    "content": "<p>It was merely seconds later three presence rushed to the opening, ready to intervene. The three Golden Core cultivators had been disguised with black cloaks, the blocking effect good enough that it would have confused me if it wasn’t for my recent upgrades in artifact forging. </p><p>With that, I was able to see their identity. Two Golden Core Elders from Kartpa Valley, and one from Dragon Peak. “Explain,” the latter one said as he floated toward the center while the other two clearly tensed, pulling back. </p><p>Their attitude showed that the disparity between Kartpa Valley and Dragon Peak continued even in further realms. </p><p>“Be ready,” I repeated once again, even as a sudden formation covered the area. At the same time, all the poison I had placed underneath the altar exploded, covering the area. It was a simple trap, but a costly one.</p><p>I idly wondered if the formation to keep them in place could have handled their coordinated attempt to break. However, as I watched the one from Dragon Peak pull his saber and attack the other two Golden Core cultivators at once, I was glad that the question was rhetorical. </p><p>The attack wasn’t enough to take down both at once but shattered the attempt of the other two to defend themselves from the poison. </p><p>“Wait,” I said to them even as I tightened my control over formation. Unlike me, the martial artists only saw a flash of light, and expected to attack.  </p><p>Their attitude toward ambush made it clear that trust was not a commodity they had in abundance, which wasn’t entirely a surprise. The two Kartpa Valley Elders reacted in a coordinated response, trying to counter the lunge from the Dragon Peak Elder. </p><p>That started a battle that left me gulping. I didn’t know if I had been underestimating the full potential of the Golden Core, or if the Demonic Cultivators were stronger than usual, but either way, I was happy with the way their distrust had forced them to fight against each other. </p><p>I couldn’t have dealt with them even with the poison, at least not without sacrificing most of the martial artists that were behind me. </p><p>The sickly green and crimson light intensified as they battled, but I noticed they were careful not to harm the altar. Unfortunately for them, it made their fate even more desperate. The battle among them didn’t look like it would take long. Merely a minute of intense battle where they relied on heavy attacks, mostly due to the restrictive environment I created for them, formation and poison restricting them effectively. </p><p>“Attack,” I ordered the hundred martial artists that were behind me as I brought the flying boat forward, covering the distance in one second. At the same time, I made a gesture, triggering every offensive trick I had buried at once. </p><p>It worked wonderfully. The elder from the Dragon Peak had the advantage during the battle, but only because he had been staying on the offensive all the time, which in turn left him unprepared for the sudden shift in the formation. </p><p>He reacted to the formation with a speed that shocked me, his power jumping another level as his eyes glowed with the same sickly green light … but it was too late. The poison had already done most of the work to weaken them, </p><p>Even as the formation bound him, a sinister smile curled his lips. “So, the rats have come out to play,” he sneered. “How quaint.”</p><p>I signaled my team to attack mercilessly while leaving the defense to me. I could have delivered the final blow, but I did not. The providence they would get from delivering the last blow was critical to the development of the Burning Ice, while I was afraid it would do the opposite for me. </p><p>The last thing I needed was to get tangled with it even more. </p><p>The demonic cultivators were not stupid, just distrustful. Our presence revealed the trap they were in, forcing them to cooperate, but it didn’t matter. The rapid attacks from a hundred Blood Essence martial artists had been enough to push them to desperation. </p><p>They turtled to a defensive stance while sending multiple messages. Those, I destroyed permanently, not even trying to decipher. I was afraid to face anyone who would come to reinforce three Golden Core cultivators. </p><p>Soon, I rushed forward, weaving between attacks like I prepared to attack. My sudden reaction left one of the Kartpa Valley cultivators overextending himself to defend, leaving him vulnerable to almost twenty attacks, each delivered with the full might. </p><p>It was enough to make him fall. As he did, I noticed the Providence flow toward the ones that delivered the last few attacks, and through them, back to the direction of the mountain. </p><p>The poison was already making their life much harder, and losing one of them didn’t help. Soon, the other two had died as well. I was tempted to attempt trying to get an insult,  but the situation was too tight. Once they died, they destroyed the altar — resulting in an even bigger flare of Providence — while I adjusted the landscape to make it look like they had fallen in each other’s hands. </p><p>Thanks to their earlier battle, it wasn’t too hard. </p><p>“Back to the ship,” I ordered as I felt a flicker at a distance, showing even more Golden Core Cultivators. </p><p>Back on the ship, everyone looked tired. I looked at Jorin, who was their leader. “Good work.” </p><p>“We … we took down Golden Core Cultivators,” she gasped in fascination. </p><p>“Yes, you did,” I said even as I started wondering whether I should bring them to the main base, so that Elsana and Lannayin could help them break through to the Spiritual Infusion realm. The mortal domain was getting more and more dangerous. </p><p>But, before I could do that, I felt a trigger at the formations protecting Markas. “You’re going to stay at the capital, hidden from the world,” I ordered even as I drove the flying boat back at full speed. “But, if you receive a signal from me, go down the stone gate, and destroy everything you see.” </p><p>It was a risky call, but even on the way, I noticed the approach of even more Golden Core Cultivators, approaching from every distance. I needed to adjust it. “No,” I said. “If I give you the signal, destroy it first, then spread and target the other capitals as well,” I said even as I gave them the full list of locations. </p><p>I had no problem believing that they would be able to do it. </p><p>Once I left them enough talismans to keep them safe, I rushed back to Markas, as I was receiving more and more warning signs. It was a good choice, as I could feel the approach of multiple Golden cultivators, only slowed down as they triggered some of the poison traps. </p><p>As I approached, I noticed something else. Every one of them wore the uniform of the Treasure Pavilion. </p><p>Interesting. It seemed that they wanted to make a point. </p><p>I rushed toward the spiritual vein, and stood in front of the tree. During my absence, the tree had grown even more, linking with all the enclaves. I first triggered the system to free it from the tendrils of Providence that were blocking its growth, then, I put my hand on its surface. </p><p>The number of Golden Core cultivators approaching made it clear that they were here to make a statement. </p><p>It looked like I was about to do one of my own, one that would hopefully convey that Markas was not for them to touch. The tree flickered with a thick essence, and several leaves flew away. It was a soft, gentle display, nothing compared to the explosion of a volcano. </p><p>But, it was still enough to wound a dozen Golden Core cultivators at once. “Who dares to disturb my land of inheritance,” I shouted, my booming voice spreading across the kingdom. </p><p>It was an exaggerated trigger, but at this point, I could only hope that it would be enough. I didn’t want too much time. The providence from killing the three Golden Core demonic cultivators had been enough to reinforce the volcano, so that it could no longer barely support only two Spiritual Infusion cultivators. All I needed was to help them level up, and that would be it. </p><p>Unfortunately, that seemed not to be the case. </p><p>They retreated, but at a great distance, the space warped, and the presence of the giant ship started to appear. I only had minutes before I needed to deal with it. </p><p>“I think that’s all I can delay not adapting to ancient martial arts,” I muttered even as I put my hand on the giant tree…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>The moon hung low in the sky, casting a pale glow over the dark forest that my team of Blood Essence martial artists rushed through, their footsteps soundless, their breaths controlled. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel impressed by the speed and elegance they moved. A part of it was their experience, as the demonic cultivator base wasn’t the first one they had been attacking. That wasn’t even the first one of the night. </p><p>While I had slipped the information about demonic cultivator infiltration to Entsa Pavilion, I didn’t rely on them to deal with the bases spread around the mortal domain. More accurately, I couldn’t. Even if it wasn’t for their clearly losing state during the battle to show that they weren’t in a position to interfere, I wouldn’t trust cultivators when it came to the security of the mortals. </p><p>Calling their perspective about mortals warped was an understatement. For a significant amount cultivators, anyone without an Immortal Root was like an animal, not worthy of notice. </p><p>Based on that, I couldn’t help but feel glad for the existence of Providence. While it had a nonsensical way of judging many situations, it at least punished the needless murder. Combined with the fact that mortals often didn’t have much to offer, it made it more sustainable for the cultivators to separate themselves rather than rule the lands directly. </p><p>That was true even for demonic cultivators. They were careful during the massacres they planned because they were afraid of the punishment of the Heavens. Every demonic cultivator I battled against had a thick cloud of Providence around them, but instead of helping them, it impeded their actions.</p><p>Of course, with the amount of negative providence around them, the minor bouts of unluckiness shouldn’t be the limit of what they had been experiencing, but luckily, I had received several methods of Demonic Cultivation to understand the mystery behind it. </p><p>A significant part of the demonic cultivation was actually aimed at reducing and tricking heavenly punishment, from bleeding it through manageable responses to accumulation and avoidance. Those abilities were as important as the sacrificial rituals they conducted to rapidly increase their cultivation. </p><p>I was certainly glad that even the demonic cultivators had their limitations when it came to targeting mortals. </p><p>“What a weird world,” I muttered even as I started building a formation around the base, one that would delay any attempt to call for reinforcements. </p><p>I chose to delay the requests rather than block them altogether. It was a trick that I used for the other bases as well. There were two reasons. First, I didn’t want to alert the enemy too much, and a good way to do that was to make the battle more balanced than it seemed. Which was why, whenever the battle ended, I made sure to adjust the landscape accordingly, making it look like the base had fallen to enemy cultivators. </p><p>More importantly, I was baiting for reinforcements, but only after the martial artists were able to retreat safely. Trying to trap the enemy was good, but not at the cost of using my growing army as a sacrifice. </p><p>“How perspective can change in a blink,” I muttered even as I continued to construct the formation to block the communication. Just months ago, all I wanted was to find a safe hideout where I could enjoy my life while gaining power, thinking that having the power of Connate Realm martial artists would be enough to ensure a good living. </p><p>And, now, I was a weird mixture of a wise wizard trying to guide heroes of the land, and a leader of a rebellion movement, my responsibilities piling up more and more. </p><p>“Enough thinking,” I muttered even as I turned my attention to the hidden enclave at the valley, carefully dismantling the traps that filled the surface. Well, not the traps themselves, but their damage-dealing aspects, so that if they triggered a trap, they would know it, and act accordingly in the future. </p><p>I couldn’t hover above them continuously to protect them. Nor it was fair for me to ask that. Ultimately, while I helped them to climb the stairs of power faster than they would be able to it didn’t change the fact that each one of them was a master in their own right, warriors who had refined their bodies and blood with the essence of martial arts. </p><p>Not only that, but the recovery of the mountain that was at the center of their martial arts sped up the recovery of their local spiritual pillar as well, which increased their power significantly. Previously, I expected them to fight against the peak of Qi Refinement at best, but now, I was confident that they would put up a good fight against the weaker Foundation Establishment forces. </p><p>With all that power, they lost the luxury of being babied, particularly since they had volunteered to fight — a fact that I repeated several times. </p><p>I turned my attention toward the target, who I felt absolutely no mercy toward despite the great mismatch. The demonic cultivators that filled the base had been preying on isolated villages, conducting dark rituals that drained the life essence from innocents to fuel their twisted pursuits. </p><p>They didn’t deserve a fair fight. </p><p>I watched as the team approached the clearing bathed in an eerie crimson light. The demonic cultivators had erected a crude altar at its center, surrounded by flickering black candles that cast long, distorted shadows. Hooded figures moved about, guarding the altar. </p><p>I decided to deal with the altar while they dealt with the rest. It looked like something tricky to be just smashed down. Instead, I sent them a signal to circle around and hit the underground fortress. </p><p>They dispersed silently, circling the clearing to slip into the underground base, I observed them through the formations. For a long while, silence ruled as they dealt with the guards with ease. Then, they moved to the rooms, silently dealing with the sleeping forces, showing no mercy. </p><p>Not after all the disasters they had seen in the other bases. Blades flashed in the flickering light of the candles, and the sickening thud of bodies hitting the ground punctuated the chants that faltered and died on the lips of our enemies.</p><p>Soon, I met with a surprise. About eight Qi Gathering cultivators, each swallowing a pill before their power spiked. I frowned as I examined the process from a distance, feeling a primal sense of discomfort. </p><p>It wasn’t the strength they displayed that scared me. Not that the spike was anything insignificant. From a raw presence, it felt almost close to peak Foundation Establishment, but I doubted it was a comprehensive improvement as the aura suggested. </p><p>There were many reasons I disdained the cultivators, but their capacity to fight was not one of them. They had the raw power, but their real might came from the intricacy of the techniques to truly deliver the attacks. </p><p>No, while the forced improvement of their power was intimidating, I trusted my team to handle the mess. What alarmed me was the sickly aura that covered them, too similar to the one I was feeling from the altar. </p><p>It indicated that the base was more important than the other satellite locations I had targeted. </p><p>But, instead of taking action, I watched as the martial artists steadily dealt with the cultivators, their sudden burst turning even more useless than I expected, as it actually caused them to lose control, allowing the martial artists to dance around their desperate attacks and work on as a team. </p><p>“Pull back to the flying ship,” I ordered when they came out of the base, victorious, but I didn’t accompany them. </p><p>Instead, I started manipulating the battlefield. I went down, using various Qi attacks to erase the signs of martial arts and replace them with cultivator activity, predominantly relying on fist art. It went smoothly, as it was not the first time I was erasing the evidence. Soon, it looked like the base had been attacked by the Kartpa Valley cultivators.  </p><p>I would have preferred to blame Dragon Peak, Kartpa Valley was the easiest for me to fake acting. And, considering I expected a secondary attack to arrive, I made sure to add those changes. </p><p>I brought the bodies of the demonic cultivators to spread them around the altar, making it look like they had died while defending it. Then, I placed a dozen different types of poison around the perimeter, all belonging to Kartpa Valley, designed to destroy cultivation while leaving the targets alive. </p><p>Only I retreated safely back to the base, I had let the messages requesting support go out. </p><p>A few seconds later, I tensed as I felt the approaching auras. Four Golden Core Cultivators. </p><p>Even with the trap, it was not a confrontation I would have wanted to take if it wasn’t for the danger presented by the Treasure Pavilion, but with the situation forced…</p><p>“Be ready for a fight,” I ordered the hundred Blood Essence Martial artists, waiting for the arrival of the reinforcements. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I arrived at the third-floor outpost, I once again planned to stay outside, ready to observe the general mood. Admittedly, with the trees planted all around the base, they no longer had to deal with the dungeon mist blocking their view, so their behavior wasn’t as unfiltered. </p><p>There still was a difference between that, and how they would act with their ‘boss’ walking among them. </p><p>However, the moment I approached the outpost enough to catch the details, that plan had changed. I got caught flat-footed by the sheer transformation. The first thing that I noticed was the scale. The outpost now spread roughly as a circle of a mile radius. Every inch had already transformed. </p><p>Admittedly, while the scale was significant, it wasn’t truly impressive. I could probably achieve that scale alone if I pushed myself. Considering there were two thousand Farmers living there, transforming less than one square mile wasn’t exactly a miracle. </p><p>But, the way they had transformed… </p><p>I had trouble convincing myself that it was still the dungeon, the hostile place that regularly spammed monsters, and not a small corner of heaven. The rough desert of the third floor had been transformed into a beautiful garden. Every inch of ground had been covered with some kind of plant, be it flowers that had colors brighter than anything I had ever seen before, sprouting from between the blades of grass that looked sculpted. </p><p>The air was crisp, tinged with a complex scent that felt heavenly compared to the dust and dry smell of the third floor, let alone the swamp of the other two floors. I took a deep breath, feeling the life of the place fill my lungs. </p><p>It was overwhelming.</p><p>The farmers, in just one day, had carved a small paradise out of the wilderness. The terraced gardens sprawled on any cliff, and under each tree, there were gardens. Most of the gardens showed flowers and other decorative items, but the occasional plots dedicated to food looked equally impressive. Wheat and barley swayed gently, taller and more golden than I’d ever seen, while rows of vegetables and herbs flourished in neat, orderly lines, enough to satisfy anyone who suffered from OCD. </p><p>The trees caught my attention the most. They were tall and mighty, which wasn’t exactly a shock. After all, it was the way I had raised them, but any tree I had grown was wild, with branches sprawling in every direction. Their trees looked gentle and orderly without losing anything of their might.</p><p>Also, they looked three times as tall as the ones I had grown. Whether it was a perk or something else, I didn’t know, but either way, it looked amazing, especially with multiple tree houses poking out of them, their roofs covered in moss and wildflowers that looked rustic yet amazing. </p><p>Yet, the most interesting detail, among everything else, was the happiness of the Farmers as they walked around, the slight stumble in some of their steps showing that they were somewhat drunk. They were clearly in a celebratory mood. </p><p>I didn’t blame them. After all, they were under explicit orders not to hunt monsters until we brought their Class skills to the limit. </p><p>Still, as I watched them, I couldn’t help but wonder how much of their relaxed attitude was about my order to Harold and the other guards to not to enter any deeper than the perimeter. Initially, it had been a way to let them relax, as I had noticed just how tense Farmers acted around the other classes. </p><p>Not that they weren’t justified in feeling that way. After three years of being dismissed and treated like dirt, I didn’t even want to imagine how bad they had been feeling. </p><p>Thinking that, I approached Harold first once he moved away from the perimeter. “Sir,” he greeted me even as he threw a hesitant glance toward the new state of the outpost. </p><p>“You look tense,” I said as I gestured for him to walk closer, not wanting to alert the rest of the camp to my presence yet. “What’s wrong?” He looked hesitant. “Are you trying to see whether I’ll blame you for the situation of the camp?” I asked. </p><p>He nodded hesitantly. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said. “There’s a reason I asked you to stay in the perimeter. I want them to feel comfortable.” </p><p>“Is this some kind of test? To see who would continue to work hard to grasp the great opportunity you’re offering.” </p><p>“Nothing so complicated. It’s just that, for the first time in a long time, they had a chance to relax while having a reason to look positively towards their future. Just let them relax for a few days.” </p><p>“If you say so, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. Just stick to the perimeter, and don’t interfere with their schedule. I have my own reasons.”</p><p>That put a smile on his face as he accepted the answer, and we started talking about other details. Signaling the existence of some kind of future conspiracy addressed his concerns better than claiming that I was treating Farmers like humans. </p><p>I wondered if it was just another part of the nebulous indoctrination, or just the base human ugliness that always wanted to elevate ourselves higher by putting others’ pure worth as a living being into a debatable concept. </p><p>On the grand scale of the new social norms, Harold’s attitude was the best I could hope for. </p><p>A sigh escaped even as I finished the discussion with Harold, and circled the enclave, getting a more detailed breakdown of their activities, immediately noticing that Harold’s comments were biased. As I got closer, I noticed a training area which I hadn’t noticed before since it was on the other side of the outpost. </p><p>It was an open-air structure, where the Farmers had been practicing with their spears. Almost three hundred of them were there, using their dummy spears to practice, half of them without a skill. </p><p>Their actions were crude and shaky, showing their limited experience wielding weapons, but the same couldn’t be said for their determination. </p><p>At the center of the formation were five Farmers I had recognized from the first batch of volunteers, doing their best to teach them Basic Stab. A good preparation for the future. </p><p>I had initially thought about staying away, but even from a distance, I couldn’t help but wince as I watched them. Their intention was good … their performance, was not so much. Repeatedly showing the same attack and asking the others to repeat was suboptimal at best. </p><p>Yet, I managed to suppress the desire to rush forward and correct them, afraid that my intervention would ruin the small yet efficient setup they had managed to put together. Even if they didn’t stop their training, their instructors would without a doubt lose their courage to take the lead. </p><p>In the long term, it would hurt more than it helped. Instead, I stayed outside the tree line, taking some mental notes about how they could teach better, my own experience with the spear helping me to put a better schedule. </p><p>And, those spear-wielders were not the only group working hard. Another, smaller group had gathered near the edge, close enough that I could listen to them. There were merely fifty of them, but they were debating intensely about how to best modify the colors of the flowers, whether it was better to make that change once the flower had grown, or if it was more appropriate to adjust its growth continuously. </p><p>“Clever,” I noted even as I listened to them, the way they had used the skill was completely novel. From the application of their skills, I could easily assess that most of them were still at the Uncommon stage, and even with the added flexibility given by the Perks, I should be easily able to copy what they had been doing. </p><p>Just like, theoretically, someone receiving Repair as an external skill would theoretically be able to copy what I could … but just like how I got familiar with my skill, they had worked on theirs. </p><p>And, now that they finally had the opportunity to advance their skill, they wanted to take advantage of it just like I did. </p><p>I continued to listen to them from a distance, glad that they didn’t keep their voices low. It was a rare thing, to see people discuss their skills openly, but I could see why they had a different outlook. Nurture was not an offensive skill, or a valued production device. Its biggest value came from unlocking a chance to upgrade their class. </p><p>It meant that, for them, trying to hide the secrets of the skill represented something far lesser than what other people experienced. Not to mention, since I was the one who ‘gifted’ the method, they probably didn’t have the sense of ownership the other people had toward their skills, making it even easier to share their information. </p><p>A smile popped onto my face as I continued to listen, but soon, I decided to multitask. The fact that they were sharing information was a good thing, but the process they used for it was horrible. </p><p>As an academician with a decade’s experience who often had to manage my own research teams, I was used to organizing such processes. Moreover, since my mathematical sociology discipline had been a relatively new area that lay in the intersection of multiple disciplines — practitioners of which disdained each other — I was used to managing all types of conflicts. </p><p>However, while designing a better debate environment was easy, actually delivering that was a harder challenge. I was afraid that, the moment I showed some interest in the topic, it would distort whatever that was developing among them naturally. </p><p>Then, my gaze fell on Terry, the same young man who had distinguished himself during the earlier experiment. Unlike the other farmers, he wasn’t intimidated by the sheer prospect of talking with me, and he looked magnetic enough to convince the others. </p><p>Maybe I should arrange a meeting with him, and see if he was willing to take a new role. </p><p>It had been a while since I had a teaching assistant. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I think I’m going to take a break,” Maria said, looking exhausted after hours of forging. </p><p>“It’s a very well-deserved rest, you were amazing,” I said. Considering she was still my boss — nominally — and someone who could evaporate me with a wave of her hand, any observer would have believed that I was doing it to get in her good graces. </p><p>It couldn’t be further from the truth. Calling the day productive would have been an understatement. With Maria helping me condense mana, I was able to establish my old production line again. My Mana Forge skill had improved by almost two hundred points, which was an incredible improvement for an Epic skill. </p><p>Alone, with my old setup, it would have taken at least a year, maybe longer. </p><p>Too bad once we passed the three hundred thresholds, the improvement slowed down once again, even with her help. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Epic) - 304 [Advanced Creative Forging, Advanced Mana Control]]</p><p>“So, what’s the situation?” she asked. </p><p>“Unfortunately, it’s as we feared,” I said. “Once we hit the barrier, the gold alloys don’t let me improve rapidly.” </p><p>“Meaning, we’ll have to get some raw platinum. I’ll do my best,” she said. </p><p>I nodded in appreciation even as I looked at the pile of gleaming weapons, mostly spearheads, though there were some swords mixed in. Technically, daggers would have been more time efficient in terms of skill improvement, but considering their relative uselessness on a battlefield, we focused on spears, with a small smattering of swords for elites with the necessary skill. </p><p>There was no harm in multitasking, and we had forged enough to supply a small army. Even without proper enchantment, they would be enough to create an elite force that could deal with a small monster horde. </p><p>My class might not have been as flashy as hers, but that didn’t mean it was useless. </p><p>”That’s an option,” I said as I looked at her, watching the way her face was showing exhaustion. The signs she was showing looked oddly familiar. It was the way I had looked when I had tried to reshape meditation. </p><p>Comparatively, using the Perk to manipulate mana, I was nowhere as exhausted. </p><p>“And, what is the other option?” she said. </p><p>“Let’s discuss it as we walk,” I said. “You have exhausted yourself, and we better rest. And, I can use the opportunity to work with the farmers again.” </p><p>“Fine,” she said as she stood up. “But, don’t deflect. I want to listen to what you have to say.” </p><p>I nodded as we started walking. “System rewards behaviors that it treats as exceptional,” I said. “For warriors, it’s killing monsters above their level, and for me, forging material that the System treats as over my level. One way to do that is to find the materials the System treats as higher level, but the other way is…” </p><p>“You want to forge something using a denser type of mana,” she said. “Aren’t you a little too ambitious,” she said. “We can’t just use my spells and hope that it works.” </p><p>“Of course not,” I said. “But, there’s nothing that stops us from theorizing a denser mana structure for Forging and copying that, right?” </p><p>“That sounds fanciful,” she said, but even with her exhaustion, I could see her eyes alight with interest. “Do you think it’s really possible?” she asked.</p><p>“If you mean whether it’s possible, I’m certain it is. Anything that skills do, it could be replicated without them, only with far more effort … or, the correct techniques. Whether only two of us could achieve it, or whether we could achieve it on a reasonable timeline is a different question. But, it’s still worth trying.” </p><p>“What if we can’t?” </p><p>“Simple,” I said. </p><p>“Really?” </p><p>“Yes. We get more people involved. No matter the problem, once enough dedicated people start working, it’ll be solved eventually.” </p><p>She paused, a pondering expression on her face. “But, how do we keep it a secret once more people get involved.” </p><p>I chuckled. “That’s the easy part. We don’t,” I answered. </p><p>She looked at me, shocked. “You, mister secrets, want to reveal it.?Then, everyone could just use the same knowledge to get stronger. Where would be your advantage?” </p><p>“Of course I want to reveal it,” I replied. “I want to keep things a secret because revealing them would get me killed. Once I’m reasonably sure that I won’t die to the blade of an assassin, that will change.” </p><p>“Reasonably sure,” she said, looking surprised. “Isn’t it a bit of a low bar when your life is concerned?” </p><p>I sighed, closing my eyes. “Maybe, but we’re living in a dangerous world already. Monsters are everywhere, people are quick to rely on violence, assassination was once again a socially acceptable dispute resolution, and dueling is acceptable for even the smallest slights. I'd rather die for a worthy cause than hide knowledge like a squirrel preparing for winter…” </p><p>“That’s…” she started, only to pause. “You really believe it.” </p><p>“Of course. I had never been a big believer in the philosophy of enlightenment, that civilization is something that always progressed toward a greater form, but if there was one thing I loved about it, the information was shared freely. Inefficiently, maybe, with many pointless steps in between to calculate the credit and rewards, but it was still shared freely.” </p><p>“And, you think it’ll make that much of a difference?” </p><p>“Of course. The last two centuries of human development skyrocketed because we can share information with ease, and more accurately. Now that every one of us has superpowers, it’s absurd that we can’t repeat it.” </p><p>She paused, her eyes tightening. “You are keeping something secret,” she said, her tone harsh. </p><p>I raised my hands in mock surrender. “I’m not keeping it a secret, but I didn’t want to share it before I gathered some data to give it some validity. I’m not even sure about the source. I can tell you, but I have one condition.” </p><p>“What is it?” </p><p>“You are going to listen to me without interruption. Questions to clarify are right, but I don’t want to turn it into a debate. At least, not when I’m explaining it for the first time.” </p><p>“Fine, I promise,” she said. </p><p>“Have you ever thought about how our culture has changed since the Cataclysm? Suddenly, we have collapsed into a feudal state, with every value we had accepted disappearing,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, but isn’t it natural? The world changed completely. Technology has disappeared, many people died, and the government is gone. We still don’t know if any of the major cities are intact. Such a radical change, isn’t it normal for the people to embrace a new direction.” </p><p>“Yes and no,” I answered. </p><p>“Very clear, professor, thank you very much,” she said. </p><p>“No sarcasm in the classroom,” I declared, which earned a chuckle. “I’m trying to say that while a significant cultural drift is to be expected, there are two problems. The speed, and the direction.” </p><p>“I’m guessing there’s a lecture incoming,” she said as she shuffled, leaning forward. </p><p>“A summary, at least. Just enough to convince you that I know what I’m talking about. Cultural change, particularly relating to the aspects relating to power, might be one of the most studied phenomena in history, centuries before sociology had even been studied as a distinct scientific discipline. Countries like Rome had mastered the art of integrating the cultures of others into their own, while philosophers ranging from Plato to Confucius, Ibn Haldun to Hobbes studied the topic to understand the theoretical and ethical basis. And, from their hands, we have surprisingly well-preserved historical records. Similarly, we have countless modern studies on the topic, ranging from banal, small-scale topics like company cultural transformations, to modern immigration.” </p><p>“And,” she said, looking confused.</p><p>What followed was a compressed history of cultural transformation across the ages, going in-depth about the various aspects driving such transformations. </p><p>“If there was one thing that was common across all those topics, it was that culture, particularly when it came to adults, is one of the hardest things to change,” I concluded. “The adaptation happens slowly, with significant friction, people clinging to the older traditions even tighter and turning into extremists just to maintain their identity…”</p><p>“Doesn’t Charisma explain that?” she interrupted, confident. I wanted to remind her about her promise, but since I had seen her holding back during my lecture several times, I decided to give her a chance to address her concerns. “It’s well-known to have long-term effects.” </p><p>“Is it why using it on someone grounds for a duel,” I asked, to which she responded with a nod. I continued “The problem is twofold. First, I had spent more than a year trying to understand how the world has been changing, as a kind of pre-research </p><p>“To a degree, it explains the speed,” I said. </p><p>“To a degree?” she asked. </p><p>“Do you remember me mentioning I had been collecting some observational data before a dungeon nearby started to drop Repair spells and ruined my business?” I asked. She nodded. “I seem to remember that there was some data supporting the other direction, but it has been a while, and I don’t remember the results well enough,” I said. “But, even in the enclaves without people with Charisma, we saw a similar pattern.” </p><p>“Maybe they just stayed hidden,” she said. </p><p>“That’s certainly a possibility,” I admitted. “It’s one of the challenges of trying to make conclusions relying on self-reporting. There’s always the risk of lying, especially on sensitive topics. But, even if that’s the case, it doesn’t explain the direction. We suddenly have people in an apocalyptic situation, without contact, and with superpowers that include brainwashing. The world should have been in chaos, with crazy cults and weird religions popping out of every corner. Yet, we have a society that has pretty much homogeneously transformed to a new direction.” </p><p>“And, you think that’s unlikely? Why?” she said, but she was more curious than confrontational. </p><p>“Part of it is historical observation. When the opportunity presents itself, there are always ambitious people wanting to leave their mark, and once they succeed, they tend to be … creative. In this case, however, it happens the same way in hundreds of enclaves similar enough to be carbon copies. This level of convergence doesn’t make mathematical sense. It’s improbable.” </p><p>“Not exactly a convincing argument, right,” she said. “Improbable doesn’t mean impossible. Look at the world we live in.” </p><p>“It’s different,” I said. “Imagine rolling a dice a hundred times. If all hundred rolls showed the same number, would you just shrug and assume that you’re lucky, or suspect that you’re playing with the loaded dice.” </p><p>Her eyes widened. “Do you suspect that we’re playing with a loaded dice?” </p><p>I snorted. “Suspect is a major understatement. The more I dig, the more convinced I get. The real challenge is to understand where it’s coming from. It even makes mathematical sense. Let me model the situation for you. We have ten different groups, with an equilibrium model…” </p><p>She stayed silent, no doubt struggling to accept the conclusion. I had a feeling that, if it wasn’t for my recent string of successes, she wouldn’t have entertained it. </p><p>It reminded me of the story of Linus Pauling. He was one of the most authoritative people in the field of science as the only person in history who had received two unshared Nobel awards, turning him into an authority … but, as he got older, he used that authority to support several unsubstantiated claims, which then turned into common public misunderstandings, including Vitamin C being some kind of super cure. </p><p>“You gave me a lot to think about,” she said once we arrived at the first floor, looking at the keep at the main dungeon entrance. “Are you sure you don’t want to rest?” </p><p>“We still have too much to do,” I said and turned back, ready to have another meeting with the Farmers. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, how much of the instructions you gave to Eleanor were actually necessary?” Maria asked once Eleanor left. </p><p>“Oh, all of it,” I said. </p><p>“Really? All twenty pages of it? And, your handwriting is so tiny…” </p><p>I shrugged. “As I was explaining before Eleanor’s success interrupted us, it’s too easy to introduce bias to experiments. If I wasn’t going to run that experiment again later, I wouldn’t have let her run it. Her attitude alone might ruin the experiment.” </p><p>She didn’t look convinced. “If you say so,” she still agreed as she crossed her arms. “But, for the moment, should we go to the fourth floor?” </p><p>I paused for a moment, considering the merits of setting a fully-fledged base here, but decided against it. The first floor didn’t have enough monsters to keep us supplied with mana, considering the scale I planned to work at. “Sure, let’s go,” I said. </p><p>Security was a concern, but not a big one. All I needed was to check the second floor once every half an hour. Without the mist to block my gaze, keeping the dungeon safe was considerably easier. There would be no ambushes prepared that could avoid my notice. </p><p>As we moved down, we discussed upcoming technical challenges, and how we could improve our coordination even further. “Too bad we can’t sell what we craft without creating a commotion,” Maria admitted with a sigh. “I might try to reach my contacts, but most of those contacts I acquired through my family and…” </p><p>“You don’t know which ones you can trust, and which ones will immediately inform Thomas,” I said. “Understandable.” </p><p>“It’s not that I’m afraid of that little snot,” Maria said. “But, his external support scares me.” </p><p>“I’m guessing you’re referring to those men that had transformed into monsters,” I said. </p><p>“Exactly. I have never heard of something like that before. He always had shady friends, but something like that… no, it’s above his grade.” </p><p>I just nodded. Ultimately, I knew too little about her family situation and the rest of the world to even help her brainstorm, let alone actually help her come to a useful conclusion. “Let’s not waste our time theorizing about a motive,” I said. “We just need to focus on how to get stronger. So long as we can do that in secret, we can shatter their plans.” </p><p>Maria nodded. “Yeah. Even if we can’t figure out a way to give Eleanor Essence, having better weapons would multiply her combat efficiency.” </p><p>“In the worst case, we can help get her a Legendary skill,” I added. </p><p>“As far as consolation prizes go, that’s a good one,” she agreed. “Finding a Legendary skill that fits her style is already enough of a challenge. Then, there’s the Stat requirements to absorb those skills…” </p><p>“Exactly,” I said. “Still, we need to figure out the best way to help her. We’re still poking around blindly, and developing a proper theory would take a significant time.” </p><p>“Too bad we don’t have too much time,” Maria said. “If it wasn’t for his last trick, I would have assumed that Thomas was at his limit and would be leaving us alone, but that’s clearly not the case. Those men that were somehow able to absorb the dungeon miasma is not something our family knows of.” </p><p>“You suspect external support.” </p><p>“Yes,” she said, but I could see her hesitancy. She clearly didn’t want to vocalize her other suspicion, which was that his supporters were a part of the Griffin family. I let that slide. As long as she was aware of the possibility, there was no point talking about it. “I’m afraid that he’ll come up with something even more devastating next. We probably have at most a month before we start selling the shells, and it’ll make whoever this mysterious supporter will push him to attack again.” </p><p>“True,” I said even as I took a step to the side, dodging another monster as we moved deeper into the dungeon. “But, a month should be enough to qualitatively improve our power, enough to deal with whatever nasty surprise he has.” </p><p>“You think so?” she said. </p><p>“Yes. With the dungeon tamed, we can operate all three floors with ease, and even systematically exploiting the fourth floor is sustainable, meaning we could improve all two thousand to above level twenty-five with upgraded classes, with all of them armed with at least an Uncommon skill, each armed with the gear I made for them.” </p><p>She paused for a second, no doubt running the calculations far more accurately than the rough calculation I had done. “Unless we have to collect Rare Nurture as skill stones,” she said. </p><p>“Yeah, that assumes a significant portion will be able to improve naturally,” I replied. </p><p>“What if none of them can?” she countered. </p><p>“Then, we’ll have less of them. Maybe five hundred?” I said. She nodded, showing that the number made sense. “It’ll be worse, particularly if their next attack is against the town.” </p><p>She paused. “I wanted to say that even he isn’t that much of a madman, but…” she said, her voice fading. “I wouldn’t put it past him to deliberately trigger a monster horde against us.” </p><p>“Is it difficult?” </p><p>“Against a proper town, it’s very difficult. Collecting and directing enough monsters to overwhelm the defenses is enough of a challenge, especially since the other towns would send out their elites to deal with it, to prevent their town from being the next one.” </p><p>“And, since we’re so far away from the other towns, no one has to support us to keep themselves safe.” </p><p>“Exactly,” she said. “There’s a reason we were able to take over this dungeon on the cheap,” she said. I didn’t ask her what she meant by cheap, as I had a feeling the number would have scared me. After all, there was a difference between a cheap dinner and a cheap yacht. I didn’t want to distract myself with a pointless tangent. </p><p>“How long in advance do you think we would get warned against a monster horde?” I asked. </p><p>“Two weeks at a minimum,” she said. “We have daily patrols in the sky, and even the smallest monster wave is not stealthy. We would catch them easily.” </p><p>“I see,” I muttered, then I paused, wondering just how easily I could help people level up. “How far away is the nearest location with environmental mana?” I asked. </p><p>“If we’re willing to brave through some dangerous locations, four hours at this pace,” she said. </p><p>I nodded. This meant that, as long as we traveled light, an overnight trip should be enough to help the farmers level up. And, with a two-week notice, we should be able to level all of them up as long as I armed them properly and brought them to the fifth floor. </p><p>Not exactly an ideal option, as the moment we showed our advanced weaponry, the secret would be out. I wasn’t naive enough to think that I could convince two thousand people to keep it a secret, and the moment they realized we could access the fifth floor, they should realize we had killed multiple dungeon bosses. </p><p>The vision advantage was good, but it was hardly a decisive advantage it had proven to be so far if the enemy prepared for it. </p><p>“The ability to rapidly help them acquire better classes means that we should be able to raise enough forces to deal with any monster waves,” I said. </p><p>“At least, the ordinary ones,” she said. “It would be harder to deal with the giant ones,” she said. I curled an eyebrow. “You can think of them as the equivalent to a dungeon boss. Large, stronger, often with some kind of dangerous ability,” she said. “The lack of environmental mana means that they won’t be as dangerous as they could be, but still, they might be problematic, especially if they came with abilities that can counter me.” </p><p>If it wasn’t for her performance against the dungeon boss, I might have assumed that she was exaggerating a bit. With that, even her offhanded mention took precedence. “Do you think that’s likely?” I said. </p><p>“In a natural monster horde that would approach our town, next to impossible,” she said. “There’s no location with enough mana to actually support that kind of a monster, so it requires a lucky dungeon break. But, if it’s an artificial one … it feels almost inevitable.” </p><p>”And, how would it counter you? Some kind of magic resistance, enhanced mobility, invisibility.” </p><p>She sighed, forlorn. It was the first time I saw her in such a deep loss. “Frankly, all of them are possible. Maybe I made a mistake trying to force the issue of breaking through the level hundred barrier. Maybe we should stop this venture before it’s too late.”</p><p>A part of me was tempted to encourage her to do that. Unfortunately, I genuinely didn’t think that it was the best path. Not for her, not for myself. Not even for the thousands of farmers who chose to risk their lives to join a new town.  </p><p>“Don’t worry. Two weeks is more than plenty to develop a special counter. If we can help Eleanor figure out how to use mana, her lethality would multiply significantly. Together, we should be able to deal with any beast that relies on invisibility or mobility.” </p><p>“What if it has other abilities,” she said. </p><p>“Then, we can find a different solution. Like siege weapons.” </p><p>“We can’t purchase more, at least not the kind that could help against the kinds of beasts we’d need help dealing with,” she said. “They are good against the weaker mobs, but against stronger monsters, they quickly turn useless.” </p><p>I thought about offering to start coming up with better variants, but after some thought, I decided against it. Finding the secret behind the natural skill upgrades, improving my class skills, figuring out the principles behind the mana attacks, developing a better system of mass production, designing better defenses for the town … </p><p>No, my list of activities was already too crowded. But, it might change if I could reach Legendary Forging. </p><p>Hopefully. </p><p>The rest of the journey had been filled with various topics of strategic significance, where we did our best to discuss the processes necessary for the next steps. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You were gone for a long time,” Maria said once I climbed up the hill with a few jumps. Eleanor was there as well, but she didn’t interrupt her task, her blade dancing between different forms, deaf to the world. “And, what’s in that huge bag?” </p><p>“There was a small development. Not all Farmers were able to upgrade their skills naturally,” I explained even as I put the bag down.</p><p>“How many of them?” she asked. </p><p>“About ten percent,” I said. </p><p>“Good,” Maria shrugged. “Then, they can stay there and deal with the logistics or something. We don’t need to replace them,” she said. </p><p>I paused. “Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Because they can’t upgrade their classes,” Maria said. “But, with all the secrecy you insist, we can’t do that. They have to stay there for the whole six months. We can’t afford to have a second location.” I continued to look at her, unable to contain my shock. “Did I say something wrong?” </p><p>“I mean, why would I want to replace them,” I said. “It’s an opportunity.” </p><p>Maria looked at me in confusion. “I don’t understand.” </p><p>“Did you know that some people couldn’t naturally upgrade their skills even if they hit the limit?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, no,” she said. “But, it wasn’t exactly something I explored. Getting the skill stones is almost always the better option,” she said. </p><p>“Assuming you can purchase the exact skill you want, of course,” I completed. </p><p> “Naturally,” she said, tensing slightly. </p><p>“It’s not a personal attack,” I said. “Believe me, I much rather get the best option rather than accidentally killing myself experimenting.” </p><p>“Fine, let’s focus on why it’s an opportunity,” Maria said. “It’s probably just their perks or something.” </p><p>“That’s the interesting part, it’s not,” I said. “I have already checked the most obvious suspects. It’s not the level or the perks,” I said even as I opened the bag, showing the pile of paper inside. </p><p>“You can’t expect me to read all of it,” she said. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said, affronted, pulling a small booklet. Like I would never try to do a presentation without a handy little summary. Having two thousand people that I could order around made tabulating the data much easier, especially since I didn’t need to deal with the guard schedule, thanks to the trees being enough to keep them safe. </p><p>Naturally, I asked them not to pass level twenty-five, as the higher their Nurture, the better their new class would be. There was no punishment for refusing to listen, as all of them were adults. If they wanted to waste the potential opportunity in front of them, I couldn’t do anything. </p><p>The presentation included all the data I was able to collect. “As you can see, there’s no meaningful correlation between their levels, perks, or core demographic data.” </p><p>Maria looked confused as I showed all the ways it was unrelated. “And, is that … good? Why are you so excited about being unable to find the result?” </p><p>“Of course I am. It means there’s another variable that affects everything,” I said, then paused. “Well, either that, or I have committed some kind of systematic error somewhere in the process, resulting in useless data.” </p><p>“Is that likely?” she said. “It sounds obvious.” </p><p>“It’s far more common than you can imagine, especially when dealing with people,” I admitted. “For example, about the experiments about learning patterns —” I started, ready to share some interesting anecdotes, only to be interrupted by a cheerful cry from Eleanor. </p><p>“Yes!” she shouted. </p><p>Once I turned toward her, the source of her excitement was obvious. A sharp edge of mana, was noticeably under control as it extended from her blade, absorbing it from the steady flow of the crusher.  </p><p>“Congratulations,” Maria shouted even as she moved to hug her. I chuckled as I watched them from a distance, happy with the success. </p><p>Eleanor looked at me. “What are you doing there, come here,” she ordered. </p><p>“Thanks. It won’t be comfortable when I’m dressed like this,” I said as I knocked on my armor. </p><p>“Nonsense,” she said as she moved to my side with one step, Maria still hugging her. She pulled me into the hug, which was one of the most uncomfortable moments of my life, for the simple reason that all three of us were wearing armor. The sound we made was not too dissimilar to a car crash. </p><p>They didn’t seem to care. “So, did you receive A new skill?” Maria asked enthusiastically once we were separated. </p><p>“Well, no,” Eleanor said. “But, since I achieved a mana attack, I can’t be too far off, right?” she said even as she moved in front of the crusher, and repeated. </p><p>I strongly doubted that was the case. I had three examples for that skill upgrade. Two of them happened on the first attempt, but my third one, Cleansing Meditation, only happened once I had pushed it to the limit. </p><p>Still, I said nothing as I watched Eleanor repeat her attack, her cheerful mode slowly dissipating into panic. “Why — is — it — not — working,” she growled. </p><p>“Let’s take a breather,” I called, stopping her. </p><p>“Is something wrong?” Maria asked as she looked at me, and Eleanor wasn’t too far away. </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I said, gesturing for Eleanor to sit down. She looked frustrated, but under my sharp gaze, she followed my invitation. Maria did that as well. “Now, before we start talking, I want you to remind both that Eleanor has just achieved a mana attack, and that’s a great win.” </p><p>“Using a specialized weapon that would shatter against any half-decent opponent, and with a giant machine behind my back,” Eleanor replied. “Hardly a useful trick.” </p><p>“I disagree, but let’s not focus on that for now. I just wanted to remind you that, we’ve been working for merely a day, and we’re already seeing results. Under any sane metric, that’s an incredible achievement.” </p><p>“I guess,” Eleanor muttered, while Maria nodded at me in gratitude. </p><p>“Now, let’s discuss why there’s no upgrade in your skill,” I said. “The worst case is that it’s a method that only works on Common skills, or using a skill stone somehow invalidates that path.” </p><p>Eleanor looked tense at the possibility, but Maria spoke first. “Do you think that’s possible?” she said. </p><p>“Possible? Yes. Likely? No,” I said. Admittedly, I wasn’t exactly confident in that conclusion, but I didn’t want to demoralize Eleanor any more than necessary. “That’s just the worst-case scenario, and I wanted to mention it.” </p><p>“What else?” </p><p>“What you have used is the simplest form of a Mana attack, with a density similar to my Rare Mana Forge. Every different skill has a distinct way of using Mana and Health with every upgrade after Rare. There’s a chance that we have to copy the Epic or the Legendary variant of a mana attack to trigger the skill.” </p><p>“That sounds complicated,” she said. </p><p>“It’s not simple, particularly since we don’t have a sample for it. But I’m sure we can figure out a way around it if things come down to that.” </p><p>“It means you have another idea,” Maria said. </p><p>“Yes. My own experience mainly relies on how I managed to improve Mana Forge. At that time, not only was my skill Common, but it was also still below twenty-five. And, even when I had upgraded to Rare, successfully creating a mana alloy gave me several points of skills.” </p><p>“Meaning, the Common variant counted that as an even bigger achievement,” Maria completed, understanding what I was getting at. Eleanor looked at her, looking confused. “He’s saying that, there’s a chance for an upgrade if you manage to get several points in one attack.” </p><p>“So I have to use it in combat,” Eleanor said, her forlorn expression immediately replaced by a vicious smile at the possibility of solving the problem in a way she favored. She stood up, ready to jump.</p><p>“Wait a second,” I said, stopping her again. </p><p>“What?” </p><p>“We still have things to discuss,” I said. She looked at me, impatient. “What if attacking the boss monster is not enough to solve the problem, and increasing your skill further only makes it harder,” I suggested. </p><p>That probability was enough to make Eleanor sit down, but I could see that it was a close call. Without the credibility I had built up on her, it might have easily gone in a different direction. </p><p>Though, it wasn’t enough to stop her from pouting. </p><p>“What are we going to do?” Maria asked. </p><p>“We have three paths, which could be run in parallel. First, we’re going to work together and see if we can design an Epic Grade mana attack,” I said. </p><p>“Do you think we can do it?” Maria said. </p><p>“Yes, especially since the System is not really stringent when it comes to measuring success,” I said. “Half of the alloys I created while I was speed-leveling my skills weren't fit to be used even as a butter knife. But, since they were made of a metal the System treated them as a higher level, it still gave me points.” </p><p>“Really,” Maria said. “That easy?” </p><p>“Is it any easier than killing monsters that others have wounded,” I said. “Every class has its advantages,” </p><p>“Fair,” Eleanor cut in. “What’s the other method?” </p><p>“We’re going to try to understand the factors behind the skill upgrade,” I said. “If we can isolate the critical variable behind it, maybe we can focus on that aspect.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” Maria said. “What’s the third method?” </p><p>“Before suggesting it, I want you to remember you can easily veto it, and I won’t be offended, alright.” </p><p>Maria looked at me, suddenly tense. “It better not be…” she growled. </p><p>I had no idea what she was thinking, but I decided to go fast just in case. “Improving my Forge skill is another option,” I explained hurriedly. “That way, not only will we see if skills could be upgraded above Epic, but if I can reach Legendary, I can forge even better weapons, which should be helpful for better attacks.” </p><p>“That’s it?” Maria said, her growing fury replaced with a smile. “It makes perfect sense. Why did you look so tense?” </p><p>“Because it kind of benefits me too much, and I don’t want to come across like I’m trying to benefit from the situation,” I said. Also, it was my guilty conscience speaking about my previous actions, but I kept that part silent.</p><p>No need to go poking around healing wounds. </p><p>“Don’t think about it like that. The stronger you are, the better,” Eleanor said, giving her entirely unbiased opinion, even as she caressed the hilt of her new sword. </p><p>Maria noticed that as well if her chuckle was any indicator, but she let that slide. “Exactly,” she said instead, then looked at Eleanor. “Of course, it means you have to go around helping the farmers upgrade their skills and collect their data while we work,” she said. </p><p>“I can do that,” Eleanor said. </p><p>“Of course you can. You just need to be careful of a few principles while you help them and record the results,” I said. “Let me write that down.” </p><p>“Sure,” Eleanor said, smiling, but as I quickly filled one paper and moved on to the second one, that smile trembled a bit. It turned into a neutral expression as I filled the second paper, and a frown replaced it as I was filling the fifth. “Is it too late to change my mind?” she asked, exasperated. </p><p>I just chuckled, but continued writing. </p><p>After all, a solid experimentation protocol was important. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Fifteen minutes later, the whole vibe had changed by the courtesy of two layers of trees I had grown, finally allowing the gathered two thousand people to see each other. </p><p>“You all gathered to address the call for a mission, one to keep our world a safer place, so that one day, our children don’t have to live in fear of monsters. I applaud your bravery!” I declared loudly, enough for the crowd to hear it. </p><p>The crowd shuffled, surprised by my declaration. “I have fought against untold dangers since that fateful day three years ago, and if there’s one thing I have learned, bravery doesn’t come from fancy Classes or impressive skills. There’s no Stat called Bravery or Courage. No, it comes from the people that dare to embrace the danger, regardless of their disadvantages, braving the unknown so that one day they can be strong enough to stem the tide. Here, I’m looking for two thousand such people!” </p><p>They watched me, some with doubt, others with a flicker of hope. I could see the shift in their eyes. It wasn’t my trite speech that was making the difference, but the display of respect from someone that they thought to be strong enough that they could never reach. </p><p>In a way, it wasn’t too different from receiving a compliment. It might be the lamest, the cheesiest compliments one could imagine, but if it came from a celebrity, it would still be enough to turn into a story they would tell to their children. </p><p>In a way, it was what was happening here. I was no different than a celebrity in their eyes, especially with all the gossip going on around me. I decided to reinforce it a little more. I drew my sword, and waved once, a mana blade rushing toward the tree line to cut down an insect. </p><p>The whispers of awe filled the opening, which even included the guards. My discussions with Eleanor had informed me of just how rare the existence of a magical warrior was, and since they would be staying here for the next six months, separated from the rest of the world, revealing that ability was a better idea than hiding it. </p><p>“People say that, since you’re Farmers, you don’t matter. That you’re only good for growing food. I say that’s wrong. You’ve faced bad seasons, monsters, bandits, and many bullies who wanted to squash you just because they were lucky enough to get a better class!” I continued, my gaze sweeping across the crowd. “I say no more! Here, I promise to help every single one of you to advance your classes!” </p><p>I paused, letting the words settle. “Harold, come here and explain to them how to improve their class,” I said as I stepped down from the rocks. </p><p>I could have done so, but I wanted to keep my speech short and impactful, while leaving the practical details to Harold. </p><p>As Harold started explaining it, I used the nearby gate to the fourth floor. After cutting down the monsters that had surrounded the gate, I rapidly grew ten lines of trees with ease. </p><p>I returned to the third floor with a cart filled with iron barrels, each filled with swamp water. I didn’t set a condenser, as the first stage of the process required diluted water from the fourth floor. Only when their skill reached Rare, would they require the help of the condenser. </p><p>When I returned, I gestured at two guards to take over the pulling of the cart, and two others rushed to dilute the water based on the previous requests. It was good to have competent assistance dealing with the minutiae of the activities. </p><p>With them accompanying me, we walked toward the center of the formation. Harold had not only finished his explanation, but also gathered the twenty volunteers that were closest to reaching level twenty-five. </p><p>“Let me show you how to improve your Nurture skill quickly,” I said even as I placed a small sapling on the ground, putting one drop of diluted swamp water underneath, following it with a blast. “As simple as this,” I said. “Try it,” I said even as I pointed at the next one. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” the first one said, and replicated my trick … poorly, pushing with his Health long after the little drop of water had been drained, which only wasted his Health. </p><p>“With shorter bursts,” I reminded him. “Did you deplete your Health?” </p><p>“I’m sorry sir. It won’t happen again,” he said, panicked. “I just wanted to show —” </p><p>I waved my hand, cutting his words. “Look, just eat something, and go back to the end of the line. Mistakes happen,” I consoled him. “There’s no harm. It’ll take a while to get it. Just remember to keep the skill usage to short, intense bursts. That’s how you’ll get the best result.” </p><p>“I won’t disappoint you, sir,” he said as he moved back, looking enthusiastic. </p><p>“What’s his name,” I whispered to Harold. </p><p>“Terry. He’s a good kid. Smart and ambitious, but with a good head. He’s a bit too enthusiastic though.” </p><p>“It’s a good combination for the youth,” I whispered, then gestured for the next one to walk closer. Even as they rotated, I continued to explain to them how to best use their Health to maximize the skill point gain, which was clearly not something they had prioritized before. </p><p>It was not a surprise. Production class skills improved rapidly as long as the appropriate materials existed. All the tricks I had applied just made the process faster. </p><p>Merely ten minutes later, every single one of the first twenty had their Uncommon skills, celebrating while the rest watched in fascination. “Should we start working on leveling, sir,” Terry asked, who seemed to be a natural leader in the group. </p><p>“Really, is that the extent of your ambition? Only Uncommon skills? How about Rare? Epic?” </p><p>“W-we can?” he gasped. </p><p>“Of course,” I said. “But, not for free.” His expression steeled, expecting me to ask for something truly extreme. ‘Help me organize the rest, and teach them,” I said. </p><p>“That’s it?” he said, looking shocked. </p><p>“Yes, that’s it,” I said, amused by his shock before he bounced to his mission with great enthusiasm. “Don’t forget to make everyone fill out their surveys before and after,” I said. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel amused. I had tried to collect information about the System before, but even when I bribed my subjects with most of my available fortune at that time, their reluctance had been clear. A great contrast to the current situation. </p><p>I didn’t remember anyone following my teachings with such enthusiasm even before the Cataclysm, when I was a professor, despite my globally renowned credentials. </p><p>And, now, a couple layers of obfuscation and a display that I could have easily faked worked wonders. </p><p>Entertaining indeed. </p><p>But soon, I noticed some kind of argument toward the edge of the crowd. I walked toward it. “You must have been doing it wrong. Do it again!” one of the trainers growled, while another one infused the sapling with his Health, his fingers trembling. </p><p>I approached slowly, trying to understand what’s going on. </p><p>“Again,” the trainer ordered, looking tense, but not as much as the student, whose fingers were trembling even worse. </p><p>“What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“S-sir, nothing,” the student gasped. “Please don’t send me away.” </p><p>“I’m not going to send anyone away,” I promised. “Now, tell me.” </p><p>“I … I don’t know. No matter what I do, my skill is stuck at ninety-nine, and it’s not improving.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said. “Is there anyone that’s stuck at ninety-nine, unable to improve,” I asked, my voice booming. A sudden silence filled the area. “Don’t worry, I won’t kick any of you out. I swear on my honor!” </p><p>I had no problem giving that promise. Why would I, when they represented not a burden but an opportunity. Something unknown, one that I could use as leverage to expand my understanding even if just by a bit. </p><p>Even with all the credibility I had built, it took a while for them to start believing me, and I had to add a warning about punishment if they hid information. Ultimately, the crowd had split, and I noticed only two hundred out of two thousand had been unable to upgrade their skills naturally. </p><p>“W-what are we going to do, sir?” one of them asked. </p><p>“A torture awaits you —” I said, a habitual joke about paperwork leaving my lips before I realized the abject terror on their faces. “A joke about doing a lot of paperwork,” I corrected rapidly, realizing that jokes that were appropriate in an office environment might not be becoming of a guild master.</p><p>I threw a Rare Nurture skill stone to the leading tone that spoke. “See if you can absorb it,” I said. </p><p>“I can, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Do it,” I said, and he did so, which had been enough to dissipate the fear of the situation. “Now, as you can see, eventually, every single one of you will receive a Rare Nurture, no matter what, so you don’t need to feel stressed. But, before that, I want every single one of you to fill in even more paperwork,” I said. </p><p>Then, I turned toward the others, who had progressed their skills successfully. “Every single one of you!” I repeated. </p><p>After all, I needed data from both sides to identify the variable causing the difference. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s call it a day,” I said as I finished forging another piece, this time a large cuirass to complete the armor I had prepared for Eleanor, completing the set. Maria was wearing one of her own under her robe, a thin chainmail that could resist not only physical, but also magical attacks — as tested by Maria herself.</p><p>[Mana Forge (Epic) 128 -&gt; 130]</p><p>“Really, that early,” Maria said, looking disappointed. “We were just getting a hang of it.”</p><p>“Believe me, I want to stop even less than you do,” I said. “Your help is truly invaluable.”</p><p>“And, don’t you forget it,” she said. Then, she sighed. “But, you’re right. Eleanor must have finished with the town, and we shouldn’t keep her waiting.”</p><p>I nodded, wondering who would be more enthusiastic about the success of the experiment: Eleanor or I. For her, it represented significantly more power, a perfectly understandable desire considering the nature of the world we lived in, where power meant security, riches, and social credit, all at once.</p><p>But, for me, it represented validation for my approach, showing that I didn’t need to rely solely on blind attempts, hoping to get lucky. That my method was not just a line of coincidences, but actually had value.</p><p>I wasn’t under any illusion that I had unraveled the secrets of the mana. Not even close. If mana was electricity, a concept capable of supporting the modern world, I was a kid who was stabbing a lemon with random pieces of metal, trying to get a reaction, trying to make sense of the occasional tingling sensation. What I achieved was nothing compared to the potential of mana. It was a deep ocean, and even the surface would have taken a lifetime to explore.</p><p>While I still hoped to get Intelligence during my next class promotion, I didn’t believe that I could do it alone. Human progress was not something that was built on the backs of one person’s genius, no matter how appealing the idea was.</p><p>Though, I had to admit, my most recent chain of successes was enough to make me forget it momentarily. With the System helping me to connect the dots and work out the more complicated aspects, it was easy to forget.</p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t alone anymore, I thought even as I looked at Maria, who had been happily examining the dagger I had forged for her, a dagger whose mana had been provided by her, far more efficiently than anything I could have achieved.</p><p>After all, the biggest burst of mana I could create was limited by my own Mana Pool, and then I had to stop, meditate to refill it, then restart. And, such a slowing down was no different than traveling with a car, only to slam the brakes every few seconds. Doing that didn’t just reduce the average speed to fifty from a hundred, but to a few miles.</p><p>Her continuous mana output meant that I could finish something in minutes rather than hours … and that was with us nowhere near peak efficiency, giving me the method to push to the peak of an Epic Skill, or maybe even higher.</p><p>Only possible thanks to my new mathematical notation. Without it to communicate, I didn’t want to imagine just how long it would have taken to explain to Maria the exact shape of mana I had required. The method was nowhere near enough to truly replicate what I was generating, but if there was one thing my skills were perfect for, it was fixing thousands of small mistakes.</p><p>“Isn’t it hard to move?” She mentioned once I piled everything into one of the railroad carts I had prepared, and added four wagons behind, each piled with armor and spears — which I was able to forge more than the necessary number in the process.</p><p>”Not really,” I said. “The rails buried under the mud help a lot. I just need to slide it back whenever it slips. You can ride on it if you want?” I invited them with a smile.</p><p>“No thanks. One ride was more than enough,” she answered as she floated next to me, wasting her mana in the process. But, with the threat of the dungeon decreased to virtually zero after cleaning the fourth floor, again and again, it didn’t really matter.</p><p>Once we arrived at the fourth floor, I unlatched the wagons from the steam engine, and started to drag them with my own power. “Is this really necessary,” she asked.</p><p>“It’s easier than bringing the engine back,” I said even as I started pulling it away.</p><p>“Where are you doing? I thought you were going to set the new base up at the dungeon gate.”</p><p>“Yes, but not this one,” I said as I started pulling one to the opposite side. “This gate is the closest one to my private base. I don’t want to make it easy for others to stumble upon it.“</p><p>Then, I looked at the horizon, where a crowd was already waiting for me, one that I could only see thanks to my vision, which had expanded once more. Dungeon mist was no longer an impediment on the fourth floor either — though the ordinary swamp miasma was more than enough to block my view instead — and the third floor was perfectly clear.</p><p>“Actually, Harold is already there with the volunteers,” I said. “Which one would you prefer, joining me while I deliver the explanation, or going upstairs and start working with Eleanor.”</p><p>“I have had enough of dealing with everyone in the town, you can deal with your own guild,” she replied as she floated once again. “See you on the first floor.” Then, before she got too far, she turned to me. “And, make sure everyone actually volunteered, or we’ll have a problem.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. I understood her disdain for dealing with people perfectly. Spending my time leading people was not exactly what I wanted either. As for her warning about making sure people were volunteers, I wouldn’t have cared about it in the slightest if I hadn’t had the same intention.</p><p>Yes, she wanted to help them, but it was more of a general sentiment than a dedicated effort, more similar to a mayor who was visiting the soup kitchen to serve food once a month. It showed caring … but it was neither her best effort, nor was it the most efficient application of her time.</p><p>I didn’t really begrudge her for it, and not just because of our growing closeness. At least, it was better than what a lot of people were doing.</p><p>As I approached closer to the gathered crowd — almost two thousand people, more than I had expected — I slowed down, carefully watching the general attitude of the people, once again using an underrated ability I had developed back in my days as a professor.</p><p>Measuring the general attitude of a crowd. People reveal a lot through their general attitude when they think they aren’t being observed. It was surprisingly effective while teaching, during a conference, or even during a department meeting where someone had been trying some kind of low-impact white-collar ploy to get a modicum of power.</p><p>It was even more effective under the circumstances, as of the gathered two thousand farmers, most had been gathered in smaller groups, thinking that the thirty-yard visibility range of the mist protected them from observers, which made them free to discuss their plight with their friends.</p><p>I saw nothing but unbridled hope and excitement, with none of them showing even the slightest concern about the weight of living in the dungeon for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Not that I was surprised. I could understand the allure of power incredibly well. As I approached, I made sure to circle the group twice, making sure there was no one who was trying to hide their attitude. It was not a foolproof method, but it had to do for now.</p><p>I approached Harold, who had been patrolling the crowd, making sure to keep it safe. “Sir,” he greeted me once he was able to see me.</p><p>“How many volunteers have you managed to collect,” I asked.</p><p>“Two thousand, and that was with me picking and choosing. More than half of the available candidates wanted to join,” he explained.</p><p>“And, there’s no problem with the rules,” I asked.</p><p>“No sir. Every single one of them is happy to stay in the dungeon for an extended period, especially since you promised to help them promote their classes,” he said. “But, wouldn’t it be difficult to collect that many skill stones?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said. “How about the other condition?”</p><p>“Which condition?” he asked, only to have a look of realization when my gaze tightened. “The surveys?” I nodded seriously. “Of course, they don’t have a problem,” Harold said. “Half of them are willing to give their firstborn for this opportunity, let alone filling a few sheets of paper every day.”</p><p>“But, have you asked explicitly, and received their consent,” I said, not wanting to do my first large-scale experiment without informing them. They didn’t know exactly what I was looking for, but that had been a widely acceptable experimentation strategy for social sciences … as knowing the subject was enough to distort the experiment results.</p><p>“I have followed your instructions to the letter, sir,” Harold answered seriously.</p><p>“Good,” I said. “Then, follow me. We’re going to start setting the base properly,” I said, then gestured at the carts behind me. “But first, arrange the guards to sort through the equipment, and prepare everything for my speech. Once the speech is complete…”</p>",

    "content": "<p>“I think we hit the limit,” Maria said once we spent fifteen minutes uninterrupted by any boss monster despite the size of the forest.</p><p>“Looks like it,” I responded. “Still, we must have killed almost fifty of them. Is that normal?”</p><p>“For a dungeon that has been left unattended as much as this one, certainly,” she said. “Every dungeon has its own limitations, but most spawn a new boss monster between a day and a week. To my knowledge, exceptions are rare, to both extremes.”</p><p>“I see,” I said. “Maybe you should have taken more of them.”</p><p>She waved her hand dismissively. “Nonsense. Ten of them are more than what I need, which should give me all the advantages I need even for an emergency. Ultimately, you will spend the majority of your time in the dungeon, so it makes strategic sense,” she said.</p><p>I nodded in appreciation. The thought process was certainly reasonable. “Still, fifty dungeon bosses in less than two hours. It has been a productive session,” I said.</p><p>“What’s next?” she asked.</p><p>“I still need to forge a few practice swords for Eleanor,” I said. “Do you mind helping me?”</p><p>“How? I don’t have the skill,” she said.</p><p>“Well, the last time you helped me, I managed to unlock a new skill, so I’m sure it won’t hurt,” I said, which was true. I already had several ideas, and even if all of them failed, she could still help me with the calculations.</p><p>“Good. I’m sure Eleanor can keep things going for a while,” she said.</p><p>“I’m sure she can, too. Whether she would enjoy it is a completely different issue,” I responded, which earned a chuckle.</p><p>“We all make sacrifices,” she said, smiling wide. We played only one game of chess until we arrived at my private workshop, which was close to the dungeon gate.</p><p>“Wow, better than I expected,” she said once I gave a tour of the place. “Though, all those tubes…”</p><p>“Proper experimentation takes time,” I said. “But, it did help me make a few interesting discoveries, like the fact that not all mana-dead locations actually lack mana. It just drops below our ability to detect.”</p><p>That made Maria cross her eyebrows. “No, that’s not true … is it?”</p><p>“To be fair, I didn’t do any experiment to collaborate the results, so it might be wrong, but the observation is solid,” I said.</p><p>“But Essence allows us to detect mana,” she said.</p><p>“Think of it like hearing. Just because you can hear doesn’t mean you will hear someone whispering at the other end of a corridor.”</p><p>Maria paused, looking unconvinced. “I don’t believe it,” she said.</p><p>“Let me explain the process, then,” I said, which turned into a lecture on Newton’s Law of Cooling. Luckily, I didn’t throw the tubes I had experimented away, meaning there were hundreds of samples to test the theory, so once I finished explaining the core principles, I let her do the experiment alone while I tended the various chores like cleaning the blast furnaces, refilling the feeders, chopping wood.</p><p>Once I completed all, Maria was still working with the tubes, her frown even deeper. I didn’t interrupt her. While I was sure I could convince her of my conclusion if I insisted enough, letting her see it on her own was a better way.</p><p>Not to mention, it was always a good habit to let one’s peers repeat the experiments. The history of science was filled with people who thought that they had made a groundbreaking discovery, only for someone else to point out a systemic mistake in their experiment setup.</p><p>And, while she was busy with that, I focused on creating the casts for the other mass-production items. For weapons, I decided to focus on spears, as it was simple enough to be used even without a skill, especially when against monsters that loved to charge in a straight line. Also, a shorter handle would turn them into throwing weapons, which was an adjustment they could make as needed.</p><p>The armor was a bit more problematic. I thought about making breastplates, but it would consume too much metal, and adjusting it would be troubling as well.</p><p>Instead, I decided to create metal strips that they could add to their clothes as they wished. Not the ideal protection, but it had the flexibility advantage. I had already produced hundreds of spearheads by the time Maria returned.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she mumbled.</p><p>That confused me. “What?” I asked.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she repeated, louder.</p><p>“No, I heard you. I just don’t understand why,” I responded.</p><p>“Are you going to make me say it?” she said, looking a bit put out. “I’m sorry I doubted you.”</p><p>Only then, it clicked. “I see,” I said. “There’s nothing to apologize for,” I explained, but she didn’t seem to be convinced. I stopped what I was doing, and looked at her. “No, I’m being serious,” I said. “What I had was an observation based on only one experiment. The model makes sense, but it doesn’t mean that my conclusion was true. It’s always good for someone else to run the same experiment.”</p><p>“Really?” she said, perking up a little.</p><p>“Yes. That’s how we progress,” I said.</p><p>“And what if you had been wrong. Would you still have been happy?”</p><p>“Depends,” I said.</p><p>“On what?”</p><p>“Whether it was a silly mistake on my part, or I missed something fundamental. The former is never fun, but it certainly wouldn’t have been your fault. The latter could be even more interesting depending on what that fundamental detail would have been, and whether it could result in a more interesting conclusion.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes. I have made some of my important discoveries on the back of such mistakes. The key is to keep an open mind. Science is not about being right, but discovering the truth.”</p><p>“That sounds … interesting.”</p><p>I smiled. “I have to admit, it can be boring, or humbling, but ultimately, it’s a rewarding process. I would have done better if I hadn’t lost that approach after the Cataclysm.” A sigh escaped my mouth. “But, that’s enough talking. Let’s start working on Eleanor’s sword. I don’t want to explain to her that we have forgotten it.”</p><p>“Good point. She can be a bit touchy when it comes to her toys,” Maria chuckled. “What do you need?”</p><p>“The first thing I wanted to see is if you could copy the denser mana of anEpic skill,” I said.</p><p>“Show me,” she said. I did. “Again,” she asked, which turned into several repeats, occasionally interrupted by the refillment of my reserves. “You need something to expand your reserves,” she commented. “Too bad we don’t have the resources for it.”</p><p>“It’s not critical,” I said, which was partially true. Expanding my reserves by a certain percentage wasn’t critical, but I would love to have one such item and examine it, trying to figure out how it worked. I showed the mana blast again. “Do you think you can repeat it?”</p><p>“Maybe,” she said as she closed her eyes, which started another chain of attempts. “How about this?” she asked once it looked similar enough.</p><p>“I don’t know. Do you mind channeling it through a piece of metal so I can use Observe on it,” I said. She did, and I realized we were on the right path. “It’s good. Far better than I had expected,” I said. “The last time we practiced, you were having trouble pushing your mana out without the control of a skill.”</p><p>“Once I did that, I realized it was a good way to challenge Meditation, so I ran it repeatedly,” she said. “Though, I didn’t almost kill myself in the process,” she added, admonishing me.</p><p>“Yeah, looking back, it wasn’t my best moment,” I admitted. “Still, I can see that the practice is helping you,” I said. “Do you mind changing the flow like …” I said, only to pause before I grabbed some clay and turned it into a tablet, and wrote a mathematical line.</p><p>It was a long, complicated formula, but even before I could start to explain it, her eyes brightened. “I see,” she said as she repeated the mana burst.</p><p>I knew that she wasn’t trying to fake understanding, as her corrections turned the flow far too similar to mine. And, the differences were resolved after a few practice sessions. The only problem was that it stabilized faster than I had expected once she stopped controlling it, making it harder for me to take over through Mana Control.</p><p>“We need to get the process right,” I said. “I need to capture it before it gets destabilized. Maybe if we can add a temporary layer outside, kind of like a string around a bundle of sticks, keeping them together.”</p><p>“How?” she asked.</p><p>“How about this?” I asked, writing a line of formula.</p><p>“No, that won’t work. It doesn’t fit well with most of the data,” she said. “How about this?” she replied, writing one of her own, which, unlike mine, included the calculations jotted down underneath as well. I nodded in appreciation, as I couldn’t calculate the results with a glance.</p><p>“Looks more promising,” I said. A few more tries, and we managed to create a variant of the same mana flow, which stayed stable for a fraction of a second once she ceased her control. It was still a tight window, but luckily, timing was something that could be perfected with enough practice, especially since Maria was kind enough to help me without getting bored.</p><p>An hour later, we were looking at a small, completed dagger … well, Maria was looking at it.</p><p>I was more distracted by the notification I had just received.</p><p>[Mana Forge (Epic) 107 -&gt; 108]</p><p>“Good news, it also gave me a skill point,” I said.</p><p>“Excellent,” Maria said. “Now, to our task.”</p><p>“With pleasure,” I said. With her help, I didn’t need to limit myself to only one sword.

    "content": "<p>Once I had established a proper spiritual pillar for the Forest Dance, it didn’t mean my work was over. On the contrary, I needed to intensify my task of expanding the enclaves. While I wanted to still keep them hidden, secrecy wasn’t as paramount once I saw that the cultivators chose to retreat against a potential threat relating to ancient martial arts rather than sending their Nascent Soul cultivators. </p><p>And, the fact that the only Nascent Soul cultivator I had encountered hid his abilities completely to act like an ordinary old man further reinforced the idea. Then, I had the records of the historical battle between the cultivators and the ancient martial artists, where no cultivator stronger than Foundation Establishment actually joined. </p><p>All of this information supported the idea that Nascent Soul cultivators couldn’t act easily.  </p><p>Of course, without my knowledge of the Nascent Soul alchemy technique, I might have just assumed it to be some kind of preference, but the technique gave me enough clues that, to show the true abilities of their realm, Nascent Soul cultivator had to mobilize Providence. </p><p>The lack of a corresponding cultivation technique meant I didn’t know the implications of mobilizing Providence through its cultivation, but I was starting to lean toward it being significant. </p><p>Unlike my System, which seemingly had no side effect — at least, that was what I assumed. If not … well, I wasn’t in a position to think about it. </p><p>“Of course, just because they don’t want to act, doesn’t mean they can’t,” I reminded myself even as I flew toward the cultivators that I imprisoned, ready to launder the Mutmah technique through one of them. Considering how the situation developed with Janassa, I wasn’t willing to get another cultivator to bond. </p><p>However, I wasn’t really afraid of sharing the technique with them. At worst, they would escape. </p><p>Getting a better version of the Mutmah Formation technique wasn’t the only reason for my visit. I also needed more rewards sitting in my inventory, ready to be cashed out to prevent the Providence from stunting the growth of the spiritual tree I had created. </p><p>However, I didn’t immediately take action. I dropped the fragmented Mutmah technique to the mix, though I made sure not to put the name to not alert them, just tagging it as an ancient formation technique, with a point cost enough to mark it as valuable … but not too valuable. </p><p>Unfortunately, the reward was not immediate. The imprisoned cultivators needed some time to pick up the technique before I could extract lessons from them under the guise of pity or insult. At least, once they did, it wouldn’t need too many repeats. They were able to redeem high-quality Foundation Establishment pills and other supporting medicine from the fake mystic land. Combined with the abundant Qi I supplied, their cultivation rose rapidly, meaning much higher multipliers for me. </p><p>Even better, since the formations prevented them from fighting each other, insulting and heckling others while studying starting to become the common culture — particularly with my assistance.</p><p>A quick visit to the cells resulted in a decent batch of rewards, from lessons in esoteric topics to various materials — the latter I wanted to reinforce the formations against the inevitable retaliation. </p><p>“That was the easy part,” I muttered as I once again stepped on my flying ship, this time toward a more dangerous location. </p><p>The fake mystic land. </p><p>I didn’t exactly know what to find, as the detection formations I had in place had been ruined during the last trick, and considering the density of the cultivators, they weren’t as dense in any case. I expected a greater concentration of cultivators, and I expected them to be arguing about benefits, mostly because I couldn’t feel many cultivators inside. </p><p>However, as I approached, I met with an unexpected sight. </p><p>A battlefield. </p><p>“Alright, that’s more than I expected,” I muttered even as I took thousands of cultivators — mostly Qi Gathering, and led by Foundation Establishment cultivators —  into account as I approached, patrolling the area. </p><p>However, I didn’t call it a battlefield just because of the number of cultivators. The landscape had shown great signs of destruction, showing that not only there was a battle, but also there was an intense one. I was glad that I had already established many formations to keep me hidden, as it was the only reason I was able to avoid the mess. </p><p>While my formation technique lacked the stopping power of the higher rank ones, the sheer expertise I had thanks to Major Integration realm expertise was not something another cultivator even came close to matching. </p><p>For the sect cultivators I observed, Major Familiarity was already counted as the mark where they needed to stop working on the technique and move to a more advanced one, while Minor Accomplishment counted as expertise worthy of sect Elders. </p><p>At least, that was how it went when it came to Outer Sect Disciples I constantly met. It might have been different for the Inner Sect disciples, but it wasn’t a problem that I needed to deal with yet. Clearly, even with the upgraded mystic land, it was still not worth their time. </p><p>So, I used the hidden tunnels I had created to directly arrive at the mystic land, which had even more formations in place that could keep me hidden while I played. From there, I started examining the battlefield. </p><p>The first thing I noticed about the battlefield was the very limited presence of mortals. There were some Connate realm martial artists that essentially worked as servants, but their numbers were limited. The real bulk consisted of Qi Gathering cultivators, though even the weakest of them belonged to the late stage. </p><p>I examined the battlefield. There were four main camps, each showing the flag of a major sect; Kartpa Valley, Entsa Pavilion, Dragon Peak, and Mutmah Sect. Their numbers were sorted that way, with Kartpa Valley being the most crowded, and Mutmah Sect with the least numbers. Though, even then, Entsa Pavilion and Kartpa Valley had almost an order of magnitude more people. </p><p>However, from the way the camps were positioned, it was clear that the numbers didn’t correlate with the numbers. Entsa Pavilion seemed to be already pushed out, with the camp half in ruins. They had only two Golden Core Elders at the camp, and both looked ragged and exhausted. Clearly, they were not in good condition. </p><p>I wondered if it had anything to do with the demonic cultivators that seemed to infect the sects. Or, maybe not. Maybe it was something far more common. </p><p>That, and worry about Aisnam. </p><p>After Entsa, the Muhmah Sect seemed to be the most disadvantaged. Their camp was even further away, their disciples not moving too much away from their formations. However, while their position was disadvantaged, their camp was practically pristine, their expertise in formations keeping them safe from harassment. </p><p>The Dragon Peak and Kartpa Valley seemed to be sharing the lead based on their closeness to the fake mystic land, which was a surprise. As, in the battlefield, there was only one Dragon Peak disciple for each Kartpa Valley disciple, and despite that, they were able to hold the line easily. </p><p>And, that was without any discernible difference between their cultivation levels. </p><p>Dragon Peak’s reputation as the first among equals seemed not to be empty bragging. Their disciples were stronger, faster, and more competent … though I wasn’t sure I liked the bloodlust they showed while fighting. </p><p>That couldn’t be good. </p><p>“Alright, the plans need to be adjusted,” I muttered. My initial plan was to use the material I picked from the demonic cultivators, leading them to discover the martial arts outpost of the conspirators, hoping to solve two problems at once. </p><p>However, the situation was complicated enough without me throwing in additional complications. I decided to depart. </p><p>I still made sure to sneak some of the evidence I picked from the demonic cultivators I had picked near the battlefield, making sure they found their way to Entsa Pavilion Elders. Hopefully, it would be enough to alert them to the problem. Unfortunately, that was all I could do at the moment to make sure Aisnam was okay. </p><p>Too bad leaving the mortal domains was not an option. Not just because the situation was too complicated here for me to abandon. The memory of the attack from the Treasure Pavilion ship was still clear in my mind, reminding me not to tangle with cultivators without stacking all the advantages I could gather. </p><p>Once I placed the evidence, I visited the training camp, only to realize it was completely gone. Admittedly, it wasn’t a big surprise. With the ongoing battle, it was only smart. A quick search of the refugee groups — which doubled as another recruitment drive for Forest Dance — confirmed that their recruitment efforts had ceased as well. </p><p>Whether they stopped completely, or hid better, I didn’t know. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to explore either. </p><p>Not when I needed to root out more than a dozen demonic cultivator bases spread across mortal domain and misty mountains… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had many plans to be launched once I returned to mortal domains … only to hit an immediate problem. </p><p>Janassa was gone. </p><p>Not only she was gone, but also there was no disturbance to my formations. No external attack, no internal fiddling. “I just need to decide whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing,” I muttered even as I examined the fake mystic land, taking note of many small signs, including a toppled tea cup and a half-empty teapot. </p><p>The evidence implied that she had disappeared with no warning. “Maybe it was teleportation,” I muttered as I focused, trying to see if there was any kind of disturbance in Providence. Unfortunately, I failed. </p><p>The perspective from Alchemy and Formations was not exactly interchangeable, especially when the topic was a possible teleportation. </p><p>“I wonder how it’ll bite me back,” I muttered. I didn’t need to have any evidence. My best guess was that the responsible party was the Kartpa Valley, solely because she had the technique even before we met. </p><p>If it was before my encounter with Elsana and Lannayin, I might have been panicking, but I started to get a sense of a pattern about the things that were happening. We would meet again … probably when she was fighting against a dozen Nascent Soul Cultivators or something, and I had to put myself into an even bigger mess.</p><p>“There’s nothing to do,” I muttered even as I started to go for the Spiritual Vein, with a small sapling in hand. It wasn’t anything special that cultivators cared about. Just an ordinary spiritual tree with no fruits or special uses. </p><p>But, it had one beautiful feature. It could grow almost unlimited. The perfect tool for the next step of my plan. I would have loved to do that with my Alchemy technique surpassing Perfection, but it didn’t seem to be possible. </p><p>And, I didn’t have the luxury of waiting. </p><p>“Let’s see if I could create a proper spiritual pillar for Forest Dance,” I muttered even as I planted the spirit plant right on top of the spirit vein, and around it, I created a formation pattern from the pieces from the alchemical pillars. </p><p>The move was a bit too rash for my tastes, but what Elsana had said about the response from the cultivators was true. They would retaliate, and once they did, it would be a bloodbath. I didn’t know what would be their limit. I didn’t expect to kill everyone in the Mortal Domain, but it was almost certain that they would destroy Markas completely. </p><p>Maybe they would decide that just destroying the Zaim Kingdom was an acceptable compromise. </p><p>Unless, of course, I had enough power to dissuade them. Luckily for me, what happened with the Burning Ice had given me the blueprint for defending a region. </p><p>“Suddenly, I’m glad that I have created that fake mystic land,” I muttered even as I channeled the output of the spirit vein to the tiny sapling completely, almost in an unrestricted manner. The sapling stopped being a sapling in a second, reaching my height … then doubled it. </p><p>Then, doubled it again … and again. </p><p>I was prepared to assist its growth, but it seemed to be unnecessary. The moment it connected with the pieces of the alchemical trees, the providence that had been collected started to flow to it. </p><p>As the tree grew, I started alternating between using formations and Land Mastery, making sure that, as the tree grew, it stayed wrapped in an illusion of clouds. I would keep the growing tree hidden from the gaze of the cultivators even as it continued to grow — how much, I had no idea. </p><p>It was the risk of using something I understood only halfway. </p><p>As the tree grew, I could feel two things. First, it was the connection of it spreading to the enclaves I had created, connecting with the martial artists through the alchemical trees … and the results were spectacular. </p><p>I had the records. Even at its peak, Burning Ice Sect hadn’t come close to having a fraction of the martial artists I had. A part of it was talent, as they lacked the ability to mass-produce pills to enhance martial talent. Though, an even bigger driver was their desire to maintain the longevity of their style. Recruiting too much might cause a schism just as easily. </p><p>For me, how it would change in multiple generations was not as big of a concern. Partially due to the urgency of the current situation, but the nature of Forest Dance assured me somewhat. The essence leaned strongly toward preservation and pacifism, and that was reinforced further with the wild growth of the central spiritual tree, embedding to its nature. </p><p>Eventually, it would be strong enough to support Spiritual Infusion practitioners. </p><p>Admittedly, it wasn’t a direct conclusion but a deduction from the way Elsana and Lannayin were bonded with the mountain. Two of them had no impact on the mountain, but I wasn’t sure if the same would be true for hundreds of Spirit Infusion martial artists, all pressing against the same structure. </p><p>Limits, I would eventually discover once the tree continued to grow. </p><p>And, grow it did. I made several small changes on the alchemical web based on my growing understanding of Land Mastery, which meant that the tree was not just another part of the network, but a siphon that drew the providence toward it. </p><p>At first, I was afraid of the backlash, but I soon realized it wasn’t the case. With both of them embodying the same art, the Providence treated them the same, moving without problem. It was a good detail under the circumstances, but I needed to be careful. </p><p>After all, it was the exact same ability that the cultivators were using to attack the remnants of the Everdawn Empire. Though, whether those remnants actually represented an entity in the depths of the mist, or it was just the remnants like the base of the Burning Ice sect the cultivators were trying to destroy, I had no idea. </p><p>What I cared about was finding a solution to the problem before the same attack was wielded against me. </p><p>“But, that’s for later,” I muttered even as I started to add more and more formations around the tree, doing my best to hide its nature as an ancient alchemical feature. It was already strong enough to deliver hits that could rival peak Foundation establishment on its own, and that was without adding in all the tricks I could deliver from the formation, or alchemical poisons. </p><p>Alone, any of them would barely allow me to fend off an early Golden Stage cultivator. Barely. However, luckily, the three transcended methods all have unique strengths and weaknesses. </p><p>Formations gave me an incredible versatility, one that no cultivator I had seen came even close to matching. I could weave shields, illusions, and displacements, and generate incredible wide-range attacks. The only problem, was the sheer power it packed was lacking. No formation I could build that a Golden Core cultivator couldn’t punch through. </p><p>The only thing it managed to keep them away in the fake mystic land was the threat of self-destruction, which would mean the loss of the treasures. </p><p>Alchemy gave me a lot of poisons that were effective for Golden Core cultivators, which had unmatched damage. Once infected, a Golden Core Cultivator would have died unless I applied a treatment. For the alchemy, the problem was twofold. First, I was still uncomfortable about killing people. One part was the leftover morality of my old life, albeit much weakened — after I led an army of martial artists to kill people, whether I delivered a killing blow or not was academic — but the real reason was Providence. </p><p>Killing created a karmic bond, which had mysterious implications on Providence in a way that I didn’t fully understand, which only worked when one delivered the blow. The impact wasn’t always negative — the Burning Ice improved quite a bit after the demonic cultivator hunt — but considering the troubles it brought whenever I created a personal connection, I wasn’t willing to add even more trouble. </p><p>Then, there was the growing tree. Currently, it was merely peak Foundation Establishment power, but it could both restrict and deliver devastating attacks at a surprisingly large radius which would increase the more it grew. </p><p>The true benefit lies in the combination of the three features. Formations for strategic flexibility, alchemy for pure, long-lasting damage and area denial, and the tree to restrict or deliver devastating damage as needed. </p><p>Altogether, as long as I was in Markas, I was confident I could deal with a number of Golden Cultivators at once. </p><p>“Assuming, of course, the tree grows unrestricted,” I muttered even as I moved toward the roots, examining the way Providence suddenly wrapped around it, as if it was trying to suffocate its growth. For anyone else, it would have been impossible to handle trouble. </p><p>I just triggered the System for a simple reward, which gave me a better understanding of Music. </p><p>The chains of Providence dispersed, and the tree continued to grow unrestricted. </p><p>All that remained was a race against time, growing the tree to a sizable level before the inevitable retaliation from the Treasure Pavilion arrived. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, that was a better show than I had been expecting,” I said even as the mountain calmed down. The raging blizzard had calmed into gentle snow, the kind that a movie about Christmas would have at the end of the movie. Even the magma of the open volcano stopped bubbling furiously, the surface calming down. </p><p>Well, as calm as it could be for an active volcano. </p><p>Elsana was the first one to speak. “Well, that was an … experience. For a moment, I was sure that the breakthrough had failed.” </p><p>“I know what you mean,” Lannayin said even as she left the surface of the magma, her footsteps fading soon after. “I lost control, almost like something else took over.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. Everything was in control,” I said even as I watched them walk toward me, taking note of their transformed aura. They certainly felt different. They were certainly awe-inspiring, especially with the way their looks had transformed. </p><p>It wasn’t too much. Elsana’s eyes gained a bluish hue that radiated a freezing aura, which had been matched in her eyes. Similarly, Lannayin’s red hair gained a glowy coppery sheen, one that I was sure to alight a dark room. </p><p>Two permanent markers of the transformation they had gone through. I wondered if such changes were normal, or if they were somehow related to the flare of Providence. I had to admit, the thought was a touch unsettling. </p><p>Luckily, I could see that whatever Providence did, it only impacted their power and not their minds, or I might have considered retreat as the prudent option. </p><p>And, it certainly impacted their power. What I could feel radiating from them was several times more intense than what the notes had prepared me for. It almost felt like they were not just ordinary Spirit Infusion realm martial artists, but living embodiments of the mountain's dual nature. </p><p>Looking at them, I was so glad that I didn’t try to break through to that stage using Burning Ice. I doubted such a sudden boost of power came with no cost … not if the persistent link of providence and their souls was any indicator. </p><p>That was in addition to their link with the mountain. </p><p>“How about a spar,” Lannayin asked even as she punched, and a dry, scorching wind followed it, melting the snow. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Elsana said. “What if we hurt each other. We need to get used to it.”  </p><p>“I can put a formation to act as an armor,” I offered. “As long as you don’t push yourself to the limit, it should keep you safe.” </p><p>“Excellent,” Lannayin said as she smiled at me, her earlier hostility gone now that I helped them to reach the Spiritual Infusion realm. </p><p>The moment I built the formations, Elsana jumped into action, her punch creating the image of a snowstorm that froze everything in its path. Lannayin dodged in panic. \"It's... incredible,\" she said softly, her breath forming delicate frost patterns in the air. \"I can feel every gust of wind, every flake of snow as if they were extensions of myself.\"</p><p>“You’re not the only one that can feel that,” she said as she slammed her foot on the ground, and a burst of magma appeared. It wasn’t from the volcano, but a direct manifestation of her essence. “Or, attack without waiting for the other to be prepared.” </p><p>“Oh, is that how you want to play,” Elsana said as she waved her hand, and the storm gathered into snowballs, rushing toward Lannayin, who melted them by blowing on them. </p><p>It turned into a long range spar, their attacks escalating. If I couldn’t feel the mountain directly, I would have suspected that they were borrowing power from the mountain, but it seemed to be their own essence, just reflected through the Spiritual Pillar. </p><p>I suspected whatever that happened with Providence played a role, as everything I had read indicated that their power should be somewhere near Peak Foundation Establishment. What they were showing was that, and it was clear that neither was pushing themselves to the limit. </p><p>“That’s enough,” Elsana finally called half an hour later, gasping. “We have just broken through. We shouldn’t push ourselves too much.” </p><p>“A good idea,” I said. “And, not to mention that you have to train a lot.” </p><p>“We do?” Lannayin asked. </p><p>“Of course. Unless, of course, you think that the cultivators would accept their loss happily.” </p><p>“They won’t,” Lannayin said, her grim tone showing that she understood exactly how cultivators had thought. </p><p>“Especially since we’re a representative of the ancient martial arts,” Elsana said. “They do everything to erase the tracks —” she started, only for her eyes to widen. “Oh, no! Markas! What if they go and destroy the city. We need to go and reinforce it.” </p><p>“Don’t worry. The defenses there are strong enough that anything you two could do wouldn’t matter.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” Elsana said even as she looked at the sky, where the giant flying ship had been parked until their earlier attack destroyed it. </p><p>“Not if you can bring the giant volcano with you,” I countered. “Don’t worry, the defenses of the mortal domain are tasked to others. It’s more important for you to get stronger.”</p><p>“You think so?” she said. </p><p>“Of course,” I replied. “You’re strong enough to fight against the Golden Core Elders one-to-one, but we already have defenses there enough to hold back those. The problem is if they send multiple Golden Core elders.” </p><p>“They might,” she said. </p><p>“That’s why I need you here. Instead of coming to the mortal domain, focus on reinforcing the spiritual pillar of Burning Ice. Now that I have a better idea of how to break through, I could help the other disciples breakthrough as well.” </p><p>“You think you can do it?” she said. “Our breakthrough had consumed … something, and I can feel that the spiritual pillar lacks more of it.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. I know how to fix it,” I said. She was talking about Providence. It was hard to quantify Providence, but their breakthrough didn’t just consume the meager amount they had in the mountain, but also received a lot of external assistance. </p><p>Refreshing Providence might have been a challenging process … if it wasn’t for the demonic cultivators I had imprisoned. A little interrogation should allow me to discover their base, which could be cleansed by the Burning Ice disciples. </p><p>That, and thanks to records, I had learned enough to not only reinforce the satellite spiritual pillar near the mortal domain, but also how to create a proper one. </p><p>Meaning, I could create one for Forest Dance rather than just relying on the alchemical abomination I had created. </p><p>She looked like she wanted to ask more, but she held back. “I trust you,” she said instead. </p><p>I shared her smile. “Happy to hear that,” I said. “Then, we have a plan. I’ll go and focus on raising other martial artists, while you two focus on meditating and reinforcing the mountain. Any problems?” </p><p>“No problem,” Lannayin said as she nodded, her gaze fixed on the glowing magma that still bubbled ahead gently. “I want to explore my new realm. The fire... it's alive within me. The heartbeat of the volcano matches my own.\" She looked up, her amber eyes blazing with an inner flame. \"Thank you for guiding us through this. I can’t wait to experiment with what kind of weapons can be created here.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I’m leaving the scripts here with you. Feel free to experiment.” </p><p>“Good,” Lannayin said, then paused. “About the cultivators that betrayed and imprisoned us…” </p><p>I shrugged. “Once I interrogate them about the location, I’ll leave them here. Punish them as you see fit,” I said. I wasn’t exactly torn up about the fates of a bunch of monsters that sacrificed thousands of lives for their power. </p><p>“Any tips about the meditation?” Elsana asked. </p><p>I shrugged. “I have some, but ultimately, you’re bonded with the mountain in a way I can’t comprehend. I don’t know how much my comments would help.” </p><p>Lannayin looked at me once again. \"Is that a bad thing?\"</p><p>\"Not necessarily,\" I said, choosing my words carefully. \"But such a deep bond might have unforeseen consequences. The Burning Ice essence is volatile even without linking it to an object directly. Balancing that energy might require a lot.”</p><p>That sparked a conversation where I did my best to explain my perspective, and even wrote a few calligraphy to guide them to the concepts. “Don’t forget that, ultimately, they are supportive,” I concluded our lesson. “You have the bonds, so you know better. Don’t push yourself too much.” </p><p>“Do you think we have the chance to do so?” she said. “By damaging the cultivator ship, we have escalated the conflict,” she explained. “I don’t know how they are, but I know that the Treasure Pavilion wouldn’t take it lightly. Not when they were able to intimidate even the major sects.  They'll retaliate, and with greater force.\"</p><p>Lannayin intervened. \"They would have destroyed everything regardless. At least now, we've sent a message. Not everyone could say that they made those arrogant immortals bleed. It’s better to die with honor than live as a coward.” </p><p>“True,” I said, but my mind was already churning hundreds of plans. While I agreed with her about living as a coward, at least when the stakes were billions of lives, I still preferred to stay alive to enjoy the fruits of my victory. </p><p>Luckily, with the System, it was not a hopeless plan. </p><p>Not even when I had to make enemies out of cultivators. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The other side of the gate was as I had expected, filled with an army of insects that rushed forward, threatening to drown me, which I cut down rapidly with ease to create some space. </p><p>“Disgusting,” Maria said the moment she arrived, a red shield of mana hanging around her like a bubble, then she waved her hand, and a ring of fire exploded outward, killing hundreds of insects at once, burning them to ashes. </p><p>Which, incidentally, destroyed their shells as well. Their mana puffed into existence for a moment, only to be drawn in by the dungeon in quick order. “Thanks for the assist, but don’t forget. We need to preserve the shells for mana recovery.” </p><p>“Right,” she said with the slightest blush. “You’re right. I’ll be more careful.” </p><p>“By the way, how much mana do you have to throw around like that, if it won't be a private question,” I asked, surprised by the ease she had done so. </p><p> “It is,” she said, but she continued to smile, so I wasn’t scared of her reaction. “Just above forty thousand.” </p><p>“W-what?” I gasped. Considering she was level hundred, I was expecting a lot. But, forty thousand… </p><p>”My class gives me ten Essence each level, which is enough to raise the number in the first place. Then, there is an item to increase my Essence further, and another to enhance mana points that it grants by every level… Combined, it goes up significantly.” </p><p>“Impressive,” I said, though I couldn’t help but feel jealous. It was a scary amount of mana. No wonder she didn’t need to stop to replenish her mana. “So, I’m sure I can leave you here safely for a second,”  I said. She nodded, and I disappeared to the fourth floor to get another sapling.</p><p>Once I returned, setting up the hydroponic garden took only seconds, the process getting more and more familiar. </p><p>“So, you have Nurture as well,” she commented. “I can arrange for a skill removal stone if you want. We have several in storage, and now that you have thousands of Farmers to call upon, it’s a waste of skill a point.” </p><p>“It comes in handy too often,” I said. </p><p>“Are you sure? It’s … Nurture,” she said, her disdain clear. </p><p>“Once we finished with the dungeon,” I said, deflecting the request. I had no intention of doing so, as Nurture was a very useful tool, but I didn’t want to spend time convincing her of that. At least, not here.</p><p>“Good,” she said. “So, does the boss monster really just come rushing in,” she said. </p><p>“Yes. Should I assume it’s not common?” </p><p>“Might be,” she said. “But, the dungeons I operate in are usually split into two categories. Either the boss monsters are valuable enough that they are hunted the moment they are born, with the various teams competing for it, or the last thing you want is to come across them.” </p><p>“Fair point,” I said even as I finished setting the web of trees, including the steam-powered crusher, and piled it with mana. Adding a secondary mana exhaust that poured pure mana toward her while pushing the more tainted portion to the trees was easy. </p><p>She closed her eyes as the mana flow hit her, only to open them back again, surprised. “The mana … it’s pure,” she gasped. </p><p>“Well, yeah. I have a filtering mechanism there to separate the two portions. It’s not that hard.” </p><p>“Really? There are wards capable of doing that, but they are rare and expensive. This could be a game changer for dungeon exploration.” </p><p>“As long as we find a way to spread it around without accompanying assassination attempts,” I said. </p><p>“Good point,” she said, and focused on absorbing the mana with enough speed to shock me. A rough calculation told me that it would take less than five minutes for her to refill her mana reserves completely, and that was with her taking in every drop of mana the crusher produced. </p><p>Her true limit, I had no idea, and that was with her yet to pass the level hundred barrier … which was supposed to improve her abilities in a material manner. </p><p>It was a good realization, snapping my growing bubble of arrogance. I had improved a lot and gained some impressive victories, but it wouldn’t do well to forget that all of those victories came from situations I could manipulate to my benefit. </p><p>Someone like Maria could still kill a hundred of me with a spell in an open field of battle. And, from the speed with which she devoured mana, it seemed like that one spell wouldn’t be her limit. </p><p>I busied myself with adding more trees to the hydroponic garden, distracting myself from the sudden sense of inferiority. It wasn’t exactly fair, as not only did my class have very significant drawbacks when it came to combat potential, but I was also significantly behind her in terms of schedule. </p><p>I made sure not to let her realize any of it, as my personal crisis was hardly her problem. “The first boss is almost here,” I called her soon. “Should we discuss how to deal with it?”  </p><p>“No need. Just give me a signal when it’s five seconds away, and leave the rest to me.” </p><p>I wanted to argue against it, as it seemed silly to fight a battle without a plan in place, but the way she told me that gave me pause. She seemed confident enough. </p><p>I decided to hold my complaints to myself, as there were two probabilities. First, her spell would put us in a dangerous position, but with several layers of trees around us, it would be easy to compensate. The second, she actually knew what she was doing. </p><p>Her confidence didn’t fill me with confidence, but I chose to trust her expertise. </p><p>“Now,” I said once the gargantuan beast approached the line with sufficient speed, and the mana started to gather in front of her. It was bright enough to signal that it was going to be a strong spell, but its structure was packed tight. I didn’t have the experience to measure the amount of mana she was putting into her casting. </p><p>But, it should be enough to wound the beast significantly. I still wished that we discussed tactics beforehand, but I could also see where she was coming from in terms of confidence. I prepared to rush once her spell went off, focusing on distracting the boss while she cast another spell. </p><p>… Only for it to turn unnecessary when the gargantuan monster had collapsed against the edge of the tree line, a giant flaming spear skewering through its center. </p><p>One spell. It was all it took to kill the giant beast, while I had to whittle at it slowly for an hour. </p><p>“How was that?” Maria said as she turned to me proudly. </p><p>“Amazing,” I said, which was certainly not an exaggeration. “What was it?” </p><p>“My strongest single-target spell,” she said. “Too bad it takes almost half of my mana to cast it once here,” she said as she moved near, and then absorbed the crystal that the dungeon boss had turned into. </p><p>While I wanted to watch her, gaping in shock, I had more important things to do. Like hunting the swarm that it brought along to supply the crusher. “So, you can take it down with one spell,” I said. “I’m impressed.” </p><p>“Yes,” she said, then frowned. “Unfortunately, it’s hard to use against smaller targets. It’s slow to cast, expensive in terms of mana, and its range is not particularly impressive.” </p><p>“It’s still a hundred times more powerful than the siege weapons,” I said. </p><p>She waved her hand. “Yeah, siege weapons are hardly worth using anywhere except when defending towns against monster hordes. Nothing that can rival a proper mage.” </p><p>I would have argued if it came from anyone else, but as someone who might match the devastation potential of a ship full of napalm, she had a right to make that comment. </p><p>“If the mage in question is you, certainly,” I said, which earned a big smile. </p><p>“Exactly,” she said. “Now, it has been a while since we had a proper game. Why don’t we have one while waiting for the next boss? I missed playing with you. You know how to make the games interesting.” </p><p>“Knight C3,” I called in response even as I continued hunting the beasts. Luckily, at this point, even using mana attacks was mostly automatic, allowing me to focus on the game even as I got piled on by the leftover swarm. </p><p>Too bad my full focus only meant a slower descent to inevitable defeat. Not that I was complaining, as it was far better than focusing on the fight. Nothing except the boss monsters came close to providing me with a challenge … and with bosses no longer a problem with her attacks, even that was not the case anymore. </p><p>So, trying to put up an impossible defense against her attacks seemed like a good way to pass the time as I expanded my little hydroponic forest, to see just how many boss monsters I could pull to fight us. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“That’s enough. We’ll walk the rest of the way. We’re not riding a car before you figure out how to make springs,” Maria said the moment we arrived at the third floor. I didn’t blame her. While creating a car with her help to deal with the technical challenges had been a fun exercise, the same wasn’t true for the ride itself. </p><p>Calling it uncomfortable was like claiming the dungeon boss of the dungeon was a bit bigger than ordinary insects. The brief stop we had at the outpost — as I parked the primitive car a distance away — to talk with Harold about collecting volunteers felt like heaven compared to the ride itself.  </p><p>So much so that, when given a choice between riding it for an extended period and flying, I didn’t know which one I would pick. </p><p>Me. </p><p>“Making the springs isn’t the biggest problem,” I said even as I placed it in the safe house. However, rather than leaving it like that, I disassembled the whole structure, turning it back into an ordinary metal cart, and took the small steam engine with me. </p><p>Carrying it on my back was not that hard. We started running. Well, I ran, while Maria floated next to me, flames dancing underneath, looking surprisingly solid. I didn’t try to decipher the shape of the mana, as it was far too complicated. </p><p>I was yet to succeed in reverse engineering my poor fire bolt spell. </p><p>“And, what is the biggest problem?” she asked, her tone showing no exertion. </p><p>“The lack of tires. I really need a rubber equivalent. Still, it was a fun proof of concept. It’ll be better once I tinker with it.” Her smile disappeared. “What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“Nothing,” she said. “It just hit me how you will destroy the business of many families, including mine.” </p><p>“Yours?” I asked. </p><p>“The Griffins. That’s what makes my family a powerhouse. We have a dungeon that produces a skill that helps us to raise and tame wild beasts. Griffins are our best product, but they are not the only ones. We sell a great number of tamed beasts of burden, and…” </p><p>“Fuel for a steam engine is far cheaper than raising and feeding one of those beasts,” I completed. </p><p>“Yeah,” she said, still looking surprised at the revelation. </p><p>I didn’t blame her. It was one thing to understand something in general terms, but understanding that it would have a direct impact on her livelihood was something else. It was a natural response. “However, you don’t need to worry too much,” I added. “There’s a long, long time until we can create an industrial base that can replace it.” </p><p>“Really? Why?” </p><p>“Three reasons,” I said. ”First, there’s no guarantee that it’ll actually work in more mana-dense locations,” I said. “I know that mana reacts weirdly when subjected to external stimulation, heat included, and not always in a predictable manner. I have no idea if an enclosed, high-pressure steam container would work in a location with more ambient mana, or a dungeon with different conditions.” </p><p>“And, mana-dense locations are the ones with the real economic value,” she said. </p><p>“Economic, military, and political,” I added, though under the circumstances, it was kind of redundant. In a world embracing feudality, the three overlapped inevitably to an extreme degree. “Then, there is the problem with metal production.” </p><p>“I thought you solved that.” </p><p>“Not exactly,” I responded. “Yes, my setup helps me to produce several tons of metal every day, but ultimately, I’m still using my skill to facilitate it. Truly scaling up requires solving several technical challenges. Until then, using the metal to produce swords, arrows, and other personal items is more efficient. The metal we used for the car could be used to forge a thousand swords.” </p><p>“And, what about the third reason?” she asked. </p><p>“The obvious one. I can’t reveal them without ending up assassinated. It represents a shift of power that’s unacceptable.” </p><p>“Then, how did such things happen in the old world,” she said. “Wouldn’t kings and other feudal lords be against it?” </p><p>“That’s an excellent question,” I said. “Unfortunately, the answer is not that straightforward. I can give you a ten-hour lecture, or a five-minute one, which one do you prefer?”  </p><p>That earned a chuckle. “Those seem to be two wildly different options. Is there no third thirty-minute class?” </p><p>I shrugged. “It’s pointless. Five minutes is all I need to give you the key aspects and the general principles. Anything more requires a solid, structured background in history behind every topic, which will take at least ten hours, and that’s with your Intelligence helping you to learn faster.” </p><p>“Really. And, without it?”</p><p>“With the pacing of a good student? Probably two semesters, three to be on the safe side, with a reading list of twenty books.” </p><p>“Always a professor. I’m actually tempted to listen to the ten-hour version, but for the moment, the five-minute one will have to be enough. We have too much to do.” </p><p>“Fine. The way technology has spread has to do with timing as much as anything else. Before the Industrial Revolution started, the power balance between the feudal power, mercantile class, and kings had already changed due to the combined effect of gunpowder weapons and geographical discoveries. Combined, those led to the loss of power for many old authorities. The power of the kings had been enhanced enough to stop the feudal powers, leaving that social space for the newly rising merchant class.” </p><p>“Really? That simple?” </p><p>I chucked. “Of course not, but I’m summarizing aggressively. Spain had appeared as the first candidate for global power, but it bungled that opportunity through a series of ill-advised political moves, ending with a disastrous invasion by Britain, which left the British as the premier naval power, who used it to create the first real globe-spanning trade path. They invaded India, using the precious fabrics as a tool to fund their navy and purchase African slaves. They used those slaves to produce cotton in their new colonies in America. And then, they moved that cotton back to produce even more fabric.” </p><p>“Sounds vicious,” she commented. </p><p>“Without a doubt. Enlightenment and philosophy love to claim that the more we develop, the more moral humanity has become, but it’s nowhere near accurate. It’s more an application of incentives than anything else —” I added, then stopped myself. </p><p>A five-minute summary shouldn’t include a sidebar to explain economic determinism, game theory, and macroeconomics. </p><p>I paused for a moment, collecting my thoughts. It was a good place to pause, as we were looking at the gate leading to the fourth floor. “Be careful about the mud and water,” I warned her. </p><p>“Thanks,” she said as she floated higher. I passed through the gate first, quickly dealing with the insects that surrounded it. She followed, but seeing that I was able to deal with all of them immediately, she refrained from attacking. </p><p>I continued to explain as I led the way, cutting down the monsters with ranged attacks with ease. </p><p>“Anyway, the setup I had described created a unique economic situation where one country with a limited population suddenly wanted to increase the production of one commodity more than it was possible with its limited population; and a new batch of industrial powerhouses that was incentivized to solve it were born.” </p><p>“And, that led to technological development?” </p><p>“Yes, though luck played some part in it as well.” </p><p>“In what way?” </p><p>“Independent of other political aspects, England had already a patent system, which was initially used to grant favored people monopolies in core products like salt production, but that had been abolished due to public pressure from the new merchant class, leaving a diminished version that only granted temporary monopolies for new inventions.” </p><p>“I see,” she said. </p><p>“This meant that, through a number of factors, the British isles suddenly had a trifecta of rare events. A need for unlimited production borne from excess raw materials and unlimited market access, a new ruling capitalist class that desperately supported new developments to further their power, and a suitable legal landscape. Together, it meant that, for the first time, educated people had significantly more to gain from exploring new avenues than just serving as tutors and courtiers for the rich.” </p><p>“That sounds simple. But was all that really necessary?” </p><p>“It absolutely was. Those developments had turned Britain into the first real global superpower, however, it also created untold tragedies, both for its citizens and other countries. But, since it helped the ones in power, they pushed relentlessly.” </p><p>“And, you expect it to be the reverse.” </p><p>“Without a doubt,” I said. “One of the key aspects of what had been going on was the absolute military dominance of the British Fleet. It meant that, during all of it, none of the other powers, internal or external, could intervene with the process, no matter how much it hurt their position. The only way the other countries could even fight it was to embrace industrialism.” </p><p>“Don’t you expect that to happen here? If a city lord embraces it, the others would too?” </p><p>“Not necessarily. Here, we have elite forces, their power coming from monopolizing System Shops and best dungeons, each locked in their feudal domains, doing their best to prevent their rivals from getting stronger.” </p><p>“There’s no indomitable British fleet to protect you when the developments are in its cradle,” she said. “Is that why you think no one else has done what you have done?” </p><p>For a moment, I thought about sharing my other doubts, like the impact of peace fields and how I expected the System to transform our perspective, but decided against it. “Partially,” I admitted instead. “I have some other suspicions, but I don’t want to share them before I collect some data.” </p><p>“Why?” she asked, sounding put out.</p><p>“Because I trust you, and I don’t want to taint your thought process,” I said. Which had the added benefit of being somewhat true. “That way, once I collect the data, we can work on it without bias.” She nodded. “But, enough talk,” I said, pointing at the gate we had just arrived at, leading to the fifth floor. </p><p>I passed her the breathing filter, but she waved off. </p><p>“Don’t worry, you said that the heat neutralizes the poison. I can handle it.” </p><p>It looked like an unnecessary risk to me, but since she was the expert when it came to the dungeon threats and her own fire magic, I kept my mouth shut. </p><p>“It’s time for some action,” I said as I stepped through the gate.   </p>",

    "content": "<p>“That’s enough,” Maria finally called. “My head is actually aching.” </p><p>“Alright, but you have made excellent progress,” I said. It was not an exaggeration. We were on it for almost four hours, and in that short amount of time, she had made enough progress to make even the most overachieving student proud as long as they had managed to replicate it in a week. </p><p>A part of it was about the Intelligence helping her, but not all of it. Her effort and general understanding also helped. Intelligence might not be able to help her internalize her learnings, or even memorize any faster — that apparently required Wisdom, which her class lacked — but it still helped her to keep many things actively in her mind, helping her to contextualize things faster than I expected. </p><p>“Really, it doesn’t feel like it,” she said. “Nothing I learned was useful.” </p><p>“You can already read my equations, and help me do the statistical calculations. Alone, running those analyses would have taken me a month at minimum,” I said. </p><p>“Really?” she said. “A month?” </p><p>Eleanor intervened. “Sometimes, you’re forgetting the value of having five hundred intelligence.” </p><p>“I thought you were supposed to be a vase. Shut up,” Maria said, blushing slightly. </p><p>I watched them argue, split between feeling shocked and happy. Shocked, because five hundred intelligence was shockingly high. For me, receiving double stats was already impressive, and that was with Strength and Vitality, the two most common stats. </p><p>The happy part came from Eleanor casually revealing one of Maria’s important secrets, and Maria not caring the slightest. It was a great way to show acceptance, especially since it was clear that they had done so immediately. </p><p>“So, what’s next?” Eleanor asked. “Don’t tell me I have to sit down like this for another hour? Because I need to visit the town and make sure everything is in order.” </p><p>“Well, no,” I said as I checked the results of the calculations. “I have a few ideas, but I’m not sure if I could implement them based on the equipment here. I have to forge a sword using the Epic skill to test it, and for that, I need my real forge. It’ll take at least half a day, so you can do whatever you need, even catch your sleep.” </p><p>“Really? Half a day? Is it that far away?” Maria interjected. </p><p>“Not really. That part merely takes a few minutes at full speed,” I said. “It’s the forging that’ll take the time.” </p><p>“Then, how do you forge all those arrowheads?” Maria asked. </p><p>”It’s about how Epic Skills, at least the ones I have, work. It creates what I termed dense mana.” </p><p>”That, we know,” Maria said. “It’s how every Epic skill works. But, I don’t understand the difference it makes. Doesn’t the skill handle all of it?” she asked. </p><p>“It’s less about the Epic, and more about how I handle the forging —” I started, only to realize that, during the experimentation, I always absorbed mana first before creating the composite sword, as it was easier and more efficient as long as I forged just one or two items. ”Let me show you,” I said even as I dragged the crusher next to my tools, and rapidly forged ten swords, each taking merely half a minute, manipulating the mana indirectly. </p><p>“Is this how you managed to climb to Epic quickly,” Maria said, her eyebrows creased. </p><p>“Yeah. It’s even easier to use Mana Control in mana-dead locations. Crushers provide me with a lot of mana. Once using material above the skill limit lost its effectiveness, I was able to increase my skill by mass-producing gold daggers.” </p><p>“Ingenious,” Maria said. “Is this why you asked for platinum?” </p><p>“Yeah. Since there’s a clear link between copper, silver, and gold, it’s worth testing platinum as well.” </p><p>Maria frowned. “Too bad I don’t have any platinum coins remaining, we could have at least tested it.”</p><p>I nodded. “True. I wouldn’t say no to an even better skill.” </p><p>“Maybe we can try selling a few swords. I’m sure they’ll fetch a fortune,” Eleanor suggested. </p><p>“No —” Maria and I responded at the same time. She chuckled as she continued. “We don’t have the channels to sell them while keeping it a secret.” </p><p>“How about the auction house?” Eleanor asked.</p><p>“Not really a secure channel,” Maria said. “Any sufficiently strong family could pressure an auctioneer to reveal what is being sold. It’s not a good method to sell things secretively.” </p><p>“Alright. This is where we split, then,” I said. </p><p>Eleanor nodded as she started walking away. Maria didn’t follow. “Maria?” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“I don’t have anything to do in the town, so it’s a good time to kill some dungeon bosses and level up, don’t you think?” </p><p>“Are you sure?” Eleanor asked, sounding a little frustrated. Maria nodded. “Maybe I should come with you, just in case.” </p><p>“No need,” Maria dismissed. “I’m sure Devon could protect me in case of any danger arising.”</p><p>That made me snort. The sheer pressure she created in her anger was still vivid in my memory. And, since the dungeon was filled with mobile sources of mana, I couldn’t imagine her somehow falling against any threat. </p><p>“Still, better safe than sorry, right?” </p><p>“No. You mentioned that you have important things to handle,” Maria said. “We can’t neglect the town.” </p><p>Eleanor looked like she wanted to disagree, so I intervened. “Don’t worry. I’ll keep her safe … not that she needs it.” </p><p>“Exactly,” Maria said, smug. Eleanor looked frustrated at first, but as she looked at my face, her expression shifted to something close to mirth. </p><p>“Fine,” she said. “I’ll be back here in ten hours.” With that, she jumped away. </p><p>“Is she gone?” Maria asked. </p><p>“Yes,” I said even as I started putting the equipment in the cave I dug, making sure people couldn’t stumble on it easily. </p><p>“Good,” Maria said as she looked at the distance. “Dungeon Mist is really frustrating. I’m glad that I won’t have to deal with it for long.” </p><p>“Tell me about it,” I chuckled even as I put the last item into the cave. “Trying to explore the fourth floor while my range of vision dropped below twenty yards was an experience, especially with monsters popping out endlessly.” </p><p>“How did you handle it?” she said. </p><p>“I discovered that I could use the trees to push away the mist,” I said. </p><p>“That’s the cost of keeping everything a secret,” she said. “You have to discover everything on your own.” </p><p>I gave her a sheepish smile. “I have to admit I might have been a tad too obsessive with secrets,” I said. “In my defense, if the wrong person learns it, I might end up locked in a comfortable prison, working all day to create weapons for them.” That was if I didn’t end up in a shallow grave, but that was a tad too morbid, so I didn’t mention it directly. </p><p>Maria sighed. “I’m sure my conflict with my family didn’t fill you with confidence either,” she said. </p><p>“It did play a role,” I admitted. “Now, everything is in place,” I said. “We just need to swing by the outpost so I can tell Harold to start recruiting volunteers, and then we can go,” I said. “Now, do you have a way to travel fast?” </p><p>She paused longer than that question deserved, which surprised me. “I do, but it’s a bit wasteful in terms of mana. We don’t want to stop and replenish constantly.” </p><p>“Not a problem,” I said even as I pulled the cart from the cave. I could have pulled her like a rickshaw driver, but I had a better idea. “Do you mind helping me with the calculations?” </p><p>“What calculations?” she asked, but she still helped me with them. After resolving a few critical design questions, I was able to link a small steam engine to the cart through several gears and a metal chain. However, most of her calculations had been used to design a more efficient steam engine than the rest of the car. </p><p>Putting a ten-ton monstrosity into a car — even a facsimile of it — was too much.   </p><p>“Welcome to my automobile, milady,” I said, pointing at the ugly device that didn’t deserve the name of a car. </p><p>“A car, really?” she said. </p><p>“Well, if you squint hard enough,” I said. “It’s more like a steerable steam engine, it’ll be an absolutely horrid ride as it doesn’t have a suspension mechanism. For some reason, System has no spring recipe.” </p><p>“Really, why not?” </p><p>“Well, springs are surprisingly a modern invention. Maybe it doesn’t fit the medieval concept the System seems to be in love with,” I said. </p><p>Maria looked confused at my statement. “What do you mean?” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, I’m just complaining,” I said, not wanting to go on a tangent about how the System was potentially affecting our perspective. Not without some concrete evidence, at least. “Now, are you ready for the ride?” I asked. </p><p>“And, how are you going to bring the car down from the top of the hill,” she asked. </p><p>“Easy,” I said as I grabbed it, then used the Fleeting Steps to easily scale down the hill. Admittedly, carrying the car, faster than its full speed kind of showed its relative uselessness for this use case, but the ability to design one was more important than its function. </p><p>Maria chuckled as mana flared around her, and she floated down with ease, sitting next to me. “Alright. Show me how fast it goes, then,” she said. </p><p>I chuckled as I pressed the gas pedal, feeling playful. The car itself was just as slow and uncomfortable as I had expected, barely going thirty miles an hour, with a horrible fuel efficiency. But, what it represented was far more impressive. </p><p>Also, it was fun. At least, initially. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, what do we do?” Maria asked a while later, playing with my backup sword, examining the sword I created based on the epic skill. Once we calmed down, Eleanor started meditating once more, while I helped Maria to catch up with the secrets I had been hiding. </p><p>“I still want to keep my abilities a secret as much as possible,” I said. “We don’t know how the world will react, and I don’t want to test it before gaining enough power. I don’t want to get experimented on or captured.”  </p><p>“I would have disagreed, but…” she said, letting her voice linger. She didn’t say it, but what she was saying was clear. The fact that Thomas could pull such obvious attacks meant one of two things. Either he was relying on some kind of external support that meant he wasn’t afraid of her family’s response, or her family was implicitly supporting his actions. “Things will change once I break through the barrier.” </p><p>“And, I’ll do my best to help that,” I responded, and she smiled gratefully. “Whatever you need.” </p><p>“I need you to supply your guild members with actual weapons, and not just arrows. Can you do that?” she asked. </p><p>“Easily, but we need to be careful about it,” I said. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>“With the guilds retreating, your enemies believe that they have succeeded, at least partially. It’s to our benefit to let them maintain that belief. Instead, they will focus on blocking our acquisition of crossbows and intercept the delivery of the arrowheads.” </p><p>“And, since we can finally kill the bosses, we can catch any spy trying to infiltrate easily. Eleanor could defend the dungeon, while I stay in the town” she added, then looked at my crusher. “Especially if it’s not that hard to replicate your machines. If we can generate enough mana to let me show a fraction of my true capability..” </p><p>“And, how much mana do you require to fight near peak efficiency, thousands of points?” I asked. </p><p>She chuckled. “Oh, not even in that ballpark. But, it’s more complicated than just having mana. The distribution, the density, the nature of mana, the placement of other mages, all of them play a role,” she said. </p><p>I bit the question that I wanted to ask down. But, this time, it wasn’t about keeping it a secret, but more practical concerns. That question would release a thousand more, and the situation was still too complicated to indulge that way. “Yes, I can replicate them. It’s not that hard,” I said. “That way, storing the shells would have two functions.” </p><p>“We need to be careful. Releasing too much of the Dungeon Pollution outside can have dangerous effects on the wildlife. It’s a method that’s only fit for emergencies before it gets too much.” </p><p>“And, there’s no such risk in the dungeon, right?” I asked. </p><p>“Not unless one got truly excessive. Dungeons can absorb it back.” </p><p>Once again, I did my best to suppress the questions I wanted to ask. “Good. Then, as long as you think it’s alright, we can move a large group of Farmers to the second and third floors permanently and start hunting on a truly large scale.” </p><p>“But, what about keeping it a secret?” </p><p>“We can forbid them from going out,” I said, and immediately, she looked angry. </p><p>“I don’t condone imprisoning them,” she said. </p><p>I shook my head, but I smiled. It was good to see her caring about their status. Admittedly, not imprisoning hundreds of people in a forced labor camp was the bare minimum, but sometimes, one had to grade on a curve. From what I had seen, there were not many in the ranks of power who wouldn’t make that decision. </p><p>And, to be fair, I couldn’t even blame that on the System. We had been the same even before the System, with countless examples both ancient and modern. </p><p>“Don’t worry. We’re not going to imprison them. We’re going to recruit from a team of volunteers only, and explain to them that they will be on a six-month dangerous mission that they are forbidden to contact with anyone else, but with equally high rewards. Levels, Rare skills, and helping them to access better classes. Throw in a nice bonus of fifty gold at the end of the enlistment, and they will accept. It’ll be like a Navy mission. And, we can claim that we sent them to set another outpost in the wilderness.” </p><p>“Fine, it’s a good idea. But, what about supplying them with food.” </p><p>“That’s even easier. It’s an army of Farmers. Setting up a garden inside the dungeon is the easiest thing to do.” </p><p>She nodded, and we spent the next ten minutes discussing the details, focusing on information security over anything else, including how to store collected shells safely in the dungeon. Eleanor listened to the discussion, but she let me take the lead. </p><p>At first, it surprised me … only when I noticed her smirk, I realized what she was doing. She was simply unloading the job she hated the most to me, leaving me responsible for the logistic details, more than happy to have more time to focus on her skills. </p><p>Especially with the prospect of gaining the ability to use mana. </p><p>“Too bad that there’s no way to close doors for the dungeon,” I said. </p><p>“Actually there is,” Maria said. I looked at her expectantly. “Unfortunately, I don’t know how,” she admitted. “It’s too big of a secret even for our family. It took a fortune for us to hire someone capable of doing that for the family dungeon, and even then, we had to close the dungeon for a week for them to do whatever they needed to accomplish to close the excess gates.” </p><p>“Good to know,” I said. Hiring such a service was out of the question both in terms of price, and in terms of trying to keep secrets, but knowing that such a thing was possible was already a benefit. </p><p>In science, sometimes, knowing if something is possible is the biggest part of the discovery. Not that dungeon landscaping was anywhere near the list of priorities, but knowing more was always welcome. </p><p>“I think that’s enough about logistics,” Maria finally cut it off. “You clearly know what you’re doing. Let’s talk about the important things,” she said, her gaze turning to Eleanor. </p><p>I would have called it selfishness, but my most recent experience in combat refreshed my understanding of how important high-ranking combatants were. With her new sword alone, Eleanor could have dealt with everything but the weird transformed monsters. And, adding mana to her repertoire would increase her capabilities significantly. </p><p>Combined, she alone represented a bigger threat than all seven thousand Farmers even with their upgraded classes, so I couldn’t claim her sense of priorities was inaccurate. </p><p>“Yes, how to improve her skill to the mana variant,” I completed. </p><p>“Yes, let’s discuss,” she said, letting me take the point. I nodded in appreciation. Things would have been far more difficult if she insisted on leading the discussion. “We can say that there are three critical variables for my case. An act that triggered the skill, Health acting as a medium to let the skill register the action as my achievement, and a way for me to control the process.” </p><p>“The first two parts are obvious,” she said. “But the third…” </p><p>“Yeah, it was Analyze, a perk of my Repair Skill back then, that allowed me to trigger it. I don’t know if there’s a similar perk available for her skills.” </p><p>“Is that why she has to act like a vase —” Maria commented. </p><p>“Hey, I’m not deaf,” Eleanor interjected. </p><p>“Yes, but you’re supposed to ignore the external factors. That includes the juvenile, poorly thought-out insults.” </p><p>“Hey!” This time, it was Maria who exclaimed while Eleanor chuckled. </p><p>“To continue. Yes, that is indeed the reason. I don’t know if it’ll actually work, but it’s a pretty harmless experiment.” </p><p>“Of course. Only an idiot experiments on herself if there’s a risk,” Maria commented. I couldn’t help but blush when she said that, which made her eyes tighten. “Is there anything you want to tell me?” she asked, her tone sharp. </p><p>“Well, no,” I said. Her eyes tightened. “I don’t want to say it,” I added. Maria said nothing while I avoided her gaze. I felt less like a capable genius, and more like a naughty child. Admittedly, it was less about the sense of authority she radiated, and more about the enormity of my own mistake. </p><p>There was no good way to admit that I almost killed myself during a poorly designed experiment — if it even deserved to be called that. “I might have … rotated my Meditation skill in reverse.” Her eyes widened. “When it was still below twenty-five.” </p><p>She gasped. “How the hell are you still alive,” she gasped. </p><p>“I have to admit, double vitality did most of the work of keeping me alive,” I said, which didn’t help Maria’s sharp gaze. “But, I learned my lesson. I promise,” I added. </p><p>“We will see,” she said, her tone suggesting that she had just appointed herself as the safety officer for my experiments. I had to admit, it was not a bad existence. To be honest, it was a required position. </p><p>“Let me show what I gathered until this moment,” I said even as I pulled the clay tablets that I used to take notes.</p><p>“What is this?” she asked, confused. </p><p>“They are the notes I took on the interaction between her vitality attacks and mana,” I said. “I’m trying to create a sword that will overlap the mana component with her vitality attack, combining it into one devastating hit that would hopefully trigger her skill to —” </p><p>“No, I don’t mean what’s the function. I mean, what is it?” </p><p>“Oh, that,” I said. “It’s a mathematical model of the interaction between the Health and mana components, but it’s an ongoing process. Unfortunately, without any literature, I was able to access, I had to invent some new symbols, and most of the models are pretty esoteric.” </p><p>“And, this actually works?” she asked. </p><p>“Depends,” I said. </p><p>“Depends on what?” she asked. “It either works, or it doesn’t, right?” </p><p>“Not exactly. There are many functions for mathematical models. Accurately recording the available observation is one of them, predicting future behavior is another,” I explained. It was quite a bit of simplification, ignoring several use cases, but I had to stay practical. “It works well enough to record what I can see, but actually predicting the behavior of alternate cases requires some work.” </p><p>“What’s the benefit of it?” she asked. </p><p>“How about sharing exactly what I can detect with my Advanced Observe Perk whenever Eleanor uses an attack, be it Health or mana?” </p><p>She paused for a moment, her eyes widening. “Teach me,” she said, her tone conveying her enthusiasm. </p><p>“With pleasure,” I said and started explaining to her every symbol I had used, regardless of whether I had invented it or not, as it was not fair to expect her to know esoteric symbols I dug out from areas like functional analysis and information theory. </p><p>A detailed primer class was in order… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I waited for Maria at the peak of the hill, ready to work on the next set of swords I would give Eleanor, just another little thing to keep her mood up. Eleanor could see me thanks to the bosses we had hunted, but Maria could not. </p><p>A little perfunctory, maybe, but doing my best was a good idea when facing a mercurial woman who could literally kill me with her gaze. </p><p>When they arrived at the bottom of the hill, Eleanor presented her arm. Maria grabbed, and then with a jump, Eleanor cleared the whole hill. “Hey, boss. Long time no see,” I said, trying to sound casual. From the way Eleanor winced, I guessed that I wasn’t particularly successful. </p><p>She looked at me, her gaze tightening. Then, she looked at Eleanor. “I’m guessing that you have skipped a few details in your story,” Maria said. </p><p>“Well, not exactly,” Eleanor answered. Maria’s expression tightened.“But, I might have neglected to mention just how close we came to losing if it wasn’t for the surprise Devon was keeping.” </p><p>“You almost died!” Maria gasped. </p><p>The shift was incredible, and scary. Up until now, Maria had always been the cheerful boss. Yes, she was arrogant, but it had been the spoiled kind of arrogance that I had gotten used to from my old job, falling somewhere between annoying and charming depending on the day. That hadn’t truly changed even when she helped me level up. </p><p>But, the moment Eleanor admitted how close she got to dying, she lost that cheeriness. Her presence shifted … changed, a pressure radiating from her. It wasn’t like Thomas, using Charisma. That was an unnatural, insidious feeling. </p><p>It was different for Maria. The pressure felt like the sudden turn of the weather right before a record-breaking storm, only this time, the pressure was truly suffocating. It was already intimidating before air started churning around her, surrounded by a faint shimmer of heat. </p><p>I was glad that she was looking at Eleanor. Eleanor avoided her gaze, shuffling on her feet. “Well, I didn’t expect them to somehow bring six ballistas without alerting us. They set up an ambush. But, nothing happened. Devon made sure of it.” </p><p>“Six ballistas?” she said, her voice tightening. “And, you didn’t mention them before.” </p><p>“I didn’t want to talk about that in public,” Eleanor said. Behind Maria, I nodded at her in appreciation. She was doing her best to present my secret as an absolute boon, which I appreciated. She could have easily twisted the situation badly just by shifting a few words around. </p><p>That sword was a well-deserved reward. </p><p>Maria looked like she wanted to continue, but after glancing at me, she decided against it. “We will talk about it later,” she declared. Then, she turned at me, her gaze sharp, assessing, reminding me that, for all her frivolity, she still had a sharp mind unrelated to her stat distribution. “It must be an interesting secret to play a decisive role in a battle with six ballistas.” </p><p>I thought about mentioning that I managed to hunt one of the gargantuan insects and expanded my range of vision, which was the method I had discovered the ambush. It would be the correct answer to her question, but I doubted trying to hide behind the technicalities would have helped. </p><p>Instead, I raised my hand. </p><p>[-20 Mana]</p><p>The sense of tension around her dissipated, but only because she was truly shocked. “How?” she gasped, looking surprised. Then, her gaze tightened, and she started to look actually angry. The shift surprised me, and then she spoke. “Who bribed you you bribe with that skill stone?” she growled, and the pressure returned, this time with revenge. </p><p>She didn’t need to mention her thought process for me to guess what happened. Immediately after an ambush to Eleanor, she must have been thinking that I had been bribed to ambush Eleanor, only to change sides at the last second. A reasonable conclusion. Utterly wrong. But reasonable.</p><p>“Calm down and listen,” Eleanor interrupted, probably coming to the same conclusion. </p><p>“I’m not in the mood to listen to a traitor,” she started, and the opening we were in actually started to get hot. </p><p>“Do you remember the time you helped me to experiment on how to forge mana alloys,” I commented. </p><p>The comment was random enough to distract her from her anger. “Yes, but —” she started. </p><p>“And, did you ever wonder why I didn’t ask your help for the same experiment again?” I continued, careful to keep my hands out in the open. </p><p>“I assumed because you learned all you needed from it,” she said. </p><p>“In a way,” I said, which didn’t help her confusion at all. “And, I’m sure you know once a class skill is pushed to the maximum, it evolves automatically.” </p><p>“Not automatically, there are quite a few conditions, but yes,” Maria said, which surprised me. I had assumed it to be automatic. That statement alone triggered dozens of questions, but I had a feeling that it wasn’t the best time to ask them. </p><p>“And, did you know that class skills can also transform when you achieve something out of context,” I added. “Something like actually managing to forge mana alloy without having any Mana?” </p><p>That made her pause. “You can’t be serious,” she said. “Experimenting with mana, without having Essence, is a fool’s errand. It’s impossible.” </p><p>“Not exactly,” I said. “I managed to use my vitality as a catalyst to somehow link with mana, which helped me to create a mana alloy. A garbage one, I have to admit, but it was enough to trigger my skill.” </p><p>She frowned. “Impossible. The interference alone —” she started, but I cut her off. </p><p>“Which is not exactly a problem in a mana-dead location,” I corrected. Technically, my experiments showed that it was merely mana-sparse rather than mana-dead, but it was not the time to fix that particular misconception. </p><p>“It’s not possible,” she said, dazed and confused. </p><p>“Which part?” I asked, feeling better. A confused Maria was a much better alternative than a murderous one who was under the mistaken impression that I had sold her best friend to her enemies for an extremely rare skill stone. “The part where I have managed to jump two rarity levels with one experiment, or the part where I managed to manipulate mana without Essence.” </p><p>“Well…” she said, looking dazed. </p><p>I grabbed one of the swords I created for Eleanor and walked to her, which was also a small test. She didn’t even flinch as I approached her with a bladed weapon, which was good news in terms of her trust. I flipped the sword and passed it to her. “Try it,” I said. </p><p>“Why?” she asked. </p><p>“Just push your mana through it. You’ll see.” </p><p>She did so, and a glow covered the sword. It wasn't a particularly stable glow, the edges of it were fraying. But, it was still a mana attack. “Impossible,” Maria gasped as she examined the way her mana reacted. </p><p>“Well, yes,” I said, and couldn't help but feel smug. At least, for the first few seconds. As she continued to examine the sword, the frayed, fragile glow around the sword straightened into a perfect edge, which then lengthened, its brightness not something I could match even if I put all the mana I could store behind it. </p><p>Then, she turned that into a ranged attack, flying away. A trick that took me days to perfect, and she learned it in seconds, without even trying. </p><p>No, I wasn’t jealous … much. </p><p>“And, this happened before you reached level twenty-five, so you got a new class,” she said. </p><p>I nodded. “Yes, a class called Mana Blacksmith. It gives one essence for every two levels,” I said. </p><p>“That’s not much, is it?” she said, looking a bit surprised. </p><p>This time, it was Eleanor that spoke. ”Not everyone is as perfect as you, Miss Legendary,” Eleanor teased, making Maria blush. “I will be happy to get one point every four levels.” </p><p>I chuckled alongside them, realizing that the biggest threat had passed. I had a feeling that being mistaken for a traitor helped quite a bit, channeling the worst of the betrayal Maria might have felt for keeping secrets. </p><p>After all, what was a small secret compared to such a heinous crime? </p><p>Maria nodded for a moment, then her eyes widened. “Wait, what? What do you mean?” </p><p>Eleanor nodded eagerly. “Exactly what you’re thinking. We’re trying to copy his method to see if I can somehow get the mana variant as well. We weren’t able to make much progress yet, but we were only trying for a few hours.“ </p><p>Maria cut her off with a raised hand, her gaze locking on me. “You’re helping her with mana?” she asked. Her voice was calm, but I could catch an undercurrent of excitement. “Is it possible?” </p><p>“Frankly, I don’t know,” I said. “But, there’s no reason for it to be impossible. I already have several paths in mind, from forcefully melding her vitality attacks with mana, to meditation.” </p><p>Maria’s eyes widened as she turned to Eleanor. “You … meditating?” she said, followed by a chuckle. “That I need to see.” </p><p>“Oh, it’s just as amusing as you think it is,” I commented, joining her in laughter. It would have been an excellent, calculated moment to join her, and use humor to deflect any remaining frustration she might have been feeling toward me. </p><p>Luckily, it was not necessary, as Eleanor trying to meditate was one of the funniest things I had been dealing with for a long time — not that there was much competition considering most of my time was spent locked in the dungeon, hunting monsters. </p><p>“Shut up,” Eleanor grumbled as she crossed her arms, turning away from us. Maria caught my gaze, and we started to laugh even louder. And, soon, despite her grumblings, Eleanor joined as well. </p><p>It felt good… </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>We spent the next three hours working on the same issue. I forged a set of swords, she practiced with them, and while I worked on the data, she meditated. Unfortunately, for every five minutes of practice, I was spending an hour doing calculations. </p><p>I never wanted a computer more. Doing the calculations by hand was truly torture. Even the most basic calculations to lay down the basic statistical data like standard deviation and correlation took a considerable amount of time, especially since I had to split the dataset in different ways to identify some of the variables. Doing the same basic calculations again and again was very boring. </p><p>However, it was true that misery loves company. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one struggling. Eleanor was more of the same. As I watched her, she shuffled in discomfort, meditating as she tried to somehow attune herself to mana. She was a woman who was used to resolving her problems through action, not inaction.</p><p>“Take a deeper breath —” I started.</p><p>It worked the opposite way. She exhaled sharply, the tension in her shoulders betraying her frustration. “I’m trying,” she muttered, cracking one eye open to glare at me. “This isn’t exactly my thing. Can’t I just kill monsters until I get a new perk like you did.”</p><p>I chuckled. “Technically we can, but we only have two shots in that. If you’re willing to waste that opportunity…” </p><p>“Fine, be reasonable,” she said as she closed her eyes again, her jaw set in a stubborn way that told me she was far from giving up. Unfortunately, it was also not helpful … or at least, I assumed it was not. I leaned back, watching her intently as she once again pointed at one of the four pipes. </p><p>Wrong one. Again. </p><p>I didn’t feel like she was making any progress. Unfortunately, I had no idea whether it was the wrong method, or it was the lack of time. I sighed as I returned to my calculations. </p><p>“How about we take a break,” she asked a minute later. “I don’t think I have sat down like that for a long time. A visit to the town is a good way to stretch my legs.” </p><p>“Sure, a little movement would do you good.”</p><p>“Do you want to come?” </p><p>“Tempting, but I should visit the outpost instead. I trust Harold to keep things under control, but my presence should make it easier. We don’t want them panicking.” </p><p>“Good point,” she said as she stood up, but didn’t start walking immediately. “If Maria returns, should I have a talk with her alone?” </p><p>“That’s going to be a fun talk,” I said. </p><p>“Yeah,” Eleanor said. “She has a tendency of … overreacting when surprised.” </p><p>I was tempted to ask her to handle that discussion. Very much so. Unfortunately, I feel like I owed Maria enough to have that talk face-to-face. “No,” I still said. “I’m the one that chose to keep it a secret. The best thing I can do is to be the one to explain it to her.” </p><p>“Do you think that’s a good idea?” </p><p>“Hell no,” I answered, making her chuckle. “But I still need to do it.” </p><p>“Your call,” she said as she prepared to jump. </p><p>“But, I won’t say no if you soften her up a bit,” I added. She just smiled before she hauled herself away with a big jump, pushing herself faster than I expected, but rather than picking a direct path, she landed, and started killing the monsters on her path.  </p><p>She must have been even more frustrated than I had realized. Suddenly, I felt pity for the wildlife around the town. </p><p>I went the opposite path, approaching my guild outpost. I expected a tight, tense environment. I trusted Harold, but with all but one other guild pulling back from the dungeon immediately after the mysterious death of multiple guild masters and more than a hundred members, it was the most rational outcome. </p><p>But, as I got closer enough to distinguish their mood, I realized I had misread the situation significantly. Instead of the dark and morose atmosphere I had been expecting, I met with people running around with purpose. Calling them cheerful would have been a stretch, but being excited and dedicated certainly would fit the bill. </p><p>The people saluted me as I approached, and I gestured for them to stand down. As I approached, Harold arrived from the gate, probably alerted by the guards about my arrival. “Guild master,” he greeted as well. </p><p>“Follow me,” I said as I moved some distance away from the crowd. </p><p>“Sir, may I ask what had happened in the dungeon? The official news says that—” </p><p>“I know what exactly the official news says,” I said, as I was the one who suggested the official story about another dungeon swarm trigger, this time enhanced. It was an obviously fake story, but there was no real point in examining it. “A few people tried to assassinate me and Eleanor, and failed. Simple as that,” I said. </p><p>“It’s good to see everything is well, sir,” he said. </p><p>“What about the guild?” I asked. “They look enthusiastic. I expected them to be stressed out after all the deaths.” </p><p>He chuckled. “The opposite. The other guilds had been posturing a lot for a long time, so they were expecting the attack. Now that those posturing guilds suddenly … encountered a misfortune, they are even more confident about their position.” </p><p>“Really? They were expecting to be attacked, and still volunteered?” I asked, surprised by it. After all, it was not a simple decision. For me, it took almost three years to finally change my attitude. </p><p>He shrugged. “They are Farmers. They know that this is the best opportunity they have to level up, and actually developing proficiency in a combat skill is a bonus. Combined, it’s the best offer they could get.” </p><p>“Still, all of them…” </p><p>Harold smiled. “Sorry to be harsh, sir, but you don’t know what it's like to have a production class. For them, any chance to level up is a treasure. Either they need to pay a fortune for dungeon access, working for a whole year to just visit it once or twice, or they need to join an expedition. And, the ones that hire Farmers are more likely to use them as disposable scouts than anything else.” </p><p>“Good point,” I said, smiling at his assumption that I didn’t know the plight of the production classes. But he still had a point. Even without my most recent bout of luck, my situation had never been that bad. Blacksmiths were not the luckiest class, but our situation was nowhere as bad as the Farmers. </p><p>For a moment, I was surprised by the general attitude, but then remembered every Farmer that had joined the camp was a volunteer, determined to seek their fortune. In such a situation, death was to be expected … and there was nothing if that expected death visited their enemies rather than them. </p><p>“Would you spend some time with them, sir? I’m sure your presence will be appreciated.” </p><p>“I can’t stay for long, but give me a tour of the latest changes,” I asked. Since they seemed to believe that I was responsible for their deaths — not wholly accurate since those transformed men were responsible for most of the mayhem, but the difference was academic — showing them that I was walking around strongly should help. </p><p>As Harold guided me through the encampments on both floors, I was already making plans to scale our operations up. Now that the secret was finally out and I didn’t need to hide the truth from Eleanor, I could actually arm them with proper anti-corrosive alloys rather than the weak variant that only worked on arrows. </p><p>With a ten-foot spear and proper plate armor, even farmers should be able to dominate the first three floors with ease, especially if we set another beachhead on the fourth floor, and use the water to grow the trees fully and create safe zones to avoid the occasional giant variant. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t hurry to implement that, for two reasons. First, I wanted to finish the experiment with Eleanor. I could already help them by bringing their Nurture higher, which would trigger better classes. Even a partial stat bonus like Strength would have been a treasure. </p><p>As for unlocking their Essence… </p><p>I had to actively stop myself from imagining that. I didn’t even know if it was possible for Eleanor, let alone integrating that at a mass scale. And, more importantly, I had a bigger impediment facing me. Maria’s reaction was still a mystery, with a whole spectrum of possibilities from glad to furious.</p><p>It was also why I wasn’t using the time to forge a thousand spears to arm them. I wanted to ask for Maria’s ‘approval’. I knew what her answer would be, but sometimes, letting the leaders make the obvious decisions was the best way to keep their mood upbeat after doing something to challenge their authority.   </p><p>Luckily, Maria wasn’t a particularly invested leader, so I didn’t expect that to be too big of a problem. The personal sense of betrayal was the likelier reaction, the fact that I saved Eleanor’s life would be enough to prevent her from feeling betrayed. </p><p>Should… Hopefully… Because, I had just seen Eleanor at a distance, accompanied by a robed figure, her redhead distinct even from a distance. </p><p>“Make sure to keep an eye on everything,” I said to Harold as I started walking away. “I might not be around for a while.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“How do we start,” she asked as she drew her sword, her smile bright. </p><p>“By sheathing that back,” I responded. </p><p>“What, why?” she said. “You promised that we are going to focus on this above anything else except an actual emergency. There’s none.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle even as I watched her attitude. “We are, but there are two things to take note of. First, we’re going to start with a lesson on how I achieved what I did, so that you have a general idea of direction. Then …” I added, forcing a serious expression. “I’m not sure I’m supposed to say it.” </p><p>“Is it bad?” she asked, tense.</p><p>“Yes, it’s terrible,” I said, barely keeping a smile down as I reached to the pile and threw her a sword. “This is the sword that you’re going to use.” </p><p>She already had a dubious expression on her face, but it transformed even further when she grabbed the hilt. Her expression of shock finally broke my determination not to laugh, and I fell down chuckling. “Alright, the joke is over. Give me the real sword,” she grumbled. </p><p>“It’s not a joke,” I said, but she just looked at me with disbelief. “At least, the sword is not the joke part. Try using the simplest attack you have used. You’ll understand what I mean.” </p><p>Her expression didn’t shift until she had attacked once, and even then, her expression turned even stonier. “You’re serious,” she said as she realized the general gist of the design. I nodded. “But, this is garbage. Poorly balanced, structurally weak, unwieldy. It’s not even a sword.” </p><p>“It’s enough of a sword to trigger your skill, which is all we need,” I said with a shrug. “That’s something you have to deal with. At least, you don’t have to start it immediately, as we need to start with a lesson on theory.” </p><p>That didn’t alleviate her frustration in any way. “I had forgotten about that part,” she complained. “Can’t we start with using this,” she said, raising the composite sword. “I promise I’m not going to complain.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, we can’t do that. I need to understand how your skill works, and what perks you have to develop a better approach.” </p><p>“What does it have to do with the Perks?” she asked. </p><p>“It’s how I achieved my own upgrade,” I said, giving her a summary of how I achieved my own breakthroughs. “As you see, without Analyze creating a bridge to sense mana, I couldn’t have done it.” </p><p>“But, I don’t have a Perk like that,” she said, looking panicked. “Does it mean that I can’t use your method?” </p><p>“I’m hopeful that we can achieve it,” I said. “We just need to make sure to create a basis. And, even without a Perk, I have some ideas that can be useful.” </p><p>“Fine,” she said. “I have three Perks, one upgraded, two baseline. The upgraded perk allows me to read and react to melee attacks better. One of the normal ones allows me to spend less Health on each attack, and the other increases my mobility.” </p><p>“Doesn’t sound ideal,” I admitted without sugarcoating. “But, it doesn’t mean we’re helpless. Let’s start with something simple,” I said. “I’ll manipulate the mana to match your skill.” </p><p>“Would that work?” </p><p>“Most likely not,” I responded. “I would be shocked if it did.” </p><p>She looked confused. “Why are we trying it if you don’t expect it to work?” </p><p>“Because there are certain basics I want to try, and it seems like the quick way to test some assumptions,” I said, and once again attached the chain to the hilt of her sword. “Now, the same attack,” I said even as I pushed mana through the chain, filling the gap. </p><p>Luckily, Repair allowed me to control mana just as well, meaning I could do so while using Advanced Observation. She used her vitality attack … only for it to cut through the mana, dispersing it. “Was it supposed to do something?” she said. “It felt the same.” </p><p>“No. It’s just a test. One of many,” I said even as I started taking notes on a clay tablet. </p><p>“What’s this? A spell?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I said, but chuckled. Her confusion was understandable. I was trying to take notes about the way vitality and mana interacted, which was a complicated topic. It was more symbols than numbers. Half of these symbols were esoteric mathematical symbols unfamiliar to anyone without a doctorate on the topic, and the other half, I had invented during my experimentation. “It’s a way to record how my mana reacted to your vitality attack as a function of various stimuli.”</p><p>“Why are you not using a paper?” </p><p>“Habit. The paper doesn’t keep well on the fourth floor. This symbol, for example, refers to the fluidity of mana,” I responded as I continued writing, expecting a follow-up question, excited to share my findings, which turned out to be a mistake. </p><p>Eleanor stopped paying attention the moment I finished my explanation, her interest wandering away. Instead, she turned her attention at the entrance, watching the movement of the guards, and the few guild members that stuck around. </p><p>I let it pass. She was not someone academically inclined, and trying to force the issue was useless. Instead, I focused on running the experiment repeatedly, asking her to shift to the other swords, trying to get a general sense of what was going on. </p><p>Then, I ran the whole set several more times, this time after putting her into that enclosed room and pumping it with various densities of mana, trying to understand how the density affected it. </p><p>“That’s it,” I called her. </p><p>“What do you mean, that’s it? You can’t be serious,” Eleanor said. </p><p>I sighed in amusement. “I mean, we have to stop for a while, so I can do some rudimentary calculations and understand how your attacks react with vitality, compare it with my own attacks, and see if I can get a generalized relationship.” </p><p>“Sounds complicated,” she said. </p><p>“Well, you’re not wrong,” I said, which was an understatement. For all intents and purposes, I was trying to invent a whole new technological path, which was the kind that ordinarily took centuries. Without the System allowing me to skip some critical steps, I could have never had even a hope of succeeding. </p><p>“What do I do in the meantime?” she asked. </p><p>“I don’t know. The calculations would probably take several hours, and there’s nothing you can work on —” I started, only to pause as a wild idea occurred to me. </p><p>I wondered if it was possible to sense mana without Essence. At face value, it sounded absurd, but maybe it wasn’t a waste of time. After all, Strength, Dexterity, Vitality, Intelligence, Perception, and Wisdom; every single of them correspond to things that exist in the human body. Even Charisma did, after a fashion. </p><p>Was it possible for Essence to be the only exception? Well, yes, but it was still worth the effort. But, if that was the case, was it possible to leverage it somewhat?  Maybe I could reverse-engineer meditation somewhat, at least in general terms? Would it be possible to break down the concept of —</p><p>“Devon,” she said as she shook me. “You haven’t said anything for the last fifteen minutes. Are you alright?” </p><p>“Sorry, I just had an idea,” I said, smiling sheepishly. “Sometimes, I do that.” </p><p>“Anything you would like to share?” </p><p>“Actually, yes. Meditation,” I answered. “I have an idea. It has a low chance of working, but we can multitask.” </p><p>“But, I don’t have the skill,” she said. </p><p>“I know, but I’m not entirely sure the skill, or the stat is necessary. After all, farmers don’t have Strength, but it doesn’t keep them from lifting rocks, right?”  </p><p>“If you think it’ll help,” Eleanor said, quick to accept the modified plan. “Now, what do I do?” </p><p>“Let’s start with something simple. I’ll set the crusher, and also create four pipes, mana only flowing out from one of them. Just close your eyes, and try to point one whenever you feel something.” </p><p>“Why four pipes?” </p><p>“It’s a classical blind experimental setup,” I said. “That will allow me to statistically establish that you’re not making a random choice.” </p><p>She shrugged again. “You’re the expert,” she said, showing her disinterest in the finer parts of the experimental design. “Anything else I need to do?” </p><p>“No,” I said even as I made the necessary additions to the crusher, and created the setup. She sat cross-legged on the ground, her eyes closed, trying to calm down. </p><p>I smiled as I watched her fidget. She could easily sit down and handle a meeting, but meditating meant she had nothing to distract herself from it. Her brows furrowed in concentration as she tried to force herself to meditate. </p><p>“Take deep breaths, and don’t focus on the act too much. Just let your mind wander while counting your breaths,” I said. “Meditation is not a competition, but an inner introspection. There’s no hurry,” As I spoke, she opened her eyes, looking at me suspiciously. “What’s wrong?” </p><p>“It’s weird,” she said. </p><p>“It can be at the beginning. But, spend enough time, and it’ll get more familiar.” </p><p>She smiled. “No, not the meditation part. Focusing on the inner self, staying calm, vague instructions… And, since when are you telling other people not to hurry?” </p><p>“Well…” I said as I avoided her gaze, finding myself blushing. “I might have been repeating the way my therapist guided me during my sessions, back before the Cataclysm.” </p><p>“And, did it work?” </p><p>“It wasn’t completely useless,” I said, though even that was a generous description. Eleanor’s chuckles showed that she realized the same, but she still closed her eyes, which was all I could ask for. Then, after a few seconds, she opened her eyes. “What now?” </p><p>“Do you mind answering a question? A personal one?” I nodded. “Why do you mention the pre-Cataclysm world so much? You’re the only one that I know that mentions it regularly.” </p><p>“That’s not the correct question,” I said. “The real one is, why is everyone so determined to act like the System existed for centuries rather than three years?” Eleanor’s eyebrows furrowed once again, but I could see that my statement didn’t resonate with her. “Just chalk it to me being nostalgic,” I said instead. “For now, let’s focus on your meditation, and let’s see if we can surprise Maria with it.” </p><p>“Good point,” she said as she closed her eyes again, leaving me to ignore that niggling question and focus on the practical problems. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 86</p><p>“What do you see?” Eleanor whispered two minutes later, as we stood a distance away from them. Finding them hadn’t been too difficult, as they retreated back to the canyon they previously wanted to use as an ambush spot. </p><p>“As far as I can tell, all of them are here, and they look tense,” I said. “My best guess is, they are afraid of another attack.” </p><p>“Good. They should be,” she added even as her sword — well, technically my sword, but the more I watched her, the more I was convinced that it wouldn’t matter — flashed, and another monster died without making a sound. </p><p>Her ability to kill the monsters silently was one reason we had managed to stay concealed despite our relative closeness. Two hundred yards wasn’t close, but it wasn’t that distant either. Luckily, without their scouts, it was much harder for them to hear anything. </p><p>Also, it helped that most of the monsters in the immediate vicinity had already been killed during either the earlier swarms or their return, and the few that remained fell to her attacks easily, her vitality attacks cutting the monsters’ shells like butter. </p><p>“I would have said that we should return to the first floor and get some reinforcements, but I don’t like their attitude,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. </p><p>“They are tense, but not really fearful. It feels like they are waiting for something.” </p><p>“Maybe reinforcements?” she asked. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, then paused, thinking for a moment. “Actually, it might be risky, but I have an idea,” I said. She looked at me questioningly. “I need you to attack them, but retreat just as quickly.” </p><p>She smirked. I was glad that I was not the target of that smirk. “Well, I was looking for an excuse to test my sword properly,” she said. </p><p>Her unilateral declaration would have been annoying if the sword was actually a rare commodity, but considering I merely require half a day to forge another, it turned into something endearing. “Unfortunately, no,” I said to her. “You need to use your old sword.” </p><p>“Why?” she complained, her tone uncharacteristically childish. Luckily, she had the presence of mind to not shout. </p><p>“Because we don’t want to give out precious information during a probing attack,” I explained. Despite not having the strategic awareness of a general, even I could recognize the fact that, with the System in play, every battle was like a puzzle game. A tense, deadly puzzle game where both parties held certain cards, and a surprise could be the difference between a win and a loss. </p><p>“Fine,” Eleanor responded. “I’m going to attack first, then retreat, right?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes, just wait for my signal,” I said. </p><p>“Which is what?” she asked. </p><p>“I’ll attack them by throwing spears from the other side,” I said. “Once you hear the cries of pain, attack unless I shout for you to stop, but be careful not to be surrounded,” I said. “We need to make it look like a botched assault. And, I’ll smash a rock with my hammer when it’s time to retreat, which should still trigger a swarm. That way, you can retreat easily.” </p><p>“Is it really necessary?” she asked. </p><p>“Humor me,” I responded. “It’s suspicious that they are staying in place rather than trying to escape. It doesn’t make sense.” </p><p>“Maybe they are over-confident. They might believe that, as long as they are in a group, we can’t defeat them without reinforcements. Not that we will have any worthwhile support. Maria is not in town today, and none of the guards would be of use.”</p><p>“Assuming some of them weren’t bribed by them in the first place,” I commented, and Eleanor nodded. “They would probably have agents at the dungeon entrance, ready to warn them if that was the case,” I theorized. </p><p>“That’s probably why they are overconfident, and think that they can survive. We have the advantage, we should press on,” she said, and then her smile turned vicious. “With my new sword, I could carve through their armor easily, so their tactic wouldn’t work.”  </p><p>“Still, if there’s one thing I learned from chess or other games, it is that assuming the enemy is making a mistake without checking can backfire badly. And, since they already expect an ambush, we’re not really losing a big opportunity,” I said. </p><p>I was glad that I had taken the opportunity to destroy the ballistas, or such a probing attack would have been impossible. </p><p>Too bad they had already collected the wrecked ballista. Currently, they were at the side of the canyon, discarded like garbage. Their enchantments were still in place, and I could repair them just as easily as I destroyed them. </p><p>I should have dragged one of them away when I had the chance. A pity. Just as I was about to move, my instincts, which had been used intensively during my days as a professor, had tingled in warning. “Try to be on the side of caution. It’s just a probing attack. No making excuses to test your new sword,” I warned her. </p><p>“I wouldn’t do that,” she hissed, but I was sure that I didn’t imagine the guilty look on her face. </p><p>“Then, we have no problem, and I don’t need to threaten you with not forging you a matching dagger,” I smirked back, enjoying her affronted expression. Now that we were on a more equal footing, she was surprisingly easy to tease. </p><p>I carefully circled the group before I once again pulled my atlatl, and released three short spears in quick succession. I aimed all three to their heads, as just because it was a probing attack didn’t mean I was against thinning their numbers a bit. </p><p>Unfortunately, ranged attacks were much harder to land without a battle to distract them. The first spear was the closest it came to hitting the target, but even then, the guard was able to deflect it with a shield. The other two missed completely. </p><p>Meanwhile, from the other side, Eleanor charged silently and engaged with four guards. I expected the rest to respond immediately. Instead, the guards retreated back like they were overwhelmed. It was an obvious bait. </p><p>My attention was grabbed by Thomas’ bodyguard, who, rather than joining the fight, had moved away from Eleanor before he pulled some kind of device and activated it. The resulting mana flare reminded me of the other attempts to communicate through dungeon floors, turning into a straight blue line before it stretched away … only significantly more intense. </p><p>Following that, he went forward, and called for Eleanor. “It’s fun to see a familiar face,” he called loudly as he removed his helmet. Too bad he was too deep into his camp for me to hit him with a spear. </p><p>“Georg,” Eleanor called even as she stopped fighting and took a few steps back. “I should have known it was you from the smell.” </p><p>“Well that's uncalled for, Eleanor,” he said. “Just because we are working for different bosses doesn’t mean we need to be rude to each other. It’s just business.” Eleanor snarled mockingly. “We’re not here to hurt you, but to kill an enemy of my master. We were just trying to keep you distracted.” </p><p>As they spoke, I circled the group once again, standing behind Eleanor in a position where she could see me, but the others could not, and gestured for her to continue talking, hoping that they would reveal something. </p><p>“You were just trying to kill my ally. Oh, that makes things so much better,” Eleanor snarled in annoyance. “I should be thankful to your snotty master, then?” </p><p>For the first time, Georg looked angry. No, he was furious. A religious zealot fighting with another one style furious. He clearly took the insult to Thomas personally. </p><p>It didn’t surprise me too much. I already had enough evidence to conclude that Charisma had an insidious effect. And, Georg had probably spent the majority of his time glued to Thomas, constantly under his Charisma. Add in the fact that he followed his orders daily, which was a good way to foster loyalty and dependence even without mixing in a supernatural pseudo-drug like Charisma. </p><p>I had a feeling that it would be useful. However, while he might have been zealous enough to defend his master's honor, that didn't mean he was foolish enough to rush forward recklessly.</p><p>“If you insist on intervening, I’ll treat you as an enemy as well,” Georg said in a chippy tone, acting like Eleanor wasn’t the target for assassination in the first place. It wasn’t convincing, but he was too angry to act in a convincing manner. </p><p>“Like you weren’t going to before,” Eleanor scoffed as she rushed forward to attack again, going further into the formation than I had requested. I signaled her, but she ignored it, moving deeper into the formation, where the enemy could surround her if they wished. I tightened the grip on my hammer, ready to rush forward if needed…</p><p>But, to my surprise, they only defended even as Eleanor pushed her luck. The reinforcements they had called must have been even stronger than I feared for them to miss such a golden opportunity. </p><p>Facing an unbreakable defensive line, Eleanor pulled back less than a minute later, and returned to my side. Together, we retreated enough not to fear them eavesdropping. “Did you find what you were looking for?” she asked. </p><p>“I might have found even more,” I responded. “They called for reinforcements, and I feel that it’s not good news.” </p><p>“What do we do? Retreat?” she said, her distaste clear. </p><p>While that was a tempting idea, there was one problem. My guild was still there. They hadn't targeted it yet, probably because it was just a bunch of farmers, which made them a low-value target, not worth risking the ambush. But, if we tried to retreat … they had already shown that they had no problem killing hundreds of unrelated people just to inconvenience Maria. </p><p>“No,” I said, my voice sharp enough to surprise myself. “They still don’t know I can see through the mist. We go and intercept their reinforcements.” </p><p>“That’s more like it,” Eleanor smiled viciously. Any other time, it would have been worrying. This time, it was the opposite.</p><p>I could acutely feel that I was changing, a scary concept in and of itself. \t</p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 87</p><p>While deciding that ambushing the arrival would be a good strategic concept, it wasn’t that simple tactically, mainly due to two factors. </p><p>We had no idea about the nature of the reinforcements. More importantly, if we left them alone for too long, they would inevitably alert the reinforcements, who would be ready for an attack. </p><p>“So, what do we do,” Eleanor asked. “Do we just go and camp at the nearest dungeon gate, hoping to catch the reinforcements?” </p><p>“No, I don’t believe that’s the most efficient plan,” I said, but didn’t immediately declare it a bad plan. Until very recently, she had been my superior, and while she currently saw me as an equal, a little delicacy wouldn’t hurt. No one liked an upstart with a lot of new ideas. </p><p>It was a lesson I had learned when I first joined the faculty. </p><p>Luckily, while she frowned at my declaration, it wasn’t the deep, affronted expression that I feared. I didn’t know if she respected my acumen more than I had realized, or if it was still the good mood from her new sword. The former would have made me happier, but I would still take the latter as well. </p><p>“That's not exactly an efficient plan. They might just use another gate to arrive here, and we would be screwed. And, we need to stay near to harass them. I don’t want them to get the idea of targeting my guild to draw us to a fight.” </p><p>“What do we do, then?” she asked. </p><p>I bit my lip as I thought, then my gaze flipped to the ruined ballistas. “We’re going to use their original tactic, and destroy them with the ballistas,” I said. </p><p>“How? We can probably take them, but they would realize that there’s something suspicious.” </p><p>“Not if we bury them,” I responded. “Since they seem determined to attack </p><p>“Can’t we just kill them?” Eleanor asked. “This new sword is incredible, and I’m guessing you’re not too shabby with that hammer, or you couldn’t have soloed dungeon bosses no matter the trickeries you used.” </p><p>“True. I’m sure we can take them, but I doubt we could catch all of them if they decided to escape. And, more importantly, it would mean their reinforcements would stay hidden, looking for an opportunity. Wouldn’t it be better to get rid of them all at once?” </p><p>Eleanor paused, thinking carefully. “Alright, professor. You have one chance to put your plan into action before we go with mine.” </p><p>I smiled, doing my best to ignore that we were planning how to massacre about forty people, plus an uncertain number of reinforcements. That ignorance came easier than I was happy with, but once again, the immediacy of the situation forced me to ignore my own warping psyche and focus on practical matters. </p><p>Like, how to conceal my action of hiding my assault. The first step was to lure them into a false sense of security. Luckily, with the reinforcements on the way, they were also trying to kill time, giving us enough time to prepare. </p><p>During the first assault, Eleanor attacked from the front alone, still using her old sword to limit her threat level, while I supported her with several ranged spears. When Eleanor pulled back, she was already frowning. “I hope you’re confident in your plan. I’m not used to failure,” she warned me. </p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s clear that they want to kill time, and it gives us an opportunity,” I said. </p><p>“If you say so,” she said even as I accompanied her for another rush. “Huh, are you still using your sword?” she asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said even as I joined the assault, charging the mess from the opposite direction, expecting to fight in a combined manner. It worked well. I wasn’t as good as Eleanor, but a maxed-out Rare skill, particularly one that worked well with my Strength build, was enough to keep the five guards that attacked me busy. </p><p>Then, I noticed that one of the guards engaging with Eleanor was struggling. I pulled a spear from my back and threw it with a smooth motion before the others could realize it. </p><p>I wasn’t able to infuse it with mana in the middle of combat, but it didn’t need to. The guard who was trying to engage with Eleanor did his best to dodge the spear that he noticed at the last second. Unfortunately for him, Eleanor was too experienced to let such a mistake go unpunished. Two attacks were all she needed to destroy his guard completely before decapitating him with the third attack. </p><p>Georg seemed to be uncaring of the loss, but the same wasn’t true for the guild leaders. “Screw your plan,” one of them growled as he rushed toward me, and five from the inner line joined him, all moving toward me. </p><p>“Idiots,” Georg growled even as he quickly barked a few orders. The majority of the reserves attacked me, while Georg rushed toward Eleanor. </p><p>I stomped my foot to the ground twice, as Eleanor was too far away to see me, signaling her to continue with the plan. “Finally, little cowards joining the battle,” I said, louder than necessary even as I took a step to the side, positioning myself at the edge of the hill. </p><p>“You have pushed your luck, Arthur,” yelled the enemy guild leader, who I remembered talking to once or twice — though only if veiled insults and threats delivered by him while I gave one-word responses counted as talking. </p><p>“Oh, brave man,” I responded, forcing a joviality to my tone. “And, it took only the support of a dozen warriors to face me,” I said. Actually, an equal number of warriors were also trying to circle around me to pin me in place, but I acted unaware of that. </p><p>After all, they were supposed to be concealed by the mist. </p><p>He just growled in anger and attacked. Unfortunately for him, the skill mismatch was enough to keep their blades from ever touching me, and even if it wasn’t my current armor was strong enough to take any blow that might slip. </p><p>None of the blows actually slipped, but it was the difference between trying to do rock climbing with a safety tether on, and without it. The former was much easier. I pushed forward ‘recklessly’ which positioned me between the two parties. </p><p>And, coincidentally, near the broken ballistas. </p><p>“Oh, big brave guild master can’t defeat poor old me with just a dozen soldiers, and require more,” I shouted as the second group joined the mess. “Too bad,” I called even as I took a step back and switched to my hammer, ready to devastate the hill we were fighting on. </p><p>[-100 Health]</p><p>As I slammed my hammer on the ground, six different attacks hit me, but all bounced off helplessly. I didn’t even feel them enough to actually require Health to cure me, but I still made a show of grunting in pain. </p><p>Quake hammer destabilized the edge of the hill we were fighting on, which created a landslide that had three consequences, two of them intentional. The first two consequences were bringing me away from the ambush as I used Fleeting Step to surf over the wave of rubble, and burying the ballistas as intended. </p><p>The third one, however, had been a welcome surprise. The guild leader and five attackers, who were responsible for the ineffective attacks against my armor, had tumbled down with me. And, unlike me, they lacked the skill to help them keep their footing on such unstable ground. </p><p>Before the landslide calmed down, my blade flashed several times, making sure they could never stand up. Not exactly an honorable victory, but considering how things had developed, I wasn’t exactly burning with a desire to give them a fair fighting chance. </p><p>When the dust settled, I found the others looking at me from the fresh edge of the hill, looking horrified. I didn’t blame them. One against twenty was supposed to be the odds for a decisive victory, especially once I recklessly pushed in between them. </p><p>The loss of six of their members, including one of the guild masters, when the best they could do was to scratch my armor was not that. </p><p>Though, while thinking that, I glanced down, only to see my armor completely pristine, without even a scratch, making me realize that they weren’t even able to achieve a scratch.  </p><p>Fascinating and scary in equal measures. </p><p>I pulled back, and Eleanor managed to ditch Georg with relative ease as she had the advantage in mobility. Though, watching them fight, I had seen that Georg wasn’t any weaker than Eleanor, likely possessing a well-developed Epic skill, so I made a note not to confront him directly.  </p><p>With everything in place, stealing the ballistas under the rubble went without a hitch. Eleanor continued attacking, while I split my attention between supporting her from range and using one of the most famous siege strategies in the ancient world. </p><p>I dug a tunnel. </p><p>Thanks to a combination of mana and Strength, digging that tunnel barely took me a minute, and the constant sound of battle kept that activity concealed. </p><p>Soon, we were looking at six ballistas, pristine after a few touches, hidden behind a rock. A quick supply run to the safe house meant that we had the ballista bolts back, not to mention a fresh batch of throwing spears. </p><p>“Not bad, professor,” Eleanor said before as she started giving me a crash course on how to use them, which seemed simple enough with enchantments handling most of the work. “All we need to do now is wait for the reinforcements to arrive. Speaking of them, why do you think they have them?” she asked. “Wouldn’t it be better if they had been a part of the ambush in the first place?” </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I responded. “Don’t forget. While setting the ambush, Thomas suspected that I might be over level hundred, which meant I was harder to target. With the visibility in the dungeon, they weren’t sure to take both of us down. That way, once I retreated away from the dungeon, they could ambush me outside. Which means, we’re going to have a difficult fight even with the ballistas.” </p><p>Her smile was positively vicious even as she grabbed the hilt of her new sword. “It’s good that I’m properly armed, right?” </p><p>I was glad she was on my side. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 88</p><p>Just because we were waiting for reinforcements didn’t mean we stopped attacking once the ballistas were ready and in place. On the contrary, we continued attacking even more, forcing them to defend themselves. </p><p>Their attitude changed from baiting us to defending earnestly, the recent loss of another guild master forcing their hands. They simply didn’t have an option. Currently, the only one that could fight against us on an equal footing was Georg, meaning, whenever we attacked from two opposite directions, he had been forced to engage with Eleanor, while the remaining guild masters tried to defend against me. </p><p>With them focusing fully on the defensive and us holding back our trump cards, the battle had been locked into a stalemate. We attacked in bursts, allowing us to replenish the Health we consumed during our special attacks. </p><p>And, whenever we retreated, Georg sent another magical message to his allies. The intensity of the mana flare from those messages didn’t match the first one, leading me to believe that the reinforcements were already in the dungeon. So, whenever we pulled back, I made sure to circle around the two positions to see if I could catch the reinforcements. </p><p>Which I finally came across them nearly ten minutes later, but their size surprised me. </p><p>More than a hundred people. </p><p>Admittedly, the numbers alone weren’t that scary. The performance they put against the monster attacks showed that they weren’t particularly strong. They were probably the rest of the guild members, the ones too weak to contribute anything other than a momentary distraction. </p><p>However, the same didn’t apply to the eight that were at the center of the formation, each wearing pure black armor. They felt …</p><p>Dangerous. </p><p>Clearly, I wasn’t the only one who felt this way, as none of the guild fighters walked near them. Whatever that was going on with them, it was not good news. They radiated some kind of primal fear. I would have almost suspected that they had Charisma, but it was not the same. </p><p>When Thomas used that, I could feel some kind of external pressure wrapping around me and pulling my fear to the surface … Here, it was a primal sensation, like I just came across a rabid dog, foams covering its mouth. </p><p>I gulped even as I retreated, suddenly glad that we had gone through all that trouble to steal and repair the ballistas. When I returned, Eleanor was just finishing eating another nutrition bar. “You’re early,” she said. </p><p>“They are here, just half a mile away, and getting closer,” I said. </p><p>“Finally,” she said with a sharp smirk. “What’s the layout?” </p><p>“About a hundred guild fighters, low-leveled, and eight … I don’t know who they are, but they felt … wrong.” I didn’t like the way I sounded plaintive, but I had no choice. I was basically trying to warn her against something that I didn’t even know myself. </p><p>“Wrong, how?” she asked, her expression serious. </p><p>“I don’t know how to describe it. It’s more of an ephemeral feeling. But, it’s intense enough that I want to target four of the six ballistas to them.” </p><p>“Even if it means we can’t catch all of them at once and most of them escape? You were the one afraid of it. Once they start to retreat, we won’t have the chance to reload them.” </p><p>“Yes, even then,” I said. I wasn’t exactly someone big on instincts, but what I was feeling from them was too intense to be ignored. “Now, let’s conduct one last attack. We can’t afford to alert them when we’re so close to victory.” </p><p>She stayed silent for a while, then nodded, approving the last-minute adjustment to the plan. It was good news. </p><p>“Stay with the ballistas and support me from range,” she said as she tensed. “I’ll switch to the sword the moment you release the first attack.” </p><p>“I’ll target the newcomers first. Just retreat when I launch the first one. It won’t take long to release every single one of them.” </p><p>“And, once two of them land, I’ll switch to … your gift to me,” she said, smiling surprisingly. </p><p>“Yes. I knew the moment I gave it to you I won’t be receiving it back,” I said, trying to sound exasperated rather than glad. I could see that she was trying to calm me down about what I had felt from them. </p><p>Eleanor rushed forward, and I started supporting her with spears I released through my atlatl, keeping an eye on the attackers. Attackers gathered on my flank, ready to spread to envelop me. They seemed ready to take me down. </p><p>Before they could even start their assault, I aimed the four ballistas toward the center of their formation, where the eight scary ones were still gathered reasonably close, and released the four bolts at the same time. </p><p>The difference between using the bolts on the ballistas and releasing them directly was like the difference between night and day. The moment I triggered, the complicated enchantment on the ballista flared to life, linking with the one on the bolt. </p><p>The bolt radiated mana as it flew toward its target, slower than I expected, which was a scary proposition as it had been accompanied by a loud buzzing noise. Combined, I could have dodged it if it was used against me, and so would Eleanor as long as she wasn’t occupied. </p><p>No wonder they had set an elaborate trap to draw her out. </p><p>However, those thoughts were only on the passing. I was more interested in the way each bolt skewered its target before exploding into fragments, accompanied by a wave of mana, which started burning black. </p><p>Scary effect. Eleanor hadn’t mentioned that detail. </p><p>It was an unexpected effect, but I didn’t have time to waste on it. Eleanor had already retreated from her engagement, so I released the last two ballistas. This time, I aimed it at the hill, destroying their formation and footing before killing some of them. </p><p>Georg might not be as fast as Eleanor, but I still didn’t want to risk targeting him with the siege weapon, and the rest wasn’t exactly a priority target. </p><p>The moment I released the last two, I rushed forward. Reloading them was not an option since the enchantment required time to recover. So, I stopped with the ranged attacks, grabbed my hammer, and rushed forward. </p><p>I took several steps before the bolts had reached their target, exploding in a dangerous cloud of dust and … no flame. Certainly no black flame. I couldn’t help but glance to my right, where the black flames were still burning strong. </p><p>But, at this moment, Eleanor had already jumped to the cloud of dust, and required my support … or at least, that was what I assumed before the cries of pain reached my ear. The sword, combined with the limited visibility worked to her benefit if the number of interrupted cries was any indicator. </p><p>However, before I could think a lot about it, Georg burst from the cloud, wanting to escape. “I got him,” I shouted at Eleanor even as I closed in the distance, Floating Step making me even faster. </p><p>“You think you can defeat me,” Georg growled as he turned to catch me. “I have seen the way you fought. You’re clearly not as good —” he started, only to realize I was not wielding a sword, but a hammer. </p><p>A hammer that glowed with an intense blue hue. “Impossible,” he shouted even as he raised his sword to parry. </p><p>I had to admit, it was a perfect parry. Sharp, strong, and angled perfectly to keep his weapon safe from any attack. I was sure that, even if I used the strongest hammer attack given by my Rare skill, it wouldn’t have worked.  </p><p>Unfortunately for him, that mana glow wasn’t from Quake Hammer, but the enhanced, denser mana from the Epic Mana Forge, designed to purge the mana out of his sword. </p><p>[-10 Mana] </p><p>It wasn’t a perfect method. Even the weakest external mana flow would have destabilized it. Luckily for us, the dungeon lacked such a fluctuation, allowing the mana to stick to his blade longer without my control. </p><p>“You think that being an Essence Warrior would save you,” he growled. “Once those monsters arrive, you won’t survive,” he declared arrogantly. But, even as he declared that a cry reached my ears. A loud, bloodcurdling cry, one that I hadn’t heard since the first days of the Cataclysm, when the concept of monsters was new. </p><p>The moment that cry reached my ear, I expected Georg to look arrogant and confident. Instead, he looked afraid, and hesitant. “No, don’t tell me you attacked them with ballistas,” he asked, with fear coloring his face. He took a step to escape. </p><p>Anyone else, I might have considered letting them go, wondering whether their intention was genuine, or they were acting. But he was the main person responsible for our plight, and even if his desire was genuine, it was too late. </p><p>I swung down my hammer, this time delivering a quake attack.</p><p> [-50 Health]</p><p>[-25 Mana]</p><p>He tried to parry again, but his weapon, already degraded by my earlier trick, was unable to handle the blow. His helmet managed to resist, but the quake aspects of it bypassed his armor sufficiently, enough to make him bleed through his eyes and ears, stunned. </p><p>I delivered another blow, finishing him off, for once happy with my own distorted perspective, allowing me to kill without hesitation. </p><p>I turned to support Eleanor, only to freeze. The initial dust cloud had settled enough for me to see her … and only her. Of the thirty-five remaining warriors, none of them were alive. </p><p>It would have been enough to celebrate, if it wasn’t for the cries that were reaching our ears. “What’s going on?” I asked even as I rushed to her side. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she said. “All I see is some kind of black flame that makes me very unsettled.” </p><p>“Wait, you can see it as well? But, it’s almost a hundred yards away,” I asked. </p><p>She nodded grimly. </p><p>I paused, looking past the black flame, focusing on the edge of the mist … which had become jagged as if it was being siphoned. </p><p>Eerily similar to how it was around the boss monster. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 89</p><p>“Good news is that we know why they wanted to ambush you outside,” Eleanor said even as another pained cry reached our ears, only to be cut halfway. I wanted to admonish her, but the uncharacteristic tenseness in her tone stopped me. It was clear that she was trying to handle the shock in her own way. </p><p>Instead, I watched, trying to understand what was going on. The black flames were calming down, but the speed at the mist was gathering — which was something I had only seen on the boss monsters — had only hastened, increasing the visibility around us. </p><p>All except the black flames, which were letting out an equally black, suffocating smog, making me glad that my helmet had an integrated filter. Eleanor was already coughing. </p><p>I grabbed one of the spears I had yet to throw, and a flash of mana melted the iron, which I then used to fashion a breather filter, which would hopefully be enough to handle what was going on. </p><p>Even as I created that, I watched through the smog. We weren’t able to see much, just several shadows, most trying to escape ineffectively, while the other shadows followed. </p><p> “What do we do?” </p><p>“I … we need to kill them,” she said. “I have never heard of people being able to absorb dungeon mist, but it can’t be good news. And, we need to do that now,” she said as she took a step forward. </p><p>I grabbed her shoulder. “No,” I said. </p><p>She looked at me, disappointed. “You can go if you want. We need to warn the fort, after all,” she said, doing her best to hide her disgust. She wasn’t very successful. </p><p>I appreciated the effort. “I’m not saying to retreat, but we can’t just rush forward blindly,” I said even as I started dragging her toward the ballistas. Her expression was alighted with understanding. “How long would it take for the ballistas to recover?” I asked. </p><p>“In a mana-dead dungeon? A lot,” she said. </p><p>“What if we can supply it with more mana?” I asked. </p><p>“A minute, maybe two?” she responded. </p><p>“Good, keep the ballistas safe. I’ll be back in a moment,” I said as I turned, ready to use the Fleeting Step, hoping that I would be fast enough to go to the nearest safe house and return just as fast. I was already doing my best… </p><p>“A-am I,” I found myself suddenly asking. The modified Fleeting Step was fast, but it wasn’t the fastest thing in my arsenal. No, the fastest Perk available to me was the Floating Stride. One that I couldn’t use due to my fears. And, now, Eleanor might die because of it. </p><p>“Come on, Devon. For once in your life, ignore your stupid fear,” I growled, pushing myself. My hands trembled, and my legs lost their strength, but I bit my lips, the taste of my own blood filling my mouth. “Come on,” I growled again. </p><p>And jumped. </p><p>The sensation of flying was as disgusting as I remembered. My whole body was locked in place, and I had been hit by a sensation of falling that played a part in some of my worst nightmares. </p><p>The desire to save Eleanor didn’t suddenly cure me of my phobia. The sensation of flying was just as hateable and disgusting as I remembered, and not having anything underneath me made it ten times worse. Luckily, Floating Stride didn’t require any input from me until I landed. </p><p>Well, landed was a generous description of what had happened. Crashed was a better descriptor, but my armor was there to take the worst of the damage, and my Dexterity meant I was able to roll to my feet with fascinating alacrity. </p><p>I jumped again. Then, I crashed again. And again… It was ridiculous, horrifying, and humiliating at the same time, but where a second might be the difference between Eleanor’s death and survival, none of it mattered. </p><p>When I reached the safe house, I picked a huge pile of shells I had placed there for safety and a manual crusher. When I had been putting them there, I was certain that I was being excessive and paranoid. Now, I was furious that I hadn’t littered the whole floor with them, maybe even with steam-powered variants. </p><p>Unfortunately, as usual, hindsight was the greatest strategic planner. </p><p>The return trip was more of the same, which meant I arrived at Eleanor's side with an undignified tumble. It would have been a horrible shock if it wasn’t for one important detail. </p><p>Eleanor was surrounded by four men … no, monsters would have been a better descriptor. They were roughly man-shaped, but their skin looked like melted messes, and the way they fought was no different than beasts. </p><p>Very strong beasts, faster and stronger than Eleanor. Her armor was already half-ripped, with her recovery working overtime to cure her wounds. Her only advantage was the lack of coordination they had been showing. They were faster and stronger, but one thing they lacked was smooth control. </p><p> Suddenly, I was very glad that I had pushed myself, as she was already at her limit. </p><p>“Tag,” I shouted even as I jumped to the mix, my hammer already dancing. </p><p>“No, they are too strong —” she shouted in panic, ready to help me when one of their attacks threw me away, but barely managed to dent my armor. </p><p>[-14 Health]</p><p>“My armor can hold them back, don’t worry,” I said. “Just fill the container with the shells, point the mouth to the ballista, and rotate the crank —” I explained, my words interrupted by another hit that threw me away. </p><p>They were strong enough to throw me around like a rag doll. </p><p>“Be careful, they are getting stronger,” she warned even as she followed my command, which was something I was glad for. </p><p>“Noted,” I said as I switched my weapon, donning my spear. The fact that Eleanor couldn’t put them down even with her new sword meant that they were able to recover from a horrifying amount of damage. My hammer might have been capable of delivering that, but on a straight line, they were too fast. </p><p>Breeze Spear focused on mobility. As I shifted to it, I was able to dodge their attacks far more effectively. Not enough to avoid every attack, but maybe reduce their hits by sixty percent. For the rest, I relied on my armor, being thrown around like a toy. </p><p>However, as I fought with them, I understood why Georg had been very reluctant to bring them into the dungeon. Whatever their ailment was, it was getting stronger the more dungeon mist they consumed. A part of that transformation was them getting faster and stronger in real-time. </p><p>Luckily, that growth was accompanied by an even greater loss of control, which meant that, as time passed, it got easier to avoid their attacks. I started paying attention to the damage my weapons had been causing, expecting it to recover faster and faster. </p><p>To my surprise, the opposite was true. As for what was responsible, a hypothesis drifted to the top of my mind the moment I sensed a familiar aura around them, one that reminded me intensely of the fourth floor. </p><p>The mist was transforming them into something closer to the monsters of the dungeon, along with giving them the same weaknesses. </p><p>I wondered if I let the transformation go long enough, could I kill them alone. But, that curiosity wasn’t strong enough to countermand when Eleanor warned me to pull back. I retreated, and the twang of the ballista followed. </p><p>A direct hit, reducing their number to three. </p><p>“Good work,” I called even as I attacked them with mana, distracting them from ballistas. I did my best not to be distracted by the body, which started burning with the same black flames. I couldn’t afford the distraction. </p><p>As I engaged with them once again, I was able to notice another, fortunate familiarity they had with a rabid beast. Their intelligence wasn’t too far away. The pain from my spear suitably distracted the remaining three. </p><p>More importantly, dealing with the three of them was markedly easier than resisting four. The number of blows I was receiving had dropped significantly, then turned into nothingness when Eleanor shouted again. </p><p>I pulled back. Another twang of a ballista, and their number dropped to two. Then, yet another, and one remained. </p><p>To my surprise, once he was alone, he turned to escape. “Keep him back,” Eleanor shouted. “We can’t let him go free.” </p><p>“Open the container!” I shouted even as I chased him — or was it a better descriptor at this point? </p><p>Eleanor seemed surprised by my shout, but luckily, her shock didn’t prevent her from following that direction, as we lacked the time necessary for me to explain why. The transformed monster in front of us was too fast on a straight line for us to catch up.</p><p>And, I didn’t want to imagine what might happen once it got loose in the dungeon. </p><p>The container parted open, and concentrated tainted energy radiated from the box. Just like the dungeon monsters, the transformed man seemed captivated by it, ignoring his — its — previous survival instincts to rush toward the box. </p><p>Under the tainted energy, its transformation started to hasten as it started to grow, as a disgusting mixture of a monster and a tumor. </p><p>“Focus on its limbs, and keep it immobile,” I ordered Eleanor as I switched to my hammer, and we started attacking it. The concentrated dose of tainted energy hastened the transformation exponentially, but it also exacerbated its weaknesses to our silver weapons, which I had designed explicitly against the corrosive aura. </p><p>As we fought, Eleanor’s armor, despite all the enchantments it had, didn’t survive against the transformed creature’s corrosion aura, slowly turning into a rusty mess. </p><p>Even then, it took almost half an hour for us to kill it properly. Its remains disintegrated, just like the other corpses, once again catching that distinctive black flame.  </p><p>We collapsed to the ground, listless. There was a lot to be done, but none of them was as important as breathing… </p><p>“You owe me an armor,” she growled between her desperate panting. </p><p>I just grumbled an answer. I was too spent to do anything else. But, I had to admit, after what had just happened, spending a day at the forge, working with metal sounded very tempting. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 90</p><p>“And, that’s the last of it. The dungeon is officially closed until further notice,” Eleanor said the moment she returned to my side, sealing the dungeon gate. </p><p>“Everything done?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, we evacuated every guild and the guards are on high alert, ordered to attack anyone that dares to breach without invitation. The only problem is that it’ll take at least a day for Maria to return,” Eleanor explained in quick order. </p><p>I nodded, admiring her efficiency. Merely an hour had passed since our close call, which was all she needed to put the dungeon on high alert and stop the operation. For someone who preferred direct action above anything else, her capacity to set up an organization was admirable. </p><p>I suspected it was Maria’s flighty attitude to such aspects that had forced her to learn. </p><p>“I’m still not sure about closing the dungeon,” Eleanor said. “We have handled the crisis well enough. Is it worth losing all that money just to trick them?” </p><p>“We have already discussed it. It’s better to let them believe they had managed to cause some significant damage, maybe even that one of those … whatever they were … was loose in the dungeon. At least, until Maria returns and can make a decision.” </p><p>“Fine,” Eleanor said. She didn’t look entirely convinced, but she assented. “But don’t forget your promise. First, you’re going to adjust this monstrosity into something more elegant,” she said as she displayed her new sword. </p><p>I made sure to hide my smile, amused by the ease with which she was convinced to follow what she believed to be a wasteful plan. I must have been underestimating the value of my new sword to a significant degree. “Let’s go,” I said. </p><p>Both of us were fast enough to ignore the presence of the weaker monsters, so I didn’t expect the trip to take that long. I was wrong. She killed any insect we came across, using vitality attacks, with a fascinated expression on her face. </p><p>It slowed our descent significantly, but I said nothing. The pleasure of watching a skill improve was unmatched even after doing that to more than half a dozen skills. For Eleanor, it was a new experience. I didn’t want to interrupt her, but after her third detour, I had to speak. “Come on, miss swords master, we are wasting time,” I warned her. </p><p>“No we’re not,” she said, her voice determined. </p><p>“Look, the faster we arrive at the fourth floor, the faster I can design you a sword that might give you a mana manipulation skill,” I said. “But, if you want to waste that opportunity, it’s your choice.” </p><p>“Wait, you can do that,” she said. </p><p>“Maybe,” I responded, leery to commit it fully. “I have several ideas in mind, but whether they will work immediately or not, I don’t know. We need to experiment a lot.” </p><p>“Like how you have been experimenting with Maria,” she said. For some reason, her tone was suspicious. Only when it was followed by a sudden realization, I understood where she was coming from. </p><p>”Yes. I might have slightly obfuscated how necessary those experiments were to help me repair the swords faster,” I said, avoiding her gaze. I had no problem with that decision itself, but admitting the act of lying was never comfortable.  </p><p>“You have a lot to atone for,” she said, trying to look stern, but her smile was hard to hide. She didn’t seem to care a lot about it, which didn’t surprise me. After all, it was that act of lying that saved her life just an hour ago. </p><p>“So … a dagger as well?” I countered. </p><p>Her smile slid away. “If you think you can get away with a mere dagger, you’re delusional. I need a full set of armor. Non-negotiable.” </p><p>“You drive a hard bargain,” I said, somehow maintaining a serious expression. “Now, let’s go. We have dungeon bosses to hunt.” </p><p>With that done, we started running full speed to the fourth floor. “So, you also use a spear,” she commented as we moved. </p><p>“It’s good to have a style that focuses on mobility and deflection,” I responded. “You might think to add that as an external skill, assuming you have an empty slot.” </p><p>“I do.” </p><p>“Good, “ I said, then paused. “Then, why didn’t you learn one? It wouldn’t be as strong as your main style, but even with all the advantages, an additional style can be helpful.” </p><p>“Mostly because of a lack of time. Focusing on my main skill was the more efficient approach. Anything below Rare is too useless, and developing a Rare skill requires months even with access to a fitting dungeon. At least, it was supposed to,” she corrected. </p><p>“Well, we just have to replicate it for you,” I said. “I have struggled with that a lot as well, but it’s not that difficult once one discovers the trick behind it. We can try it once we arrive at my base. I have a few Rare Breeze Spear samples. And, I still need some time to forge your armor.” She looked hopeful. “Not one based on my Epic skill, that needs two full days,” I corrected. “But, you still need an armor set that can resist the natural corrosion of the fifth floor.” </p><p>“Fine. I guess it’s a good way to utilize that downtime,” she admitted. </p><p>I smiled, happy to see that her obsession with improving her sword skills didn’t mean she refused a chance to diversify her abilities. And I knew that, with her Dexterity, her own variant of Breeze Spear would turn into a devastating weapon that could easily surpass mine. </p><p>Especially since she lacked a phobia that turned its biggest advantage useless.</p><p>We chatted even as we passed through another gate and arrived at the fourth floor, and a thicker mist surrounded us, making me glad for increased visibility. Though, not as much as it would have if it wasn’t for the fog that hung above the swamp, which was annoying. </p><p>“Disgusting place,” she growled even as her feet sank into the mud. “I was so glad when we discovered the corrosive effect would prevent us from exploring the place.” </p><p>“Understandable,” I said. “Wading through mud is not exactly my idea of a fun time either.” </p><p>“Yet, you decided to build your base here,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “Not because I love the environment,” I said. “But, as a Blacksmith who can forge equipment that can resist the corrosion of this place, its strategic value is far more important than the less-than-pleasant environment.” </p><p>“Fair. And, how the hell do you manage to find your path here? There’s nothing for wayfinding.” </p><p>“Here,” I said as I crouched, pushing the mud away to show her the rails I had buried. “I laid them before. My skills allow me to detect their presence.” </p><p>“You went through all that trouble just to find your path.” </p><p>“No, it helps to move the carts around,” I said. </p><p>“Carts, really?” she said even as we continued to run despite the mud. “Do you really need that much effort just to move a bunch of arrowheads around,” she asked. </p><p>“Well, no,” I said even as we continued to move. “But that’s not the only thing I move around. After all, I have a proper base here.” </p><p>“Calling a dinky little shack a base is a bit grandiose even for you, professor,” she teased. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, letting the discussion linger as we continued to move until we finally arrived at my base. The moment her vision range touched the edge of the trees, a gasp escaped her mouth. “Not bad for a dinky little shack, is it?” I asked smugly. </p><p>“Well …” she said as she gazed upon my base, impressed. Her reaction was understandable, as the structure rose from the swamp as a single, monolithic structure, surrounded by multiple blast furnaces and steam engines. And, around them, there were almost ten discrete rings of trees to keep the base safe from the monsters.  </p><p>It looked good, mostly because I had decided to put my excess of available metal to good use. Knowing that the fifth floor was too hostile to set up a permanent base — the persistent attacks from the boss monsters and air that put a vat of acid to shame was decisive enough — further incentivized me to put some more effort into my base. </p><p>Eleanor’s shock was a nice side benefit. </p><p>“I have to admit, it’s not as horrible as I imagined,” she responded, then smirked. “For a dingy little base, of course.” </p><p>I didn’t bother answering her even as I disappeared inside, and came out with two things. A modified weapon, halfway between a sword and a spear to help her switch between the skills, which I threw at her, handle first, and as she grabbed that, I threw a copy of Rare Breeze Spear skill. “I’m sure this will keep you busy for a while.” </p><p>“Explain how I am going to power-level the skill first,” she said. “And, what’s this abomination?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Simple,” I said as I raised my hand. She threw it back. “Just start treating it as a sword, and start channeling a vitality attack. Then, halfway in, switch to your spear skill, and complete that attack. Considering you’re using an Epic skill as a template, it should work.” </p><p>“That’s it?” she said. </p><p>“Yep, that’s it. Trivial,” I said. “Now, why don’t you play with it while I go and start working on your armor.” Seeing her enthusiasm, I had to quickly add a correction. “The temporary one.” </p><p>“Fine,” she growled playfully as she raised her hand, and the skill orb disappeared. She grunted as she closed her eyes, her discomfort clear. </p><p>I left to forge her armor. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 81</p><p>Even as I watched the two spies disappear into the mist, I didn’t interrupt our sparring immediately. I didn’t know the reason why they were here, and even though their presence was suspicious, I couldn’t simply attack them. And, not just due to ethical reasons. </p><p>Information asymmetry was valuable in any circumstance, and had I attacked them, they would have realized that I possessed a way to see through the mist. Every other method I managed to learn about worked similarly to the effect of the trees, dispersing the mist to increase the range of vision, which worked for both sides. </p><p>Killing the dungeon bosses was the only method — that I knew of — that expanded the range of vision for the observer only. It was a strategic advantage I was not ready to give up. This meant that I continued to practice even as I wondered who was the target of the cloaked scouts: Me, or Eleanor…  </p><p>My mind wandered even as I called my System. It was unnecessary, as I knew everything it would show. Still, I needed the confidence it would provide as I prepared to face a potential battle. </p><p>[Mana Blacksmith - Level 43]</p><p>[Health 1290/1290] [Mana 210/210]</p><p>[Vitality 86 / Strength 86 / Dexterity 65 / Essence 21]</p><p>[Skills (8/13)</p><p>Mana Repair (Epic) - 102 [Advanced Observe]</p><p>Mana Forge (Epic) - 107 [Advanced Creative Forging, Mana Control]</p><p>Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 139 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]</p><p>Nurture (Epic) - 219</p><p>Quake Hammer (Rare) - 200 [Persistent Tremor]</p><p>Blade of Retribution (Rare) - 200 [Strike of Retribution]</p><p>Breeze Spear (Rare) - 200 [Floating Stride]</p><p>Fire Bolt (Basic) - 25 </p><p>Shoot (Basic) - 25]</p><p>My distraction was punished by a ringing sound as the flat of Eleanor’s blade slammed against my helmet. “You’re getting lost,” she warned. </p><p>“Sorry, I’m just getting used to the new skill,” I said. “Fighting against the monsters is a different experience.” </p><p>“That’s why we have to practice,” she responded. “You’re lucky that I’m willing to waste my time helping you.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “And, it has nothing to do with the boredom you have accumulated through endless meetings.” </p><p>She avoided my gaze, and a shy giggle left her mouth. “Anyway, you have improved quite a bit,” she said, changing the topic. </p><p>“The dungeon is working for me,” I responded, suddenly feeling encouraged. “Having access to endless materials is proving to be quite a boon. I came up with a few inventions, including one that allows me to catch if someone gets near,” I said. </p><p>Technically, it was true. As long as I used a silver-gold alloy, I was able to expand the detection range of my Observe Perk quite a bit. </p><p>“Really, can you teach me?” she asked. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I said. “It requires me to use a perk I had received from the Repair skill, but it’s still quite useful. By burying a silver web, I can detect the presence of monsters and people alike.” </p><p>“Really, you did that through the Repair skill?” </p><p>“Yes. Is it a problem?” </p><p>“No,” she said. “I just never imagined a production skill having combat application.” She paused, and sighed deeply. “I can’t believe just how big of a misfortune your class is. You’re a natural-born warrior. You working as a blacksmith is a waste.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, I appreciate the variance,” I said even as I walked to the perimeter, and buried a long piece of silver string — which I created in my pocket by manipulating mana. At the same time, I watched Eleanor very carefully, trying to see if she noticed my ability to manipulate mana. </p><p>It was a risky test, but with the prospect of an ambush, I wanted to see what I could and couldn’t do near her without raising suspicion. </p><p>I was tempted to retreat, but after some consideration, I decided against it. I didn’t know whether the potential ambush was targeting me or Eleanor, but either way, acting unaware of the potential ambush was the better option than scaring them away. </p><p>If I were to fight against these spies, I much rather do that in the depths of the dungeon. Even before I started hunting the dungeon bosses, I had the home-ground advantage in the dungeon thanks to all the buried defensive bulwarks I had prepared for this exact eventuality. </p><p>My ability to see through the mist was even more important </p><p>“Handy,” Eleanor commented once I finished burying the silver string, and returned. Technically, what I buried wasn’t enough to catch any interloper, but it was good enough to make my warnings credible if they returned. Even if they didn’t return to attack as I feared, I could still warn Eleanor about potential assassins. </p><p>I wanted to keep my secrets, but not at the cost of letting Eleanor walk into the blades of a hidden assassin if I could help it. At this point, despite the number of secrets I had to keep from her, Eleanor belonged to the small list of people I could call a friend. </p><p>Speaking of friends, I wondered where Rosie was. Her guild was operational, but she was yet to return. </p><p>I elected not to ask Eleanor about it, but instead attacked her again, continuing our sparring session. I appreciated it, as even at the peak of the skill, the spar taught me a lot about fighting another human, particularly one that was flat-out better. </p><p>As we fought, the situation was interrupted by a sudden rumbling, and at a distance, the same two cloaked agents appeared at the edge of our range of vision once again, drawing a swarm behind them. </p><p>“Another stampede,” Eleanor gasped as she pulled out of an attack. “Natural or manmade,” she said. </p><p>“Definitely manmade,” I said. “There’s two people just at the edge of the swarm,” I said. </p><p>“Not for long,” she said even as she dashed forward to meet with the swarm. I bit my lip, holding back a curse as I followed her. She was as fast as me when I used Fleeting Step to the limit, making me glad I had gone through all that trouble to integrate Floating Stride into my repertoire. </p><p>Still, I let Eleanor ditch me before I started following her. “Wait for me, I can’t move as fast as you,” I shouted. </p><p>“Then, you can clean up!” she shouted, her attitude showing that she didn’t feel the slightest hint of threat from the ambush. </p><p>While I understood where her sense of invincibility came from — I was dealing with a version of it myself — it didn’t mean I approved. Especially since the enemy knew about both Eleanor and me being here, but despite that, they attacked. </p><p>As Eleanor went forward, the cloaked figure went behind the swarm, mana around them once again making the swarm ignore them. Eleanor burst forward, trying to engage with them. The swarm barely slowed her down, but she still failed to engage with the cloaked figures. </p><p>Despite that, the cloaked figures didn’t try to ditch Eleanor. Instead, they retreated in a smooth manner, slowly drawing her to a certain location. </p><p>It was not something I was willing to allow. I started rushing forward, only for ten figures to appear from the mist. Nine of them were clad in pitch-black armor, while the tenth one was cloaked as well. </p><p>The cloaked one, who was clearly some kind of scouting class, directed the rest. I changed my direction slightly to catch up with Eleanor, only for them to cut my path. </p><p>I wanted nothing more than to retreat, but I couldn’t do that without revealing I had detected their presence. And, at this point, it was not an acceptable sacrifice, so instead, I moved forward, but didn’t show my Fleeting Step. </p><p>Soon, I found myself face-to-face with the three armored figures. “Get out of my path, or die,” I called in faux anger even as the nine armored figures spread out, ready to cut my path. Their formation was enough to reveal what they had been trying to do. </p><p>It wasn’t a formation designed to surround someone, but to support each other in case I tried to ignore them and push forward. That alone was strong evidence to suggest that they were trying to delay me.</p><p>Their armament suggested it as well. Their armor was heavier than I expected, and every single one of them carried shields. Their equipment was identical, making them look like some kind of an assassination squad.  </p><p>I didn’t want to engage with them, but I needed information. So, I rushed forward, and attacked the one at the center of the formation, my sword covered with Vitality. The shield was sturdy enough to resist the blow, giving them a chance to counter-attack if they wished. </p><p>It was a risky move, but a necessary one, because, during the brief contact, I managed to use Observe, which gave me a brief, yet accurate snapshot of the shield. I attacked a second one before the first recovered, ready to retreat before they closed around me. </p><p>To my surprise, instead of leveraging the opportunity, they stayed spread in their formation, showing their intent to delay me. That alone had granted me a very important piece of information. They didn’t want to kill me but wanted to split me and Eleanor up. </p><p>I paused for a moment before I attacked the line again, but my intent was more about testing their equipment. It was new, not showing any sign of damage from anything but very brief sparring. No one had touched them since they had been purchased from the System Shop, not even to cast a repair spell — which was something I could distinguish at my current skill level. </p><p>They were also thick, heavy, and most importantly, optimized to resist sword attacks. As long as I used a spear or a hammer, I could have easily killed them. </p><p>It was purchased to delay a certain guild master who had famously only used swords. They targeted me, and not Eleanor, as Eleanor was too fast to be restricted by them. </p><p>Someone had gone through a lot of trouble to set up a unit to delay me. The only question, was whether they were trying to split Eleanor so they could kill me … or the other way around. </p><p>Ironically, I found myself desperately wishing that it was the first version, as that was destined to fail. At this moment, I had too many hidden advantages for such an attempt to succeed as long as I stayed in the dungeon. </p><p>Eleanor’s abilities were not as much of a secret. </p><p>I needed to make a decision, and I needed to make it immediately. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 82</p><p>“You bunch of whipper-snappers think that you can kill me,” I laughed boisterously even as I suddenly started running away, but limited myself to ordinary running speed. “I didn’t get to my age by stupidly letting people ambush me.” </p><p>Before they could make a decision, I had passed the forty-yard mark. The cloaked one followed me from a distance, using hand signals to command the other armored figures. Once again, I enjoyed the luxury of having a better range of vision, as it allowed me to see their movements clearly. </p><p>They were happy to keep me separated from Eleanor. </p><p>That left the question: why bother setting things like that in the first place? Couldn’t they have just ambushed Eleanor when she was alone? </p><p>I didn’t waste too much time thinking about that, and instead focused on my first problem. How to ditch the cloaked scout, who was constantly updating the rest on my location. Then, I turned my gaze toward a nearby cliff. </p><p>At this point, I was familiar with Quake Hammer enough to create the same effect with a punch. It shattered the cliff, which came tumbling down. </p><p>That had two advantages. First, it was very loud, enough to confuse the scout who relied on his hearing. More importantly, the destruction of the dungeon fixture released the tainted energy that was captured in the dungeon, which pulled the nearby beasts toward me. </p><p>The scouts were able to prevent the monsters from attacking them by using some kind of item — which was another suspicious point, as I had no doubt such an item was extremely expensive, or it would have been a common gear for the dungeon guards — but the armored ones didn’t have it. </p><p>This meant that, with the swarm between me and them, I was free to retreat. </p><p>The scout tried to follow me, but I didn’t let him succeed. He was fast, but nowhere as fast as my modified version of Fleeting Step, which incorporated some principles from Floating Stride. Still, I made sure not to show that fully as I retreated back, bringing down two more cliffs on the way. </p><p>Then, I circled the whole area, moving at full speed, doing my best to calculate Eleanor’s current position. </p><p>A minute later, I was looking at Eleanor, still chasing the two scouts. There was no threat there, so I moved forward, wondering what kind of trap was awaiting her. </p><p>I moved forward, hoping that the commotion Eleanor was creating to conceal my approach. Though, I didn’t have to move too far. Following the path the scouts had been drawing Eleanor, I had found a relatively deep canyon. On both sides, there were two ballistas, ready to be launched. </p><p>Of course, that was not the full extent of the ambush. I could see almost a hundred people, their blades ready. I was able to recognize most of them as members of the various guilds, including a few leaders. </p><p>Seeing their identity, their ploy had turned apparent. </p><p>They wanted to kill Eleanor, and blame me for it. After all, Eleanor had publicly visited me before we left for the dungeon. </p><p>I had to admit, if they were trying that, it was a good ploy. It would not only weaken Maria’s support significantly, but also force her to distance herself from her biggest supporter, forcing her to rely on the other guilds. </p><p>Assuming, of course, Maria was able to handle the loss of her best friend. Knowing her, abandoning the dungeon to her family while she left to harrow in her depression was a much likelier option. </p><p>However, while the plan offered a lot of benefits, trying to target both me and Eleanor at the same time made the plan unnecessarily dangerous. From the perspective of the guilds, safely dealing with Eleanor was safer than the alternative. Refusing their offer to collaborate wasn’t that big of an insult. </p><p>Then, there were the resources that they had committed to the attack. The team I fought against before had been equipped to defend against me, which was a significant level of financial commitment.  </p><p>I suddenly had a hunch as I circled the group, trying to see the face of a figure who seemed to be in charge. </p><p>A bodyguard of Thomas. </p><p>I had no intention of directly attacking the group. The existence of six ballistas alone was enough to make the position unassailable, let alone the forty extra fighters ready to intervene. </p><p>I reversed the direction, using Fleeting Step to cut the path of the two that had been pulling Eleanor into an ambush, and managed to cut their path about four hundred yards away from the ambush spot. I rushed with the full speed of the Fleeting Step, and cut their path from the opposite direction. </p><p>They were fast enough that I couldn’t take them down easily, but I didn’t need to do that. I just needed to slow them down. Eleanor caught up with them, her blade glowing with vitality, and a few slashes were all it took to kill them. </p><p>“What’s going on?” she asked. “How are you this fast?” </p><p>“I also learned an Uncommon spear skill to surprise you during our spars,” I said, quick to explain and give an excuse even as I focused on killing the swarm around us. “But, the ambush forced me to reveal my hand.” </p><p>“I know. They are not as subtle as they think they are,” she said. </p><p>“And, you’re moving toward it regardless,” I said, unable to suppress my shock. </p><p>“Well, yes. How else would I deal with them?” </p><p>“And, you’re not afraid they have a force that’s overwhelming enough to take you down?” She snorted dismissively. “Even if they have siege weapons?” I asked. </p><p>That made her eyes widen. “No, that’s impossible. How do you know?” </p><p>“One of my attackers slipped it as I was retreating, trying to taunt me,” I said, inventing a credible source to what I had seen. </p><p>“Your attackers?“ </p><p>“Yes. My attackers. The moment you left me behind, ten more warriors appeared to cut my path, geared specifically so I couldn’t support you.” </p><p>“Still, I’m sure that together —” </p><p>“No,” I cut her off. She looked frustrated, ready to refuse. Her attitude was radiating confidence to the point of recklessness. The fact that she was killing the monsters around us with incredible ease just reinforced the image. </p><p>I had to admit, her arrogance was not entirely unjustified, but the ambush that was waiting for her was too significant, particularly with the ballistas in place. But, I didn’t know how I would convince her without telling her I had already seen it. </p><p>I was afraid that I had to reveal I had already killed a few dungeon bosses to convince her. It was not something I wanted to reveal, but it was better than letting her walk into a deadly ambush. My secrets were important, but not to the point of letting her walk to her certain death. </p><p>I would reveal it if I had to. But, before that, I had one more thing to try. “Please,” I continued. “If you follow my lead, I promise that I’ll spar with you every day for a week.” </p><p>Bribery worked where honesty and common sense failed. “Alright. Don’t forget it. Even if Maria wants to play chess, sparring takes priority.” </p><p>“Deal,” I said, doing my best to ignore the two bodies that we had left behind. “Now, follow me.” </p><p>With that, I led her back to the initial ambush location. The squad was not there, but finding them hadn’t been too difficult. Their scout had tried to bring them away, which was a valiant, but ultimately useless effort. My range of vision meant that I was able to see them even when they were trying to hide. </p><p>I still made a show of searching for them by going in the wrong direction first before switching. “Good instincts,” Eleanor said as she dashed forward. “Take the scout while I deal with the armored ones.” </p><p>I had no problem with that assignment. The scout split from the group, while the armored ones gathered together. </p><p>The moment I got out of Eleanor’s range of vision, I sped up even further and caught up with the scout. I hurried up, because their actions made it clear that they were using a method to communicate with each other. </p><p>They acted like they had been promised reinforcements. Technically, it could be a lie, but I wouldn’t bet on it. The enemy had invested too much into their ploy to turn back immediately. </p><p>I attacked the scout, using my Strength advantage to the limit, his lack of metal armor putting him in an even more disadvantageous position. The skill difference between us was stark enough that I could just rely on the skill to deal with him, which meant I could split my attention between my fight and Eleanor’s massacre. </p><p>She was good. Intimidatingly so. I was aware that she had been holding back during our spars, but I clearly underestimated the extent of it. Her blade danced with an alacrity that I could never imagine matching. </p><p>I wondered if her Dexterity was that high, or if it was a difference due to the perks. Either way, she danced around the nine armored figures, making sure that their presence was more of a restriction to each other than actual benefit. </p><p>One of them had already fallen, and two others looked in critical condition. </p><p>Since she seemed to be in control, I once again rushed forward. </p><p>I needed to see what the main group was doing. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 83</p><p>Finding the main group had been easy. I didn’t have Perception, but the rushed movement of forty people, particularly when it was accompanied by a monster horde, was not too difficult. Luckily, not every single one of them had a movement ability, so they had to split their forces into two. </p><p>The main group, the bigger crowd, had rushed forward, while the second team, consisting of merely ten members, with six of them pulling the carts the ballistas were placed on, trailed behind them. </p><p>Their burst of speed confirmed that they were in communication with the other group, doing their best to catch up with Eleanor before she could finish with the armored team. </p><p>What I wanted to do was to talk with Eleanor and convince her to retreat, but I doubted that she would follow that suggestion. She was too confident, too headstrong. </p><p>I needed to equalize the stakes. The distance between the first and the second group wasn’t far enough for me to deal with all of them before the reinforcements could arrive — the distance between the two groups was merely two hundred yards, and I didn’t have the luxury of delaying them. </p><p>Luckily, killing them wasn’t my objective. </p><p>I attacked them from behind, which cost them a valuable second before they could raise an alarm. They tried to put a defensive line around the ballistas as they shouted, trying to raise an alarm, but it was too late. </p><p>I was already on top of the carts, and delivered the mana variant of the Quake punch, figuring out if it would be enough to destroy an immobile target. It was not. The siege weapon was able to resist the attack better than I had expected. </p><p>Thankfully, letting out a secondary blast of mana, this time under the control of Mana Forge, had been enough to deal with them. An Epic skill, even if it was merely a production one, was an incredible asset when used correctly. </p><p>I didn’t even need to destroy them completely, just damage the main shaft and add a large crack — one that I could repair just as easily if the need arose. </p><p>They made an attempt to catch me, but none of them had the necessary speed. I retreated, not only leaving them with their precious ballistas, which were turned into expensive junk, but also dragging a large box of ballista bolts with me. </p><p>I departed in a hurry, as I saw ten people splitting from the main group, including Thomas’ bodyguard and three of five guild masters I had recognized. It was an elite force, one that I wasn’t ready to confront. </p><p>I didn’t expect Thomas’ bodyguard to be as strong as Eleanor — or he wouldn’t have gone through all that trouble to set up such a huge ambush — but that didn’t mean he wasn’t as strong as me. And, supported by three guild masters and a few other soldiers, he had an overwhelming advantage. </p><p>Unless, of course, I changed the equation somewhat. </p><p>I picked a route that was almost perpendicular to Eleanor’s direction, which, as an added benefit, allowed me to stay near her without restricting my escape path. But, the real benefit was that it was on the path of the safe houses I had created, which also doubled as an armory, filled with javelins.</p><p>Manipulating their pursuit was easy. Several members of their party were faster than me unless I used Floating Stride, which was still not something I could use, but they didn’t dare to confront me without the rest. So, they moved near the group, spread to cut my path in case I wanted to make a beeline for Eleanor. </p><p>I changed direction occasionally, acting like I was trying to do that to make the scouts’ job of trying to find my location harder. Even with the help of Perception, tracking the location of someone solely by sound was not easy, especially when the man in question could incorporate wind into his steps, and monsters were hardly silent either. </p><p>When combined, my advantage in vision allowed me to easily avoid the traps they tried to place. I had to admit, their attempts weren't half bad both in terms of creativity and robustness. </p><p>In a way, it was like playing chess with Maria, where every move was done with a strategic robustness that I couldn’t come close to matching. Unfortunately for them, it wasn’t a chess game, where both sides had equal resources and equal information, where pure calculation ability of the stat and mindless repeating solved their problem. </p><p>It required them to systematically analyze the information granted by the Stat and direct it efficiently. Without a deliberate restriction and being pushed in the correct direction, the Stat didn’t work. A classic garbage-in-garbage-out problem. They were not even able to understand the reason for their continued failures, still under the assumption that we shared the same range of vision, just setting even more elaborate traps.  </p><p>In any other situation, I would have lamented about it being a waste, but coming from my enemies, it was always welcome. </p><p>It was appropriate to add some more complexity to their plight. I opened the box I had taken and pulled one of the bolts. It was mostly metal, but a quick check with my Repair skill showed me that the metal was nothing more than a relatively ordinary iron alloy, once again there to hold the enchantment in place. </p><p>And, the enchantment was far too complicated to even start making sense. I didn’t waste any time before I threw it toward my enemies. It managed to catch them in surprise even as it hit one of them in the chest … only to bounce helplessly. </p><p>Whatever enchantment was on the bolt, it didn’t trigger when I threw it by hand. </p><p>I threw two more, and they bounced off nearby rocks, and their lack of reaction implying that my method of using the bolts was utterly useless. Still, I threw a few more until I had reached one of my safe houses. I pulled the hatch to enter, placed the remaining ballista bolts there, and grabbed a bunch of throwing spears, as well as the spear-thrower I had designed. </p><p>Well, “designed” was a big word. A spear-thrower, or atlatl as my anthropologist friends insisted to call it, was one of the first inventions the early humans had ever come up with, believed to be in use for almost thirty thousand years. </p><p>It was attached to the bottom of the spear and folded against it. Then, the spear was thrown by the action of the upper arm and wrist. Atlatl acted as a low-mass, fast-moving extension of the throwing arm, increasing the length of the lever, and allowing the thrower to impart force to the dart over a longer distance, thus putting more energy and allowing for higher speeds.</p><p>Though, in my case, there was one other advantage. I designed the atlatl to hold my mana so that I could imbue the javelin as I wanted. Not only did it cause more damage, but, as an added benefit, it might have caused an outside observer to mistake the source of the attack, and assume that I had some kind of magical device rather than Essence Stat. </p><p>It wasn’t a guarantee, but I had done all that was needed to do so, including making the atlatl needlessly ornamental, with gold and silver fittings on the surface. It did look like a weapon purchased from the System shop. </p><p>Now, it was time for a field test. I moved away from the entrance, zeroing in on my first target: The scout. Not only was he not wearing heavy armor, which made him a good target for the ranged attack, but also his direction was a critical part of their strategy. </p><p>I channeled some of my Mana to the spear, weakening its structure appropriately as I targeted him, and released it. </p><p>[-40 Mana]</p><p>To his credit, the scout tried to dodge the attack. The combination of Dexterity and Perception gave him a chance despite the mist significantly restricting his vision. When all of it added up, however, even his supernatural abilities didn't help. </p><p>The spear not only hit, but the weakened structure started to shatter into razor-sharp, mana-soaked shards as it hit his chest with enough momentum to shred his clothing. The damage was severe, but Health was already helping him to recover. </p><p>[-37 Mana]</p><p>[-28 Mana]</p><p>Two more spears, one targeting his head, stopped that recovery. I couldn’t help but wince as I killed another man. It was not a good way to go. </p><p>“Take cover,” one of them shouted in panic. The one with the Intelligence tried to give some orders to change it, quick to realize that ranged attack had only been effective on the scout because of his lack of armor, but his command went unheeded as the orders conflicted. </p><p>One disadvantage of mixing the various guilds. </p><p>I decided to fuel their worry even further. I threw another spear, but this time, the mana worked the opposite way. Rather than spreading through its structure to weaken its integrity, it focused on the spearhead, reinforcing the impact point as much as possible. </p><p>[-95 Mana]</p><p>Then, I threw it to the one with Intelligence, one that was doing his best to control them. The spear sank into his right elbow, making him drop his sword in pain. </p><p>Loss of the only calm voice didn’t help their panic. It was a good moment to attack them … if I had the ability to deal with a team of armored soldiers. Unfortunately, I did not. Health made that process very troubling. </p><p>Even with the hammer I used against the gargantuan monsters, it wasn’t a challenge I would be willingly embracing. Without it, it was hopeless. Instead, I had just absorbed the mana from a few shells while they tried to recover, threw two more spears at the stragglers, and forced them to gather together to defend against the inevitable assault. </p><p>Then, I ran away to meet up with Eleanor. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 84</p><p>I found Eleanor fighting a surprisingly effective hit-and-run battle, using her speed and Dexterity to the best of her ability. She wasn’t incredibly fast. I could see that her speed was somewhat comparable to Fleeting Step, though it was considerably more flexible. She was making movements too sudden for me to replicate even with Floating Stride, and it helped her to be never surrounded. </p><p>However, while that ability helped her to never be surrounded, it wasn’t helping her to actually deal the finishing blow. The reinforcements — the ones that failed to distract — had arrived, their numbers ensuring that Eleanor couldn’t focus on one enemy at a time. There were a few bodies on the ground, but it was likely that they had been slain before the reinforcements had arrived. </p><p>And, whenever an exhausted one retreated back, the potions and concentrated nutrition bars were in place to help them recover their Health. </p><p>Eleanor was incredible as she danced around them despite the numbers, her confidence not faltering even for a second, but I could see that her fighting style had been geared more toward evasive action and defense than stopping power. Not shocking, considering stopping power was one thing Maria didn’t lack. She just needed to keep Maria safe against the enemies while she spread destruction. </p><p>Unfortunately, without Maria, her lack of stopping power, particularly against armored figures, was showing. Her ranged attacks weren’t enough to easily pass through the high-grade armor. Not that she was using them often, no doubt careful about depleting her Health. </p><p>Admittedly, I was tempted to just turn my back and leave. I didn’t know what encouraged — or forced — Thomas to pull such an intense ambush, but it was certain that this wasn’t the end. From what I could derive from my limited interactions in mind, he seemed entitled and greedy. A bad combination, particularly when confronted with failure. </p><p>Back before the Cataclysm, I had dealt with people like him a lot, often in the form of trust-fund students who were under the impression that their family money should somehow afford them a passing grade. But, occasionally, I had dealt with them as a part of a disciplinary committee — yet another pointless time sink I had to deal with before the Cataclysm — where I had to examine their ‘discretions’ quite a bit. </p><p>Rich and popular, they were not used to losing on topics they cared about, feeling entitled to success. Some just threw a tantrum before avoiding the topic of failure, while others doubled down. </p><p>Thomas clearly belonged to the second category, the kind that would take such a loss personally. Another attack would inevitably arrive.</p><p>In that attack, it was certain that he would escalate things further. Yes, I had my setup, but now that the proof of concept of dungeon exploration was in place, I could easily move my things to another location. It was a smart decision. Looking rationally, no one could claim that I actually owed Maria or Eleanor anything. Anything I took, I had paid back more than tenfold. </p><p>Yes, I earned a lot, but I didn’t owe them for the benefits they hadn’t intended to give. </p><p>However, it didn’t change the fact that, since the Cataclysm, they were the first people I had truly bonded with. Hours of playing chess with Maria despite being demolished repeatedly, Eleanor’s constant badgering for another spar, the long dinners whenever we managed to get some time from our busy schedule. </p><p>“God damn it,” I growled as I had committed to a stupid, short-sighted, sentimental decision that I was sure would give me an endless amount of trouble. </p><p> I swung my arm, bringing the atlatl down.  </p><p>[-46 Mana] </p><p>Another spear let loose. This time, I wasn’t targeting a scout, on alert against the possible attacks, but one with his back turned at me, unaware of the risk. The spear exploded and took him from the back of his head. </p><p>The result wasn’t pretty. </p><p>Once again, the dungeon mist worked to my benefit, especially since the scouts had been working hard to stay out of Eleanor’s way, spread at the outside of the formation to track Eleanor to limit her mobility advantage. It meant, they weren’t able to see each other, the shocked cries of the other fighters weren’t enough to inform them about the true nature of the threat. </p><p>Before the crowd could even realize what had happened, I moved around, taking down all of the scouts. Eleanor looked equally surprised about the development, but it didn’t prevent her from moving forward to take down the surprised attackers. </p><p>I stayed outside their range even after I had finished dealing with the scouts, this time aiming for the armor joints. The damage from the armor-piercing variant might not be as dangerous, but it still blocked their mobility enough to give Eleanor an opportunity. The tacit cooperation was enough to allow us to take down six more permanently before they pulled back into a defensive formation that made my throwing spears useless. </p><p>Since only two spears remained, it was not exactly a great loss. </p><p>Eleanor, realizing the situation had reached a stalemate, pulled back. I approached her from the other direction, and once I walked her into her field of view. She looked at me in shock, which was to be expected. What I was afraid of was to find suspicion or hostility. Luckily, those emotions were absent. I was sure of it, as Eleanor wasn’t a particularly difficult person to read. </p><p>A part of me was glad that it was Eleanor and not Maria I had revealed it. While Eleanor had a sense of directness that didn’t appreciate subterfuge, she was grounded enough not to take my sudden reveal personally. </p><p>At least, under the current circumstances. </p><p>She had enough presence of mind to not speak at the earshot of the others as we retreated back. She just made a questioning gesture, but when I gestured for her to follow me, she didn’t complain, moving full speed as she followed me.</p><p>I didn’t know whether it was the reveal of my surprise, or the overwhelming number of enemies that convinced her to retreat without complaining, but either way, I was too happy with the outcome to question it. </p><p>“Someone has been keeping secrets,” she said, but only after we had put almost a mile distance between us and the hostile party. </p><p>“I have been told a little mystery looked good on a man,” I responded even as I gave her a comical pose with my sword. With my bushy silver beard, no doubt ridiculous, but she didn’t laugh. I shrugged. She must be still under the effect of the adrenaline. </p><p>She spoke almost a minute later, when we stood at the dungeon gate leading to the third floor. “Why are we going down?” she asked. “Shouldn’t we return to the first floor?” </p><p>I was glad that she was asking about it rather than ordering what to do. I must have really impressed her. “Not before we pick some gear from my stash. We don’t know if they have any other nasty surprises.” With that, I stepped through the gate. </p><p>“Nasty surprises, like what?” she asked. </p><p>”Well, the ballista squad, for one,” I commented casually, only for her to actually stumble. </p><p>“Ballistas, really?” she asked, shocked. For once, she actually looked unsettled. I didn’t blame her. A lucky ballista shot might not have killed her, but it didn’t need to. All it would have taken was for it to impair her mobility for a while, and the fight would have ended very much differently. </p><p>“Yes, all organized by a bodyguard of Thomas, I have seen him,” I said, then gave her a quick summary of everything that happened, all while still running at her maximum speed, easily killing any monster that we came across. </p><p>She listened to me without interruption, but I was too familiar with her to miss her growing suspicion. I didn’t blame her, as she lacked one critical piece of information that explained how I was able to outplay the enemy with such ease. </p><p>“Is it the camouflage ring?” she asked, finally interrupting me toward the end of my story, only to pause. “No, it doesn’t make sense —” she continued, only to gasp in shock. “No, you can’t be serious,” she said even as she put some distance between us. </p><p>It wasn’t the fear that made her retreat. Instead, she just raised two hands and raised six fingers from fifty yards away … a distance that I wasn’t supposed to be able to see her. </p><p>“Four and two,” I said, unable to keep a smirk away even as she looked absolutely shocked. I wasn’t stretching the reveal to mock her. Instead, I was letting her piece things together on her own, hoping that it would help her to process the other secrets I was planning to reveal. </p><p>I didn’t know if I would reveal all my secrets, but any decent subset would be shocking enough to be worth wasting a few seconds here. </p><p>She showed me a few numbers, and even wrote a few words in the air for me to read, which I told her with ease. As her shock melted into acceptance, she made one last gesture. “And, what’s this number?” she asked. </p><p>It was one. A special one. “Well, that’s just rude,” I said with an exaggerated offended tone. </p><p>“Sorry, professor,” she responded with a soft laugh even as she closed the distance, and we started moving once again. “So, you have managed to kill a dungeon boss,” she commented. </p><p>“No,” I said, and she looked insulted. It was a mean way of extracting information from her, but her disbelief just confirmed that there was no way of expanding the vision range without actually dispelling the mist — at least, to her knowledge. Old habits die hard. I quickly amended my statement. “I have killed four of them.” </p><p>She fell into silence once again, thinking for a long while. “You consumed the crystals yourself, right?” she asked. I nodded. “No wonder you were able to outplay the ambush so easily,” she commented. “Surprising.” </p><p>I nodded. She was right. It was surprising, but she was handling it well. I must have impressed her more than I had expected for her to so easily accept my claim of soloing a dungeon boss, let alone multiple. </p><p>I just hoped that she would be just as accepting of all the other secrets I was about to reveal. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 85</p><p>Soon, we were standing in front of the cave that held my best gear. I could have gone in and grabbed my weapons immediately, but before doing that, I turned to her. “I need you to promise me something.” </p><p>She gestured for me to continue. “Go ahead.” </p><p>“I need you to swear that you’ll keep what I’m about to reveal to you a secret. It’s a matter of life and death,” I said. For a moment, she looked affronted, like I had just asked her to deface a monument to her religion. It clicked. “Except Maria, of course,” I added. “I know you two come as a package deal. I won’t ask you to keep secrets from her.” </p><p>I would have if it had any chance of working, but it was a moot point.  </p><p>She lost her tenseness. “Better,” she said. “But, I won’t make any promises in her place.” </p><p>“As long as you help me convince her to keep it a secret,” I bargained. I wasn’t entirely sure if it working, but I wasn’t under any delusion. The moment I decided to help Eleanor openly, I knew that they would pay more attention to my actions. </p><p>It was inevitable. Previously, no matter how much potential I had offered, I didn’t represent an actual threat. What I had displayed while helping Eleanor proved that I was able to fight on the same stage as them. It meant attention, which would eventually lead to the reveal of my secrets. </p><p>Voluntarily revealing them looked much better. </p><p>“Let’s see what makes you so tense,” she said even as I swiped the rocks from the entrance and revealed the safe house to her. There were several notable items, but at the center of the room stood my armor, placed on a mannequin, and next to it, stood my three weapons. </p><p>“Looks pretty, but hardly a big reveal,” she commented even as I walked toward the stand. “I was kind of suspicious that you’re holding back a new alloy based on the number of shells you collected without the assistance of your new guild, but mentioning killing a dungeon boss pretty much settled it. You need to be able to ignore the corrosion completely to actually spend that much time on the fourth floor.” </p><p>“Fifth floor, actually,” I corrected, which made her look at me with a sudden shock, which made me believe that it was a big deal. Admittedly, considering the difference between the fourth and fifth floors, it was certainly a big deal, but I seemed to guess that just by the mention of the fifth floor. </p><p>I needed to learn what was common knowledge and what was not. </p><p>“How?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, I’m sure this will answer some of your questions,” I said as I threw her the sword, hilt first. She caught the sword, almost absent-minded, but the moment she swung the sword absentmindedly, she froze like she had been struck by thunder. </p><p>“Impossible,” she gasped as she let Health cover the sword, which stretched significantly. “I … just…” </p><p>I smirked even as I realized the best way of getting rid of her. “Why don’t you go out and test it for a moment and meanwhile, I can change.” </p><p>She didn’t even deign to answer my question even as she stepped out. I changed into the other armor, grabbed my hammer and spear, and went out. On my waist, I still had the sword I used publicly, which wasn’t as good as the one I had given to Eleanor. </p><p>I wasn’t stupid enough to try and get back the sword from Eleanor … at least, not before I forged one of her own that fit her style even better. I shrugged. I still had my hammer and spear, which was already more useful against the upcoming battle. </p><p>The hammer in particular. I could hardly wait until I smashed their faces and — </p><p>I paused, my own smug satisfaction made me do a double-take. I was thinking about killing people. It was a deep, solemn event. But, I was treating it as a challenge to be cleared, almost like an exciting problem.  </p><p>I wondered if it had something to do with the fact that they were determined to ambush us, or if was I simply getting too used to violence because I had spent my days in violence. Yes, it was against mindless monsters, but it was clearly making me more callous to death. </p><p>“Maybe I’m the crazy one for actually trying to treat life as something sacred,” I muttered as I continued to put on my armor. After all, people had been doing their best to treat life as a currency — and not a particularly valuable one — as they tried to climb the ladder of power, both the system and the social kind. </p><p>However, the moment I finished putting on armor, I abandoned those thoughts. Not permanently, but there were better ways to handle a potential ambush. Regardless of my own feelings — or lack thereof — the ones that ambushed us needed to be dealt with. </p><p>I was afraid of what they would do next. </p><p>I replenished my throwing spears, and left the hideout. Outside, Eleanor was practicing her skill attacks, her face contorted in a familiar excitement while the life aura around her sword was thicker than I had ever seen. “Let me guess, you have earned a few skill points.” </p><p>“Try a lot instead. I have gained six points. It’s absurd,” she responded even as we started to run back. “Is this how you managed to improve that much in such a short time? I can see why you want to keep this a secret.” </p><p>“Yes, I don’t think a lot of city lords would appreciate the prospect of lower classes getting stronger,” I said. </p><p>“But they would love to have those swords,” she commented, looking confused. </p><p>“Enough to keep me a guest forever,” I responded. “Before I make any kind of decision, I want to be strong enough.” </p><p>“Then, why did you come here in the first place and play along,” she said. “Aren't there better ways to access a dungeon.” </p><p>“Well...” I said, realizing that she misunderstood the timeline of my development. I wanted to let her continue believing in that. Not due to any practical reason, but solely because I was ashamed. But, even the harmless lies had a way of coming out, and the last thing I needed was for her to believe my presence to be some kind of conspiracy. </p><p>So, as we traveled back, I gave her an abridged version of my story, up until their recruitment. It didn’t take long, as it was hardly a riveting story. “Really?” she said, chuckling in amusement. “The genius professor wasted three years of his life doing nothing but sending applications.” </p><p>I shrugged. As much as I wanted to defend myself about the impact of the peace field and how it potentially impacted people who lived in towns, I held back. Not because I wanted to keep it a secret, but because that particular topic needed far more time than we currently had to properly explain. “I have to admit it was not my finest moment, but it worked out. Without your help, I doubt I could improve my combat skills in such a short time,” I said. I wasn’t sure if it was entirely true, but being generous with credit was almost always a better choice.  </p><p>“Yes, you owe me,” Eleanor said, her smile widening. “Wait until Maria learned I managed to help you more than those silly experiments.” </p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far. After all, it was her experiments that allowed me to unlock Essence. Without her, I couldn’t use Mana ...” I continued, only to stop when I noticed Eleanor had stopped, and was falling behind me. </p><p>“Y-you can use mana,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>There, I realized that I had yet to mention that fact. “Well, yes,” I said even as I raised the sword, and let the mana gather around the edge, which turned mana into something actually visible rather than something that could be sensed through Essence. </p><p>“How?” she repeated. “The only way to unlock new stats is to upgrade class skills, and the skill stones that allow it are nearly impossible to find,” she said. </p><p>“Maybe, but it doesn’t exclude upgrading the skill directly,” I said. She looked at me blankly. “I’m sure upgrading the rarity of the skills through practice is not a secret.” </p><p>“Well, no,” she said. “But, it only upgrades to the rarer variant of the same skill.” </p><p>“Not always,” I replied, remembering my own experience with Meditation, which upgraded to Cleansing meditation. “And, sometimes, achieving something incredible, like creating a mana-infused metal alloy can actually upgrade the skill to a rarer variant.” </p><p>She gasped. “T-that’s a game changer.” </p><p>“Believe me, I’m aware. Why do you think I’m keeping all those secrets? People kill for much less.” I didn’t have any concerns about revealing that to Eleanor, as paradoxically, it would help her to keep my secret even better. </p><p>Ironically, the bigger the secret, the harder it is to sell.  My ability to forge weapons that even Eleanor couldn’t access from the market was a secret she could have sold for a king’s ransom. </p><p>The potential to upgrade production classes … was the kind of secret the buyer would have killed everyone just to prevent any accidents. </p><p>Hopefully, Eleanor was smart enough to realize that as well. </p><p>She stood silent for a while, her expression shifting. “We will talk about it later,” she finally declared. “We have a battle to win.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, we will,” I said, feeling excited at the prospect. The information I managed to glean from both of them allowed me to improve significantly. I was enthusiastic about what a true collaboration could bring. </p><p>But first, we had a battle to win. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After a productive day of research, we managed to discover a relatively reliable method of breakthrough, which was mostly about my ability to directly manipulate Qi, something pure martial artists, both ancient and modern, lacked. </p><p>Unfortunately, it came with its own problems. </p><p>I ended up face to face with Lannayin and Elsana, with both of them looking at me, determined, making me wish that we weren’t as successful. “Are you sure you want to try?” I asked. “We can just leave here, and I’m sure I’ll figure out an alternative way to develop a new, independent spiritual pillar. You just need to show patience.” </p><p>“No,” Lannayin said, her voice showing an anger that she had never done before. “I won’t turn my back, not after being betrayed and thrown away.” </p><p>I looked at Elsana, hoping that she would change her mind. Instead, she nodded her head decisively as well. </p><p>“So be it,” I said even as I sighed. I disagreed with their decision, feeling it was hasty, and put them at too much of a risk. I did my best to dissuade them, but since they seemed to be determined, I could only let them try. </p><p>I might have said that it would create strategic problems for me, but it would be a lie. Actually, the situation was the exact opposite. The Treasure Pavilion was already doing its best to break into the mountain, and Lannayin and Elsana had known qualities for them. </p><p>From a selfish perspective, their breakthrough actually helped me to conceal my existence and retreat in case of failure. I still had certain fears about how to prevent them from following me back to the mortal domain, but those fears were valid whether they broke through or not. </p><p>Ultimately, it was their decision. </p><p>“So, how do we do?” Lannayin asked. </p><p>“You have two options,” I said even as I focused on learning. “Either each of you continues to embody the aspects that you’re used to, or we can try to focus on developing a whole Burning Ice concept,” I said. </p><p>“We will go with our original aspects,” Elsana cut in. “Trying to comprehend the Burning Ice concept will take months to do properly. We don’t have that much time.” </p><p>Lannayin looked surprised at Elsana’s decisive comment, but seemed to accept that decision. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked. </p><p>“Why? Does it make us weaker or something?” Lannayin asked. </p><p>“Not from a pure power perspective,” I admitted. “Actually, it would help you exert even more power from the mountain since one of you could focus on the storm while the other handles the volcano, but with a drawback. Unless both of you stay in the mountain and cooperate perfectly, it’ll affect your ability to channel the power of the mountain.” </p><p>“That’s acceptable,” Lannayin said. “What do we do?” </p><p>“Each of you move to your elemental alignment, and start meditating,” I said. “Once you align with the aspect correctly, I’ll start linking you with the mountain, using Qi as a bridge.” </p><p>Lannayin looked at Elsana, who nodded at her, confirming that it was the method. “Do we do it together?” </p><p>“That would be better,” I said. “Otherwise, I’m afraid it might unbalance the elemental harmony of the mountain.” </p><p>Amusingly, for all the guidance in the notes, the distilled core of the recommendation wasn’t too different. Go to a place to connect with the spiritual pillar directly, and open oneself completely to connect it directly. </p><p>That explained why nine out of ten people had failed. They were opening their existence to a spiritual pillar which was a combination of an active volcano and an endless storm. Regardless of their will, fluctuation would have been enough to destroy them completely. </p><p>No wonder the sects had been falling behind the Everdawn Empire before the arrival of the cultivators. While I didn’t have the true technique of the Everdawn Empire to compare, I could imagine that, by having the emperor as their spiritual pillar, they could reach the Spiritual Infusion realm far better. </p><p>Luckily, while the method of breakthrough was fascinating, the mechanics were not that elusive. I created a formation between the mountain and them, which would essentially function as a barrier. That way, instead of trying to wrestle with the mountain at once, they would face it slowly. </p><p>Lannayin sat on an obsidian platform, right at the edge of the volcano, her feet inches away from the bubbling magma, while Elsana sat on a platform of pure ice. They were not just ordinary seats, but also spiritual pillars on their own rights, essentially carrying the echo of the mountain, creating a path for them to follow. </p><p>I rubbed my temples even as I adjusted the formation. While the mechanics of the breakthrough was simple, it wasn’t actually easy. It was considerably safer than the original method, but considering the original method represented only a one-in-ten chance, that wasn’t as meaningful as I had hoped. </p><p>I took a deep breath, and started adjusting the formation, the passive Qi connection between the mountain and them slowly strengthening. </p><p>Lannayin let out a gasp as she connected with the intense essence of fire, her breath looking hot enough to melt the metal directly. I shivered, glad that there was a formation to manage the connection. I had a feeling that, trying to handle a full connection the way she had just tried would have evaporated half of her body. </p><p>Meanwhile, Elsana raised her hand, needles of ice dancing freely with little side effect.</p><p>I said nothing about the method they picked to handle the strengthening connection. It was entirely about their perception, which had been shaped by the way they had used their martial arts for years. I would have preferred to change it, but that would have required weeks and months … a time we lacked. </p><p>I connected with their meditative seats, noting every hint of change, my understanding of the Spirit Infusion realm changing every second. Having two living examples, especially ones under my direct control of formations, allowing me to catch every hint of change, was a treasure trove, especially compared to the dated diaries of a few martial artists who didn’t know what they were attempting. </p><p>It was an even more intimate process than I had first assumed, a part of their souls mingling with the mountain. The connection with the mountain was intense, enough that I suspected it to be impossible to reverse.</p><p>At least, I couldn’t imagine a method with my current Alchemy knowledge. Suddenly, the providence rushed toward them, bypassing the formation with ease as it bonded directly with them, with an intensity that shocked me. </p><p>I was glad I didn’t try it on myself first. </p><p>The reaction of providence scared me even though I could sense that there was nothing wrong with their bodies … well, other than a sudden deficiency of energy, but that was easy to handle. The formation allowed me to inject essence directly, and the spiritual pillar indirectly provided them with Qi. </p><p>I loosened the formation, letting them bond with the spirit of the mountain fully. The riskiest part was already done, and with the providence mingling with their bodies intensely, I guessed that trying to restrict the interaction would do more harm than good. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was merely a guess. At this point, whatever that was going on had stopped being something I could interfere with. I could only observe … especially since I suspected whatever the two had been transforming was more than ordinary Spirit Infusion realm martial artists. </p><p>“I wonder if that was your plan all along,” I muttered, looking at the mountain. </p><p>The battle between two kinds of providence was still not something I could understand, but one thing was clear. The part that was on the side of the ancient martial arts was losing, while the one that favored the cultivators was winning, and only when my System devoured the energy from the winning side, the losing side have a chance to strike back. </p><p>First by leading me to Marana, then to Elsana and Lannayin. An encounter that seemed to be a thing of the past, only for me to encounter them in the current situation, just when I was looking for a solution. </p><p>Elsana waved her hand, and the storm suddenly raged. Around her, it was nothing more than a gentle dress, but the sudden burst toward the cultivator fleet was something else. </p><p>Though, the sight of it wasn’t as scary as Lannayin who had just stepped onto the magma, only to walk over it like it was a gentle spring garden. She waved her hand, and the volcano exploded. </p><p>Power-wise, their moves weren’t too different than my trick with the Land Mastery. But, the control they displayed was incredible. The blizzard caught the cultivators with total surprise, and the magma punched through the defenses of the giant cultivator ship, evaporating a giant hole in the middle. </p><p>The ship immediately disappeared, the cultivators that were still outside falling victim to the blizzard. However, I didn’t fear the sudden violence. </p><p>I could feel that it was the Providence using the opportunity to strike back… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t move too far away from the medical wing, just moved closer to the bubbling magma, the red light giving me enough read the metal plates. It was not the greatest source of illumination, but considering the text was about how to progress in martial arts that had been developed based on the volcano, it felt poetically appropriate. </p><p> I sat cross-legged on the warm floor, glad that metal plates were far less susceptible to being blown away by the merciless winds of blizzard. </p><p>The plates in front of me were explaining the greatest secret of the Burning Ice martial arts school. How to break through to the next stage of the martial arts. </p><p>Even with all my existing information, deciphering it was not an easy process. A part of it was about their usual habit of using flowery language and pointless metaphors, but that, I had long gotten used to. Their description of Land Mastery was equally obtuse, but it didn’t prevent me from making rapid progress. </p><p>Unfortunately, this time, the problem wasn’t just limited to it. The advice was simply … poor. It was not a professional guide. It was better to call it a diary of a few old sect masters and grand elders, sharing anecdotes on why they were successful. </p><p>That would have been bad enough if their advice was accurate. But, reading their accounts, I could see that it was sheer luck that allowed them to succeed, making me feel like I was reading a rich man’s advice on how to get rich, where the first advice was winning the lottery. </p><p>Admittedly, the rate of success they mentioned wasn’t as horrible, but one in ten wasn’t acceptable odds from my perspective. Especially since it required someone to be the peak of the Blood Essence realm to try it in the first place. </p><p>And, unlike our case where I was able to mass produce them due to my transcendental medical capabilities, for the Burning Ice sect, the peak Blood Essence members were a rare commodity, each one representing a critical elder. It meant, in terms of breaking through, their advice was, well, not exactly worthless, but close to it. </p><p>Luckily, the same wasn’t true for the actual mechanics of the realm. First-rate martial artist, officially called Spirit Infusion Realm, was characterized by the martial artists' ability to evoke the spiritual pillar outwardly as a weapon. </p><p>From the descriptions, it was similar to a Qi Gathering realm, at least in terms of outwardly manifesting their power and creating external effects. I had no doubt that the actual power of those attacks was more similar to peak Foundation Establishment cultivators than actual Golden Core ones, but with an endurance no cultivator that could match. </p><p>The biggest drawback of the cultivators was always their slow recovery time. A Golden Core elder, if exhausted, required somewhere between weeks to months to recover depending on their immortal root and the spirit vein they could access. Things were worse if their cultivation was damaged. Fixing those problems could take years. </p><p>Though, considering they could reliably cosplay as a nuclear bomb before getting exhausted, it wasn’t exactly as big of a drawback as it seemed at first glance. </p><p>Once again, there was no explicit mention of Qi in the cultivation arts, but reading the personal notes, I could deduce that the existence of Qi was something implicit. Deciphering the way essence and spiritual totems worked, along with some logical conclusions, I could reliably tell that, the outward manifestation was just a form of Qi attack. Only, instead of directing it directly as a cultivator would, the spiritual totem acted as a medium. </p><p>In a way, it was similar to how I used formations, interacting with Qi indirectly, but through a different method, with its own advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>However, as I continued to read, I noticed a distinct absence of one detail. There was no method to detect the presence of Qi, or any suggestions on how to avoid it. Assuming they had other auxiliary methods for that would be reasonable, but, what I had seen underneath the capital led me in a different direction. </p><p>What if Qi was everywhere before cultivators arrived and made sure it wasn’t the case anymore. </p><p>“I feel like a conspiracy theorist. The only thing that’s missing is the lizard people,” I grumbled as I stopped thinking about the wider implications, instead focusing on how to break into Spiritual Infusion Realm. </p><p>That led me to rethink everything about martial arts. </p><p>The third-rate realm, had been straightforward enough. It was the activation of martial essence throughout various parts of the body starting from muscles and ending up in gates, a fundamental awakening that prepared the body for the next stage. </p><p>Then came the Blood Essence realm, demeaning a far more radical transformation, including the very blood in the veins. A process that would have to take years if it wasn’t for the existence of a cheater like me. </p><p>Now, Spirit Infusion loomed before me. The only thing I had was a vague direction to work forward, with nothing in between. The notes had some vague mentions of merging with the true essence of martial arts, which I assumed to be a deeper embrace of the spiritual totem.</p><p>The trick was to discover a path that didn’t end up death for nine-tenths of a time. Maybe I should collect some cultivation techniques of Golden Core, to see if it could help. But, before I could start that, Elsana walked toward me, with Lannayin behind her. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel amused when Lannayin threw an icy gaze my way. She said nothing, just grunted in anger before she stumped forward, walking into the storm. </p><p>“Sorry about her,” Elsana said. “She’s still on the edge.” </p><p>“Perfectly understandable,” I answered. “It’s not fun to suddenly wake up in a new situation that’s forced upon you. It takes a while to process.” </p><p>Elsana gave me a questioning glance, but I just shrugged. I wasn’t sure I was ready to share the exact circumstances of how I ended up in this world even now. It wasn’t worth the risk. “What are you working on,” she asked. </p><p>“I’m trying to see how to break into the third major realm for martial arts,” I said. </p><p>She gasped. “R-really?” </p><p>I winked at her, implying that I was doing it for her, earning a beautiful blush in return. It was not a lie. While I eventually wanted to discover it, her status was the reason the topic suddenly jumped up in priority. </p><p>She followed with a hug, which might have been more if it wasn’t for the risk of Lannayin’s return. “Do you need any help?” </p><p>“I would appreciate some brainstorming assistance,” I said. “Here’s what I know…” </p><p>With that, I gave her a summary of everything I had discovered about the ancient martial arts. “We’re looking for a way to bond the martial artist with the spiritual pillar on a deeper level,” she said. She glanced at the volcano and the storm, the physical representation of the pillar she was stuck with. “If the mountain gets destroyed…” </p><p>“I don’t know what would happen, but I don’t think it’ll be good. In the best case, you’ll lose most of your power,” I admitted. </p><p>“What a choice,” she said with a deep sigh. “Either I lose everything, or I fight against an army of cultivators alone —” </p><p>She was cut short as I flicked her nose. “First of all, you’re not alone,” I said. </p><p>“I can’t ask you to fight them for me.” </p><p>I chuckled. “First of all, you certainly can,” I said. “You earned the right. Also, it’s not like I’m here for you. As much as I’m glad I saved you, don’t forget that I was already here, trying to defend the place before your arrival. I will adjust my plans, but not as substantially as you think. And, if you can break into the next realm, my life will be much easier.” </p><p>She gave a weak smile. “It makes the decision easier.” </p><p>“Then, let me make it harder again. I’m sure that, eventually, we can figure out how to completely erase the signs of the ancient martial arts from your body, so that you can recultivate Snow Blossom technique.” </p><p>“I appreciate the attempt, but for good or ill, I’m locked in this path,” Elsana said, her expression tight. Her decisiveness surprised me, but maybe it should not. After all, she was still the woman who had built a local powerhouse alchemy house and her own martial arts style from a mere glimpse of the Burning Ice concept. </p><p>“So, you want to break through,” I said. “How about Lannayin?” </p><p>“She’ll be even more enthusiastic. She doesn’t take betrayal well. But, are you sure? If we reach the next stage, we’ll bond with the volcano and the storm. That much is clear. It means that you’ll lose a great opportunity.” </p><p>I waved my hand. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be happy as long as the mountain stays intact,” I said, which was true. As much as I wanted to learn ancient martial arts and improve, I didn’t want to do it if it created a mountain-sized — literally — weakness for my enemies to exploit. </p><p>For me, two successful breakthrough attempts were far more than what I could hope for. </p><p>“Let’s study,” I said as I passed her the metal tablet. “The sooner we succeed, the sooner we can celebrate.”</p><p>That earned a slap to the shoulder and a giggle. </p><p>Too bad we had to study first. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I rushed to their side, not wanting them to wake up alone. Waking up meant that their situation wasn’t critical anymore, but their cultivation was still filled with problems. The last thing I wanted was for them to panic and try to use their power, putting themselves back in a critical condition. </p><p>As for disguise, I didn’t wear any. For them, I was Arthanum, giving them a familiar face was much better than trying to juggle yet another fake identity. Luckily, the existence of the fake mystic land gave me a chance to explain my power. </p><p>“I’m so glad I don’t have to undersell my abilities for once,” I muttered. If there was one critical advantage to the situation, with their expertise in the ancient martial arts. The System didn’t reward me with ancient martial arts or registered the strength from it as power — which, admittedly, started to make more sense once I realized the existence of two different types of Providence — meaning I didn’t need to create some complicated situations to make them provide gifts for me. </p><p>It was a nice change of pace. </p><p>Though, even then, I needed to pick a direction. I either had to admit that I had Qi cultivation, or I would disguise myself as a martial artist. Both had their advantages and disadvantages, but I decided to settle on Qi cultivation. </p><p>After all, most of my abilities were still reliant on that side, from Alchemy to formations. </p><p>I moved to the edge of the caldera, where they had been resting. It was a semi-open area, the magma bubbling underneath while the blizzard raged on over us, swirling furiously around their bed. At thief first glance, it looked like a terrible medical wing, exposed to elements, but considering their unique condition, it was inevitable. </p><p>It was also the reason why Elsana was placed at the side of the volcano, while Lannayin was at the core of the blizzard. I was trying to balance their unbalanced essence with external forces. I sat on the floor, waiting for them to wake up. </p><p>Elsana stirred for the first time since I had pulled her from the brink. Her eyes fluttered open, blue and sharp as shards of ice — a temporary effect of her new martial cultivation —  immediately narrowing as she took in the surroundings. Then, her gaze fell on me, and her expression was replaced with shock. </p><p>“A-am I dreaming?” she muttered. </p><p>I stood up slowly, making sure to make no threatening move just in case. Luckily, she wasn’t alarmed, so I continued walking toward her. “Well, if it’s a dream, it’s a good one,” I said as I stood next to her, watching her reaction. </p><p>Seeing her lean toward me, I gently put my hand on her cheek, and she leaned against it. The moment stretched, gentleness contrasting with the howls of the blizzard and bubbling of magma. For a long while, she said nothing. </p><p>Silence stretched until a flicker of surprise passed through her face. “H-how?” she stammered. </p><p>“You need to be a little more descriptive, and beautiful,” I said, smiling. </p><p>That made her smile despite the situation. “Don’t be obtuse. You know what I mean.” </p><p>I chuckled. “I don’t,” I said. “Genuinely, I don’t,” I added when she looked at me, shifting to anger. “You might be asking about why I was here, in the depths of the misty mountains. You might be questioning how I saved you from the hands of the sect cultivators. You might be asking why I have the ability to use Qi… You might even wonder how I managed to achieve the impossible and got even more handsome —” </p><p>The last one earned a playful slap to my shoulder. I smiled even more. “I see that you’re still arrogant as ever,” she said, then she looked more serious. “No, I have an even more important question. Why do I still have my cultivation?” </p><p>“Because I helped,” I said. </p><p>“How?” she said. “Forcibly replacing our cultivation with the ancient variant was already deadly, and with that demonic artifact did to us… Saving our lives is incredible enough, but I can feel that my cultivation is stronger.” </p><p>“And, I’m sure you want the long answer,” I said, and she nodded seriously. It didn’t surprise me. There were aspects of life that she was frivolous, but her abilities as an apothecary were not one of those. “How about I give you a quick answer for now, and once we move you to a better place, we talk more in detail.” </p><p>She looked like she was about to argue, but looking at her best friend lying on the next bed, she said nothing, just nodded. </p><p>I appreciated the silent display of trust. Not rushing immediately to check Lannayin showed that she trusted me to cure her as well. </p><p>“How much do you learn about the spiritual pillar and their role in martial arts with the cultivators,” I asked. </p><p>She winced. “Not much, only that their existence was critical to reaching higher realms, and breakthroughs in this plane were strictly forbidden,” she said. “It’s one topic even our teachers are not allowed to learn about. Even the suspicion is enough to be executed.” </p><p>I nodded. Based on what I had learned, the precaution of the sects didn’t come as a surprise. </p><p>“And, what about ancient martial arts?” I followed. </p><p>“Slightly more, but mostly on how to identify it, and report to the sect so that they can be … exterminated, along with the city they had been discovered,” she said, her disgust apparent. “But, they don’t  have any problem raiding the ruins and selling the findings for profit.” </p><p>Good, I wasn’t the only one who was bothered by the cultivator’s utter lack of care about mortals and their insatiable greed. </p><p>“It means you know that the volcano is related to the ancient martial arts.” </p><p>“Yes, it’s why the sect sent us to the mission, thinking that the nature of our martial arts would help. But, we didn’t expect the team to be infiltrated by demonic cultivators. Suddenly, they killed the other half of the team by driving them to an ambush. The rest, I only remember the pain.” </p><p>“Alright. To keep it short …” I said, then gave her a breakdown of everything I had done to help her, from how I replaced the spiritual pillar with the presence of the blizzard around the volcano, how I replaced the essence with a stronger one to overwhelm the old parts, and how I separated them from the demonic artifact. </p><p>However, to make sure the explanation took only minutes rather than weeks, I only focused on the results, and not the process. For a change, it was not because I wanted to hide anything from her.  </p><p>Explaining how I combined alchemy and apothecary through formations and artifact refining to achieve what I did required a basis that I only had due to cheating, and required days to explain in a worthwhile manner. </p><p>Elsana might have realized it as well, as she didn’t interrupt me for a long time. “An impressive treatment. You have changed quite a bit,” she said. </p><p>“Not entirely my own efforts,” I said. “Once I had been taken away from Markas, the ones that took me brought me to a mystic land. There, I had an immortal encounter that taught me a lot.” </p><p>She nodded, not showing any doubt. The degree of improvement between our last encounter and the current one was so stark in terms of my capabilities, that nothing else but an immortal encounter explained it. </p><p>Admittedly, other than the timeline of that encounter, it was more or less the truth. It was possible to treat the System as some kind of immortal encounter on steroids, with lasting effects. One that, even failing at the assessment let me end up in a point that would have left every other cultivator jealous. </p><p>“It feels like a long time since everything happened, doesn’t it?” she asked. </p><p>“Yeah, the siege caught all of us unprepared,” I admitted even as I caressed her cheek, and she leaned against my palm once more. “It was a close call.” </p><p>She sighed. “It feels so long ago, but also it was yesterday,” she said as she grabbed my wrist, and pulled me to the bed. “Do you understand?” </p><p>“I do,” I said. “It’s okay to feel when you’re working hard, with days filled with nothing but work. Every day feels endless, yet, emotions and desires stay locked up, just as fresh.” </p><p>“As always, you speak too much,” she said with a chuckle before she pulled me for a quick kiss, one that had the potential to be more if it wasn’t for Lannayin starting to stir. “We’ll continue later,” she promised. </p><p>“I’ll hold you to that,” I said even as I stood up. “But, I better leave you alone with her. We don’t want her panicking. Just remember, no using your essence. I don’t want you ruining all my hard work.” </p><p>She gave me a grimace. “Damn, is this how it feels to be the patient?” </p><p>I just chuckled as I walked out, happy to see her mood recover. While she dealt with Lannayin, I studied, as I had a lot to learn. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Unfortunately, working on switching skills wasn't going as smoothly as I expected. “Umm, do it faster?” I suggested. </p><p>“Really, do it faster?” Eleanor grumbled even as she repeated the attempt, which was not any faster than her previous hundred attempts. The only thing that changed was her condition. She looked exhausted, unnaturally so. It reminded me of the time I pushed myself trying to modify my Meditation skills. </p><p>It was a good idea to stop it. I just needed to find a way to present it to her, which was hard, as every failure was making her more frustrated. “Is this all you have? I thought professors are supposed to be good at teaching.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but blush. “Actually, no,” I said. “I’m not exactly a good teacher of basics.” </p><p>“Really? But, you were a professor for a decade. Don’t you need to be a good teacher for it?” </p><p>“Not entirely. Being a professor has very little to do with actual teaching. That’s especially true for my case, where research was more important.” </p><p>“But, you were able to teach me how you have combined your hammer style with Stalwart Guard perfectly. And, there were the plans you prepared for the Blacksmiths, and they were able to learn from it.” </p><p>“That’s different. With the other Blacksmiths, I knew exactly what they knew, and what they didn't know since we share the same skill. Discussing martial skills with you is similar. You’re the expert, which is something I could keep up with easily. Teaching the basics to someone is different.” </p><p>“I hope it’s not an excuse to stop teaching me,” she said. </p><p>“Certainly not. Having a stronger protector is a necessity for a poor weak production class member like me,” I said, which earned a snort from her. </p><p>“Yes, you're the epitome of weakness. Not even level fifty, and already soloing dungeon bosses.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Speaking of making you stronger, I have a different exercise in mind.” </p><p>She looked at me stubbornly. “I don’t want to stop it before I can perfect it. It’s more valuable. I don’t care what else you have in mind.” </p><p>“As valuable as gaining the ability to use mana?” I asked. </p><p>The way her expression froze was beautiful. “But again, you’re the teacher. I should listen to you, right?” she responded, as if she wasn’t the one that declared it earlier. </p><p>“Let’s go and open the dungeon first. Then, we can work while watching the place. We might even catch a few spies.” </p><p>“We don’t want to reveal our training —” she started, then corrected herself. “We don’t have to. We can just climb on top of one of the hills and watch everyone without obstruction.” </p><p>“Exactly,” I said as I glanced around, measuring just how much my range improved after consuming thirteen crystals in total. I was glad to note that my vision had increased exponentially. Even on the third floor, I could comfortably see farther than a mile. “Our enemies will have a nasty surprise the next time they try to infiltrate the dungeon.” </p><p>“Yes, they will,” Eleanor said. </p><p>“Why don’t you go and reopen the dungeon while I pick up the necessary equipment,” I said. </p><p>“Equipment?” she asked. </p><p>“Yeah, I need to bring a small forge to the first floor. Maybe some excess gold and other equipment wouldn’t be amiss.” </p><p>“And, do you think it would be enough?” </p><p>“Frankly, I don’t know,” I answered. “It’s not like I have any baseline other than experiencing it myself. There was a chance that your Epic skill would make it easier. Or, maybe it would be the opposite, and it’ll slow us down. Either way, we need to experiment and see.” </p><p>“Fine,” Eleanor said, disappointed by my lackluster commitment. </p><p>“See you in half an hour,” I said. </p><p>“With one condition. We focus on teaching me how to use mana above everything else.” </p><p>“Except for an actual emergency,” I added, curious exactly why she had been focused on that aspect. </p><p>“Well, obviously,” she responded, her smirk making me think that I had missed something. \"Now, anything else?” </p><p>“Actually, yes,” I said. “I want you to use every attack given to you by your skill while I observe the results.” </p><p>“Do I have to walk closer?” she asked after a slight pause. </p><p>“No need,” I said even as I passed her a small, thin gold chain. “Just wrap this at the hilt of your sword, and it’ll be enough,” I said. </p><p>She nodded even as she followed my direction. “Every single attack?” she asked. </p><p>“Yeah, from the simplest to most complicated, as slow as you can manage,” I directed. “I’ll signal you to stop once I get a good handle on their structure.” </p><p>She cycled through her attacks, and each slowed down as I requested. Even as I did my best to memorize the attacks, I appreciated the display of trust she was showing. No matter what, the exact workings of her skill were a dangerous secret to give. I could design an armor to counter the special features of her vitality attacks, which would’ve made her life much harder in combat. </p><p>It was a good feeling to be trusted. </p><p>However, rather than lingering on that warm feeling, I focused on the concrete details of her skill to be able to help her properly. Not only would it be a good reward for the trust she was extending, but it would also help me. </p><p>A stronger Eleanor meant a safer dungeon. </p><p>Her attacks were interesting. Similar to my own Epic Skills — though in my case, they were limited to forging and farming — her sword skill had two types of release, which I temporarily named ordinary and dense releases. The ordinary release was mostly similar to my own combat skills, and the dense variant worked with similar principles, only more solid and damaging. </p><p>“I think I have learned enough,” I said. “I’ll pick up the necessary equipment while you handle the operation.” </p><p>“Fine. But, you only have half an hour, alright,” she said, unable to keep her enthusiasm down. I didn’t blame her. </p><p>As we split, I went back to the fourth floor, and filed a large cart with necessary items. A set of tools, some vitality-dense wood to create a fire, a manually-operated crusher to create the necessary mana density, several portable mana-resistant plates I designed to create a portable room, a thousand pounds of iron, split equally between ordinary and anti-corrosive, and some silver and gold. </p><p>It was significant extra work to carry everything to the first floor rather than experimenting here, but after the most recent ambush, it was much preferable to keep an eye on the dungeon entrance. Especially since our increased vision had made that task much easier. </p><p>Since everything was organized on the fourth floor, piling up the necessary equipment didn’t take as long as I expected, so I decided to forge several swords before leaving. I didn’t expect them to work immediately, but having a prototype would be useful. </p><p>I closed my eyes, remembering that fateful day I managed to attain Mana Forge, trying to isolate the steps. I had captured the mana from the fire that Maria had kept, perceived its presence through Analyze, and then connected it through Health I had forced into the metal with my blood. </p><p>And, it worked, because the absence of the environmental mana allowed the weak pull of my Health to connect with mana. </p><p>“The absence of Analyze is going to be the biggest challenge,” I decided even as I started forging multiple composite swords, ones that would transfer the mana in a similar shape to her attack. Trying to create an artificial mana conduit similar to her vitality attack might be useful. </p><p>At least, her ability to freely use vitality attacks meant that I didn’t need to make her bleed constantly. That had been macabre enough when I was doing it on my own, but asking someone else to do the same was too much of a mad scientist's demand for me to feel comfortable with. </p><p>It was a good red line to embrace. </p><p>Once everything was done, I pulled the cart through the familiar path, curious how much my view had increased. On the third floor, it was already more than a mile. On the second floor, it was almost three miles. </p><p>On the first floor, the dungeon mist didn’t block my vision in the slightest, allowing me to see everything as long as I climbed to a high enough place. “Excellent,” I said even as I watched a dungeon monster come into existence. It wasn’t too different from the way they evolved. The mist coalesced into something denser, followed by a bright intensity, and they came into being. </p><p>Leaving me even more curious about what a dungeon was … unfortunately, that was not a topic I was qualified to understand yet. </p><p>Instead, I picked up a nice steep hill, about three miles away from the entrance, a good place both as a hidden safehouse and an observatory which was tall enough that even the occasional explorer wouldn’t see us at the top. </p><p>Eleanor returned before I finished setting everything up, though her mood wasn’t as good as I expected. “What’s wrong?” I asked once she arrived on top — with just one step thanks to Floating Stride, which I couldn’t help but feel jealous of as my phobia prevented me from using it as freely. </p><p>“The guilds, they have left the town,” she said. </p><p>“All of them?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes —” she started, but stopped as quickly. “Well, all but one. That annoying woman’s guild stayed, but their numbers are nowhere near enough to keep the dungeon working.” </p><p>“How about the Farmers?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, they are still here, but we can’t keep the dungeon working with only them, not unless we can find a lot more crossbows,” she said. Then, she paused again. “Why are you smiling?” </p><p>I felt giddy at the opportunity. “Tell me. Financially, how long you can keep the dungeon going without selling anything to the System Shop.” </p><p>“Two weeks, and that’s with stopping all purchases.” </p><p>“And, how about if my guild continues to operate at the same pace?” </p><p>“We should be able to hold back quite a while, at least until the first payment for the debt is due,” she said. “About three months.” </p><p>That made me chuckle. “There’s nothing to worry about, then. I could easily surpass the number of shells the other guilds could produce, with no additional cost. All I need to do is to figure out how to make a decent crossbow. It can’t be that hard. A day, two at most.” </p><p>“True,” she said, looking thoughtful. “Why do you ask about the payment schedule, then.” </p><p>“Because, wouldn’t it be better to stockpile them while letting Thomas believe that his plot to hurt us succeeded to some degree? That way, he won’t be in a hurry to plan his next attack.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” she said. “And, in the meanwhile, if I can figure out how to use mana attacks…” Her smile widened as she fell silent, considering possibilities as she grabbed the hilt of her new sword, excited. </p><p>I smiled as well, imagining the way her face would look once she realized she wouldn’t be using her precious new toy. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“And, that makes it ten,” Eleanor said even as she absorbed another crystal, her smile widening. She was referring to the number of crystals she had absorbed, and I had absorbed an equal amount, each consumption increasing our vision even more. </p><p>With her tactic of cutting the limbs of the gargantuan beast — something she could achieve without any risk thanks to her absurd Dexterity — keeping my hydroponic garden mostly intact, I was able to expand it more, which drew more gargantuan beasts to us. Combined with the speed at which we dealt with them, killing twenty of them didn’t even take half a day. </p><p>It was good to finally cooperate.  </p><p>“Maybe we should aim for twenty, each?” she suggested. </p><p>“No, you said Maria might return early. We should be ready, just in case they target her.” </p><p>That made Eleanor snort. “Yeah, targeting her directly. That’s funny,” she said. “You have never seen her fight, right?” </p><p>“I have seen it when she helped me level up.” </p><p>It made Eleanor actually laugh, though, with the filter on, she sounded quite weird. “Oh, yeah, that. Believe me, that’s nothing.” </p><p>I shrugged. While it was hard to treat Maria as truly dangerous since the performance she revealed to me was something I could match if I forced myself, I couldn’t ignore the fact that I had no true baseline on how strong she was. But, considering how our enemies had never created any trouble while she was in the camp, I was willing to take Eleanor’s words at face value. </p><p>“Still, we can take a break and see if she has arrived. Not to mention, we better open the dungeon before people start getting too antsy. The sudden disappearance of multiple guilds will be difficult enough to explain,” I said, then gestured. “Unless you want to spend even more time on the fifth floor.” </p><p>“You’re right. A break will be useful. Even with the filter, it smells disgusting,” she said. With that, we passed through the dungeon gate, stepping onto the fourth floor. “Finally,” she said, removing the filter. “So, what do we do now?” </p><p>“Nothing, we just go back to the first floor.” </p><p>“We can practice skill-switching. I want to get a hang of it.” </p><p>“Sounds good. Multitasking is never a bad idea,” I said. “But, just to be on the safe side, don’t practice that when I’m not around, alright?” </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>“Because I almost killed myself while experimenting with Meditation,” I explained. </p><p>“Really?” </p><p>“Yeah,” I said, shivering as I gave her a quick breakdown of just how close I got to death due to my own mistake. That was what I got acting like a sixteenth-century alchemist, recklessly experimenting on myself without any proper procedures. Desperation was a dangerous drug. </p><p>“Alright, I’ll be careful,” she promised, which I appreciated. </p><p>“Good. The System is still a mystery with some really weird restrictions, but it’s clear that at least some of the restrictions from the skills are here to protect us. Unraveling them requires a much more careful methodology.” </p><p>“Don’t tell me that you’re going to abandon us for one of the research institutes you’re talking about,” she said. </p><p>“I had such thoughts before, but my recent success gave me a better direction.” </p><p>“Do you think you can do a better job?” she said. </p><p>I paused, thinking how to present it. I thought about hiding my opinions, but I changed my mind. Maybe a secondary perspective would help. “Not that. The opposite, actually. I’m a lone Blacksmith, yet all I needed was to monopolize the dungeon for a few weeks to transform the whole town. Why wasn’t it copied anywhere else?” </p><p>“But, you’re the one that said gaining a mana skill was a lucky break.” </p><p>“True, but even without it, I could have scaled up easily. And, that was with me alone. Cooperating with other people …” I added, then my voice faded. </p><p>“You suspect something,” Eleanor said. </p><p>“I suspect many things, but talking about them has no point until I get some evidence to support them,” I replied. “Maybe all of them are wrong, and I'm a once-in-a-generation genius who solved the System, and people will adapt my discoveries happily, and we’ll defeat the monsters that are challenging us.” </p><p>“You don’t believe it,” Eleanor said, though she didn’t exactly sound shocked. </p><p>“Of course not. How many high-ranking guild masters, family heads, or city lords that you know would be happy that their new position suddenly got less powerful.” </p><p>“It would?” she asked. “Wouldn’t people getting stronger increase their power?” </p><p>“It’s a bit complicated, but not necessarily,” I said. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>I paused, thinking how to explain it without it turning into a lecture. Not that I didn’t like teaching, but the middle of the dungeon was not a good place to explain the history of governments and how it related to individual power… especially since it was a loaded topic with many distinct opinions in academia, with significantly different views, from general principles like social contracts and constructs, ideas of enlightenment, labor theory, economic collectivist theories, class struggle, impact of technology. </p><p>It was closer to a complete undergrad degree than a lecture. </p><p>“I’m going to oversimplify it wildly, but we can summarize the current power struggle as a game. Currently, the ones holding power have four major advantages. Do you want to guess what those are?” </p><p>“Individual strength is the most obvious one,” she said. I nodded. “And, I’m guessing having the elite military following their orders is another one.” </p><p>“Partially,” I said. “It’s not just having the most elite forces. Back in the day, Roman Emperors had the elite Praetorian Guard, but those guards were responsible for more deaths and deposition than any enemy forces.” </p><p>“They have the charisma to ensure their loyalty,” she said. </p><p>“Exactly. I don’t know how it works, but I’m guessing it’s easier to use it to raise a small but elite guard utterly loyal to their leader than controlling the whole city.” </p><p>“True,” she said, confirming it. “Economy is probably the other one? What about the fourth?” </p><p>“Knowledge,” I said. She seemed to scoff at the idea. I wasn't surprised by her attitude, as most people shared that dismissiveness. Mostly because, it was easier to underestimate the value of the knowledge they already possessed. It was why I was able to learn a lot from them without them realizing I was interrogating them. But, I needed to correct it. “Oh, so you think the knowledge on how to improve your new Rare skill was completely useless?” </p><p>“Well, no,” she said. </p><p>“Then, how about the working principles of the dungeon? How, how to upgrade the class? What about —” </p><p>“Alright, professor,” she said, cutting me off. “I got it. Knowledge is important. Still, I don’t see why the city lord would react badly to having better weapons.” </p><p>“Because they can’t control the source,” I said. “The System Shops might be expensive, and their wares might be limited, but they are under their direct control. They don’t suddenly come out and demand civil rights, better living conditions, or a say in the ruling matters.” </p><p>“I can’t believe it,” she said. “That means they are letting all those people die just because they want to keep their power. Did System really corrupt us that much?” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “Believe me, if you study history, you’ll learn that we didn’t need the System to not care about the deaths of millions of people. History is filled with kings and emperors sending their men to die just to invade territory that they would never step into. Or, if you’re looking for a more recent example, look at the billionaires letting people work in conditions that were similar to slavery just to buy another yacht that they could show off to their other billionaire friends.” </p><p>“It still feels unbelievable.” </p><p>I shrugged again. “Frankly, it’s just a hypothesis, one that I wasn’t able to start exploring mathematically.” </p><p>“How does math relate to all of it?” she said. </p><p>“Well, that’s what I was working on before the Cataclysm struck. Mathematical sociology. Everything I just explained to you can be represented in a mathematical model. And, assuming the existence of  enough granular data and a sufficiently strong computer, it’s possible to predict how things might work.” </p><p>“Does it work?” she said. </p><p>“Somewhat. At least, it helps to evolve sociology into a proper science. It’s better than just writing books that were only read by other academicians —” I started, only to realize Eleanor was not exactly the correct target for that rant. </p><p>Old habits die hard. </p><p>“Yes. At least I believe that it can be used to understand some of the core principles of the situation, allowing us to look in the right direction. It should be helpful. But, first, I need to do some experiments.” </p><p>“Experiments?” she asked, looking tense. She wasn’t hard to read. I had no doubt she was thinking about the … things that we had fought, transforming into monsters halfway. </p><p>“Letting people fill some surveys, after a day in the dungeon, or after leveling up. Maybe some interviews after teaching them a new skill, and understanding how their perspective changed. A proper, scientific observation. Nothing crazy.” </p><p>“Good,” she said. “Because if those…” </p><p>“Believe me, I share your concerns,” I said. “Ethics are an important part of science, and ignoring them for quick progress is not a good direction to go.” </p><p>“Alright, that’s enough talking. Teach me how to switch between skills faster,” Eleanor declared. “Regardless of the potential danger, it’s better to have a brave warrior to protect your big brain.” </p><p>I chuckled, happy with her declaration. Her words might be flippant, but I had learned enough about her to know that the intent behind it wasn’t as flippant. </p><p>Though, I doubted she understood the potential enormity of her commitment. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Wow, you really undersold just how disgusting the fifth floor is,” Eleanor said the moment we appeared, and landed on the metal platform. Her voice was muffled due to the silver air cleanser, but it was still comprehensible. </p><p>Despite the loud rush of the insects that surrounded us immediately. </p><p>“You’re lucky that I already installed the metal platforms,” I replied even as I used my spear to deal with the fliers, leaving the giant ones to her. “It’s not fun to drop deep enough to bury you to waist level.” </p><p>“Oh, can we remove the platforms before we bring Maria here, please,” Eleanor begged. “She hates her clothes getting dirty.” </p><p>“We’ll see,” I said, both amused and heartened by her attitude at the same time. Amused, as it was a good prank. A touch mean, maybe, but not cruel. However, I was heartened by it for a more obvious reason. If there was one thing Eleanor was obsessed about, it was her protectiveness about Maria. Asking for my cooperation to prank Maria was the true proof that she had accepted me as a part of their little group. </p><p>I smiled, happy with the development, and not just because of the practical implications. A plight of growing up skipping classes was that having friends of my own age was more of a fantasy than anything else. It was childish to get excited at the prospect of a prank, but it didn’t make it wrong. </p><p>Though, even I had to admit, planning a prank while buried under a monster swarm was a bit excessive. </p><p>“So, how do we go around finding a boss monster,” she said. “This place is even more of a mess compared to the fourth floor, and I have no doubt that it’s huge. Even in a newly discovered dungeon like this, finding one would take hours even if we’re lucky.” </p><p>“What if we don’t find one?” I asked, and she looked surprised. “What if they find us?” </p><p>“Explain,” she said. </p><p>“It’s a trick I discovered, more out of a coincidence than anything,” I said. “Keep the monsters busy for a moment.” </p><p>“Sure,” she said and walked closer to me, dealing with any monster that got near. Even as she fought, I could see her proficiency increasing noticeably, showing the benefits of her improved gear. It had many strategic implications, but I ignored them momentarily, instead focusing on repairing my primitive hydroponic farm setup which had been destroyed by the latest gargantuan monster. </p><p>Putting back the pieces took far less than creating a new one, and once it was properly repaired, I looked at her. “I’ll disappear for a second,” I said even as I went through the gate, and returned with a huge branch I turned into a sapling. </p><p>[-48 Health]</p><p>At this point, growing the trees had no impact on my Nurture skill, which was already above two hundred. “Wow, that’s some rapid growth,” she said even as she watched me grow a tree from nothingness in less than a minute. That allowed it to intimidate the insects somewhat, slowing their attacks. </p><p>“Really? You think so?” I asked. </p><p>“Yeah. I have never seen a farmer actually grow anything that fast, even with the assistance of the mana wards and alchemical fertilizers.” </p><p>“That’s because no one really cares about helping them increase their class skill. Even as an external skill, it has quite a bit of value.” </p><p>“Really, that’s just Nurture? Nothing else?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes,” I said even as I cut a branch, turning it into firewood to feed the steam engine. With that started working, the water of the hydroponic farm started to flow properly, which was enough to counter the decay effect on the tree without me constantly healing it. </p><p>“Really?” she added. </p><p>“Yes,” I said. “Well, Epic Nurture, but it’s still Nurture,” I said. </p><p>“Epic Nurture. And, you spent all that time to improve that to a usable level —” she started, her tone surprised, but undecided between angry and fascinated. At least, until it died halfway to her buildup. “Wait, you found a way to cheat somehow, right?” </p><p>“Cheat is such an ugly word,” I said, unable to keep back a chuckle. “Creative innovation was a much better descriptor,” I said. </p><p>“How?” she asked. I gave her a summary of what I did, skipping a lot of pertinent details relating to the process. Not because I wanted to keep it a secret, but because I didn’t think Eleanor would care about the ideal centrifuge design, or how the natural corrosive poison interacted with heat. She frowned once I finished explaining. </p><p>“Sounds simple, right?” I said even as I finished linking the crusher with the steam engine, pumping the excess mana into the water. With the proper nutrition and mana balance integrated, the time I required to grow trees dropped to mere seconds, their presence sheer and overwhelming. </p><p>“Well, yes,” she admitted. “It seems like a simple idea. It makes sense that someone else would also discover it.” </p><p>“There’s a simple explanation,” I said. “The amount of metal I used in that setup, I could have forged a thousand swords easily, and sold every single one of them for at least ten gold.” </p><p>“And, for ten gold, you can hire a thousand farmers for a day easily,” she completed, realizing the scale. </p><p>“Exactly. Farmers are the single most common class, and no one cares about their situation. For most city lords, it’s better to have a pool of employees desperate for work than a small cadre of capable elites.” </p><p>“Well, that makes sense,” she admitted. “You don’t seem like you agree.” </p><p>“Yeah, I’m weird like that,” I said, dismissing the topic. As much as I wanted to lash out at her for ignoring the plight of people, I held back. I still didn’t understand the true source of the cultural shift, but considering that its source was almost certainly supernatural, I didn’t feel like blaming her. </p><p>It was an inevitable fight, but I rather have that discussion with some concrete information under hand. Just as I was thinking about how to change the topic, I noticed the tree leaves trembling. “Be ready. Boss monster will be here in less than a minute.” </p><p>“Really, are you sure?” she said as she pulled near me. </p><p>I nodded even as I switched to my hammer. Its weight felt reassuring in my hand, even as the air grew heavy with the distinct smell of the boss monster, damp and decaying. Beside me, Eleanor tensed, showing the quiet precision of a predator, ready to lash out. </p><p>“Join me on top of the boss monster, and focus on the fliers first,” I said. Just as she nodded, the gargantuan monster burst into the opening, causing destruction in its wake as it uprooted the trees and crushed the metal container. </p><p>However, no matter how big of a terror it was, the moment we arrived on top of it — Eleanor with one smooth Floating Stride, me with several short jumps over other insects — its biggest weapons turned useless. </p><p>“Don’t forget to pass me the shells,” I reminded her even as I brought down my hammer, shattering a great portion of the shell. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>“Wow, nice hit,” she said. “Why didn’t you use it during the fight?” </p><p>“Because we didn’t need it,” I said. “Too early, and we would have alerted them. And, once those … things joined, ballistas were the better option. Sometimes, the best card is one that is yet to be played.” </p><p>“I don’t think I could have kept myself back,” she said. </p><p>“Don’t sell yourself short. You managed to suppress the temptation to use my sword for a long time.” </p><p>“I don’t know what you are about. This is my sword,” she responded even as she continued to cut down the fliers. I chuckled, appreciating her presence. With all the advantages I had managed to collect, killing a boss monster was almost completely safe, but considering it took almost an hour, it was boring. </p><p>Having someone to chat with was as valuable as her dealing with the constant annoyance of flying insects. </p><p>“Feel free to join me,” I invited her once the number of flying insects stopped crowding us. </p><p>“My pleasure,” she said even as she started to add her own slashes. I noted that her vitality attacks were able to penetrate the flesh of the beast more than mine, and the damage it caused lingered more. However, I recognized the dense nature of her vitality, similar to the one provided by my Epic Mana Forge skill. Though, it flew better than I expected. </p><p>“Is it an Epic Skill, or a Legendary one?” </p><p>She paused for a moment, looking like she wanted to refuse, then answered. “Unfortunately, merely Epic,” she answered. “Legendary Skills that fit my particular stat distribution are hard to find,” she explained. </p><p>“I’m sure we will be able to figure something out,” I responded even as I continued to work on the dull, mottled green carapace. “Feel free to go back to the fourth floor to replenish your Health if you need it, by the way. I can handle it alone.” </p><p>“That would be excellent,” she said as she disappeared, and returned a minute later. When she returned, she attacked with renewed intensity, her attacks cutting the beast hard. </p><p>Twice, she had disappeared to replenish her Health, but even with that, it took merely ten minutes for us to take down the boss beast, nowhere near as time-consuming as doing it alone. </p><p>When the boss started to topple, I retreated, letting her absorb the energy alone. </p><p>“Wow,” she said as the glow faded. “That was by far the easiest boss fight I have been a part of. No risk, no hassle. Perfect.” </p><p>I smiled even as I started repairing the metal. “Production classes can come in handy from time to time.” </p><p>“True,” she said, then smiled back. “Let’s see if we can take down the next one without letting it destroy everything. I’ll cut its legs, and you focus on its head. What do you think?” </p><p>“Worth the effort,” I responded, smiling wide. </p><p>I certainly wouldn’t say no to killing more. Today’s events had already proven the value of a better range of vision. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was happy to leave Eleanor outside while I worked on her armor. It wasn’t that I had disliked her presence, but as I got better and better as a smith, it turned into a calm, meditative practice. Exactly what I needed after the ambush that we lived through. </p><p>An ambush where more than a hundred other people didn’t survive. </p><p>Even as my hammer danced against the anvil with a steady rhythm, I pondered on my reaction. Or, more accurately, lack thereof. I had played a role in such a massacre, going as far as killing many of them with my own hands, yet I didn’t feel any guilt. </p><p>There were no trembling hands, no wandering thoughts replaying the same event again and again. </p><p>It wasn’t that I was struggling with the idea of killing them intentionally. They were the ones who had decided to plan an ambush for the express purpose of killing Eleanor and framing me, which would have driven me to an ambush of eight … whatever those were. </p><p>I was just rattled by my own lack of reaction. It wasn’t natural. Yes, it was possible to make people more accepting of taking lives — hell, the militaries of all nations across history had many such methods — but those methods required a dedicated application. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had too many candidates to suspect. Maybe it was just a natural aspect of the System, somehow transforming my perspective as it got stronger — a scary thought if it was true. Spending so much time in the dungeon was another suspect. I had been spending a huge portion of my time fighting against mindless monsters, and it might have impacted me. </p><p>Even the crystals I received from the boss monster were suspects. Or, maybe I was dealing with a completely different issue. </p><p>“Maybe I can actually run experiments about it,” I said, a genuine smile appearing on my face. It wasn’t even too difficult. I just needed to create a detailed questionnaire, devise a few tests, and collect the data from the farmers every day, measuring their responses. </p><p>It should give me direction. </p><p>My smile widened as I realized just how big of an advantage I had. For three years, the best I could do was to hire a few people to do interviews, their answers suspect for many reasons. Now, I had access to a great number of subjects who would be happy to answer my questions.</p><p>My mind wandered over which principles I needed to adhere to so that I could collect the most accurate data without violating the ethical boundaries of science. The last thing I needed was to resurrect a scientific approach, only to immediately replicate shameful episodes like the Stanford Prison Experiment, or worse, the Monster Study. </p><p>My hammer danced, mingling with my mana to handle the creation process of the chainmail, every ring perfectly aligned, imbued with the right amount of mana and dungeon products, balanced perfectly to resist the corrosion effect of the fifth floor. The armor I forged for Eleanor might not be on the same tier as mine since I lacked time, but that didn’t prevent me from creating the best one I could of a previous tier. </p><p>Luckily, with Advanced Creative Forging helping me handle most of the small details, I was able to split my attention between my work and my ethical principles for the upcoming experiment. It was a good feeling to have many thoughts flying in my head, designing the core principles. </p><p>The first principle was informed consent. It would be wrong to use people as scientific curiosities just because I was effectively their employer. They needed to understand what I was doing, and why. Also, they needed to understand that they had the right to opt out with no repercussions, and that their dungeon access was not dependent on their assent. </p><p>Then, there was the matter of confidentiality. In a world where magic worked in ways I couldn’t fathom, I couldn’t just rely on keeping my notes hidden to ensure privacy. I needed to devise a way to collect their input truly anonymously … even if that could potentially risk the accuracy of the collection. </p><p>A necessary sacrifice to maintain my ethical principles. </p><p>Finally, I had to ensure my research was just; which was not exactly an easy principle to define, let alone adhere to, in a world where people had been ruled by their inherent differences. It had already reached an unhealthy degree, as evidenced by my own experience of being rejected just because I didn’t have what they deemed necessary. </p><p>I needed to be vigilant that any potential result shouldn’t further the divide — regardless of the temporary practical benefits. </p><p>Of course, the ruling principle was still non-maleficence, the commitment to do no harm. Just like my discoveries relating to the system, I simply lacked the context of the potential implications of my discoveries, meaning I needed to be very careful about the ultimate aim of those studies —  </p><p>My thought process was interrupted by Eleanor slamming my door open. Considering both the door and the wall were made of metal, it was … loud. </p><p>“I didn’t know knocking on the door required a skill,” I said bitingly, annoyed by her approach. Sarcasm was not the most ideal way of communication, but I didn’t enjoy being interrupted while working on my real job. </p><p>Eleanor flinched at my words, and for a moment, I feared her anger. After all, she wasn’t a post-doc trying to stay in my good grace. Luckily, she seemed not to be as arrogant as I feared. “Sorry, I didn’t think. I was just … frustrated. I can come later.” </p><p>“Not a problem. Just remember to knock the next time,” I reminded her. I could have asked her to leave, but I had already lost my train of thought, and trying to reestablish it was not worth the effort, especially since her armor was halfway done. “Now, what drove you that mad,” I asked. </p><p>A frustrated growl escaped her mouth. “The method you told me, switching the skills. It’s not working,” she said. </p><p>“Show me,” I said, my hammer still moving rapidly, curious why it didn’t work. </p><p>She raised my hybrid weapon, and it glowed with her vitality attack. Yet, a moment later, she paused, and the vitality dispersed. Only after five seconds, she managed to hit. </p><p>“Why are you lingering that much? Just switch between skills.” </p><p>She looked at me, frustrated. “What do you mean, just switch between the skills. I’m trying. That’s the fastest I can manage. And even that is painful.” </p><p>“Really, painful?” I asked, surprised. I had been switching between skills for a long time, and it never caused pain. </p><p>“No, painful is not the right word, but I don’t know how to describe it,” she said. </p><p>“Uncomfortable?” I suggested. </p><p>“In a way, but uncomfortable doesn’t feel like an intense enough word. It’s far more intense. Almost like …” she started, only to fade. “I don’t know. It’s just difficult. Show me how you do it.” </p><p>“Fine,” I said, glad that I was making a chainmail for her, which was easier to interrupt for a moment. She threw me the hybrid weapon, and I pushed my health, covering the edge near the tip with Health. </p><p>[-10 Health] </p><p>I started a slow piercing attack, only to switch halfway, with only a momentary pause, finishing it as a spear attack. “That’s how I do it.” </p><p>“Is this the fastest you can manage?” she asked. </p><p>I was so glad I didn’t have to consider the implications of every single detail I revealed to her anymore. “No,” I said as I repeated the action, the delivery even faster. </p><p>“How can you do it that fast?” she asked. </p><p>I shrugged. “Probably practice,” I said.</p><p>“Really, were you using that switching trick for a long time?” </p><p>“Not the switching trick itself,” I admitted, feeling frustrated. If only I had been experimenting with the System properly since the day I had received it. “My life would have been much easier if I managed to discover it earlier. But, while using Repair on damaged weapons, I often ignored the suggestion from the skill. It’s always a grating and uncomfortable sensation. Maybe I just got used to it.” </p><p>“That’s your answer? Practice for three years? We don’t have the time for that. Don’t tell me I wasted a precious skill slot for a Rare skill I can’t develop.”</p><p> I did my best to hide my smile, aware that Eleanor would take it the wrong way. I was familiar with her brand of freak-out. I had many high-performing students react that way when they finally faced a topic that they didn’t immediately resolve. </p><p>Admittedly, it was also a habit I had to break through, back in the far-away days when I was still a student, which felt a lifetime away … well, two lifetimes. </p><p>“How about we solve the issue of improving your skill first, and work on switching skills later?” I offered. </p><p>“You have another way to improve skills quickly?” she asked. </p><p>“Not all of them, but it’ll work for this one,” I said even as I stopped working on her armor, and instead started forging a spear, using the composite method, following the pattern of the skill. Since I owned the skill, I knew exactly how every attack of Breeze Spear worked, which should be enough for Eleanor. “Try pushing your Health without shaping, and complete a basic attack,” I suggested once I passed her the first spear. </p><p>“Just a simple attack. Are you sure?” she said. </p><p>“There’s no harm trying, right?” I asked even as I started working on a second spear. </p><p>She nodded as she made the attempt, her burst of smile enough to confirm the efficiency of the method. </p><p>Forging the spears and occasionally guiding her about the Breeze Spear slowed my armor-making somewhat, but even then, it didn’t even take half an hour to finish everything, and started traveling toward the fifth floor. </p><p>Eleanor insisted on bouncing around like a kite, using the Floating Stride. “Wow, you’re right. This perk is excellent,” she said even as she took another great stride. “Too bad I can’t seem to switch skills as quickly as you. It would have been an excellent combination with my sword skill.” </p><p>“We’ll work on it once we take down a few gargantuan beasts and return to the first floor.” </p><p>“Promise?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes, promise,” I replied. </p><p>After all, I wouldn’t have turned down the opportunity to have her willing cooperation. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“And, that’s the last of it. The dungeon is officially closed until further notice,” Eleanor said the moment she returned to my side, sealing the dungeon gate. </p><p>“Everything done?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, we evacuated every guild and the guards are on high alert, ordered to attack anyone that dares to breach without invitation. The only problem is that it’ll take at least a day for Maria to return,” Eleanor explained in quick order. </p><p>I nodded, admiring her efficiency. Merely an hour had passed since our close call, which was all she needed to put the dungeon on high alert and stop the operation. For someone who preferred direct action above anything else, her capacity to set up an organization was admirable. </p><p>I suspected it was Maria’s flighty attitude to such aspects that had forced her to learn. </p><p>“I’m still not sure about closing the dungeon,” Eleanor said. “We have handled the crisis well enough. Is it worth losing all that money just to trick them?” </p><p>“We have already discussed it. It’s better to let them believe they had managed to cause some significant damage, maybe even that one of those … whatever they were … was loose in the dungeon. At least, until Maria returns and can make a decision.” </p><p>“Fine,” Eleanor said. She didn’t look entirely convinced, but she assented. “But don’t forget your promise. First, you’re going to adjust this monstrosity into something more elegant,” she said as she displayed her new sword. </p><p>I made sure to hide my smile, amused by the ease with which she was convinced to follow what she believed to be a wasteful plan. I must have been underestimating the value of my new sword to a significant degree. “Let’s go,” I said. </p><p>Both of us were fast enough to ignore the presence of the weaker monsters, so I didn’t expect the trip to take that long. I was wrong. She killed any insect we came across, using vitality attacks, with a fascinated expression on her face. </p><p>It slowed our descent significantly, but I said nothing. The pleasure of watching a skill improve was unmatched even after doing that to more than half a dozen skills. For Eleanor, it was a new experience. I didn’t want to interrupt her, but after her third detour, I had to speak. “Come on, miss swords master, we are wasting time,” I warned her. </p><p>“No we’re not,” she said, her voice determined. </p><p>“Look, the faster we arrive at the fourth floor, the faster I can design you a sword that might give you a mana manipulation skill,” I said. “But, if you want to waste that opportunity, it’s your choice.” </p><p>“Wait, you can do that,” she said. </p><p>“Maybe,” I responded, leery to commit it fully. “I have several ideas in mind, but whether they will work immediately or not, I don’t know. We need to experiment a lot.” </p><p>“Like how you have been experimenting with Maria,” she said. For some reason, her tone was suspicious. Only when it was followed by a sudden realization, I understood where she was coming from. </p><p>”Yes. I might have slightly obfuscated how necessary those experiments were to help me repair the swords faster,” I said, avoiding her gaze. I had no problem with that decision itself, but admitting the act of lying was never comfortable.  </p><p>“You have a lot to atone for,” she said, trying to look stern, but her smile was hard to hide. She didn’t seem to care a lot about it, which didn’t surprise me. After all, it was that act of lying that saved her life just an hour ago. </p><p>“So … a dagger as well?” I countered. </p><p>Her smile slid away. “If you think you can get away with a mere dagger, you’re delusional. I need a full set of armor. Non-negotiable.” </p><p>“You drive a hard bargain,” I said, somehow maintaining a serious expression. “Now, let’s go. We have dungeon bosses to hunt.” </p><p>With that done, we started running full speed to the fourth floor. “So, you also use a spear,” she commented as we moved. </p><p>“It’s good to have a style that focuses on mobility and deflection,” I responded. “You might think to add that as an external skill, assuming you have an empty slot.” </p><p>“I do.” </p><p>“Good, “ I said, then paused. “Then, why didn’t you learn one? It wouldn’t be as strong as your main style, but even with all the advantages, an additional style can be helpful.” </p><p>“Mostly because of a lack of time. Focusing on my main skill was the more efficient approach. Anything below Rare is too useless, and developing a Rare skill requires months even with access to a fitting dungeon. At least, it was supposed to,” she corrected. </p><p>“Well, we just have to replicate it for you,” I said. “I have struggled with that a lot as well, but it’s not that difficult once one discovers the trick behind it. We can try it once we arrive at my base. I have a few Rare Breeze Spear samples. And, I still need some time to forge your armor.” She looked hopeful. “Not one based on my Epic skill, that needs two full days,” I corrected. “But, you still need an armor set that can resist the natural corrosion of the fifth floor.” </p><p>“Fine. I guess it’s a good way to utilize that downtime,” she admitted. </p><p>I smiled, happy to see that her obsession with improving her sword skills didn’t mean she refused a chance to diversify her abilities. And I knew that, with her Dexterity, her own variant of Breeze Spear would turn into a devastating weapon that could easily surpass mine. </p><p>Especially since she lacked a phobia that turned its biggest advantage useless.</p><p>We chatted even as we passed through another gate and arrived at the fourth floor, and a thicker mist surrounded us, making me glad for increased visibility. Though, not as much as it would have if it wasn’t for the fog that hung above the swamp, which was annoying. </p><p>“Disgusting place,” she growled even as her feet sank into the mud. “I was so glad when we discovered the corrosive effect would prevent us from exploring the place.” </p><p>“Understandable,” I said. “Wading through mud is not exactly my idea of a fun time either.” </p><p>“Yet, you decided to build your base here,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “Not because I love the environment,” I said. “But, as a Blacksmith who can forge equipment that can resist the corrosion of this place, its strategic value is far more important than the less-than-pleasant environment.” </p><p>“Fair. And, how the hell do you manage to find your path here? There’s nothing for wayfinding.” </p><p>“Here,” I said as I crouched, pushing the mud away to show her the rails I had buried. “I laid them before. My skills allow me to detect their presence.” </p><p>“You went through all that trouble just to find your path.” </p><p>“No, it helps to move the carts around,” I said. </p><p>“Carts, really?” she said even as we continued to run despite the mud. “Do you really need that much effort just to move a bunch of arrowheads around,” she asked. </p><p>“Well, no,” I said even as we continued to move. “But that’s not the only thing I move around. After all, I have a proper base here.” </p><p>“Calling a dinky little shack a base is a bit grandiose even for you, professor,” she teased. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, letting the discussion linger as we continued to move until we finally arrived at my base. The moment her vision range touched the edge of the trees, a gasp escaped her mouth. “Not bad for a dinky little shack, is it?” I asked smugly. </p><p>“Well …” she said as she gazed upon my base, impressed. Her reaction was understandable, as the structure rose from the swamp as a single, monolithic structure, surrounded by multiple blast furnaces and steam engines. And, around them, there were almost ten discrete rings of trees to keep the base safe from the monsters.  </p><p>It looked good, mostly because I had decided to put my excess of available metal to good use. Knowing that the fifth floor was too hostile to set up a permanent base — the persistent attacks from the boss monsters and air that put a vat of acid to shame was decisive enough — further incentivized me to put some more effort into my base. </p><p>Eleanor’s shock was a nice side benefit. </p><p>“I have to admit, it’s not as horrible as I imagined,” she responded, then smirked. “For a dingy little base, of course.” </p><p>I didn’t bother answering her even as I disappeared inside, and came out with two things. A modified weapon, halfway between a sword and a spear to help her switch between the skills, which I threw at her, handle first, and as she grabbed that, I threw a copy of Rare Breeze Spear skill. “I’m sure this will keep you busy for a while.” </p><p>“Explain how I am going to power-level the skill first,” she said. “And, what’s this abomination?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Simple,” I said as I raised my hand. She threw it back. “Just start treating it as a sword, and start channeling a vitality attack. Then, halfway in, switch to your spear skill, and complete that attack. Considering you’re using an Epic skill as a template, it should work.” </p><p>“That’s it?” she said. </p><p>“Yep, that’s it. Trivial,” I said. “Now, why don’t you play with it while I go and start working on your armor.” Seeing her enthusiasm, I had to quickly add a correction. “The temporary one.” </p><p>“Fine,” she growled playfully as she raised her hand, and the skill orb disappeared. She grunted as she closed her eyes, her discomfort clear. </p><p>I left to forge her armor. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Good news is that we know why they wanted to ambush you outside,” Eleanor said even as another pained cry reached our ears, only to be cut halfway. I wanted to admonish her, but the uncharacteristic tenseness in her tone stopped me. It was clear that she was trying to handle the shock in her own way. </p><p>Instead, I watched, trying to understand what was going on. The black flames were calming down, but the speed at the mist was gathering — which was something I had only seen on the boss monsters — had only hastened, increasing the visibility around us. </p><p>All except the black flames, which were letting out an equally black, suffocating smog, making me glad that my helmet had an integrated filter. Eleanor was already coughing. </p><p>I grabbed one of the spears I had yet to throw, and a flash of mana melted the iron, which I then used to fashion a breather filter, which would hopefully be enough to handle what was going on. </p><p>Even as I created that, I watched through the smog. We weren’t able to see much, just several shadows, most trying to escape ineffectively, while the other shadows followed. </p><p> “What do we do?” </p><p>“I … we need to kill them,” she said. “I have never heard of people being able to absorb dungeon mist, but it can’t be good news. And, we need to do that now,” she said as she took a step forward. </p><p>I grabbed her shoulder. “No,” I said. </p><p>She looked at me, disappointed. “You can go if you want. We need to warn the fort, after all,” she said, doing her best to hide her disgust. She wasn’t very successful. </p><p>I appreciated the effort. “I’m not saying to retreat, but we can’t just rush forward blindly,” I said even as I started dragging her toward the ballistas. Her expression was alighted with understanding. “How long would it take for the ballistas to recover?” I asked. </p><p>“In a mana-dead dungeon? A lot,” she said. </p><p>“What if we can supply it with more mana?” I asked. </p><p>“A minute, maybe two?” she responded. </p><p>“Good, keep the ballistas safe. I’ll be back in a moment,” I said as I turned, ready to use the Fleeting Step, hoping that I would be fast enough to go to the nearest safe house and return just as fast. I was already doing my best… </p><p>“A-am I,” I found myself suddenly asking. The modified Fleeting Step was fast, but it wasn’t the fastest thing in my arsenal. No, the fastest Perk available to me was the Floating Stride. One that I couldn’t use due to my fears. And, now, Eleanor might die because of it. </p><p>“Come on, Devon. For once in your life, ignore your stupid fear,” I growled, pushing myself. My hands trembled, and my legs lost their strength, but I bit my lips, the taste of my own blood filling my mouth. “Come on,” I growled again. </p><p>And jumped. </p><p>The sensation of flying was as disgusting as I remembered. My whole body was locked in place, and I had been hit by a sensation of falling that played a part in some of my worst nightmares. </p><p>The desire to save Eleanor didn’t suddenly cure me of my phobia. The sensation of flying was just as hateable and disgusting as I remembered, and not having anything underneath me made it ten times worse. Luckily, Floating Stride didn’t require any input from me until I landed. </p><p>Well, landed was a generous description of what had happened. Crashed was a better descriptor, but my armor was there to take the worst of the damage, and my Dexterity meant I was able to roll to my feet with fascinating alacrity. </p><p>I jumped again. Then, I crashed again. And again… It was ridiculous, horrifying, and humiliating at the same time, but where a second might be the difference between Eleanor’s death and survival, none of it mattered. </p><p>When I reached the safe house, I picked a huge pile of shells I had placed there for safety and a manual crusher. When I had been putting them there, I was certain that I was being excessive and paranoid. Now, I was furious that I hadn’t littered the whole floor with them, maybe even with steam-powered variants. </p><p>Unfortunately, as usual, hindsight was the greatest strategic planner. </p><p>The return trip was more of the same, which meant I arrived at Eleanor's side with an undignified tumble. It would have been a horrible shock if it wasn’t for one important detail. </p><p>Eleanor was surrounded by four men … no, monsters would have been a better descriptor. They were roughly man-shaped, but their skin looked like melted messes, and the way they fought was no different than beasts. </p><p>Very strong beasts, faster and stronger than Eleanor. Her armor was already half-ripped, with her recovery working overtime to cure her wounds. Her only advantage was the lack of coordination they had been showing. They were faster and stronger, but one thing they lacked was smooth control. </p><p> Suddenly, I was very glad that I had pushed myself, as she was already at her limit. </p><p>“Tag,” I shouted even as I jumped to the mix, my hammer already dancing. </p><p>“No, they are too strong —” she shouted in panic, ready to help me when one of their attacks threw me away, but barely managed to dent my armor. </p><p>[-14 Health]</p><p>“My armor can hold them back, don’t worry,” I said. “Just fill the container with the shells, point the mouth to the ballista, and rotate the crank —” I explained, my words interrupted by another hit that threw me away. </p><p>They were strong enough to throw me around like a rag doll. </p><p>“Be careful, they are getting stronger,” she warned even as she followed my command, which was something I was glad for. </p><p>“Noted,” I said as I switched my weapon, donning my spear. The fact that Eleanor couldn’t put them down even with her new sword meant that they were able to recover from a horrifying amount of damage. My hammer might have been capable of delivering that, but on a straight line, they were too fast. </p><p>Breeze Spear focused on mobility. As I shifted to it, I was able to dodge their attacks far more effectively. Not enough to avoid every attack, but maybe reduce their hits by sixty percent. For the rest, I relied on my armor, being thrown around like a toy. </p><p>However, as I fought with them, I understood why Georg had been very reluctant to bring them into the dungeon. Whatever their ailment was, it was getting stronger the more dungeon mist they consumed. A part of that transformation was them getting faster and stronger in real-time. </p><p>Luckily, that growth was accompanied by an even greater loss of control, which meant that, as time passed, it got easier to avoid their attacks. I started paying attention to the damage my weapons had been causing, expecting it to recover faster and faster. </p><p>To my surprise, the opposite was true. As for what was responsible, a hypothesis drifted to the top of my mind the moment I sensed a familiar aura around them, one that reminded me intensely of the fourth floor. </p><p>The mist was transforming them into something closer to the monsters of the dungeon, along with giving them the same weaknesses. </p><p>I wondered if I let the transformation go long enough, could I kill them alone. But, that curiosity wasn’t strong enough to countermand when Eleanor warned me to pull back. I retreated, and the twang of the ballista followed. </p><p>A direct hit, reducing their number to three. </p><p>“Good work,” I called even as I attacked them with mana, distracting them from ballistas. I did my best not to be distracted by the body, which started burning with the same black flames. I couldn’t afford the distraction. </p><p>As I engaged with them once again, I was able to notice another, fortunate familiarity they had with a rabid beast. Their intelligence wasn’t too far away. The pain from my spear suitably distracted the remaining three. </p><p>More importantly, dealing with the three of them was markedly easier than resisting four. The number of blows I was receiving had dropped significantly, then turned into nothingness when Eleanor shouted again. </p><p>I pulled back. Another twang of a ballista, and their number dropped to two. Then, yet another, and one remained. </p><p>To my surprise, once he was alone, he turned to escape. “Keep him back,” Eleanor shouted. “We can’t let him go free.” </p><p>“Open the container!” I shouted even as I chased him — or was it a better descriptor at this point? </p><p>Eleanor seemed surprised by my shout, but luckily, her shock didn’t prevent her from following that direction, as we lacked the time necessary for me to explain why. The transformed monster in front of us was too fast on a straight line for us to catch up.</p><p>And, I didn’t want to imagine what might happen once it got loose in the dungeon. </p><p>The container parted open, and concentrated tainted energy radiated from the box. Just like the dungeon monsters, the transformed man seemed captivated by it, ignoring his — its — previous survival instincts to rush toward the box. </p><p>Under the tainted energy, its transformation started to hasten as it started to grow, as a disgusting mixture of a monster and a tumor. </p><p>“Focus on its limbs, and keep it immobile,” I ordered Eleanor as I switched to my hammer, and we started attacking it. The concentrated dose of tainted energy hastened the transformation exponentially, but it also exacerbated its weaknesses to our silver weapons, which I had designed explicitly against the corrosive aura. </p><p>As we fought, Eleanor’s armor, despite all the enchantments it had, didn’t survive against the transformed creature’s corrosion aura, slowly turning into a rusty mess. </p><p>Even then, it took almost half an hour for us to kill it properly. Its remains disintegrated, just like the other corpses, once again catching that distinctive black flame.  </p><p>We collapsed to the ground, listless. There was a lot to be done, but none of them was as important as breathing… </p><p>“You owe me an armor,” she growled between her desperate panting. </p><p>I just grumbled an answer. I was too spent to do anything else. But, I had to admit, after what had just happened, spending a day at the forge, working with metal sounded very tempting. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Just because we were waiting for reinforcements didn’t mean we stopped attacking once the ballistas were ready and in place. On the contrary, we continued attacking even more, forcing them to defend themselves. </p><p>Their attitude changed from baiting us to defending earnestly, the recent loss of another guild master forcing their hands. They simply didn’t have an option. Currently, the only one that could fight against us on an equal footing was Georg, meaning, whenever we attacked from two opposite directions, he had been forced to engage with Eleanor, while the remaining guild masters tried to defend against me. </p><p>With them focusing fully on the defensive and us holding back our trump cards, the battle had been locked into a stalemate. We attacked in bursts, allowing us to replenish the Health we consumed during our special attacks. </p><p>And, whenever we retreated, Georg sent another magical message to his allies. The intensity of the mana flare from those messages didn’t match the first one, leading me to believe that the reinforcements were already in the dungeon. So, whenever we pulled back, I made sure to circle around the two positions to see if I could catch the reinforcements. </p><p>Which I finally came across them nearly ten minutes later, but their size surprised me. </p><p>More than a hundred people. </p><p>Admittedly, the numbers alone weren’t that scary. The performance they put against the monster attacks showed that they weren’t particularly strong. They were probably the rest of the guild members, the ones too weak to contribute anything other than a momentary distraction. </p><p>However, the same didn’t apply to the eight that were at the center of the formation, each wearing pure black armor. They felt …</p><p>Dangerous. </p><p>Clearly, I wasn’t the only one who felt this way, as none of the guild fighters walked near them. Whatever that was going on with them, it was not good news. They radiated some kind of primal fear. I would have almost suspected that they had Charisma, but it was not the same. </p><p>When Thomas used that, I could feel some kind of external pressure wrapping around me and pulling my fear to the surface … Here, it was a primal sensation, like I just came across a rabid dog, foams covering its mouth. </p><p>I gulped even as I retreated, suddenly glad that we had gone through all that trouble to steal and repair the ballistas. When I returned, Eleanor was just finishing eating another nutrition bar. “You’re early,” she said. </p><p>“They are here, just half a mile away, and getting closer,” I said. </p><p>“Finally,” she said with a sharp smirk. “What’s the layout?” </p><p>“About a hundred guild fighters, low-leveled, and eight … I don’t know who they are, but they felt … wrong.” I didn’t like the way I sounded plaintive, but I had no choice. I was basically trying to warn her against something that I didn’t even know myself. </p><p>“Wrong, how?” she asked, her expression serious. </p><p>“I don’t know how to describe it. It’s more of an ephemeral feeling. But, it’s intense enough that I want to target four of the six ballistas to them.” </p><p>“Even if it means we can’t catch all of them at once and most of them escape? You were the one afraid of it. Once they start to retreat, we won’t have the chance to reload them.” </p><p>“Yes, even then,” I said. I wasn’t exactly someone big on instincts, but what I was feeling from them was too intense to be ignored. “Now, let’s conduct one last attack. We can’t afford to alert them when we’re so close to victory.” </p><p>She stayed silent for a while, then nodded, approving the last-minute adjustment to the plan. It was good news. </p><p>“Stay with the ballistas and support me from range,” she said as she tensed. “I’ll switch to the sword the moment you release the first attack.” </p><p>“I’ll target the newcomers first. Just retreat when I launch the first one. It won’t take long to release every single one of them.” </p><p>“And, once two of them land, I’ll switch to … your gift to me,” she said, smiling surprisingly. </p><p>“Yes. I knew the moment I gave it to you I won’t be receiving it back,” I said, trying to sound exasperated rather than glad. I could see that she was trying to calm me down about what I had felt from them. </p><p>Eleanor rushed forward, and I started supporting her with spears I released through my atlatl, keeping an eye on the attackers. Attackers gathered on my flank, ready to spread to envelop me. They seemed ready to take me down. </p><p>Before they could even start their assault, I aimed the four ballistas toward the center of their formation, where the eight scary ones were still gathered reasonably close, and released the four bolts at the same time. </p><p>The difference between using the bolts on the ballistas and releasing them directly was like the difference between night and day. The moment I triggered, the complicated enchantment on the ballista flared to life, linking with the one on the bolt. </p><p>The bolt radiated mana as it flew toward its target, slower than I expected, which was a scary proposition as it had been accompanied by a loud buzzing noise. Combined, I could have dodged it if it was used against me, and so would Eleanor as long as she wasn’t occupied. </p><p>No wonder they had set an elaborate trap to draw her out. </p><p>However, those thoughts were only on the passing. I was more interested in the way each bolt skewered its target before exploding into fragments, accompanied by a wave of mana, which started burning black. </p><p>Scary effect. Eleanor hadn’t mentioned that detail. </p><p>It was an unexpected effect, but I didn’t have time to waste on it. Eleanor had already retreated from her engagement, so I released the last two ballistas. This time, I aimed it at the hill, destroying their formation and footing before killing some of them. </p><p>Georg might not be as fast as Eleanor, but I still didn’t want to risk targeting him with the siege weapon, and the rest wasn’t exactly a priority target. </p><p>The moment I released the last two, I rushed forward. Reloading them was not an option since the enchantment required time to recover. So, I stopped with the ranged attacks, grabbed my hammer, and rushed forward. </p><p>I took several steps before the bolts had reached their target, exploding in a dangerous cloud of dust and … no flame. Certainly no black flame. I couldn’t help but glance to my right, where the black flames were still burning strong. </p><p>But, at this moment, Eleanor had already jumped to the cloud of dust, and required my support … or at least, that was what I assumed before the cries of pain reached my ear. The sword, combined with the limited visibility worked to her benefit if the number of interrupted cries was any indicator. </p><p>However, before I could think a lot about it, Georg burst from the cloud, wanting to escape. “I got him,” I shouted at Eleanor even as I closed in the distance, Floating Step making me even faster. </p><p>“You think you can defeat me,” Georg growled as he turned to catch me. “I have seen the way you fought. You’re clearly not as good —” he started, only to realize I was not wielding a sword, but a hammer. </p><p>A hammer that glowed with an intense blue hue. “Impossible,” he shouted even as he raised his sword to parry. </p><p>I had to admit, it was a perfect parry. Sharp, strong, and angled perfectly to keep his weapon safe from any attack. I was sure that, even if I used the strongest hammer attack given by my Rare skill, it wouldn’t have worked.  </p><p>Unfortunately for him, that mana glow wasn’t from Quake Hammer, but the enhanced, denser mana from the Epic Mana Forge, designed to purge the mana out of his sword. </p><p>[-10 Mana] </p><p>It wasn’t a perfect method. Even the weakest external mana flow would have destabilized it. Luckily for us, the dungeon lacked such a fluctuation, allowing the mana to stick to his blade longer without my control. </p><p>“You think that being an Essence Warrior would save you,” he growled. “Once those monsters arrive, you won’t survive,” he declared arrogantly. But, even as he declared that a cry reached my ears. A loud, bloodcurdling cry, one that I hadn’t heard since the first days of the Cataclysm, when the concept of monsters was new. </p><p>The moment that cry reached my ear, I expected Georg to look arrogant and confident. Instead, he looked afraid, and hesitant. “No, don’t tell me you attacked them with ballistas,” he asked, with fear coloring his face. He took a step to escape. </p><p>Anyone else, I might have considered letting them go, wondering whether their intention was genuine, or they were acting. But he was the main person responsible for our plight, and even if his desire was genuine, it was too late. </p><p>I swung down my hammer, this time delivering a quake attack.</p><p> [-50 Health]</p><p>[-25 Mana]</p><p>He tried to parry again, but his weapon, already degraded by my earlier trick, was unable to handle the blow. His helmet managed to resist, but the quake aspects of it bypassed his armor sufficiently, enough to make him bleed through his eyes and ears, stunned. </p><p>I delivered another blow, finishing him off, for once happy with my own distorted perspective, allowing me to kill without hesitation. </p><p>I turned to support Eleanor, only to freeze. The initial dust cloud had settled enough for me to see her … and only her. Of the thirty-five remaining warriors, none of them were alive. </p><p>It would have been enough to celebrate, if it wasn’t for the cries that were reaching our ears. “What’s going on?” I asked even as I rushed to her side. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she said. “All I see is some kind of black flame that makes me very unsettled.” </p><p>“Wait, you can see it as well? But, it’s almost a hundred yards away,” I asked. </p><p>She nodded grimly. </p><p>I paused, looking past the black flame, focusing on the edge of the mist … which had become jagged as if it was being siphoned. </p><p>Eerily similar to how it was around the boss monster. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 76</p><p>When I arrived at the first floor — as usual carrying a huge cart filled with shells to the brim — everything that was required to move to the second floor was already in place. I saw several carts filled with construction materials, escorted by workers, which meant the second-floor encampment could be built even faster. </p><p>I didn’t arrange any of them. It must be Harold who handled it all, which was fortunate. I walked further, only to see Harold talking with someone. His posture suggested that whoever he was talking to, wasn’t pleasant. </p><p>“What’s going on,” I said even as I approached. </p><p>“Sir. We have a representative from the guilds gracing us with their presence,” Harold said, but his distaste was clear. </p><p>“Speak,” I said. </p><p>“Honorable guild leader. I’m just here to deliver you a letter,” he said as pulled an envelope. </p><p>“From whom?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s from a few other guilds that are looking to establish a local chapter in the dungeon, sir,” he said as I opened the letter. I didn’t need to fake a frown as I read the long and meandering letter. On the surface, it was just asking for an informal dinner where the guild masters could meet and discuss strategies, to be hosted in the town in a few days.  </p><p>However, reading between the lines, there was another message, one that was not particularly hidden. It suggested that I keep the dungeon operation light until we could have a meeting. </p><p>While there was no other explicit mention of their plans, the intent was obvious. They wanted to establish a small cartel, one that could pressure the town into giving them a higher share of the profits. </p><p>“Tell them that I will attend the meeting,” I said. The nameless messenger smirked while Harold frowned. I turned to him. “Start working. We have to start building the outpost on the second floor. The sooner we start, the sooner we can start making a fortune,” I added loudly. </p><p>Just like that, their expressions changed. “Sir,” the messenger started, but froze when I looked at him. </p><p>“What, do you want me to give up a fortune just because of a letter,” I said. “I’m not here to make a pittance.” </p><p>“I’ll deliver that message, sir,” he said before he turned and left. </p><p>Harold said nothing as we watched him move away. I could see him tense, and I didn’t blame him. I wasn’t feeling too different. In a more ideal world, I might have actually accepted their offer and maintained a low-key position. </p><p>Unfortunately, at this point, my wagon was firmly hitched to Maria’s side. A part of it was I owed them. Not all of their assistance had been intentional, but without their initial help, my life wouldn’t have been so easy. </p><p>Though, even ignoring that, supporting Maria was clearly the better option for me. They not only represented my only source of income, but they provided me unrestricted access to the dungeon, one without many uncomfortable questions being thrown around. Those two advantages were the cornerstone of my incredible development, and I wasn’t ready to give them up.</p><p>Unfortunately, this meant that we had made some very determined rivals that would benefit from our failure.  </p><p>“We should reinforce the security, sir,” Harold said. </p><p>“Do that. Feel free to invest eighty percent of the profit back to security. And, purchase anything Eleanor is willing to give up based on credit.” </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit daring, sir? If anything goes badly, we might lose most of our income.” </p><p>“No risk it, no biscuit,” I replied confidently. Admittedly, it was a significant diversion from my earlier attitude, as I was hoping to get a nice egg’s nest in case, but the latest transformation of my skill had changed my mind. </p><p>That qualitative improvement meant that, one way or another, I would make money in a way that wouldn’t be ruined by a new dungeon drop. A few extra golds I would be getting from the dungeon had suddenly turned useless. </p><p>It was a nostalgic feeling, one that I had lived through before. Back then, it was a trivial algorithm for a dating app that had unexpectedly given me a fortune that had allowed me to focus on my work rather than pandering to every little boring old man who thought themselves to be geniuses just because the university needed their donations. </p><p>And, this time, it was the Forge skill that gave me an opportunity for financial independence, the kind that not only allowed me to not have to worry about my personal income, but also research grants. </p><p>The irony was that both options — mathematical sociology as a discipline, and Blacksmith class — had been treated as useless options that could never be used to make a living by society. </p><p>Sometimes, stubbornness paid off. </p><p>I let my mind linger on the other things as I watched Harold organize the operation. The temporary construction workers were already separated into teams, but, to my surprise, only sixty crossbowmen split from the group. I would have expected him to pick more. </p><p>I asked about that when Harold walked to me once again. “They are the ones I preliminary picked for the guild, sir.” </p><p>“The reason?” I asked, more out of curiosity than anything else. </p><p>“They are the only ones that show the mixture of initiative and the obedience we need,” he said. “I thought it’s better to expand a bit slowly rather than hiring people that would wash out after a few days.” </p><p>A good point, but I was curious about his rationale. “And, you know that, how?” </p><p>“I was a marine before the Calamity, sir. A sergeant, to be exact. It helps me to see who will stick out and who won’t.” </p><p>“A good point,” I said. ”But, it must be hard to see the country you have fought so hard for disappearing into nothingness.” </p><p>“Nothing I could do, sir,” he said before he started explaining exactly how he picked up the candidates he had chosen. </p><p>The ease with which he had dismissed the value of his service and his country was interesting, mostly because it was a widespread phenomenon. I had tried to study that during my first days, but unfortunately, it was more of a psychological study than a sociological one. During the first days, I had just assumed it was the sheer impossibility of the Cataclysm breaking the old world order irrevocably. </p><p>But, now that I had discovered the Peace Field affecting every single town, I couldn’t help but wonder if there was any external reason for people so easily abandoning their old-world allegiance and higher concepts. </p><p>And, if there was one, whether it was accidental … or intentional. </p><p>I sighed even as I shelved that track of thought as yet another topic that I would look into when I had time. Or, as it exceedingly became likely, if I had time. The number of research topics I wanted to explore was getting more and more bloated. </p><p>I missed having doctorate students whom I could throw those low-priority questions at. Maybe I should start looking for a similar arrangement now that I had the necessary resources. Maybe I should pay a visit to one of those research institutes that kept rejecting me and poach a few people. Poaching their best members with excessive payment would have been a fitting payback.  </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to create a recruitment roadmap that doubled as a revenge plan, I had other things to focus on. Things that might not be as important in the grand scheme of things, but were certainly more urgent. </p><p>With the decision made, I focused on questioning Harold about the general direction for his recruitment and the security protocols as we walked toward the gate that connected the first and second floors. </p><p>And, I added a few twists of my own. </p><p>“Really, sir? Don’t you think large silver murals on every wall are a bit excessive? It would take several tons of silvers at the minimum. It won’t be easy.” </p><p>“Showing off wealth helps display confidence,” I said. “Not only do I want silver, but also I want you to cover the inner chambers with gold.” </p><p>I could see just how bewildered that request made him. I didn’t blame him, trying to make a dungeon fort pretty in such a gauche way was not a good statement. Unfortunately, the real reason was too important to reveal. </p><p>My Observe perk could only be used through metal. Silver and gold were much better than iron. Covering the walls with ugly murals would mean that, with little effort, I could establish an impressive scale of security.   </p><p>Not to mention, having a near-unlimited source of silver and gold around would certainly be useful at some point. </p><p>“That’s enough strategizing,” I said even as I stood at the dungeon gate. “It’s time to fight.” </p><p>“Shall I go first, sir,” Harold offered. </p><p>I thought about letting him do so in order to see his potential, but I decided against it. In a world where individual combat capability was the most important asset, a leader had to lead from the front to have even the slightest hope of fostering loyalty. </p><p>Even if the enemy was a bunch of insect monsters I could swat as easily as mosquitos. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 77</p><p>“[Nurture (Epic) 109 -&gt; 110]</p><p>I sighed as I used another concentrated dose of swamp poison to further push Nurture to a higher level, earning twenty more points in the process. However, that was not the only thing I gained. As the proficiency of my Nurture skill passed one hundred, it experienced a qualitative improvement, allowing me to choose between growth and other options like better fruit yield, stronger structure, and other features. </p><p>It was not helpful for the task next in line, which was to create a path of trees toward the possible direction of the fifth floor that would also function as a mining path, but eventually, it would be useful. </p><p>There was never any harm in more utility.  </p><p>My process of exploration was direct. First, I created a huge mining cart, and temporarily added a simple lever so I could use it directly. Ultimately, I wanted to add a steam engine to make it easier to pull, but that could be delayed until it was necessary. </p><p>Then, I forged a huge number of railway tracks, which was easier to do once I created a casting system similar to the one I had used for the arrows. The Epic grade Forging skill allowed me to handle it even faster thanks to the increased mana control. </p><p>A realization hit me. “I don’t actually need to create trees all along the path, do I?” I said excitedly. All I needed was to bury those tracks under the swamp, which would allow me to find it without creating a giant path of trees that would be visible. </p><p>That didn’t mean the effort I had put into Nurture was useless, as I still needed the roots of the trees to solidify the ground under the tracks enough that my tracks wouldn’t simply sink down, not to mention keeping the insects away was a critical step while I used the steam engine when I eventually brought the base to its new location. </p><p>Not to mention, considering the number of times I had to go back and forth, running without worrying about monsters would be useful. </p><p>However, It also meant that, once that was complete, I could cut the trees to prevent the others from easily discovering my new base. It was particularly important since I had managed to turn the other guilds into a potential enemy when I refused their offer to establish a cartel. </p><p>Once preparations were done, I finally started moving away from the dungeon gate, laying a new railroad, with two layers of trees on each side of the path, with Epic Nurture allowing me to raise these trees in seconds. </p><p>As I moved deeper, I was also doing two additional things. Every time I laid a track, I checked the ground for iron ore. I had discovered a few deposits with five percent purity, but I just marked them before moving forward instead of excavating them. I was hoping for a higher purity. </p><p>At the same time, after every ten rails, I crushed several shells in the separator, then, released the tainted energy, triggering yet another monster swarm. That way, I was able to check the monster density and direction, which allowed me to adjust the route slightly, always going toward the direction where the monsters were the thickest. </p><p>As an added benefit, I was able to test my newest spear. It was amazing. Be it Mana or Health attacks, all flowed smoothly, allowing me to kill even the giant insects from a distance with one blow. </p><p>“I need to forge a whole set for myself,” I said. I was thinking of not only weapons, but also a thick full-plate armor set that increased my safety factor significantly. “No, two sets,” I added as I realized that I still needed to wear my old armor outside. I could modify the inner layer of the armor, but the outer layer had to stay the same. </p><p>I could probably get away with one sword as long as I made it look identical to the looted sword I carried with me. </p><p>***</p><p>Just like that, I found myself lost in another routine, and a week passed, where I split my attention between exploring the dungeon deeper, forging myself a new set, and repeatedly visiting the first two floors to keep an eye on my growing guild and make some preparations for some unfortunate eventualities. </p><p>The exploration part was a modest success. Since the fourth day, I was getting attacked by the flying insects at an increasing frequency, which gave me the hope that I was going in the right direction. Unfortunately, considering my process of exploration required me to constantly lay down rails, it was slower than I’d have preferred. </p><p>For that reason, when I discovered a new iron deposit near the railroad I was creating, I created a simple steam engine to move my old base. The move took less than I expected for a simple reason: While I carried the forging equipment and other sensitive items, I left most of the iron behind. </p><p>I used that iron to create an underground chamber filled with various weapons, from iron javelins to a sealed iron tunnel with several half-complete traps that required a touch of Mana to be completed. It was a good mixture of an escape tunnel, a safe house, and an underground fortress that I could use defensively. </p><p>Having near-unlimited anti-corrosive steel was useful for more than one purpose. </p><p>The concept was nice enough that I built another underground base on the third floor, but kept the entrance buried, just in case I had to deal with assassins again. </p><p>Of course, while working on all of that, I had constantly visited the outposts, and even started sleeping at the fort on the second floor. At the surface, it looked like overconfidence, as a dungeon could be a dangerous place, but for me, it was much safer than the town, especially since the first version of the guild building was already complete, and I didn’t have an excuse to sleep at the headquarters without raising some problematic questions. </p><p>Not to mention, we didn’t have enough people to defend both locations, so prioritizing the dungeon was the obvious decision. </p><p>However, what took the most time was forging my new equipment that was based on the new capabilities of my Epic skill. It took a week for me to create a full set of armor, modify the other one that I was wearing outside, and create three weapons. The hammer, in particular, took a lot of time due to it requiring a lot of metal, but considering how important the hammer was to deliver a devastating amount of damage to any insect I might face on the fifth floor that might be armored enough to shrug off my other attacks, I didn’t want to take a risk. </p><p>I liked my new weapons. Unfortunately, while that intense session of forging took almost half of my time, it only contributed five points to my Mana Forge skill, which was absolutely glacial compared to my old progress. </p><p>On the other hand, my Epic Nurture was growing leaps and bounds. It was already nearing a hundred and ninety, which was significant progress considering its nature as an Epic skill. The poison distillation setup I had was working well enough. </p><p>I was already working on the design of a second one, though this time, I would probably integrate a better filtration mechanism, and a more decent centrifuge, aiming for at least ten thousand RPM. </p><p>The last thing I did was to practice the Floating Step despite my distaste for flying, as the deeper I went into the dungeon, the more critical my traveling time was getting. Luckily, I had found a workaround when I was working on my metal safe houses. As long as I practiced it in an enclosed space, the Floating Step kept me from flying upward. </p><p>It resulted in some very painful collisions, but that pain was much better than actually floating into the sky like a balloon with a snapped string. I was yet to make as much progress as I had wished, but even with limited gains, I was able to make the Fleeting Step faster. </p><p>It was worthwhile as the distance I needed to travel across the fourth floor increased more and more.  </p><p>“Too many things to do —” I started to complain, only to freeze when I met a very welcome view. A sudden, glowing gate, right into my vision. </p><p>The fifth floor. </p><p>While it was an exciting prospect, I didn’t rush immediately. I started by surrounding the gate with five rings of trees, just in case there was a nasty surprise waiting for me on the fifth floor. </p><p>One that followed me. </p><p>However, that was not the extent of my preparation. On the railroad, I had been dragging a large cart that was filled with iron tracks. With my tools, turning the remaining iron into some kind of war wagon that was covered with iron spikes was not a difficult task. </p><p>I could use that war wagon as cover, a platform to climb on, or even a safe box if necessary. </p><p>I pushed the box, and followed in. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 78</p><p>The moment I stepped on the fifth floor, I was greeted with pain. It wasn’t sourced from an attack — not for the lack of trying, as every inch of me had been surrounded by monsters. Flying insects, giant monsters, armored ones, crowded enough to cut each other’s path. </p><p>No, it was the very breath I had taken that had hurt me, burning my lungs like acid. </p><p>[-17 Health]</p><p>That wasn’t the only source of pain, as the moment I stepped in, I found myself in waist-deep water, and the amount that slipped burning like acid. Luckily, I was prepared for that, and jumped on the metal wagon I had created. That way, not only did I not have to fight buried in waist-deep water, but I was also safe from the underground attacks. </p><p>I appreciated it. While the underground attackers weren’t any stronger than the others, their attacks came from a different vector, forcing me to pay attention to them as well. The situation was complicated enough, with my vision dropping to almost three yards. </p><p>Things would have been far more complicated if my armor couldn’t just shrug off all the ranged attacks. I danced with my spear in hand, the improved alloy easily piercing even the armored shells thanks to the blue glow sticking around the weapon. </p><p>I stayed on top of the wagon, fought with a speed I had never done before as I pushed my Rare skill to the limit, not even finding a moment to grow a plant. The monsters were simply too many in numbers. Maybe I should return to the fourth floor to replenish my Health, to avoid a dangerous situation. It was difficult to count, but I might be killing a dozen monsters every second.   </p><p>But, before I could make such a move, I was greeted by a very welcome notification. </p><p>[Level 40 -&gt; 41]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>That was enough reward for the first expedition, I decided as I jumped through the gate, returning to the fourth floor, to adjust my plans. </p><p>The first thing I did was to open one of the silver containers to consume a dense nutrition bar, replenishing my Health. The fact that the very air of the dungeon was dealing damage to me was not something I had expected.</p><p>I couldn’t help but shiver as I imagined what would have happened if my weapons and armor weren't immune to corrosion. Would have they just melted away and left me defenseless against the monster horde, all the while the very air itself burned my body. </p><p>Yet, even as I processed all the ways I had gotten close to the dungeon, one thing was clear. The dungeon was not unlike a puzzle, with each level increasing the difficulty, but one that was easily dealt with as long as one learned the appropriate lessons from the earlier floors. </p><p>The only problem was that I wasn’t entirely sure I was learning the ‘right’ lessons. Even as my skills improved, which unlocked new, more complicated recipes, every single one of them had been designed for usage by individual warriors. Not even a siege weapon, let alone anything more complicated. Even the carts and other logistic items were not included. </p><p>“No time for such pondering,” I spoke aloud, disrupting my own train of thought even as I stood up, ready to prepare for the second invasion. As much as I wanted to return to the base and create a few plans, I needed to confirm a few more details about the fifth floor. </p><p>However, first, I needed a mask. Luckily, I had already experimented on the poison while I was trying to isolate it, and knew two things about it. Silver worked well to neutralize it, and so did heat. </p><p>Fashioning a breather based on those two principles wasn't too difficult. The silver part was trivial, and even the heat part was not too difficult. I just made sure to heat up the outer layer and add an insulating layer in between. </p><p>I made the silver part detachable as well, so, if needed, I could always use my sole magic skill to heat the mask back up. I didn’t see that coming up, but there was no harm in being prepared. </p><p>“Now, the tedious part,” I said even as I went back to the fifth floor, once again resisting the pile-up of the monsters. My breathing was once again uncomfortable, but this time, not every breath resulted in a loss of Health, so I chalked it as a success. </p><p>So, I stood on top of the war wagon, fighting against a veritable horde, their corpses piling around before they disappeared periodically. They presumably left skills behind, but I didn’t have the time to check the waters for those. </p><p>None of them were able to touch me, but that didn’t make their presence any less intimidating. As I fought against them, I started to understand why dungeon breaks were such a dangerous subject even more viscerally. </p><p>Alone and wearing the appropriate gear, the insect monsters were not a threat despite their great number. After all, there was a limit to the number of beasts that could attack me at once, and the disparity in equipment and mobility prevented that from turning into a problem. </p><p>Yet, I could easily imagine the same amount of beasts overwhelming the defenses of the town with ease. I sighed even as I continued to fight, dealing with the endless swarm I had triggered. Thrice, I needed to return to the fourth floor to rest, and during one of them. I went back to the second floor to check the dungeon hunting. </p><p>I was still afraid of a sabotage attempt from the other guilds. </p><p>During the third trip, the numbers in the swarm finally started to lessen, but it wasn’t the only pleasant surprise. Another pleasant notification appeared.  </p><p>[Level 41 -&gt; 42]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>“Finally,” I cheered when I killed another beast, only for it not to be replaced by another attacker. At least, not a melee one. The ranged attacks continued to rain over my armor, but they were easy to shrug off. </p><p>I could have moved to hunt them, but instead, I returned to the fourth floor brought back a large sapling, and used Nurture to grow it.  </p><p>[-96 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Epic) 96 -&gt; 97]</p><p>Soon, I was looking at another towering tree. The additional notification was welcome. However, the moment I pulled back, the tree started to die, which showed that the same tree wasn’t able to resist the corrosion of this level. </p><p>“That’s not good news,” I muttered. Exploring the fifth floor without the assistance of the trees was not acceptable. </p><p>Luckily, its degradation was not instant. So, I quickly raised six more trees, surrounding the gate with a nice field, which finally expanded my vision. It was a welcome change, as it meant I wasn’t fully blind. </p><p>With the expanded vision, dealing with the ranged attackers was easier. The only problem, I had to periodically cure the trees. The expanded vision was worth the trouble, and the occasional points I received from the skill were well worth it. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no chance that the trees would survive in my absence, which was not acceptable. I needed a more permanent solution. </p><p>However, before I started that, I made several quick trips between the fourth and the fifth floor, using the excess iron to create a raised metal platform surrounding the gate, not unlike a pier. </p><p>Constantly walking through corrosive mud was not my idea of a good time. Only after I had finished setting up the area, I turned my attention back to the trees. I was tempted to try using Epic Nurture to somehow increase the poison resistance of the trees. I knew that was possible, as some of the farmers had that as a Perk. </p><p>But, after helplessly trying that for half an hour, I paused, realizing the obvious pitfall I had fallen into, constraining myself to the System because of convenience. </p><p>Why not use a technological solution, one that many startups had been trying to implement on the scale before the Cataclysm.  </p><p>Hydroponic farming. </p><p>I created several huge metal boxes, and filled them with soil from the fourth floor. Then, I set up another steam engine to pump water through silver heated filters, weakening the poison considerably. </p><p>The anti-corrosive floor meant that the roots of the tree couldn’t grow just as deep, but that deficiency was easy to deal with using Epic Nurture. Which meant, an hour of effort was enough for me to create ten layers of trees, allowing me to set up a base successfully. </p><p>Once that was done, I scooped the skills from the water. Every single one of them was Epic, and none of them was currently usable for me. </p><p>I stored them back on the fourth floor before returning to the fifth floor, spending most of my time working on my base. After all, with the way things were, trying to explore the fifth floor was not exactly a time-efficient action. </p><p>Especially since I couldn’t simply spread the trees. </p><p>However, my plans had been disrupted when the dungeon mist had suddenly split into two. </p><p>Revealing a gargantuan insect, charging forward! </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 79</p><p>“God damn it,” I growled even as I threw the work hammer to the side, grabbed my spear, and moved aside. The last thing I expected was to be attacked by a gargantuan monster, tall enough to tower over me in a suffocating manner. </p><p>A desperate dash was not exactly the ideal way of measuring, but roughly eyeballing it, I measured it to be somewhere around two hundred yards tall, and about forty yards wide. An absurd size, reminding me of a battleship rather than a land animal. </p><p>A beast of that size shouldn’t have been possible without being crushed under its own weight, particularly as an insect … but then, I was in a pocket dimension, using magic to hunt giant corrupted monsters. </p><p>It was three years too late to talk about what was possible or reasonable.  </p><p>I turned my attention to more practical concerns, trying to understand its physical capabilities. It was huge, yet, despite its size, it reacted to my escape with shocking speed, adjusting its charge. Without the Fleeting Step, I would have ended up between its mandibles. I was glad I didn’t have to test the durability of my armor in such a way, not with the way the ordinary anti-corrosive iron from the hydroponic garden snapping under its weight. </p><p>I didn’t optimize the metal I used on the garden for durability, but even without it, it would have tanked the attack of an ordinary giant insect with limited damage. Yet, against the gargantuan variant, it wasn’t able to resist the slightest. </p><p>Worse, as it drifted closer, the air I breathed gained an acrid quality, like I had forgotten to replace my silver air filter after using it for an hour. And, since that bitter smell got more intense the closer the beast got, it was easy to assume that the beast radiated some kind of intense corrosive aura. </p><p>The speed at which the distant trees wilted confirmed my theory. </p><p>Dodging didn’t mean my problems were over. As I moved away, I was attacked by the other monsters. The burrower variants burst out of the ground, and the fliers fell down, trying to suffocate me, while the giant ones charged. However, there was something unusual in their approach. </p><p>Up until now, during every single encounter I had, the beasts had been attacking me recklessly, always picking the closest path possible with the exclusion of everything else. This time, it was different. The fliers circled around me in confusing patterns, the giant ones attacked in a way that forced me to a certain direction, and the burrowers did their best to block my path as they burst out of the water. </p><p>They were showing tactical acumen. It was elementary, but due to the numbers they attacked with, it was still effective. And, as if the situation wasn’t complicated enough, their new tactical awareness meant that they could ignore the fear effect that was spread by the trees. Combined with the rapid destruction of the metal platforms under the mandibles of the gargantuan monster, the defenses I had created for myself were being destroyed with incredible ease. </p><p>In response, I drew my sword and released several ranged mana attacks, each attack cutting through several flying bugs before dispersing. As I did that, I jumped on the back of one of the giant monsters, using it as a platform, which prevented the borrowers from tangling with me. </p><p>Five ranged attacks were all I could throw out before my Mana drained completely. There, I switched to my spear, one hand slashing with ease. At the same time, I used my feet to roughly crush the mana-dense shells of the slain beasts, using the opportunity to replenish my mana. </p><p>Luckily, their tactics were not only elementary, but also rigid. As I jumped between the giant monsters, the attacks of the swarm slowed down, and their movement shuffled in a manner that could be called confused. </p><p>The gargantuan one didn’t appreciate it, doing its best to turn to face me. </p><p>Luckily, for some reason, the mist around it was gone. It was similar to the effect of the trees in terms of the end result, but the process was clearly the opposite. In practical terms, the trees repulsed the mist, while the gargantuan beast was pulling it toward itself, devouring it, similar to using Meditation in a Mana-dense location. </p><p>I circled around it, leveraging its most obvious weakness, which was its turn speed. However, calling it a weakness was a stretch. It rotated remarkably well for a monster that was the size of the warship. Even with my improved Fleeting Step, taking advantage of that required me to stick close to it. </p><p>And, the closer I got, the more disgusting the smell started to get, warning me that my filter was reaching its limit. </p><p>I couldn’t help but shiver even as I split between circling around the beast and dealing with the swarm, afraid to imagine dealing with the gargantuan beast without my long list of advantages. I stayed away from its attacks even as I focused on thinning the swarm, focusing exclusively on the fliers. </p><p>Whenever I filled my reserves, I used Mana attacks to whittle their numbers, or I switched to spear. Reducing the tactical complexity of the situation before I tested the endurance of the titanic insect seemed like a good idea. </p><p>However, despite my successful focus on fliers, the swarm showed no change of pattern, suggesting that their new tactical acumen was not only elementary, but also quite rigid. Another welcome change.</p><p>Only when the density of fliers reached a point where I could ignore them, I jumped on top of the gargantuan beast. The moment I stepped on its back, my lungs started to ache, its corrosive aura surpassing the limit of my filter. </p><p>[-6 Health]</p><p>It did not matter. I stabbed its back with the spear, first without covering it with mana. It sank well enough. Unfortunately, the beast was far too large for it to be effective. The sword reacted in a similar manner. Neither result surprised me. I switched to my hammer. </p><p>It was time to show it how a Blacksmith fought. </p><p>I brought down the hammer, using the mana attack I had designed based on my Quake attacks, depleting all of it in one attack. </p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>A large part of its shell shattered, and for the first time, it let out a sharp sound, one that I recognized as pain. It was good, but the even better part was the burst of mana that spread as I shattered its shell, allowing me to replenish my mana in quick order. </p><p>Its mana was far more dense in what I called tainted energy, but my Cleansing Meditation skill allowed me to separate the two efficiently, allowing me to replenish my mana as I delivered another attack … and another. </p><p>I had a feeling that the battle against the gargantuan beast was supposed to be an incredibly difficult battle. And, without the gear I had created with my Epic Skill, which allowed me to resist its corrosive aura almost completely, it would have been. </p><p>Even the iron I tagged as anti-corrosive proved to be only corrosion resistant, the broken remains of the platforms darkening and rusting at a shocking speed. Instead, it turned into a steady, almost tedious, process, not unlike another forging session. My hammer landed again and again, using its mana against itself. </p><p>Its shell recovered from the damage, but not at the same speed I could damage it, slowly weakening under my attack. </p><p>Yet, even with all my advantages, an hour after I started, I was still attacking against it. If it wasn’t for the weakening of its corrosive aura as its shell got more and more damaged, I would have to retreat back to the fourth floor to replenish my Health. </p><p>Instead, I stayed on top of it, steadily destroying its shell and the flesh underneath, my hammer landing on it again and again … until the beast stopped moving, and burst into a sudden blast of light. </p><p>The sudden disappearance of the beast meant I found myself falling down. My limbs clenched in fear as I found myself in free fall, barely able to pay attention to the movement of the light. It gathered into a point, almost like it was about to turn into a skill stone, but when I got near, it turned into light back again, and infused my body. </p><p>It was a weird, ephemeral sensation, like there was some kind of connection between me and the land around me. It didn’t last long, but when it faded, it left me with a nice surprise. </p><p>My range of vision had just doubled. </p><p>“So, it makes the gargantuan beast a dungeon boss,” I said to myself even as I started dealing with the remaining swarm. It wasn’t exactly a big surprise, as the length of the battle, along with all of its abilities, suggested that to be the case. </p><p>But, confirmation was always welcome. </p><p>I went back to the fourth floor, as I was exhausted, both physically and mentally. Not to mention, I needed to replenish my Health. </p><p>When I arrived on the fourth floor, I was greeted by a very welcome surprise. My vision range wasn’t increased by three more yards as I had feared but directly doubled. Excited, I returned to the earlier floors, and realized that the same pattern held true. </p><p>I gulped, realizing its importance. An expanded range of vision would be useful while exploring the fourth and fifth floors, but it wasn’t what excited me the most. </p><p>No, that honor went to the tactical flexibility provided by the ability to see more than the other people in the dungeon. It would solve my biggest fear, which was to be ambushed. </p><p>Maybe I should see if I could tempt the attacks from more dungeon bosses before I went back. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 80</p><p>In the end, I was able to kill three more gargantuan beasts before exhaustion won over me. </p><p>To my surprise, finding them had been the easy part. All I needed to do was to grow a lot of trees, and once the number had passed a certain point, a gargantuan beast attacked. While the reason for their hatred was a mystery — the disruption of the mist was my best guess — the effect was not disputable. </p><p>It helped me to draw them closer, and my vision expanded significantly in the process. </p><p>As I absorbed the resulting light, my vision increased even further. Session one added three more yards to my vision, the third one added almost four, and the last one added slightly more than five, which was more than I had expected. </p><p>Compared to that, the excitement from another level up, bringing me to level forty-three, faded in importance. </p><p>Initially, even my most optimistic assumption was for it to turn into some kind of additive effect, with each boss monster expanding adding some more to my view, while the more realistic assumption was for its effect to lessen with each consumption. </p><p>The quasi-exponential growth it was displaying was certainly welcome. </p><p>I was tempted to hunt a couple more, but my need for a nice, long sleep proved to be more important. I was exhausted. </p><p>Walking around in the dungeon with a significantly expanded range of vision felt amazing. Even with my skills and armor ensuring my safety, walking around blindly in a monster-filled pocket dimension was not a comfortable feeling. </p><p>Especially since I had already dealt with two assassination attempts. </p><p>Once I reached the second floor, my range of vision barely surpassed two hundred yards, which was an incredible benefit against any potential assassins. And, that advantage would expand even more as I continued to hunt for the gargantuan beasts. </p><p>With every day, the dungeon was starting to feel like home. </p><p>Once I reached the outpost, I decided to check the immediate surrounding area, making sure to stay outside the view of the hunter teams, watching the way they operated. I had checked their operation many times, but the benefit of distant observation was valuable. </p><p>I immediately caught two problems. The new recruits who had classes other than farmers were bullying the farmers. It wasn’t anything too extreme, mostly slurs, mixed with occasional pushes and shoves, but I decided to nip that in the bud. </p><p>I might lack the power to fix that anywhere else, but I wouldn’t allow that to happen in my own guild. </p><p>The second thing I noted was several farmer teams, doing their best to steal some of the shells, embezzling from my profit. That, I decided to ignore. It was not ideal, but there was a limit on how much I could pay them before my actions started to be treated as not just stupidly generous, but actually suspicious. </p><p>And, I had too many secrets to handle such a suspicion. Letting them steal a few was a good idea. Maybe I should ask Harold to create a semi-official channel so that they weren’t ripped too badly by the other guild members. </p><p>Harold was not in the base, so after a quick walk in the base, I returned to my room. “Let’s see,” I muttered even as I put my hand on one of the silver murals that covered my walls, using my Advanced Observe Perk to check every place that was connected to it, checking the existence of various metal seals I had created. </p><p>It was not paranoia when I had multiple enemies, with one of them already showing a willingness to kill me. </p><p>Then, I moved to the next stage, which was sealing the room. Locks, even the intricate ones that could have been used as a bank vault, were not secure in a world with both Dexterity and Perception. However, as a blacksmith, I had a much easier trick. I welded the door shut. </p><p>It was not impossible to breach the reinforced door, but it was impossible to do so without alerting me. </p><p>Only after that, I laid down, not removing my armor. Sleeping in armor was not comfortable, even with Health to resolve the worst of my stiff body, but it was another sacrifice I had made for my security. I closed my eyes, letting sleep claim me, my overactive mind replaced by restless dreams that were impossible to remember. </p><p>However, even that restless sleep proved to be a luxury, when I had been woken up by the insistent ringing of a bell. </p><p>”What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“L-lady Eleanor is here for an urgent meeting, sir,” the unlucky member said. </p><p>“Really, what a bad timing,” I grumbled in frustration. “Just as I was trying to sleep,” I added, and caught a surprised expression, one that he schooled immediately. </p><p>“Spill,” I said. </p><p>He looked uncomfortable. “I don’t know what you mean, sir,” he said, looking panicked. </p><p>“No, you clearly wanted to say something. Speak,” I ordered. </p><p>“I  … It’s just that I didn’t see you work in your chambers for so long, sir. Ordinarily, you leave the paperwork to Sir Harold.” </p><p>It felt weird, before I remembered to ask an important fact. “How long have I been in my room?” I asked. </p><p>“About two days, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Working on new tactics is time consuming,” I said, throwing out a simple excuse for the situation, one that might not have been entirely believable, but hierarchy had its benefits. People not bothering to ask questions was one of them. </p><p>I said nothing else as he led me outside, where Eleanor had been waiting for me. Her expression, more enthusiastic than anything else, suggested that she was here for a spar more than anything. </p><p>Luckily, it had been more than ten days since I had received the skill from her, so there was no harm in showing my great progress. Whether to reveal the full extent of it was a different question, which I would decide based on her reaction.</p><p>“Follow me,” she said, her impatience clear. From anyone else, that dismissive attitude would have been a grave insult, but I knew that she was obsessed with the art of the sword as much as I was obsessed with my studies, so I understood her frustration. </p><p>I would have been equally irritable if I had been distracted by a week of non-stop meetings in the middle of my studies. </p><p>I managed to keep my desire to tease her suppressed until we left the outpost behind, knowing that teasing her in front of the guild member would affect the authority we had been reflecting. It had been a fact I had dealt with for a long time. </p><p>“So, how was your week,” I asked even as we moved deeper into the dungeon. She groaned in frustration. “Come on, it can’t be that bad.” </p><p>“No, it’s worse,” she said, making a face. “Now that we’re making some money, there’s a lot of purchases that need to be done. More siege weapons, construction material for the town, new skills…” </p><p>“Sorry about that. I know it’s all my fault —” I teased her, which she interrupted by throwing a rock at me. </p><p>“Don’t be a smartass, or I’ll bring you with me next time.” </p><p>I chucked. “Hey, it’s not like I had a better time,” I said. “I spent most of my time forging the arrowheads, which left time for nothing else.” </p><p>“Really?” she said, but I could see her disappointment. </p><p>However, her disappointment only made me amused. I chuckled even as I drew my sword and attacked her. She drew hers to parry mine, which launched a short yet intense duel where she stayed defensive, letting me show my abilities. </p><p>“Impressive,” she said as she shifted from the defense to offense, and I found myself defending, while her attacks escalated more and more, her frown turning into a big smile.  </p><p>I didn’t hold back, but I didn’t push myself to my full capacity either, and just relied on the sword skill. </p><p>A reasonable time had passed since I had received the skill, and even if she had realized that I had reached the limit of the Rare skill she had gifted to me, I could explain it. She already believed that I was some kind of sword genius, and even if she found that unconvincing, I could reveal the existence of the composite swords I designed to make the attacks more reliable. </p><p>“Not bad. You have worked hard,” she said even as she started putting in an actual effort. She was nowhere near the real limit of her skill, but it was an actual challenge. In a way, the situation was very similar to the chess games I played with Maria. </p><p>I had no chance of victory — as long as we relied on swords only — but unlike Maria, Eleanor didn’t enjoy a one-sided beatdown. Instead, she limited herself in certain ways to make our sparring an actual challenge. </p><p>However, just as we fought, I noticed something distressing. Two people, both dressed in black cloaks, approached us silently, paying more attention to the ground than their surroundings. Interestingly, the monsters around them ignored their presence, which I suspected to have something to do with the subtle blue glow surrounding them. </p><p>And, once they were about a hundred yards away from us, they stopped, waiting for something. My guess was that they were waiting for us to speak and confirm our identities. </p><p>It was not good news. I realized that, without exploring the fifth floor and killing the boss monsters, there was no chance for me to notice them. It was that confidence that made them act like that. “Try not to overemphasize the defenses of your extremities,” Eleanor said even as she attacked from below. </p><p>“I don’t want to lose a leg,” I said while I defended and retreated at the same time, but my focus was on the unexpected presence of the two. The moment Eleanor and I spoke, confirming our identities through the mist, they started moving back. </p><p>Leaving me with a decision to make. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 71</p><p>When I stepped through the gate to return to the first floor with another cart holding five hundred shells, I met with a welcome sight. The small outpost had progressed far more than I had expected. </p><p>The internal fort I envisioned was already completed with solid bricks, perfect enough to suggest the involvement of a specialized class, and the second ring was already half complete. And, that wasn’t even the only change. Nearby, there was a pool that was almost ten times larger than what I had dug that was also considerably deeper. From that pool, a half-completed water canal stretched deeper.  </p><p>As I drifted closer, I started to be able to capture more details. Soon, I came to an expanded tree plantation, with almost a hundred saplings in place, though the growth of the new ones was much lower. Those changes were based on my orders, yet, the progress was surprising. </p><p>Then, there were the ones I didn’t order. The first thing that surprised me was the number of people in the camp. When I left, there were exactly fifty-five people there. But, as I approached, I could easily count a hundred, with more out of my view. </p><p>Most of the new additions were Farmers. The number of hunters and reserve forces was leveraged as fifty. And, with all of them committed to the hunt, their hunting efficiency was high. A few people were running into the deep, only to return with two or three monsters chasing them, their movement too fluid for them to not have Dexterity. </p><p>Once the monsters they brought along drifted into the range, the crossbowmen took them down. </p><p>The extra runners weren’t the only additions. Outside the second wall, there was a second team of farmers, growing an orchard of fruit trees, with smaller plants like tomatoes spread in between. Outside all, there were twenty guards defending the encampment. </p><p>While I took in the changes, Harold approached. He silently gestured to the cart, and the workers rushed forward to take and empty the cart. “An excellent haul for an hour of work, sir. Almost half of ours,” he said. </p><p>An obvious way of underlining his success, but I could see that he was tense. The reason was obvious, the development of the outpost was outside my orders, and he was afraid that I would disapprove. “Good work,” I said, removing that fear. “How are the contingency plans coming along?” </p><p>He paused. “T-they are in development, sir,” he said. As he said that, he glanced at the extra guards that were standing around, implying that the security was not in doubt. </p><p>“It’s good that you prioritized the development, but don’t do that at the expense of security. Once you finish the second wall, start drilling the emergency plans. I want to see something impressive when it’s time to change shifts.” </p><p>“I will do that, sir,” Harold replied. </p><p>“I like people that show initiative. Work for me well, and you won’t be disappointed. Just make sure to protect anyone that works for us, and don’t shortchange them for their efforts,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said. His desire to argue against the second part was apparent, but he kept his mouth shut. I had a feeling that my reputation for needless generosity was proving useful. </p><p>With that done, I didn’t say the farm that was growing food. It was working well, and considering the constant consumption of the farmers to raise the dungeon trees, having a local source of food was a good idea. Especially since we would soon have hundreds of farmers around. </p><p>“Continue the operation. I want to check the tree plantation,” I said even as I walked toward there. </p><p>“Sir,” farmers called, treating me like royalty. It annoyed me, but considering the alternative was dealing with constant assassination attempts, I decided to keep quiet. I ignored them even as I checked the base, wondering if I should raise the trees to their maximum height. </p><p>Having the ability to see more than fifty yards would have made the challenge of running the farm easier. However, it would also require a lot of alchemical boosters, which I currently lacked. And, for the moment, it was better if people didn’t realize the benefits of the water from the fourth floor mixed with the giant insect shells. </p><p>At least, not until I could move my forging base to the fifth floor. </p><p>I said nothing even as I used my own fertilizer to quickly trigger the growth of the trees on the plantation. It consumed half of the water, but provided enough trees to sustainably support a thousand crossbowmen I envisioned as long as farmers continued to tend to them. </p><p>Farmers watched my performance, split between fascination and jealousy. I wanted to talk with them, but I was afraid that talking too much would reveal some of my secrets. “Continue,” I said with a gesture instead and went back to Harold. </p><p>“I need a better cart, something I can work with pedals,” I said. “Though, make sure that it stays simple, I need to be able to fix it,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir. I’ll work on it immediately,” he said. </p><p>“Not you. You have a more important task. Delegate it to someone else,” I reminded him. “Actually, delegate it to three different people, and let each of them bring one. A good way to pick trusted workers, right?” </p><p>“You are wise, sir,” he said. It was a bit excessive, considering I just wanted an excuse to have three different designs I could examine for my own eventual take. I could have done it myself, but it would be a loss not to use resources when available. </p><p>“Good. They don’t have to be perfect, just make sure I can move on it faster,” I said. </p><p>With that, I once again left the growing outpost behind, thinking about my next step. </p><p>Moving to the fifth floor. </p><p>Asking for the designs I could work with pedals was a part of it. After all, if it could work with pedals, it could work with a steam engine powering it, meaning I could bring most of my base, including the metal paneling, at once. I could maybe even uproot a few trees if I could properly put it in place. </p><p>Combined with some kind of rail I could lay on its path and collect once the cart passed, such a model seemed to be viable for a one-time move. </p><p>Ambitious, but achievable. All I needed was to find the dungeon gate leading to the next floor, which wasn’t exactly easy, especially alone. The dungeon mist had reduced the visual range to twenty yards, and the fourth floor was huge. I didn’t know the exact size, but considering the third floor was somewhere between thirty and forty miles from one end to another while the first floor was merely ten miles, even my most conservative guess was around fifty miles, and eighty miles was not out of the question. </p><p>“And, can I travel to it repeatedly even if I discovered it,” I thought even as I considered the possibilities. The first three floors had unique cliffs, rocks, and other features that could be used to navigate, but the fourth floor was not like that. </p><p>It was difficult to separate one pile of wet dirt from another, and even worse, it was not exactly stable. Unfortunately, the only method I currently had in mind would increase the chance of discovery much further. I needed to decide which was more important in the short term: Discovering the fifth floor, or keeping my forge hidden on the fourth floor longer. </p><p>“The fifth floor,” I decided even as I once again moved deeper into the fourth floor, using the mana separator, once again using it to trigger a monster wave, this time using Breeze Spear to get used to it in combat … while, of course, not using the perk I had received. </p><p>The increased number meant that the dead monsters were piling up larger and larger. However, as much as the prospect of getting an Epic skill was exciting, it wasn’t my priority. My plan was simpler. I knew that, once the previous floors were filled with monsters, some of them started to spill to higher floors. </p><p>Four times, I repeated the trick, going in around my base in a circle, but all those attempts failed. </p><p>Either there weren't any different types of monsters on the fifth floor, or I was too far away from the gate leading down. Since my experiment already showed the existence of other types of monsters, I was more inclined to believe it was the latter. </p><p>Though, either way, it needed to be tested. I needed to get deeper into the dungeon. And, the fastest, most secure way was to create a path of trees going deeper into the dungeon. </p><p>While that was a viable path, it had two disadvantages. If someone stumbled upon its existence, it would lead them right to my base, but it could be handled by leaving some gaps and false trails. It would still be a risk, but considering the other guilds were yet to send their main forces, the time was the safest for it. </p><p>Once they took note of the money my guild was making, they would inevitably send more forces, and some of them would inevitably explore the dungeon. As long as they were willing to spend money, corrosion could be defeated. </p><p>By using sufficiently strong equipment, if nothing else. The corrosion effect was strong, but it lost its effectiveness against better equipment. </p><p> I needed to discover the fifth floor before that happened. Whether to move my base deeper, or just to visit and level up further — hopefully — was to be seen. </p><p>However, that brought me to the second problem. Currently, I had only one method of traversing the dungeon. Creating a line of trees that was miles long. And, it would be a slow and laborious process… </p><p>“Unless, of course, I decided to upgrade my skills,” I said as I looked at the three identical skill stones, their glow more intense than all the Rare ones. Epic skills, and while I currently couldn’t see which skill they were, considering the drop rate, they were certainly Nurture. </p><p>And, I just needed to push my current Rare variant to its limit before I could explore its abilities. </p><p>“It’s experimentation time,” I said to myself. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 72</p><p>Before I started experimenting, I visited the first floor to show my presence and keep the area secure, again with a cart filled with shells. This time, there were no surprises. The defensive walls were sprouting at an impressive speed that would make a Roman legion proud, while the others were already in place. </p><p>Everything was perfect. All I needed was to purchase more crossbows, and the corner of the first floor would belong to my budding guild. I could probably take over all of it, but expanding into the second floor was the better option. </p><p>If I took over the first floor and made a lot of money, it would either push the other guilds away completely or encourage them to explore the lower floors to make money like I did. Neither option was good for my objectives. </p><p>I returned to the fourth floor, my mind already churning on how to improve Nurture. The pattern of improvement was simple. I just needed to use the poisonous variant of the energy while I used my Nurture skill. </p><p>It was a simple plan, but there was one practical challenge. The only reason I was able to push the growth of the Nurture was the poisonous nature of the swamp water, which allowed me to push it further. However, just like any other challenge from the System’s perspective, its improvement effect dropped off significantly after a certain point. </p><p>I tested to see if the tainted energy worked as a better poison. Unfortunately, it did not. </p><p>“Let’s start doing some chemistry experiments,” I said. When it came to chemistry, I knew even less than material science. The latter, I worked hard to educate myself after the Calamity, and working as a Blacksmith for three years gave me a lot of practical experience. </p><p>Chemistry, I knew nothing about. I couldn’t even start guessing if the poison was some kind of organism or disease, a type of metal poisoning, or some kind of magic effect that bypassed the easy methods. </p><p>“Luckily, that doesn’t mean I can’t learn,” I said. It was the whole point of science. Experiment and learn. </p><p>And, with the abundance of materials available, setting up the experimental setup was easy. I thought of three easy directions. Boiling, straining, and spinning. Three easy methods to get a general idea about the direction I should follow. </p><p>Boiling was straightforward. I just needed to get a container full of muddy water, boil it, and see if the evaporation concentrated the poison. Considering the number of open fires I had in place with the blast furnaces constantly running, preparing the necessary environment barely took a minute. </p><p>I even set up an angular metal plate over it to catch the steam and direct it to a secondary container, just in case the poison component moved with the steam. </p><p>While that boiled, I forged a number of metal sieves, each with different mesh sizes. For a few of them, I even went to the trouble of creating hexagonal gaps in case it had some kind of mana effect that would be affected. </p><p>Hexagon patterns didn’t help, but the material choice did. Using silver somehow reduced the poison effect, while iron, even the anti-corrosive variant, didn’t destroy it. </p><p>Third, I created a centrifuge. At least, a simple variant. The top-tier scientific centrifuges before the Calamity could rotate over a hundred thousand times per minute. I knew that, because I remembered one of the geneticists bragging for a whole meal about getting a grant to purchase one with an RPM of over two hundred thousand with some other specifications as well, with a price tag of over a million dollars. </p><p>Instead, even with my skills helping me, I was lucky to reach 300 rotations per minute on my current device. While my forging skills helped me to handle the material challenges, the real challenge came from the mechanical aspects. It was not as straightforward. </p><p>Still, it should be enough to work. </p><p>Once my setup was complete, I ran a set of experiments, which gave me three inputs. First, boiling destroyed both the fertilizer effect and the poison, leaving something closer to pure water. Not enough to drink it, but then the setup wasn’t exactly designed for pure isolation. </p><p>A more rigorous distillation setup might have given me pure water. Not exactly critical under the circumstances, but nice to know in case of an emergency. It meant that even if I got lost, I wouldn’t die from thirst. </p><p>The second set of experiments was simpler. Using sieves was somewhat helpful. It wasn’t exactly perfect, as the material on both sides contained both fertilizer and poison effect. The ground particles had worked more as a fertilizer, while the water acted as a poison. </p><p>I still put both materials on the centrifuge, which allowed the dirty water to coalesce even further. Once again, the water part carried the poison part. However, separating it from the water didn’t exactly make it more potent. </p><p>I created several large iron trays, and poured the water into a thin layer to make sure it evaporated faster, and kept that tray away from the flame, barely bringing it to a low simmer.  Not enough to boil it, but enough to hasten the evaporation. </p><p>That was the closest to the flame. The others, I kept farther away to better understand the impact of the heat. </p><p>And, once I set those trays and left them to evaporate, I went upstairs once more, dropping another thousand shells and watching the operation a bit. Then, I went to the second floor, and five minutes later, I returned with a broken cart and picked a new one. Maybe it was slightly paranoid, but considering Thomas killed more than a hundred people in his latest attempt, I didn’t consider it below him. </p><p>It was better to keep any potential spy guessing. </p><p>Once I returned to the fourth floor, I started experimenting with the water in the trays. The damage to the plants confirmed that evaporation was a good way to increase the poisoning effect on the plants, but heat somewhat damaged the process. </p><p>“How fun,” I muttered. The effect of the heat made the creation of poison water difficult, but not impossible. Luckily, I had the steam engine to provide constant motion. </p><p>First, I created a huge water reservoir, made of entirely metal, with an adjustable sieve at the bottom. It had a channel, which constantly dripped water into a centrifuge powered by the steam engine, which rotated at around 400 RPM. As the centrifuge rotated, the particles moved toward the edge, but spilled only when the water amount had turned too much. </p><p>Meanwhile, there was a small gap at the center, which allowed the purer — poisonous — water to flow to another channel, which led to multiple, layered trays that collected the water. Each layer, except the bottom one, had a Pythagorean cup setup, meaning water had been collected slowly in a layer, and once it reached a certain height, it started to drain until it reached the minimum level. </p><p>Not too different from using a hose to drain a gas tank. </p><p>And, to complete, there was a ventilator attached to the steam engine, creating wind to enhance evaporation speed. </p><p>As each layer evaporated, the ones at the lower layers started to gather denser poison. That way, the process was sustainable without constant supervision — other than cleaning the sieves occasionally — giving me a selection of poisons of different concentrations to choose from, which I could use to improve my Nurture skills. </p><p>Since I needed to improve my Nurture ability quickly, I built the tray system larger than necessary. It consumed almost fifteen metric tons of corrosion-resistant iron, with each tray spreading almost a thousand square feet, which was the size of a decent three-bedroom apartment. Connected to each tray, there was a reservoir that didn’t drain even when the suction setup was triggered, allowing me to get a sample from whichever layer I wished.  </p><p>As I worked on adding more trays to the bottom, the first layer reservoir and the tray had been filled, and the tray section had been drained thrice, while the second reservoir had collected a decent amount. </p><p>Unfortunately, the evaporation process required some time, meaning I needed to work more.  </p><p>“Let’s try it,” I said even as I scooped a small bucket from both the first and the second reservoirs. And, I used the first one on a mature tree. </p><p>[-48 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Rare)  97 -&gt; 99]</p><p>“Not bad, but it could be better,” I said even as I took a cutting from the tree, and grew a new one. </p><p>[-123 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Rare)  99 -&gt; 106]</p><p>“Much better,” I said even as I repeated it a few times. The poison from the first layer lost its effectiveness at just above a hundred and thirty attempts, while the second one kept me going a bit more. When I finished, my Nurture skills had developed significantly. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare) - 152]</p><p>It was promising. Once the fourth reservoir had enough poisoned water, I should be able to complete it, but I had no intention of breaking the setup once I completed it. After all, since each layer constantly evaporated, it would take longer and longer for the lower layers to be filled with water. </p><p>Without a doubt, the Epic variant of the skill would require even more potent poisons. </p><p>There was another benefit of keeping the setup. It could be used to rapidly increase the skills of the other Farmers, which might actually unlock better variants if we pushed it far enough. Maria had already confirmed that class upgrades were not a secret. </p><p>However, I didn’t know if there was any difference between doing that through skill evolution and skill stones. Testing that with a few volunteers might actually help. However, at this point, I couldn’t do that with the eight thousand farmers currently working. I had already rocked the boat enough for the moment. </p><p>Once again, just because it was an open secret for the powerful families didn’t mean I could reveal it without putting a target on my back. </p><p>Well, another target. </p><p>“Patience,” I said even as I moved toward my mining pit to crash some more ore, refilling the ore feeder for the blast furnace. However, I noticed that the deposit was running out. </p><p>It was good that I was planning to start an expedition once I improved my Nurture skills to the limit. Since I was going to create a path with the trees, adding some rails and a small, steam-powered engine to bring back the ore wouldn’t be too difficult. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 73</p><p>“Code red sixteen,” Harold shouted, and the hunters immediately released their arrows before retreating, while all the farmers currently in the garden retreated into the first layer, each grabbing a spear as they climbed the walls. </p><p>A few more orders, and the outpost was ready to face a vicious swarm. </p><p>A successful drill. </p><p>“Very good,” I shouted. “Speedy response, and excellent work. You can return to your jobs.” </p><p>Harold gave several orders before he approached me. “How was it, sir?” he asked. </p><p>“Good, but it can be better. Make sure to continue practicing, especially with the new intake. I don’t want them to die halfway.” </p><p>“Understood, sir,” he replied. “By the way, the carts you have asked for are already here. Would you like to see them?” </p><p>I nodded, and he brought me inside the second wall, where three different carts were waiting for me. The cart portion was done well, but the same couldn’t be said for the connection between the pedals and the wheels. </p><p>It looked like I wasn’t the only one struggling with the more mechanical aspects. It was workable, but in a way, it struggled with the same problem most of my equipment did, high-quality material used to replicate smart design principles. </p><p>It looked like I either needed to find someone that was trained as a mechanical engineer, or start studying the mechanical engineering aspects more seriously. </p><p>Before I could leave the outpost for another trip, a guard had called. “You’re here, sir Arthur. Excellent. Lady Maria requests you for a meeting.” </p><p>I looked at Harold. “Make sure that everything goes well. Make sure to add another pool to expand the gardens, and handle the shift change,” I said. “Also, be extra alert for the possibility of sabotage when I’m not in the dungeon.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” he responded. I nodded. I appreciated Harold’s efficiency. He was competent enough to rely on for a lot of things. </p><p>I ditched the guard, not wanting to lose too much time moving at a slow pace. While I couldn’t improve Nurture to the degree I wanted, it didn’t mean I had nothing to do. If nothing else, I could try to get more Epic skills. While I probably couldn’t activate Quake Hammer before my Strength reached a hundred, making preparations wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>Then, there was the issue of the iron ore deposit about to be depleted. I could recycle some of the equipment like the old experimental devices if needed, but I much rather find a new one. </p><p>Just like my primitive poison refining setup had shown, I didn’t know when I would suddenly need a lot of iron for another step. Not to mention, as the arrow consumption increased, I would need more and more of it. </p><p>The trip back to town was not eventful. I used the facsimile of the Fleeting Step I had long learned thanks to the Perk guiding me, and merely ten minutes later, I was at the town. To my surprise, Maria was not at the headquarters, but at the outer town that was going through rapid construction, watching the show. </p><p>“Impressive, right?” she asked. </p><p>“It certainly is,” I said, but truthfully, I wasn’t sure. Yes, watching the people juggle weights measured in tons through direct application of their physical might was impressive, but it couldn’t rival what we were able to achieve before the Cataclysm had destroyed our technology. </p><p>Even before, I felt that we had been too hasty to abandon that path, and my own experience in the dungeon had only confirmed it further. Yes, the skills were amazing, but that didn’t mean we had to give up on the benefits of the scientific method. </p><p>We watched the show silently before Maria waved her hand, and created a bubble to block sound. “I have good news and bad news,” she said. </p><p>“Let’s start with the bad,” I said. </p><p>“Alright. We were only able to get three hundred more crossbows.” </p><p>“Really?” I asked, surprised. “It was not a problem I expected to encounter. Was it Thomas?” </p><p>Maria sighed. “This time, no. We underestimated the guilds that are trying to get involved. They swept the market and purchased all of them. A few of them are trying to sell them with absurd markups, while the others want us to sell them arrows.”</p><p>“Still, buying all of them…” </p><p>She shrugged. “Crossbows are rare weapons to begin with. Often, magic or melee are the better options. Moreover, most archery classes prefer a bow. They are much more efficient.” </p><p>“True,” I said. “Still, altogether, it’s not too bad. The first problem is a bit annoying, but could be acceptable depending on the markup. If they want to purchase arrows, it’s even better. I can even sell them to you in bulk, and you can resell them. However, just note that my stocks are not infinite, so don’t sell them cheaply,” I said. </p><p>“But, it would reduce your profits.” </p><p>“Not necessarily. As long as I can add a little profit to the sale, I should still be making enough to sustain the guild. Don’t forget that I’m only earning two silvers from each shell, which is just above my cost. As long as you sell it for two silver coins, I’ll be making a small but sustainable profit. And, I doubt that even if you’re willing to sell, an agreement can be done in a few days.” </p><p>“True,” she said with a chuckle. “They are pushing their luck a lot, thinking that we have no choice but to fold to their demands just because most guilds are not interested in a weak dungeon that’s too far away from the trade routes. We’re lucky that the System shop that accepts the shells is not too far away.” </p><p>I paused. “I recommend searching for alternative System shops that might purchase those shells. Now that the production issue is solved, it’s the best point to exert pressure from.”  </p><p>She looked tense. “Do you think that will work?” </p><p>“Maybe. Better safe than sorry,” I said. Silence stretched for a moment while she considered my words. “So, what’s the good news?” I asked. </p><p>“The silver delivery is arranged. Five tons. Moreover, I managed to get almost two hundred pounds of raw gold for you to experiment with, though I had to pull a few favors. I even went to the trouble of bringing the gold with me. The silver will be delivered with the next caravan.” </p><p>“That’s excellent news,” I said. “How about raw platinum.” However, even as I asked that, I wasn’t very hopeful. She would have mentioned it if she had managed to acquire that. </p><p>“Unfortunately, we failed to find any,” Maria responded. “The price at the System shops is simply too high, all the platinum had been long sold. That’s true for the gold as well. You’re lucky that using gold as decoration is back in fashion, so it’s not impossible to find.” </p><p>I nodded. While the absence of platinum was a bummer — I was looking forward to using it to push my skill forward aggressively — the gold delivery was excellent news. I should be able to create a setup that would allow me to push it to the limit, which would hopefully trigger another evolution. </p><p>I needed that before I reached level fifty. The opportunity for a class upgrade was simply too valuable.</p><p>“Speaking of the dungeon, is there a way to trigger class upgrades for Farmers?” I asked. “I have a few Uncommon and Rare Nurture skills I collected while exploring. I wouldn’t want them to go to waste.” </p><p>“You can, but I wouldn’t recommend it,” she replied. </p><p>“Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Not really worth the effort,” she said. “Even if you use Rare Nurture for class upgrades, the results are underwhelming.” </p><p>“How bad?” I asked. </p><p>“One point of Strength or Dexterity for every five levels bad,” she said with a shrug. “Not exactly worth the effort.” </p><p>“And, how about pushing the skill to the limit,” I said. </p><p>She shrugged dismissively. “Who would go through all that trouble,” she said. “Ultimately, Nurture is the cheapest Rare skill you can find on the market by far, merely going for a few gold coins. Also, Rare skills grant better perks.” </p><p>I thought about asking for more, but I could see that she was already getting bored. I decided to end that talk. “It’s disappointing. Still, even a point every five levels is useful, at least for the ones I hire for my new guild. At least, I could do some proper hiring. No need to waste time.”  </p><p>“Your call,” she said, utterly uninterested. </p><p>“How about a chess game or two before I returned to the dungeon,” I offered, and her disinterest was replaced with a smile. </p><p>”Perfect. But only a few games. I have a lot of work as well. B3,” she said, starting the game with an unconventional opening. I responded, and our discussion had shifted away from the dungeon operations. </p><p>I was happy with her lack of interest in the potential of the Farmer class. Once again, her bored answers allowed me to understand what was common, and what was not. Just the confirmation that Rare Nurture could be used to give them Strength or Dexterity was valuable enough.</p><p>It meant that I could help them improve their class without raising suspicion.  </p><p>Dexterity would make it so they can use Basic Shot more efficiently — too bad the Common variant required Perception — while Strength meant that they could actually use Combat skills. In this dungeon, especially, having a Hammer skill could be a lifesaver against a swarm, as I knew from first-hand experience. </p><p>Especially if I armed them with weapons of my own making. Together with some stronger crossbows, they could actually operate independently on the third floor safely, opening a lot of interesting possibilities. </p><p>Of course, while she dismissed the value of letting Nurture develop naturally, I wasn’t exactly sure. My meditation had evolved automatically, maybe due to the adverse conditions. It meant that the setup I had created to increase the concentration of poison from the swamp could be used to make their skills evolve as well, maybe even unlocking better classes in the process. </p><p>However, that couldn’t be used without a basis for trust — and before I understood just how big of a secret it was. </p><p>Between the first and the second games, I decided to ask her another question. One that I couldn’t ask the guards without ruining the identity of an experienced dungeon delver. “Quick question. Is there any way to see more through the dungeon mist?” </p><p>“Without spending a lot of mana, or spending a fortune on alchemical boosters?” she asked. I nodded. “No, not for this dungeon,” she said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“In other dungeons, you can always travel to the last floor to kill the domain creatures, which gives you a crystal. This crystal, when absorbed, allows one to see farther through the dungeon mist, but with the way the fourth floor is, it’s not really a viable path,” she said. </p><p>“Can’t you just use the crystal from a different dungeon?” I asked. </p><p>“No, that’s unique for each dungeon,” she said. </p><p>I nodded, adding that to the topics to be researched. </p><p>But, that was for the future. </p><p>Tonight, I had another date with my skills, to see whether my Mana Forge or Nurture would reach Epic first… </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 74</p><p>I left the dungeon with another cart, accompanied by five hundred farmers and ten guards who were about to join the operation. Part of the cart was filled with the crossbows Maria had purchased for me. </p><p>Unlike what she had thought, I wasn’t particularly disappointed with the situation. While I welcomed the extra income the expanded hunting operation might grant me, at this point, I could leave the dungeon naked, and I would still consider the expedition to be a huge success. </p><p>At this point, Maria needed it far more than I did, meaning she had to be the one to visit the various towns and purchase crossbows. And if I needed it … I could always try to figure out a way to create a composite bow. </p><p>My Skills didn’t include woodwork, but that didn’t mean that I had to stay incapable of it. All I needed was to figure out how to make a half-decent bow part out of wood, and the rest could be made entirely of metal. </p><p>As for bowstrings, purchasing them was still viable. The guilds might purchase all crossbows around the nearby towns to pressure Maria, but purchasing all of the bowstrings was a move of a completely different scale. </p><p>Of course, the cart didn’t only contain the crossbows, but also several sealed empty boxes. The gold Maria had brought wasn’t a part of it, as I decided to just turn it into a thick plate and wear it under my armor. Considering its importance, I didn’t want to take any risks. </p><p>It was possible, while three hundred pounds of gold sounded incredible, from a pure volume perspective, it wasn’t too much. If liquified, it would be around one and a half gallons. It was heavy, but my Strength allowed me to carry it easily. </p><p>Admittedly, once I arrived at the dungeon, it proved to be an unnecessary precaution, but better safe than sorry. I led the crowd to our outpost, which had grown even more in my absence. “Sir,” Harold greeted, followed by a quick summary of the operation. </p><p>The performance was decent enough. I could identify several points that I might have done differently, but I ignored the temptation of turning into a micromanager and let him deal with those details, only adding a few strategic commands, both in terms of how to handle the old operation, and how to expand the new ones. </p><p>“Should we expand to the second floor?” he asked. </p><p>“Not yet. But, make sure to identify the best performers, and let them join the guild directly. Twenty of them for now,” I said, and passed Harold twenty Rare Nurture skills. </p><p>“We’re trying for the class upgrade, sir?” he said without any prompting. </p><p>“Yes,” I said, unable to help but sigh, realizing that it was not a feature that was particularly hidden like I had first assumed, at least, not three years after the Cataclysm. It was probably a bigger secret when I still had the money. “Just make sure to pick good candidates. Calm, smart, ambitious but not too ambitious. Most importantly, smart enough to keep their mouths shut about secrets.” </p><p>“Perfect foot soldiers, I got it,” Harold said. </p><p>I nodded. After all, he wasn’t wrong. While I had no intention of letting the ones Harold picked learn my true secrets — even Maria and Eleanor wouldn’t be able to touch house secrets, let alone Harold or the people he picked — letting them operate on the second floor already required revealing some secrets that were best kept under wraps. </p><p>I didn’t expect those secrets to be kept away successfully. Even without magical means like a camouflage ring, there were too many ways to dig out secrets, including simple bribery. </p><p>However, there was a difference between an ambitious recruit selling secrets for several gold coins, and an arrogant one bragging to everyone after a night of drinking. I couldn’t prevent the former, but the latter was easier to deal with. </p><p>“Excellent. Make sure to work them hard. Tomorrow, we’ll start building an outpost on the second floor,” I told him. </p><p>With that, I left him to organize the operators while I immediately rushed to the fourth floor. The first thing I did was to remove all the gold from my armor, and place it into the forge. It was tempting to start working on forging gold items immediately, but I turned my attention to the poison refinement setup. </p><p>With some poisonous mix already gathered on the sixth tray, I had an easy way to push Nurture to the limit. It merely took half an hour, and the poison at the fifth tray had been enough. All I needed was to repeatedly poison and cure a tree. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare) 196 -&gt; 200]</p><p>[Perk Options — Bountiful Growth / Efficient Harvest / Lingering Tend] </p><p>I picked Bountiful Growth, spending a few minutes to test its effect. It helped me to grow the trees far faster. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t even begin to understand how it affected the original setup. And, without understanding, I couldn’t reverse engineer it. A great loss. I might have done so if I had a few months to delve deep into the secrets of Nurture. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was simply not an option.  </p><p>Instead, I pulled one of the skill stones I couldn’t have deciphered before, and smiled at the notification. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Epic)]</p><p>I absorbed it. What followed was not exactly pleasant. I had absorbed many different external skills, which gave me a general sense of what to expect. However, the sensation of absorbing an Epic skill was still more unpleasant than I had expected. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare) 200 -&gt; Nurture (Epic) 1]</p><p>However, the reward was worth it. “Let’s try it,” I said even as I moved toward a tree that was completely grown and touched its bark, trying to use only one point of Health, wanting to understand the differences. </p><p>[-5 Health]</p><p>To my surprise, I wasn’t able to use one Health. A few more attempts showed that the least I could use had turned to five health, and it only increased in multiples of five. </p><p>That was not the only difference. The Health, for the lack of a better term, felt different. In a way, it was similar to how Vitality attacks had changed the form of the Health, but instead of turning solid and sharp, it transformed almost the opposite manner, soft and docile. </p><p>The difference was interesting. The impact, however… </p><p>“Incredible,” I gasped even as I watched the tree grow after one continuous burst of Health. </p><p>[Nurture (Epic) 1 -&gt; 14]</p><p>Due to the poisonous nature of the environment, I wasn’t expecting to succeed at growing anything before I visited the third floor and pushed the skill to a certain, high level. To my surprise, it worked better than I had expected. </p><p>Some more practice with Health showed that I could still use the old form of Health for Nurture, but it had no effect on improvement. </p><p>I raised several trees. The effectiveness of the skill had grown further, and I slowly lost the necessity to improve the amount of Health I used by multiples of five, but I was still unable to drop it lower. Even more surprising, the growth of the skill had stalled barely at its forties. And, even after I had started using the six different intensities of poison I had collected, I wasn’t able to reach a hundred.  </p><p>[Nurture (Epic) - 92]</p><p>However, that inability didn’t mean failure. Even with Epic Nurture barely below one hundred, I was able to grow trees effortlessly, both in terms of time, and in terms of Health required. Epic Nurture was more effective when dealing with the corrupting influence of the poison water, meaning the trees could grow far more cheaply without being restricted by the swamp, allowing me to explore the region faster. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the only benefit I had derived from my Epic skill. While Rare attack skills had various Health-based special moves, they all worked in similar manners. Epic Nurture allowed me to work with Health in a completely different manner. </p><p>After an hour of practice, I was able to create that denser variant of Health more smoothly, and it had some interesting implications, particularly for Fleeting Step. Some experimentation later, I was able to create a variant that allowed me to move smoother. </p><p>When using the softer variant of Health, the movement wasn’t as fast, but it was far more flexible. With those benefits combined, it was obviously the correct decision to improve Nurture. </p><p>Too bad I couldn’t improve my other skills to Epic before I reached level fifty, which was why I hadn’t focused on hunting beasts for Epic skills. Even with my skills maximized, I still needed a hundred points in my stats to be able to absorb Epic skills. </p><p>But, with the prospect of my class tempting me, I decided not to hurry up when it came to leveling up. </p><p>Not before I pushed Forge to Epic level. </p><p>Or, maybe more. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 75</p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) 293 -&gt; 297]</p><p>“Well, that was straightforward,” I called even as I finished forging a very intricate silver-gold sword that gleamed densely with mana. To my surprise, improving Forge hadn’t required anything particularly clever. I just needed to forge various types of pure gold equipment and push the skill higher and higher. </p><p>That way, I was able to bring both skills to the threshold before dawn, even when I took multiple breaks to show my face upstairs, making sure everything was going well. </p><p>During the forging process, the only change I made was to stop bleeding into the molten metal. Unlike the earlier bursts, the denser Health I learned thanks to Nurture was easier to control, staying in the metal and allowing Mana to latch on easily. </p><p>That, combined with my steam-powered Mana crusher providing a Mana density that could hardly be matched outside, allowed me to rapidly push Mana Forge near the limit in less than eight hours. The ability to monopolize a dungeon floor was certainly an incredible opportunity. </p><p>It had been a shockingly efficient process, even when I didn’t neglect to improve my Repair skills in the process. Currently, both skills are at the edge of improving. </p><p>“Let’s just hope improving them again won’t be too hard,” I muttered even as I forged another weapon, this time pushing Forge to its edge. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 299 -&gt; Mana Forge (Epic) 1]</p><p>The sensation of improving a Class Skill was much smoother than absorbing an external skill stone, but that wasn’t because it contained any less information. The biggest thing, the Forge skill came with its own way of condensing Health, one that was different from both Nurture and combat skills. </p><p>It was closer to Nurture when it came to feeling, but with more viscosity. It felt heavier and moved slower. The differences were noteworthy. The modified energy worked far better to bond with the metal. And, more importantly, it was under the direct control of the skill, meaning the improvement in the skill quality was incredible. </p><p>But, all this improvement came with a very unfortunate side effect. Just like it had been the case for the previous mana attack trick, its effectiveness to improve had dropped considerably. Luckily, that was not my only trick. </p><p>While the skill was at one, it only contained the recipes for copper. Instead of forging them again and again, I once again used Nurture to imbue gold with mana, pushing my skill forward once again. It wasn’t as rapid as the previous attempts, but it was rapid enough. </p><p>Unfortunately, its effectiveness stalled when I finally reached a hundred and unlocked the proper forging recipes for pure gold. A big problem, but I preferred to focus on the benefits first.  </p><p>For one, I learned that the different types of metals actually required slightly different types of Health to maximize their potential benefits. It also meant that there might be other ways of using Health that created some unusual patterns. </p><p>That was a research direction that required far more than just a day to explore comprehensively. </p><p>Worse, I was afraid that it was too much for one person. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in a position to hire people, not without opening a dangerous box that I might not be able to close back up. </p><p>I repeated the same effort with the Mana Repair, and soon, both my class skills were Epic Grade. Interestingly, unlike Meditation, the skill name didn’t change. I had a feeling that, just like the Perks, it changed by the actions leading to the improvement. </p><p>Unlike External Skills, Class Skills seemed to have a memory for the actions leading to their improvement. </p><p>[Mana Repair (Epic) - 101 [Advanced Observe]</p><p>Mana Forge (Epic) - 102 [Advanced Creative Forging, Mana Control]]</p><p>However, even as I looked at the incredible development of my skills, I had a frown on my face. My trick of forging with the environmental mana had stopped working even when I was working on gold. </p><p>The reason for it was simple. Epic Mana Forge didn’t just have a method of condensing Health, it had a way of condensing Mana as well. From a certain point of view, it was excellent news, as it allowed me to forge incredible weapons. </p><p>Like the tiny spearhead in my hand, which was a unique iron-silver-gold alloy, based entirely on the new condensed Health and Mana I was able to utilize. It was superior to anything else I had in my possession. Not only was the material stronger and more flexible, but it also maintained an absurdly sharp point that could pierce through a rock without using any Vitality or Mana to reinforce the attack, and the thin wings it had on the side had an edge sharper than anything I had forged previously. </p><p>These attributes alone made the weapon incredibly valuable, but those paled compared to its real features. It enhanced the impact of Vitality and Mana attacks to a shocking degree. Not only was it easier to use those attacks, but also the damage was stronger than I was able to forge previously. </p><p>Several times stronger. </p><p>However, despite all the newfound advantages, its inability to use environmental mana was a deadly drawback. It meant I had to stop, absorb the Mana, deplete it back in just two blows, and repeat the process. It meant repeated pauses while working. </p><p>And, for the tiny spearhead I was holding, I had to stop almost two hundred times, which had extended the time of forging drastically— and this new method of forging was hardly time-efficient in the first place. Even the tiniest weapon I could think of took almost three hours to make. Forging a sword would take a full day, and I couldn’t even imagine how long it would take to put together an armor set. </p><p>That timeline didn’t annoy me from a practical perspective, though. I was sure that this tiny spearhead I was holding would go for an absolute fortune if sold in an auction. It would probably be enough to buy the dungeon I was currently in. </p><p>It was a bit of a stretch, but I was confident in my assumption. I had already used Observe on Eleanor’s sword back when I was learning the Vitality attack from her, and it was not made of anything that could compare to what I had in my grasp. And, Eleanor was rich enough to be a minority investor. If she was able to purchase something made of my alloy, she would have. </p><p>Knowing her, she would never turn away the opportunity to purchase a better sword. </p><p>More importantly, she was part of a large family, and worked as a bodyguard for one of their core members. I suspected that the family purchased a sword like that for her if it was possible. Meaning, either they didn’t have the access, or it was valuable enough not to be given to a guard. </p><p>Either way, it meant I needed to be even more careful. The previous ones, I was afraid of revealing because I didn’t want them to affect their profits. However, my new creation was of strategic significance. </p><p>That kind of importance could get assassins involved, and not the ragtag bandit Thomas had sent. Professional ones. </p><p>Admittedly, my experiences with Assassins were limited. Most of my knowledge came from the Pre-Cataclysm era, when I had temporarily joined a government project as a consultant. While my role as a sociologist was merely peripheral, I still had to go through a weeklong training to avoid assassinations due to regulations. </p><p>The number of ways someone could be assassinated was truly shocking, and that was before magic turned into a part of the world, adding thousands of other methods. “I wonder if there’s an Assassin class,” I said with a deep sigh, but stopped wondering. </p><p>Ultimately, I was not ready to reveal my secrets before I got a better understanding of the landscape, and that hadn’t changed. </p><p>Unfortunately, the need to keep a secret wasn’t my biggest problem. No… My biggest problem was a simpler one. </p><p>It would take a long time to improve Mana Forge to its limit. </p><p>I lost the ability to rapidly improve my skill by forging hundreds of weapons in quick succession. I had tried a few tricks, but the moment recipes with gold appeared in the skill, none of those worked. It seemed that I had to use the methods in the skill to forge the weapons. </p><p>And, even the simplest weapons were requiring tens of thousands of mana to be forged. I would be lucky if I got a skill point in three hours, and it would probably get more challenging as I improved. </p><p>“How quickly one gets spoiled,” I sighed, mocking myself. A month ago, I was happy to increase one proficiency point in less than a month. </p><p>Now, I was turning my nose to improving my Epic skill because a day would mean improving it only in single digits. I was still hopeful that platinum would benefit me the same way gold did, but I needed to work harder to get my hands on some. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe I could figure out a way to automate a portion of the process, or try to see if the more dangerous dungeons contained materials that could allow me to bypass some steps. </p><p>“Let’s shelve Forge and Repair for the moment,” I ultimately decided even as I started forging myself a collapsible spear shaft, steel with a gold core, though it was made with the old methods. </p><p>Since I had already created myself a superior weapon, there was no harm bringing it around for safety. And, once that was done, I went upstairs. </p><p>I wanted to be there for the creation of the outpost for the second floor. </p>",

    "content": "<p>However, a successful operation didn’t mean they had recovered immediately. Their current stability was utterly reliant on their new spiritual pillar. Meaning, that the destruction of the volcano would result in their demise, and there was nothing I could do about it. </p><p>“Well, let’s look at the bright side,” I muttered. “At least I don’t have to decide between staying and leaving.” It was not an option with Elsana here. I didn’t enjoy the sensation of being trapped, but sometimes, life insisted on being the exclusive supplier of lemons, and all one had to do was start enjoying lemonade. </p><p>But, since I had to keep the volcano safe for the foreseeable future, I had to change my approach. </p><p>The first thing I did was to bring my flying boat back to full size, and slowly channel most of its reserves to the mountain, leaving only enough for the return trip to the nearest outpost, knowing that, if the worst happened and I had to run away in a hurry, I had to rely on the System. </p><p>In that case, extracting some Qi from the system for emergencies would work. Still, I was glad that I had set many recovery stations on the way, making such a trick possible in the first place. </p><p>“Now, onto something more productive,” I said even as I reached the ship storage, and started pulling spirit plant seeds. Luckily, unlike my storage ring, miniaturization didn’t kill the seeds. Seeds of plants I had picked for the express purpose of showing ice and fire qualities.</p><p>It was a reasonable precaution considering the objective of my trip, but I was more thinking of providing some Qi to rejuvenate the place, rather than preparing for a siege. Luckily, it was not out of the question either. </p><p>However, I didn’t start planting the seeds all across the mountain. Instead, I created a small plant nursery, and planted them, not hastening their growth too much. </p><p>If the circumstances allowed, I would have awakened my new batch of prisoners and solved it through the System. Unfortunately, with the unknown nature of the Providence battle, I was reluctant to poke around it any more than necessary. </p><p>Instead, I went through the items of my prisoners … only for my eyes to widen. Even the poorest of them had wealth that could be counted by thousands of low-grade spirit stones. At first, I assumed that it was about their presence here, but as I went through them, I soon found many low-grade artifacts, some too damaged to be useful, destined to be scrap, too varied to be their own use. </p><p>“Robbery,” I muttered as I realized the source of their wealth. Which, considering their hidden demonic cultivation, wasn’t exactly a huge surprise. The spirit stones, I crushed directly to reinforce the mountain. </p><p>As for the artifacts, I broke them down to use them as nutrition for the spirit plants. Some of the spirit plants were hard to raise, requiring delicate treatment, while the others worked even better than the best garbage processor, spreading their roots through the broken artifacts. </p><p>Then, once they grew, I could use those plants as fertilizers for the others. </p><p>It wasn’t the best way to use artifacts in general, but kickstarting a new garden that could give me a renewable source of Qi was more important than anything. Land mastery might not make direct use of Qi, but just like the Burning Ice symbol, it was able to do so passively. </p><p>Once that was done, I finally started working on the storage ring of the inner sect disciple. I had left it to the end, because it had multiple traps … including one that would trigger a collapse if the disciple had been killed, or had a chance to trigger it. </p><p>“Let’s see,” I muttered as I started working on it. Unraveling its defenses took an hour, which was almost an eternity considering my System-given skills, and I had to apply both formations and artifact refining to unlock the traps. </p><p>Only to realize the storage ring had two independent sections inside it. “Well, that’s a beautiful gift,” I muttered even as I went through his stuff, but one of the jade stones caught my eye. I had already assumed that Elsana’s presence was yet another ploy of the fates, but this reward was almost enough to earn my forgiveness -- for the strategic inconvenience, not for the pain Elsana suffered. </p><p>“Mutmah Formation Technique,” I muttered even as I examined it cursorily, without activating it. I didn’t want to imagine just how many traps were in it to prevent anyone from using it, but I could just recycle it through the System … once I was far away from this place. As for how to learn, I had already perfected the method.</p><p>That was not the only technique in his possession, making me believe that their trip had been ‘productive’. </p><p>The real surprise was in the second, smaller storage. There were only two things there. A disgusting, horrible formation plate that radiated a familiar sense of death and decay, one that immediately reminded me of the stone gate under the capital. </p><p>But, the formation didn’t have any sign of the Everdawn Empire. Instead, it was filled with the signatures of the Entsa Pavilion. </p><p>“A grand conspiracy,” I said even as I examined it. No wonder they had so many traps. Its discovery alone was grounds for a declaration of total mobilization for Entsa Pavilion. </p><p>I put the unactivated formation plate back into the storage, but I kept the spirit stones out. A hundred medium-grade ones, which was enough to reinforce the lost Qi from the earlier attack and leave some excess for me to expand the garden. </p><p>Originally, spending Qi to hasten the growth of the plants would have been an inefficient usage, but since I would stay here for a long time, it changed. </p><p>What followed was a long, arduous process, one that was certainly boring considering the presence of twelve Golden Core cultivators doing their best to break through the natural land formation with their ceaseless attacks. </p><p>My role wasn’t a grand, violent last stand. Instead, the most challenging task I had was gardening. Admittedly, it was surprisingly challenging, as not only I was trying to pick plants that had to survive in the heart of a burning caldera, or in the depths of a blizzard. Even more challenging, both the essence and the Qi those plants provided had to respect the delicate balance between Ice and Fire. </p><p>That balance wasn’t supposed to be that fragile, but after the long abandonment that likely lasted more than a millennium, many problems crept up during the balance, and the constant attacks didn’t help. </p><p>So, I spent all the time I had left from caring for my patients and growing the garden to study Land Mastery, using my expanding understanding to solve those problems one by one. A challenging task, especially since I had to keep those improvements hidden from my attackers. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my ability to pinpoint the weaknesses of the formation, the defenses wouldn’t have lasted for another day. With it, however, things were far more efficient. Formations were an amazing tool, but the one great weakness they had, was that the enemy’s understanding restrained its greatest effectiveness. </p><p>It was even more true for cases like that, where multiple cultivators that were unfamiliar with each other, trying to combine their power to use a formation plate that was beyond their understanding. </p><p>Even better, after the last ‘accident’ I created, they started arguing, each blaming each other for the failure of their approach before retreating back to the ship. The good news, they stopped their attacks, letting me focus on deciphering the secrets of Land Mastery. </p><p>Unfortunately, I was afraid that it was just the calm before the storm. After mobilizing such a giant ship, almost as large as the volcano I was on, it couldn’t be the only tool they had in place. But, I just continued to study Land Mastery, knowing that, the more I understood, the better it would be. </p><p>But, before they could attack again, I had a nice surprise. </p><p>My patients were about to wake up. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Now that both the volcano and the blizzard were under control, traveling to the outskirts of the mountain took merely a minute under the cover of the blizzard, and I came across the people that was climbing the mountain. </p><p>As I approached, the details started to become clear. The first thing I noticed was the method they had been using to approach. Just like I did, they were traversing a line of balance to climb higher. Well, to be more accurate, they were trying to do that. The path they were following was a false one, one that would bring them to their end halfway in. </p><p>Still, I continued. While it was not convenient to use the System, it didn’t mean they would be useless. Spirit stones, in particular, would have been very convenient to have. </p><p>Yet, even as I approached, I started to feel something weird about their approach. Something they carried was resonating with the mountain itself rather rapidly, as if they were being accompanied by a disciple of Blood Essence at their peak … but something felt wrong. </p><p>The presence of that disciple was strangely disjointed, almost split into two. Something was truly wrong with them. </p><p>Maybe it was why they ended up following a false line of balance. </p><p>As I continued to approach,  I realized the surprises were not limited to it. The mix of the team was equally surprising. It was a mixed team, showing members of both Kartpa Valley and Entsa Pavilion, which moved side by side, pulling a cart behind them. </p><p>Considering the enmity between the two sects, I was surprised by the combination. I examined them more closely as I approached. At first glance, I could see that all of them were Foundation Establishment cultivators. Their numbers looked equal, but their powers were not if their attitude was any indicator. Understandable, as one of the Kartpa Valley disciples had been wearing the robe of an inner disciple. </p><p>Though, based on the number of times he caressed the fabric as they climbed up, I guessed that he was a recent promotion. </p><p>I let the blizzard wrap around me to hide my presence, approaching them, curious about the story of how they collaborated. It must have been an interesting story —</p><p>My thoughts came to a halt the moment I saw what they had been pulling behind the cart. What I assumed to be a singular being due to aura was actually two people, chains stabbing through their skin to forcefully mix their presence together, one representing ice, the other fire. </p><p>It was a disgusting act, one that would have earned my displeasure in any case — and considering I could directly control the mountain we were on, it was not a wise thing — but what truly angered me was the identity of the two. </p><p>Elsana and Lannayin. </p><p>Suddenly, my desire to avoid murder seemed like a silly concern. However, I was able to suppress my fury out of pure concern. Elsana and Lannayin were currently in a very perilous situation, and I didn’t want to kill them merely by accident. </p><p>Luckily, I had too many ways to solve the problem. I closed my eyes, using land mastery to channel the blizzard in front of them, which was only there to hide the formation I built. It wasn’t a strong one, but it didn’t need to be. </p><p>As it was only there to hide my next move. A small pill, turning into sleeping gas by a touch. </p><p>Cultivators rarely used poison. I had heard many of them claiming it was about martial honor and other nonsense, but the answer was simpler. Poison was not very effective against the cultivators. Once noticed, cultivators could dispel most poisons easily, and the ones that could not be harder. </p><p>Even the ones I used to defend mystic land were more like acid than poison, an overwhelming source of destruction without any hiding. The current sleeping poison was different.  </p><p>Luckily, I had two advantages. One, the formation helped me to reduce their alertness. More importantly, the constant blizzard and fire had already made their body numb, which should be enough to make them miss the signs. </p><p>It worked … somewhat. All but one had collapsed at once, while the Inner Sect disciple managed to stay on his feet. I immediately followed with an illusion, one that showed the visage of a black-robed skeleton on fire. “Invader,” the skeleton gasped. </p><p>“Illusion,” the inner disciple gasped, but his focus was all I needed was to drag the cart away from them, and the blizzard covered their path. He tried to cure himself, but I pulled the fire away, destroying the balance point. </p><p>Suddenly, he found himself dealing with freezing supernatural cold and poison at the same time, and eventually, he fainted. </p><p>Looking at the horrifying, grotesque state of Elsana and Lannayin, I was tempted to leave them to die. But, instead, I brought them up. I wanted to interrogate them first. </p><p>As for their ultimate fate, I would leave it to Elsana and Lannyin … once I saved them from their horrible fate. </p><p>Though, as I brought them to the center of the volcano, I was never glad for my double proficiency in apothecary and alchemy. They had linked their presence with an artifact, which turned out to be a demonic monstrosity. </p><p>Curious, I quickly checked the unconscious cultivators, only to see the signs of demonic cultivation in every single one of them, including the inner sect disciple, though the signs of it were buried deep. It was not good news, but one bright spot, it explained why they were together. </p><p>I left them unconscious. Interrogating them was not a priority. </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention on Elsana and Lannayin, particularly, their martial essence, which was in ruins. I was familiar with their old martial cultivation — very familiar in the case of Elsana — enough to understand what had been done. </p><p>Someone had destroyed it, and replaced it with ancient martial arts of burning ice, though instead of the proper understanding, they chose to infuse Elsana with the ice part, and Lannayin with the fire part. Unfortunately, there were multiple problems. </p><p>The first, but not the biggest, problem was the process. I had also cleansed the old martial arts essence and replaced it with ancient martial arts, but in my case, it was a careful medical operation, done carefully, using my Qi as a sharp scalpel. </p><p>In comparison, they were more like a careless landlord who decided to knock down a wall or two while remodeling the apartment, uncaring if they had destroyed anything critical. Calling the damage significant would have been an understatement. </p><p>Their haphazard infusion of ice and fire essences didn’t make it any better. They had just grabbed the essence from the mountain and forced it to bond with them, which technically brought them to the Blood Essence realm, but with great cost to their health. Then, there was the demonic artifact that linked them together, creating a mockery of the Burning Ice concept. </p><p>No wonder they had utterly failed to find a true balance point. </p><p>Unfortunately, while the depths of their failure might have been funny in any other circumstances, it currently was not. If the damage hadn’t been haphazard like I had been currently dealing with, I could have easily cleaned their cultivation and let them start again properly. </p><p>I closed my eyes, thinking about the best possible alternative. Soon, I removed the cultivation records of the sect, and started reading about their variants. Luckily, it looked like the balance wasn’t the only path they had been following. In the sect, there were also people who were dedicated to ice and fire. </p><p>Trying to elevate their martial cultivation in the correct direction while also cleansing the impact of the demonic artifact was not easy. I would go as far as to say that it was almost impossible. Not only did I have to use the full extent of my Alchemy and Apothecary knowledge, but I also had to apply my newly acquired artifact refining abilities and demonic cultivation techniques combined to properly deal with the artifact binding them. </p><p>Even then, if we weren’t at the heart of the Burning Ice base, with the volcano and the storm in place to properly settle in them as spiritual pillars, allowing their bodies to generate essence strong enough to overwhelm and cleanse the old remnants, I doubted that I could have succeeded. </p><p>But, in life, results mattered more than anything else. </p><p>Success.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>Retreating was not a simple problem. Not the physical extraction part. The cultivators were still working on suppressing the rage of the volcano, and every indicator I could see showed that it would take a while. </p><p>Unfortunately, that didn’t solve the main reason I had felt compelled to sneak into the mountain in the first place. I was afraid that they could somehow track me through the Providence of the Burning Ice. Worse, my recent insights about Providence not being a singular object, with a part of it helping me while the other trying to cause some problems made that rationale only stronger. </p><p>I had a feeling that, making the enemy of Fate, even a portion of it supposed to be a death sentence, especially since all signs showed that the part that hated me was the dominant party. But, it couldn’t, not with the System devouring Providence constantly. </p><p>I didn’t know what that entity was, and whether Providence was its entirety, or something Fate used to interact with the world as some kind of medium, but either way, the System interfered with it constantly. </p><p>“What the hell is the System,” I muttered even as I thought about the moment I received it. I still didn’t know who was the mysterious goddess that granted it, and whether she was just a very strong cultivator or some other kind of entity. </p><p>But, either way, she was strong enough to use something as miraculous as the System — the true extent I was yet to understand — as a punishment. A lazy, poorly thought-out one, at that, had given me too much advantage. The stronger I got, the more I was realizing just how strong that mysterious being was. </p><p>As much as I wanted to ponder on more about the source of the System based on my latest revelation, I had more urgent tasks to focus on. I started examining the metal pages on Land Mastery, treating it as a crash course. </p><p>While I didn’t have any System Rewards to give me an instant understanding, it didn’t mean I couldn’t make some rapid progress. Land Mastery was a complex subject, one that required the martial artist to balance forces beyond their comprehension and direct them, all without lacking the exact controls of the formation crafting. </p><p>My knowledge of martial arts essence helped me to capture the basics. To my surprise, my formation ability had limited application on how to master the basics, and calligraphy was completely useless, but I had received unexpected help from two different directions. </p><p>Spirit plant care … and painting. </p><p>The basics of land mastery had an unexpected degree of overlap with the two concepts. The spiritual plant care, I understood well enough. After all, both arts relied on concepts that required the caretaker to gently direct and control the mystical forces rather than controlling them directly. </p><p>Painting, on the other hand, came as a surprise, especially when calligraphy had failed utterly. But, the more I read about land mastery, the more I understood the reason for it. The conflict came from the most fundamental parts of the arts. </p><p>It wasn’t something as basic as calligraphy about being controlled while painting was about freedom. A beginner of both arts might have made that judgment, but that would be wrong. I might have cheated to receive my understanding through the System, but once received, it had turned internal. </p><p>And, that internalized understanding meant that I had a much better idea of what was going on. </p><p>Calligraphy was about direction, about imparting a sense of movement and intention in every stroke. Each line was a journey, starting from a single point and expanding outward, commanding the space it occupied with purpose. Yet, it wasn’t rigid. The moment the ink touched the paper, it got free, moving under its free will, creating tendrils that the master had to direct rather than control. </p><p>In calligraphy, there was no room for hesitation; a stroke, once made, could not be undone. Nor it could be paused halfway. Calligraphy thrived on this immediacy, on the boldness of commitment. A brief line of action, like a battle of swords, until the results solidified and set in stone. </p><p>Painting, on the other hand, was a search for harmony. It began with the many — the disparate elements of a scene, each with its own weight and presence. A brush stroke for a mountain, another for a tree, a careful dab for a cloud, all fragments of the larger whole that were put together slowly, patiently, requiring the painter to plan ahead. </p><p>A painting meant nothing halfway, just a collection of unrelated objects and concepts, creating a cacophony. Only when it was finished, the harmony was born, unified into a singular vision. A tapestry of unrelated concepts turning into one, a serene coexistence where every detail played its part in the broader narrative. </p><p>“No wonder cultivators love calligraphy while treating painting as a lesser art,” I muttered even as I truly pondered on the differences for the first time. Calligraphy fitted the life of cultivators much better. A single, unifying brush, controlling everything to create harmony, but ultimately alone. </p><p>With painting as the basis, my understanding of land mastery had grown leaps and bounds, especially since even the most complicated topics relating to essence, I had already known.</p><p>Together, my understanding of land mastery had grown leaps and bounds, and in less than a day, it reached the equivalent of Minor Familiarity.  </p><p>“Let’s give it a try,” I muttered even as I closed my eyes, once again using a formation to interface with the essence of the mountain. Of course, if I was outside of the mountain, my current level of knowledge would have been useless. </p><p>However, I was in the heart of the mountain, with a deep understanding of Burning Ice. The computer equivalent would have been sitting in front of a computer, with all the passwords already in hand, wildly different than hacking from outside. </p><p>The first thing I felt was the presence of the mountain, burning and freezing at the same time. However, what I felt wasn’t harmony, but rage. The fire and ice danced, trying to get free of their shackles, but ultimately failing, losing ground with every passing second. </p><p>Yet, even trapped, the power it displayed was great and overwhelming. </p><p>My understanding of the higher ranks of power was difficult. But, even if I assumed every Golden Core cultivator I had encountered was merely first rank, and the difference between the first and ninth ranks were equally wide as it was between the first and ninth stage of the Qi Gathering realm, the power of the mountain would still surpass them by a wide margin. </p><p>But, that power didn’t help against the Nascent Soul formation, controlled by the twelve Golden Core Cultivators. While the volcano felt like a living being, it wasn’t truly sentient, not even the way an animal was. It was better to compare that to a complicated plant. </p><p>And, like any plant, it didn’t truly comprehend the nature of the attack, lashing ineffectively. But, now that I was in control, it was different. </p><p>Through the land mastery, I could feel the formation around the mountain, and my knowledge at the Major Integration allowed me to get the general working principles of the formation even though it was a much higher-ranking formation. </p><p>It was merely a surface understanding. I could neither crack it, nor I could replicate its effects, but it didn’t prevent me from understanding the general shape of the formation, where the Qi gathered, where it had been transformed, and which channels it attacked on the mountain. </p><p>While my abilities didn’t allow me to unlock the door, it didn’t prevent me from knocking on the door, metaphorically speaking. With the land mastery allowing me to control the power of the volcano, I knew exactly where to attack to shatter the formation, which would have probably ended up painfully. </p><p>However, doing so would mean that someone was controlling the land directly, which was not something I wanted. None of the members of the Treasure Pavilion interacted with the volcano, and I wasn’t willing to believe that it was because they lacked the power. It was more likely to be something similar to what had been going on underneath the mortal kingdoms, where they were using others as tools to avoid the backlash of Providence. </p><p>I didn’t want to test their limits to see if they wanted to switch. Luckily, while defeating them was not acceptable, slowing them down was a different thing. I triggered another volcanic explosion, which had been accompanied by cracks, gathering the focus of the twelve golden cultivators. </p><p>A mistake. After all, it was not the volcano sect, but the Sect of Burning Ice. As they were distracted, the wind blew with an intense speed, forcing the essence through the cracks before the essence flared. It would have been easy to prevent if they were more used to working together, but clearly, they were not. </p><p>The formation destabilized enough to ruin their progress, the volcano spewing another burst of magma to force them away. </p><p>However, once their overwhelming presence was gone, I noticed an unwelcome problem. Similar to the Symbol, the mountain had been absorbing Qi indirectly to power its attacks, and after centuries — maybe even longer — of abandonment, the reserves were long lost. It barely had a month to recover, and now, the reserves were already dipping lower. </p><p>Maybe it was time to push the mountain to self-destruction and retreat, leaving nothing for Treasure Pavilion to follow. I should be able to do so as long as I study Land Mastery some more. </p><p>However, just as I started studying, I noticed a presence on the outskirts of the mountain. </p><p>It looked like the grand formation wasn’t the only method they were trying to intervene. </p><p>How interesting. </p>",

    "content": "<p>While deciding that ambushing the arrival would be a good strategic concept, it wasn’t that simple tactically, mainly due to two factors. </p><p>We had no idea about the nature of the reinforcements. More importantly, if we left them alone for too long, they would inevitably alert the reinforcements, who would be ready for an attack. </p><p>“So, what do we do,” Eleanor asked. “Do we just go and camp at the nearest dungeon gate, hoping to catch the reinforcements?” </p><p>“No, I don’t believe that’s the most efficient plan,” I said, but didn’t immediately declare it a bad plan. Until very recently, she had been my superior, and while she currently saw me as an equal, a little delicacy wouldn’t hurt. No one liked an upstart with a lot of new ideas. </p><p>It was a lesson I had learned when I first joined the faculty. </p><p>Luckily, while she frowned at my declaration, it wasn’t the deep, affronted expression that I feared. I didn’t know if she respected my acumen more than I had realized, or if it was still the good mood from her new sword. The former would have made me happier, but I would still take the latter as well. </p><p>“That's not exactly an efficient plan. They might just use another gate to arrive here, and we would be screwed. And, we need to stay near to harass them. I don’t want them to get the idea of targeting my guild to draw us to a fight.” </p><p>“What do we do, then?” she asked. </p><p>I bit my lip as I thought, then my gaze flipped to the ruined ballistas. “We’re going to use their original tactic, and destroy them with the ballistas,” I said. </p><p>“How? We can probably take them, but they would realize that there’s something suspicious.” </p><p>“Not if we bury them,” I responded. “Since they seem determined to attack </p><p>“Can’t we just kill them?” Eleanor asked. “This new sword is incredible, and I’m guessing you’re not too shabby with that hammer, or you couldn’t have soloed dungeon bosses no matter the trickeries you used.” </p><p>“True. I’m sure we can take them, but I doubt we could catch all of them if they decided to escape. And, more importantly, it would mean their reinforcements would stay hidden, looking for an opportunity. Wouldn’t it be better to get rid of them all at once?” </p><p>Eleanor paused, thinking carefully. “Alright, professor. You have one chance to put your plan into action before we go with mine.” </p><p>I smiled, doing my best to ignore that we were planning how to massacre about forty people, plus an uncertain number of reinforcements. That ignorance came easier than I was happy with, but once again, the immediacy of the situation forced me to ignore my own warping psyche and focus on practical matters. </p><p>Like, how to conceal my action of hiding my assault. The first step was to lure them into a false sense of security. Luckily, with the reinforcements on the way, they were also trying to kill time, giving us enough time to prepare. </p><p>During the first assault, Eleanor attacked from the front alone, still using her old sword to limit her threat level, while I supported her with several ranged spears. When Eleanor pulled back, she was already frowning. “I hope you’re confident in your plan. I’m not used to failure,” she warned me. </p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s clear that they want to kill time, and it gives us an opportunity,” I said. </p><p>“If you say so,” she said even as I accompanied her for another rush. “Huh, are you still using your sword?” she asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said even as I joined the assault, charging the mess from the opposite direction, expecting to fight in a combined manner. It worked well. I wasn’t as good as Eleanor, but a maxed-out Rare skill, particularly one that worked well with my Strength build, was enough to keep the five guards that attacked me busy. </p><p>Then, I noticed that one of the guards engaging with Eleanor was struggling. I pulled a spear from my back and threw it with a smooth motion before the others could realize it. </p><p>I wasn’t able to infuse it with mana in the middle of combat, but it didn’t need to. The guard who was trying to engage with Eleanor did his best to dodge the spear that he noticed at the last second. Unfortunately for him, Eleanor was too experienced to let such a mistake go unpunished. Two attacks were all she needed to destroy his guard completely before decapitating him with the third attack. </p><p>Georg seemed to be uncaring of the loss, but the same wasn’t true for the guild leaders. “Screw your plan,” one of them growled as he rushed toward me, and five from the inner line joined him, all moving toward me. </p><p>“Idiots,” Georg growled even as he quickly barked a few orders. The majority of the reserves attacked me, while Georg rushed toward Eleanor. </p><p>I stomped my foot to the ground twice, as Eleanor was too far away to see me, signaling her to continue with the plan. “Finally, little cowards joining the battle,” I said, louder than necessary even as I took a step to the side, positioning myself at the edge of the hill. </p><p>“You have pushed your luck, Arthur,” yelled the enemy guild leader, who I remembered talking to once or twice — though only if veiled insults and threats delivered by him while I gave one-word responses counted as talking. </p><p>“Oh, brave man,” I responded, forcing a joviality to my tone. “And, it took only the support of a dozen warriors to face me,” I said. Actually, an equal number of warriors were also trying to circle around me to pin me in place, but I acted unaware of that. </p><p>After all, they were supposed to be concealed by the mist. </p><p>He just growled in anger and attacked. Unfortunately for him, the skill mismatch was enough to keep their blades from ever touching me, and even if it wasn’t my current armor was strong enough to take any blow that might slip. </p><p>None of the blows actually slipped, but it was the difference between trying to do rock climbing with a safety tether on, and without it. The former was much easier. I pushed forward ‘recklessly’ which positioned me between the two parties. </p><p>And, coincidentally, near the broken ballistas. </p><p>“Oh, big brave guild master can’t defeat poor old me with just a dozen soldiers, and require more,” I shouted as the second group joined the mess. “Too bad,” I called even as I took a step back and switched to my hammer, ready to devastate the hill we were fighting on. </p><p>[-100 Health]</p><p>As I slammed my hammer on the ground, six different attacks hit me, but all bounced off helplessly. I didn’t even feel them enough to actually require Health to cure me, but I still made a show of grunting in pain. </p><p>Quake hammer destabilized the edge of the hill we were fighting on, which created a landslide that had three consequences, two of them intentional. The first two consequences were bringing me away from the ambush as I used Fleeting Step to surf over the wave of rubble, and burying the ballistas as intended. </p><p>The third one, however, had been a welcome surprise. The guild leader and five attackers, who were responsible for the ineffective attacks against my armor, had tumbled down with me. And, unlike me, they lacked the skill to help them keep their footing on such unstable ground. </p><p>Before the landslide calmed down, my blade flashed several times, making sure they could never stand up. Not exactly an honorable victory, but considering how things had developed, I wasn’t exactly burning with a desire to give them a fair fighting chance. </p><p>When the dust settled, I found the others looking at me from the fresh edge of the hill, looking horrified. I didn’t blame them. One against twenty was supposed to be the odds for a decisive victory, especially once I recklessly pushed in between them. </p><p>The loss of six of their members, including one of the guild masters, when the best they could do was to scratch my armor was not that. </p><p>Though, while thinking that, I glanced down, only to see my armor completely pristine, without even a scratch, making me realize that they weren’t even able to achieve a scratch.  </p><p>Fascinating and scary in equal measures. </p><p>I pulled back, and Eleanor managed to ditch Georg with relative ease as she had the advantage in mobility. Though, watching them fight, I had seen that Georg wasn’t any weaker than Eleanor, likely possessing a well-developed Epic skill, so I made a note not to confront him directly.  </p><p>With everything in place, stealing the ballistas under the rubble went without a hitch. Eleanor continued attacking, while I split my attention between supporting her from range and using one of the most famous siege strategies in the ancient world. </p><p>I dug a tunnel. </p><p>Thanks to a combination of mana and Strength, digging that tunnel barely took me a minute, and the constant sound of battle kept that activity concealed. </p><p>Soon, we were looking at six ballistas, pristine after a few touches, hidden behind a rock. A quick supply run to the safe house meant that we had the ballista bolts back, not to mention a fresh batch of throwing spears. </p><p>“Not bad, professor,” Eleanor said before as she started giving me a crash course on how to use them, which seemed simple enough with enchantments handling most of the work. “All we need to do now is wait for the reinforcements to arrive. Speaking of them, why do you think they have them?” she asked. “Wouldn’t it be better if they had been a part of the ambush in the first place?” </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I responded. “Don’t forget. While setting the ambush, Thomas suspected that I might be over level hundred, which meant I was harder to target. With the visibility in the dungeon, they weren’t sure to take both of us down. That way, once I retreated away from the dungeon, they could ambush me outside. Which means, we’re going to have a difficult fight even with the ballistas.” </p><p>Her smile was positively vicious even as she grabbed the hilt of her new sword. “It’s good that I’m properly armed, right?” </p><p>I was glad she was on my side. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“What do you see?” Eleanor whispered two minutes later, as we stood a distance away from them. Finding them hadn’t been too difficult, as they retreated back to the canyon they previously wanted to use as an ambush spot. </p><p>“As far as I can tell, all of them are here, and they look tense,” I said. “My best guess is, they are afraid of another attack.” </p><p>“Good. They should be,” she added even as her sword — well, technically my sword, but the more I watched her, the more I was convinced that it wouldn’t matter — flashed, and another monster died without making a sound. </p><p>Her ability to kill the monsters silently was one reason we had managed to stay concealed despite our relative closeness. Two hundred yards wasn’t close, but it wasn’t that distant either. Luckily, without their scouts, it was much harder for them to hear anything. </p><p>Also, it helped that most of the monsters in the immediate vicinity had already been killed during either the earlier swarms or their return, and the few that remained fell to her attacks easily, her vitality attacks cutting the monsters’ shells like butter. </p><p>“I would have said that we should return to the first floor and get some reinforcements, but I don’t like their attitude,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. </p><p>“They are tense, but not really fearful. It feels like they are waiting for something.” </p><p>“Maybe reinforcements?” she asked. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, then paused, thinking for a moment. “Actually, it might be risky, but I have an idea,” I said. She looked at me questioningly. “I need you to attack them, but retreat just as quickly.” </p><p>She smirked. I was glad that I was not the target of that smirk. “Well, I was looking for an excuse to test my sword properly,” she said. </p><p>Her unilateral declaration would have been annoying if the sword was actually a rare commodity, but considering I merely require half a day to forge another, it turned into something endearing. “Unfortunately, no,” I said to her. “You need to use your old sword.” </p><p>“Why?” she complained, her tone uncharacteristically childish. Luckily, she had the presence of mind to not shout. </p><p>“Because we don’t want to give out precious information during a probing attack,” I explained. Despite not having the strategic awareness of a general, even I could recognize the fact that, with the System in play, every battle was like a puzzle game. A tense, deadly puzzle game where both parties held certain cards, and a surprise could be the difference between a win and a loss. </p><p>“Fine,” Eleanor responded. “I’m going to attack first, then retreat, right?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes, just wait for my signal,” I said. </p><p>“Which is what?” she asked. </p><p>“I’ll attack them by throwing spears from the other side,” I said. “Once you hear the cries of pain, attack unless I shout for you to stop, but be careful not to be surrounded,” I said. “We need to make it look like a botched assault. And, I’ll smash a rock with my hammer when it’s time to retreat, which should still trigger a swarm. That way, you can retreat easily.” </p><p>“Is it really necessary?” she asked. </p><p>“Humor me,” I responded. “It’s suspicious that they are staying in place rather than trying to escape. It doesn’t make sense.” </p><p>“Maybe they are over-confident. They might believe that, as long as they are in a group, we can’t defeat them without reinforcements. Not that we will have any worthwhile support. Maria is not in town today, and none of the guards would be of use.”</p><p>“Assuming some of them weren’t bribed by them in the first place,” I commented, and Eleanor nodded. “They would probably have agents at the dungeon entrance, ready to warn them if that was the case,” I theorized. </p><p>“That’s probably why they are overconfident, and think that they can survive. We have the advantage, we should press on,” she said, and then her smile turned vicious. “With my new sword, I could carve through their armor easily, so their tactic wouldn’t work.”  </p><p>“Still, if there’s one thing I learned from chess or other games, it is that assuming the enemy is making a mistake without checking can backfire badly. And, since they already expect an ambush, we’re not really losing a big opportunity,” I said. </p><p>I was glad that I had taken the opportunity to destroy the ballistas, or such a probing attack would have been impossible. </p><p>Too bad they had already collected the wrecked ballista. Currently, they were at the side of the canyon, discarded like garbage. Their enchantments were still in place, and I could repair them just as easily as I destroyed them. </p><p>I should have dragged one of them away when I had the chance. A pity. Just as I was about to move, my instincts, which had been used intensively during my days as a professor, had tingled in warning. “Try to be on the side of caution. It’s just a probing attack. No making excuses to test your new sword,” I warned her. </p><p>“I wouldn’t do that,” she hissed, but I was sure that I didn’t imagine the guilty look on her face. </p><p>“Then, we have no problem, and I don’t need to threaten you with not forging you a matching dagger,” I smirked back, enjoying her affronted expression. Now that we were on a more equal footing, she was surprisingly easy to tease. </p><p>I carefully circled the group before I once again pulled my atlatl, and released three short spears in quick succession. I aimed all three to their heads, as just because it was a probing attack didn’t mean I was against thinning their numbers a bit. </p><p>Unfortunately, ranged attacks were much harder to land without a battle to distract them. The first spear was the closest it came to hitting the target, but even then, the guard was able to deflect it with a shield. The other two missed completely. </p><p>Meanwhile, from the other side, Eleanor charged silently and engaged with four guards. I expected the rest to respond immediately. Instead, the guards retreated back like they were overwhelmed. It was an obvious bait. </p><p>My attention was grabbed by Thomas’ bodyguard, who, rather than joining the fight, had moved away from Eleanor before he pulled some kind of device and activated it. The resulting mana flare reminded me of the other attempts to communicate through dungeon floors, turning into a straight blue line before it stretched away … only significantly more intense. </p><p>Following that, he went forward, and called for Eleanor. “It’s fun to see a familiar face,” he called loudly as he removed his helmet. Too bad he was too deep into his camp for me to hit him with a spear. </p><p>“Georg,” Eleanor called even as she stopped fighting and took a few steps back. “I should have known it was you from the smell.” </p><p>“Well that's uncalled for, Eleanor,” he said. “Just because we are working for different bosses doesn’t mean we need to be rude to each other. It’s just business.” Eleanor snarled mockingly. “We’re not here to hurt you, but to kill an enemy of my master. We were just trying to keep you distracted.” </p><p>As they spoke, I circled the group once again, standing behind Eleanor in a position where she could see me, but the others could not, and gestured for her to continue talking, hoping that they would reveal something. </p><p>“You were just trying to kill my ally. Oh, that makes things so much better,” Eleanor snarled in annoyance. “I should be thankful to your snotty master, then?” </p><p>For the first time, Georg looked angry. No, he was furious. A religious zealot fighting with another one style furious. He clearly took the insult to Thomas personally. </p><p>It didn’t surprise me too much. I already had enough evidence to conclude that Charisma had an insidious effect. And, Georg had probably spent the majority of his time glued to Thomas, constantly under his Charisma. Add in the fact that he followed his orders daily, which was a good way to foster loyalty and dependence even without mixing in a supernatural pseudo-drug like Charisma. </p><p>I had a feeling that it would be useful. However, while he might have been zealous enough to defend his master's honor, that didn't mean he was foolish enough to rush forward recklessly.</p><p>“If you insist on intervening, I’ll treat you as an enemy as well,” Georg said in a chippy tone, acting like Eleanor wasn’t the target for assassination in the first place. It wasn’t convincing, but he was too angry to act in a convincing manner. </p><p>“Like you weren’t going to before,” Eleanor scoffed as she rushed forward to attack again, going further into the formation than I had requested. I signaled her, but she ignored it, moving deeper into the formation, where the enemy could surround her if they wished. I tightened the grip on my hammer, ready to rush forward if needed…</p><p>But, to my surprise, they only defended even as Eleanor pushed her luck. The reinforcements they had called must have been even stronger than I feared for them to miss such a golden opportunity. </p><p>Facing an unbreakable defensive line, Eleanor pulled back less than a minute later, and returned to my side. Together, we retreated enough not to fear them eavesdropping. “Did you find what you were looking for?” she asked. </p><p>“I might have found even more,” I responded. “They called for reinforcements, and I feel that it’s not good news.” </p><p>“What do we do? Retreat?” she said, her distaste clear. </p><p>While that was a tempting idea, there was one problem. My guild was still there. They hadn't targeted it yet, probably because it was just a bunch of farmers, which made them a low-value target, not worth risking the ambush. But, if we tried to retreat … they had already shown that they had no problem killing hundreds of unrelated people just to inconvenience Maria. </p><p>“No,” I said, my voice sharp enough to surprise myself. “They still don’t know I can see through the mist. We go and intercept their reinforcements.” </p><p>“That’s more like it,” Eleanor smiled viciously. Any other time, it would have been worrying. This time, it was the opposite.</p><p>I could acutely feel that I was changing, a scary concept in and of itself. \t</p>",

    "content": "<p>Soon, we were standing in front of the cave that held my best gear. I could have gone in and grabbed my weapons immediately, but before doing that, I turned to her. “I need you to promise me something.” </p><p>She gestured for me to continue. “Go ahead.” </p><p>“I need you to swear that you’ll keep what I’m about to reveal to you a secret. It’s a matter of life and death,” I said. For a moment, she looked affronted, like I had just asked her to deface a monument to her religion. It clicked. “Except Maria, of course,” I added. “I know you two come as a package deal. I won’t ask you to keep secrets from her.” </p><p>I would have if it had any chance of working, but it was a moot point.  </p><p>She lost her tenseness. “Better,” she said. “But, I won’t make any promises in her place.” </p><p>“As long as you help me convince her to keep it a secret,” I bargained. I wasn’t entirely sure if it working, but I wasn’t under any delusion. The moment I decided to help Eleanor openly, I knew that they would pay more attention to my actions. </p><p>It was inevitable. Previously, no matter how much potential I had offered, I didn’t represent an actual threat. What I had displayed while helping Eleanor proved that I was able to fight on the same stage as them. It meant attention, which would eventually lead to the reveal of my secrets. </p><p>Voluntarily revealing them looked much better. </p><p>“Let’s see what makes you so tense,” she said even as I swiped the rocks from the entrance and revealed the safe house to her. There were several notable items, but at the center of the room stood my armor, placed on a mannequin, and next to it, stood my three weapons. </p><p>“Looks pretty, but hardly a big reveal,” she commented even as I walked toward the stand. “I was kind of suspicious that you’re holding back a new alloy based on the number of shells you collected without the assistance of your new guild, but mentioning killing a dungeon boss pretty much settled it. You need to be able to ignore the corrosion completely to actually spend that much time on the fourth floor.” </p><p>“Fifth floor, actually,” I corrected, which made her look at me with a sudden shock, which made me believe that it was a big deal. Admittedly, considering the difference between the fourth and fifth floors, it was certainly a big deal, but I seemed to guess that just by the mention of the fifth floor. </p><p>I needed to learn what was common knowledge and what was not. </p><p>“How?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, I’m sure this will answer some of your questions,” I said as I threw her the sword, hilt first. She caught the sword, almost absent-minded, but the moment she swung the sword absentmindedly, she froze like she had been struck by thunder. </p><p>“Impossible,” she gasped as she let Health cover the sword, which stretched significantly. “I … just…” </p><p>I smirked even as I realized the best way of getting rid of her. “Why don’t you go out and test it for a moment and meanwhile, I can change.” </p><p>She didn’t even deign to answer my question even as she stepped out. I changed into the other armor, grabbed my hammer and spear, and went out. On my waist, I still had the sword I used publicly, which wasn’t as good as the one I had given to Eleanor. </p><p>I wasn’t stupid enough to try and get back the sword from Eleanor … at least, not before I forged one of her own that fit her style even better. I shrugged. I still had my hammer and spear, which was already more useful against the upcoming battle. </p><p>The hammer in particular. I could hardly wait until I smashed their faces and — </p><p>I paused, my own smug satisfaction made me do a double-take. I was thinking about killing people. It was a deep, solemn event. But, I was treating it as a challenge to be cleared, almost like an exciting problem.  </p><p>I wondered if it had something to do with the fact that they were determined to ambush us, or if was I simply getting too used to violence because I had spent my days in violence. Yes, it was against mindless monsters, but it was clearly making me more callous to death. </p><p>“Maybe I’m the crazy one for actually trying to treat life as something sacred,” I muttered as I continued to put on my armor. After all, people had been doing their best to treat life as a currency — and not a particularly valuable one — as they tried to climb the ladder of power, both the system and the social kind. </p><p>However, the moment I finished putting on armor, I abandoned those thoughts. Not permanently, but there were better ways to handle a potential ambush. Regardless of my own feelings — or lack thereof — the ones that ambushed us needed to be dealt with. </p><p>I was afraid of what they would do next. </p><p>I replenished my throwing spears, and left the hideout. Outside, Eleanor was practicing her skill attacks, her face contorted in a familiar excitement while the life aura around her sword was thicker than I had ever seen. “Let me guess, you have earned a few skill points.” </p><p>“Try a lot instead. I have gained six points. It’s absurd,” she responded even as we started to run back. “Is this how you managed to improve that much in such a short time? I can see why you want to keep this a secret.” </p><p>“Yes, I don’t think a lot of city lords would appreciate the prospect of lower classes getting stronger,” I said. </p><p>“But they would love to have those swords,” she commented, looking confused. </p><p>“Enough to keep me a guest forever,” I responded. “Before I make any kind of decision, I want to be strong enough.” </p><p>“Then, why did you come here in the first place and play along,” she said. “Aren't there better ways to access a dungeon.” </p><p>“Well...” I said, realizing that she misunderstood the timeline of my development. I wanted to let her continue believing in that. Not due to any practical reason, but solely because I was ashamed. But, even the harmless lies had a way of coming out, and the last thing I needed was for her to believe my presence to be some kind of conspiracy. </p><p>So, as we traveled back, I gave her an abridged version of my story, up until their recruitment. It didn’t take long, as it was hardly a riveting story. “Really?” she said, chuckling in amusement. “The genius professor wasted three years of his life doing nothing but sending applications.” </p><p>I shrugged. As much as I wanted to defend myself about the impact of the peace field and how it potentially impacted people who lived in towns, I held back. Not because I wanted to keep it a secret, but because that particular topic needed far more time than we currently had to properly explain. “I have to admit it was not my finest moment, but it worked out. Without your help, I doubt I could improve my combat skills in such a short time,” I said. I wasn’t sure if it was entirely true, but being generous with credit was almost always a better choice.  </p><p>“Yes, you owe me,” Eleanor said, her smile widening. “Wait until Maria learned I managed to help you more than those silly experiments.” </p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far. After all, it was her experiments that allowed me to unlock Essence. Without her, I couldn’t use Mana ...” I continued, only to stop when I noticed Eleanor had stopped, and was falling behind me. </p><p>“Y-you can use mana,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>There, I realized that I had yet to mention that fact. “Well, yes,” I said even as I raised the sword, and let the mana gather around the edge, which turned mana into something actually visible rather than something that could be sensed through Essence. </p><p>“How?” she repeated. “The only way to unlock new stats is to upgrade class skills, and the skill stones that allow it are nearly impossible to find,” she said. </p><p>“Maybe, but it doesn’t exclude upgrading the skill directly,” I said. She looked at me blankly. “I’m sure upgrading the rarity of the skills through practice is not a secret.” </p><p>“Well, no,” she said. “But, it only upgrades to the rarer variant of the same skill.” </p><p>“Not always,” I replied, remembering my own experience with Meditation, which upgraded to Cleansing meditation. “And, sometimes, achieving something incredible, like creating a mana-infused metal alloy can actually upgrade the skill to a rarer variant.” </p><p>She gasped. “T-that’s a game changer.” </p><p>“Believe me, I’m aware. Why do you think I’m keeping all those secrets? People kill for much less.” I didn’t have any concerns about revealing that to Eleanor, as paradoxically, it would help her to keep my secret even better. </p><p>Ironically, the bigger the secret, the harder it is to sell.  My ability to forge weapons that even Eleanor couldn’t access from the market was a secret she could have sold for a king’s ransom. </p><p>The potential to upgrade production classes … was the kind of secret the buyer would have killed everyone just to prevent any accidents. </p><p>Hopefully, Eleanor was smart enough to realize that as well. </p><p>She stood silent for a while, her expression shifting. “We will talk about it later,” she finally declared. “We have a battle to win.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, we will,” I said, feeling excited at the prospect. The information I managed to glean from both of them allowed me to improve significantly. I was enthusiastic about what a true collaboration could bring. </p><p>But first, we had a battle to win. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I found Eleanor fighting a surprisingly effective hit-and-run battle, using her speed and Dexterity to the best of her ability. She wasn’t incredibly fast. I could see that her speed was somewhat comparable to Fleeting Step, though it was considerably more flexible. She was making movements too sudden for me to replicate even with Floating Stride, and it helped her to be never surrounded. </p><p>However, while that ability helped her to never be surrounded, it wasn’t helping her to actually deal the finishing blow. The reinforcements — the ones that failed to distract — had arrived, their numbers ensuring that Eleanor couldn’t focus on one enemy at a time. There were a few bodies on the ground, but it was likely that they had been slain before the reinforcements had arrived. </p><p>And, whenever an exhausted one retreated back, the potions and concentrated nutrition bars were in place to help them recover their Health. </p><p>Eleanor was incredible as she danced around them despite the numbers, her confidence not faltering even for a second, but I could see that her fighting style had been geared more toward evasive action and defense than stopping power. Not shocking, considering stopping power was one thing Maria didn’t lack. She just needed to keep Maria safe against the enemies while she spread destruction. </p><p>Unfortunately, without Maria, her lack of stopping power, particularly against armored figures, was showing. Her ranged attacks weren’t enough to easily pass through the high-grade armor. Not that she was using them often, no doubt careful about depleting her Health. </p><p>Admittedly, I was tempted to just turn my back and leave. I didn’t know what encouraged — or forced — Thomas to pull such an intense ambush, but it was certain that this wasn’t the end. From what I could derive from my limited interactions in mind, he seemed entitled and greedy. A bad combination, particularly when confronted with failure. </p><p>Back before the Cataclysm, I had dealt with people like him a lot, often in the form of trust-fund students who were under the impression that their family money should somehow afford them a passing grade. But, occasionally, I had dealt with them as a part of a disciplinary committee — yet another pointless time sink I had to deal with before the Cataclysm — where I had to examine their ‘discretions’ quite a bit. </p><p>Rich and popular, they were not used to losing on topics they cared about, feeling entitled to success. Some just threw a tantrum before avoiding the topic of failure, while others doubled down. </p><p>Thomas clearly belonged to the second category, the kind that would take such a loss personally. Another attack would inevitably arrive.</p><p>In that attack, it was certain that he would escalate things further. Yes, I had my setup, but now that the proof of concept of dungeon exploration was in place, I could easily move my things to another location. It was a smart decision. Looking rationally, no one could claim that I actually owed Maria or Eleanor anything. Anything I took, I had paid back more than tenfold. </p><p>Yes, I earned a lot, but I didn’t owe them for the benefits they hadn’t intended to give. </p><p>However, it didn’t change the fact that, since the Cataclysm, they were the first people I had truly bonded with. Hours of playing chess with Maria despite being demolished repeatedly, Eleanor’s constant badgering for another spar, the long dinners whenever we managed to get some time from our busy schedule. </p><p>“God damn it,” I growled as I had committed to a stupid, short-sighted, sentimental decision that I was sure would give me an endless amount of trouble. </p><p> I swung my arm, bringing the atlatl down.  </p><p>[-46 Mana] </p><p>Another spear let loose. This time, I wasn’t targeting a scout, on alert against the possible attacks, but one with his back turned at me, unaware of the risk. The spear exploded and took him from the back of his head. </p><p>The result wasn’t pretty. </p><p>Once again, the dungeon mist worked to my benefit, especially since the scouts had been working hard to stay out of Eleanor’s way, spread at the outside of the formation to track Eleanor to limit her mobility advantage. It meant, they weren’t able to see each other, the shocked cries of the other fighters weren’t enough to inform them about the true nature of the threat. </p><p>Before the crowd could even realize what had happened, I moved around, taking down all of the scouts. Eleanor looked equally surprised about the development, but it didn’t prevent her from moving forward to take down the surprised attackers. </p><p>I stayed outside their range even after I had finished dealing with the scouts, this time aiming for the armor joints. The damage from the armor-piercing variant might not be as dangerous, but it still blocked their mobility enough to give Eleanor an opportunity. The tacit cooperation was enough to allow us to take down six more permanently before they pulled back into a defensive formation that made my throwing spears useless. </p><p>Since only two spears remained, it was not exactly a great loss. </p><p>Eleanor, realizing the situation had reached a stalemate, pulled back. I approached her from the other direction, and once I walked her into her field of view. She looked at me in shock, which was to be expected. What I was afraid of was to find suspicion or hostility. Luckily, those emotions were absent. I was sure of it, as Eleanor wasn’t a particularly difficult person to read. </p><p>A part of me was glad that it was Eleanor and not Maria I had revealed it. While Eleanor had a sense of directness that didn’t appreciate subterfuge, she was grounded enough not to take my sudden reveal personally. </p><p>At least, under the current circumstances. </p><p>She had enough presence of mind to not speak at the earshot of the others as we retreated back. She just made a questioning gesture, but when I gestured for her to follow me, she didn’t complain, moving full speed as she followed me.</p><p>I didn’t know whether it was the reveal of my surprise, or the overwhelming number of enemies that convinced her to retreat without complaining, but either way, I was too happy with the outcome to question it. </p><p>“Someone has been keeping secrets,” she said, but only after we had put almost a mile distance between us and the hostile party. </p><p>“I have been told a little mystery looked good on a man,” I responded even as I gave her a comical pose with my sword. With my bushy silver beard, no doubt ridiculous, but she didn’t laugh. I shrugged. She must be still under the effect of the adrenaline. </p><p>She spoke almost a minute later, when we stood at the dungeon gate leading to the third floor. “Why are we going down?” she asked. “Shouldn’t we return to the first floor?” </p><p>I was glad that she was asking about it rather than ordering what to do. I must have really impressed her. “Not before we pick some gear from my stash. We don’t know if they have any other nasty surprises.” With that, I stepped through the gate. </p><p>“Nasty surprises, like what?” she asked. </p><p>”Well, the ballista squad, for one,” I commented casually, only for her to actually stumble. </p><p>“Ballistas, really?” she asked, shocked. For once, she actually looked unsettled. I didn’t blame her. A lucky ballista shot might not have killed her, but it didn’t need to. All it would have taken was for it to impair her mobility for a while, and the fight would have ended very much differently. </p><p>“Yes, all organized by a bodyguard of Thomas, I have seen him,” I said, then gave her a quick summary of everything that happened, all while still running at her maximum speed, easily killing any monster that we came across. </p><p>She listened to me without interruption, but I was too familiar with her to miss her growing suspicion. I didn’t blame her, as she lacked one critical piece of information that explained how I was able to outplay the enemy with such ease. </p><p>“Is it the camouflage ring?” she asked, finally interrupting me toward the end of my story, only to pause. “No, it doesn’t make sense —” she continued, only to gasp in shock. “No, you can’t be serious,” she said even as she put some distance between us. </p><p>It wasn’t the fear that made her retreat. Instead, she just raised two hands and raised six fingers from fifty yards away … a distance that I wasn’t supposed to be able to see her. </p><p>“Four and two,” I said, unable to keep a smirk away even as she looked absolutely shocked. I wasn’t stretching the reveal to mock her. Instead, I was letting her piece things together on her own, hoping that it would help her to process the other secrets I was planning to reveal. </p><p>I didn’t know if I would reveal all my secrets, but any decent subset would be shocking enough to be worth wasting a few seconds here. </p><p>She showed me a few numbers, and even wrote a few words in the air for me to read, which I told her with ease. As her shock melted into acceptance, she made one last gesture. “And, what’s this number?” she asked. </p><p>It was one. A special one. “Well, that’s just rude,” I said with an exaggerated offended tone. </p><p>“Sorry, professor,” she responded with a soft laugh even as she closed the distance, and we started moving once again. “So, you have managed to kill a dungeon boss,” she commented. </p><p>“No,” I said, and she looked insulted. It was a mean way of extracting information from her, but her disbelief just confirmed that there was no way of expanding the vision range without actually dispelling the mist — at least, to her knowledge. Old habits die hard. I quickly amended my statement. “I have killed four of them.” </p><p>She fell into silence once again, thinking for a long while. “You consumed the crystals yourself, right?” she asked. I nodded. “No wonder you were able to outplay the ambush so easily,” she commented. “Surprising.” </p><p>I nodded. She was right. It was surprising, but she was handling it well. I must have impressed her more than I had expected for her to so easily accept my claim of soloing a dungeon boss, let alone multiple. </p><p>I just hoped that she would be just as accepting of all the other secrets I was about to reveal. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Finding the main group had been easy. I didn’t have Perception, but the rushed movement of forty people, particularly when it was accompanied by a monster horde, was not too difficult. Luckily, not every single one of them had a movement ability, so they had to split their forces into two. </p><p>The main group, the bigger crowd, had rushed forward, while the second team, consisting of merely ten members, with six of them pulling the carts the ballistas were placed on, trailed behind them. </p><p>Their burst of speed confirmed that they were in communication with the other group, doing their best to catch up with Eleanor before she could finish with the armored team. </p><p>What I wanted to do was to talk with Eleanor and convince her to retreat, but I doubted that she would follow that suggestion. She was too confident, too headstrong. </p><p>I needed to equalize the stakes. The distance between the first and the second group wasn’t far enough for me to deal with all of them before the reinforcements could arrive — the distance between the two groups was merely two hundred yards, and I didn’t have the luxury of delaying them. </p><p>Luckily, killing them wasn’t my objective. </p><p>I attacked them from behind, which cost them a valuable second before they could raise an alarm. They tried to put a defensive line around the ballistas as they shouted, trying to raise an alarm, but it was too late. </p><p>I was already on top of the carts, and delivered the mana variant of the Quake punch, figuring out if it would be enough to destroy an immobile target. It was not. The siege weapon was able to resist the attack better than I had expected. </p><p>Thankfully, letting out a secondary blast of mana, this time under the control of Mana Forge, had been enough to deal with them. An Epic skill, even if it was merely a production one, was an incredible asset when used correctly. </p><p>I didn’t even need to destroy them completely, just damage the main shaft and add a large crack — one that I could repair just as easily if the need arose. </p><p>They made an attempt to catch me, but none of them had the necessary speed. I retreated, not only leaving them with their precious ballistas, which were turned into expensive junk, but also dragging a large box of ballista bolts with me. </p><p>I departed in a hurry, as I saw ten people splitting from the main group, including Thomas’ bodyguard and three of five guild masters I had recognized. It was an elite force, one that I wasn’t ready to confront. </p><p>I didn’t expect Thomas’ bodyguard to be as strong as Eleanor — or he wouldn’t have gone through all that trouble to set up such a huge ambush — but that didn’t mean he wasn’t as strong as me. And, supported by three guild masters and a few other soldiers, he had an overwhelming advantage. </p><p>Unless, of course, I changed the equation somewhat. </p><p>I picked a route that was almost perpendicular to Eleanor’s direction, which, as an added benefit, allowed me to stay near her without restricting my escape path. But, the real benefit was that it was on the path of the safe houses I had created, which also doubled as an armory, filled with javelins.</p><p>Manipulating their pursuit was easy. Several members of their party were faster than me unless I used Floating Stride, which was still not something I could use, but they didn’t dare to confront me without the rest. So, they moved near the group, spread to cut my path in case I wanted to make a beeline for Eleanor. </p><p>I changed direction occasionally, acting like I was trying to do that to make the scouts’ job of trying to find my location harder. Even with the help of Perception, tracking the location of someone solely by sound was not easy, especially when the man in question could incorporate wind into his steps, and monsters were hardly silent either. </p><p>When combined, my advantage in vision allowed me to easily avoid the traps they tried to place. I had to admit, their attempts weren't half bad both in terms of creativity and robustness. </p><p>In a way, it was like playing chess with Maria, where every move was done with a strategic robustness that I couldn’t come close to matching. Unfortunately for them, it wasn’t a chess game, where both sides had equal resources and equal information, where pure calculation ability of the stat and mindless repeating solved their problem. </p><p>It required them to systematically analyze the information granted by the Stat and direct it efficiently. Without a deliberate restriction and being pushed in the correct direction, the Stat didn’t work. A classic garbage-in-garbage-out problem. They were not even able to understand the reason for their continued failures, still under the assumption that we shared the same range of vision, just setting even more elaborate traps.  </p><p>In any other situation, I would have lamented about it being a waste, but coming from my enemies, it was always welcome. </p><p>It was appropriate to add some more complexity to their plight. I opened the box I had taken and pulled one of the bolts. It was mostly metal, but a quick check with my Repair skill showed me that the metal was nothing more than a relatively ordinary iron alloy, once again there to hold the enchantment in place. </p><p>And, the enchantment was far too complicated to even start making sense. I didn’t waste any time before I threw it toward my enemies. It managed to catch them in surprise even as it hit one of them in the chest … only to bounce helplessly. </p><p>Whatever enchantment was on the bolt, it didn’t trigger when I threw it by hand. </p><p>I threw two more, and they bounced off nearby rocks, and their lack of reaction implying that my method of using the bolts was utterly useless. Still, I threw a few more until I had reached one of my safe houses. I pulled the hatch to enter, placed the remaining ballista bolts there, and grabbed a bunch of throwing spears, as well as the spear-thrower I had designed. </p><p>Well, “designed” was a big word. A spear-thrower, or atlatl as my anthropologist friends insisted to call it, was one of the first inventions the early humans had ever come up with, believed to be in use for almost thirty thousand years. </p><p>It was attached to the bottom of the spear and folded against it. Then, the spear was thrown by the action of the upper arm and wrist. Atlatl acted as a low-mass, fast-moving extension of the throwing arm, increasing the length of the lever, and allowing the thrower to impart force to the dart over a longer distance, thus putting more energy and allowing for higher speeds.</p><p>Though, in my case, there was one other advantage. I designed the atlatl to hold my mana so that I could imbue the javelin as I wanted. Not only did it cause more damage, but, as an added benefit, it might have caused an outside observer to mistake the source of the attack, and assume that I had some kind of magical device rather than Essence Stat. </p><p>It wasn’t a guarantee, but I had done all that was needed to do so, including making the atlatl needlessly ornamental, with gold and silver fittings on the surface. It did look like a weapon purchased from the System shop. </p><p>Now, it was time for a field test. I moved away from the entrance, zeroing in on my first target: The scout. Not only was he not wearing heavy armor, which made him a good target for the ranged attack, but also his direction was a critical part of their strategy. </p><p>I channeled some of my Mana to the spear, weakening its structure appropriately as I targeted him, and released it. </p><p>[-40 Mana]</p><p>To his credit, the scout tried to dodge the attack. The combination of Dexterity and Perception gave him a chance despite the mist significantly restricting his vision. When all of it added up, however, even his supernatural abilities didn't help. </p><p>The spear not only hit, but the weakened structure started to shatter into razor-sharp, mana-soaked shards as it hit his chest with enough momentum to shred his clothing. The damage was severe, but Health was already helping him to recover. </p><p>[-37 Mana]</p><p>[-28 Mana]</p><p>Two more spears, one targeting his head, stopped that recovery. I couldn’t help but wince as I killed another man. It was not a good way to go. </p><p>“Take cover,” one of them shouted in panic. The one with the Intelligence tried to give some orders to change it, quick to realize that ranged attack had only been effective on the scout because of his lack of armor, but his command went unheeded as the orders conflicted. </p><p>One disadvantage of mixing the various guilds. </p><p>I decided to fuel their worry even further. I threw another spear, but this time, the mana worked the opposite way. Rather than spreading through its structure to weaken its integrity, it focused on the spearhead, reinforcing the impact point as much as possible. </p><p>[-95 Mana]</p><p>Then, I threw it to the one with Intelligence, one that was doing his best to control them. The spear sank into his right elbow, making him drop his sword in pain. </p><p>Loss of the only calm voice didn’t help their panic. It was a good moment to attack them … if I had the ability to deal with a team of armored soldiers. Unfortunately, I did not. Health made that process very troubling. </p><p>Even with the hammer I used against the gargantuan monsters, it wasn’t a challenge I would be willingly embracing. Without it, it was hopeless. Instead, I had just absorbed the mana from a few shells while they tried to recover, threw two more spears at the stragglers, and forced them to gather together to defend against the inevitable assault. </p><p>Then, I ran away to meet up with Eleanor. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You bunch of whipper-snappers think that you can kill me,” I laughed boisterously even as I suddenly started running away, but limited myself to ordinary running speed. “I didn’t get to my age by stupidly letting people ambush me.” </p><p>Before they could make a decision, I had passed the forty-yard mark. The cloaked one followed me from a distance, using hand signals to command the other armored figures. Once again, I enjoyed the luxury of having a better range of vision, as it allowed me to see their movements clearly. </p><p>They were happy to keep me separated from Eleanor. </p><p>That left the question: why bother setting things like that in the first place? Couldn’t they have just ambushed Eleanor when she was alone? </p><p>I didn’t waste too much time thinking about that, and instead focused on my first problem. How to ditch the cloaked scout, who was constantly updating the rest on my location. Then, I turned my gaze toward a nearby cliff. </p><p>At this point, I was familiar with Quake Hammer enough to create the same effect with a punch. It shattered the cliff, which came tumbling down. </p><p>That had two advantages. First, it was very loud, enough to confuse the scout who relied on his hearing. More importantly, the destruction of the dungeon fixture released the tainted energy that was captured in the dungeon, which pulled the nearby beasts toward me. </p><p>The scouts were able to prevent the monsters from attacking them by using some kind of item — which was another suspicious point, as I had no doubt such an item was extremely expensive, or it would have been a common gear for the dungeon guards — but the armored ones didn’t have it. </p><p>This meant that, with the swarm between me and them, I was free to retreat. </p><p>The scout tried to follow me, but I didn’t let him succeed. He was fast, but nowhere as fast as my modified version of Fleeting Step, which incorporated some principles from Floating Stride. Still, I made sure not to show that fully as I retreated back, bringing down two more cliffs on the way. </p><p>Then, I circled the whole area, moving at full speed, doing my best to calculate Eleanor’s current position. </p><p>A minute later, I was looking at Eleanor, still chasing the two scouts. There was no threat there, so I moved forward, wondering what kind of trap was awaiting her. </p><p>I moved forward, hoping that the commotion Eleanor was creating to conceal my approach. Though, I didn’t have to move too far. Following the path the scouts had been drawing Eleanor, I had found a relatively deep canyon. On both sides, there were two ballistas, ready to be launched. </p><p>Of course, that was not the full extent of the ambush. I could see almost a hundred people, their blades ready. I was able to recognize most of them as members of the various guilds, including a few leaders. </p><p>Seeing their identity, their ploy had turned apparent. </p><p>They wanted to kill Eleanor, and blame me for it. After all, Eleanor had publicly visited me before we left for the dungeon. </p><p>I had to admit, if they were trying that, it was a good ploy. It would not only weaken Maria’s support significantly, but also force her to distance herself from her biggest supporter, forcing her to rely on the other guilds. </p><p>Assuming, of course, Maria was able to handle the loss of her best friend. Knowing her, abandoning the dungeon to her family while she left to harrow in her depression was a much likelier option. </p><p>However, while the plan offered a lot of benefits, trying to target both me and Eleanor at the same time made the plan unnecessarily dangerous. From the perspective of the guilds, safely dealing with Eleanor was safer than the alternative. Refusing their offer to collaborate wasn’t that big of an insult. </p><p>Then, there were the resources that they had committed to the attack. The team I fought against before had been equipped to defend against me, which was a significant level of financial commitment.  </p><p>I suddenly had a hunch as I circled the group, trying to see the face of a figure who seemed to be in charge. </p><p>A bodyguard of Thomas. </p><p>I had no intention of directly attacking the group. The existence of six ballistas alone was enough to make the position unassailable, let alone the forty extra fighters ready to intervene. </p><p>I reversed the direction, using Fleeting Step to cut the path of the two that had been pulling Eleanor into an ambush, and managed to cut their path about four hundred yards away from the ambush spot. I rushed with the full speed of the Fleeting Step, and cut their path from the opposite direction. </p><p>They were fast enough that I couldn’t take them down easily, but I didn’t need to do that. I just needed to slow them down. Eleanor caught up with them, her blade glowing with vitality, and a few slashes were all it took to kill them. </p><p>“What’s going on?” she asked. “How are you this fast?” </p><p>“I also learned an Uncommon spear skill to surprise you during our spars,” I said, quick to explain and give an excuse even as I focused on killing the swarm around us. “But, the ambush forced me to reveal my hand.” </p><p>“I know. They are not as subtle as they think they are,” she said. </p><p>“And, you’re moving toward it regardless,” I said, unable to suppress my shock. </p><p>“Well, yes. How else would I deal with them?” </p><p>“And, you’re not afraid they have a force that’s overwhelming enough to take you down?” She snorted dismissively. “Even if they have siege weapons?” I asked. </p><p>That made her eyes widen. “No, that’s impossible. How do you know?” </p><p>“One of my attackers slipped it as I was retreating, trying to taunt me,” I said, inventing a credible source to what I had seen. </p><p>“Your attackers?“ </p><p>“Yes. My attackers. The moment you left me behind, ten more warriors appeared to cut my path, geared specifically so I couldn’t support you.” </p><p>“Still, I’m sure that together —” </p><p>“No,” I cut her off. She looked frustrated, ready to refuse. Her attitude was radiating confidence to the point of recklessness. The fact that she was killing the monsters around us with incredible ease just reinforced the image. </p><p>I had to admit, her arrogance was not entirely unjustified, but the ambush that was waiting for her was too significant, particularly with the ballistas in place. But, I didn’t know how I would convince her without telling her I had already seen it. </p><p>I was afraid that I had to reveal I had already killed a few dungeon bosses to convince her. It was not something I wanted to reveal, but it was better than letting her walk into a deadly ambush. My secrets were important, but not to the point of letting her walk to her certain death. </p><p>I would reveal it if I had to. But, before that, I had one more thing to try. “Please,” I continued. “If you follow my lead, I promise that I’ll spar with you every day for a week.” </p><p>Bribery worked where honesty and common sense failed. “Alright. Don’t forget it. Even if Maria wants to play chess, sparring takes priority.” </p><p>“Deal,” I said, doing my best to ignore the two bodies that we had left behind. “Now, follow me.” </p><p>With that, I led her back to the initial ambush location. The squad was not there, but finding them hadn’t been too difficult. Their scout had tried to bring them away, which was a valiant, but ultimately useless effort. My range of vision meant that I was able to see them even when they were trying to hide. </p><p>I still made a show of searching for them by going in the wrong direction first before switching. “Good instincts,” Eleanor said as she dashed forward. “Take the scout while I deal with the armored ones.” </p><p>I had no problem with that assignment. The scout split from the group, while the armored ones gathered together. </p><p>The moment I got out of Eleanor’s range of vision, I sped up even further and caught up with the scout. I hurried up, because their actions made it clear that they were using a method to communicate with each other. </p><p>They acted like they had been promised reinforcements. Technically, it could be a lie, but I wouldn’t bet on it. The enemy had invested too much into their ploy to turn back immediately. </p><p>I attacked the scout, using my Strength advantage to the limit, his lack of metal armor putting him in an even more disadvantageous position. The skill difference between us was stark enough that I could just rely on the skill to deal with him, which meant I could split my attention between my fight and Eleanor’s massacre. </p><p>She was good. Intimidatingly so. I was aware that she had been holding back during our spars, but I clearly underestimated the extent of it. Her blade danced with an alacrity that I could never imagine matching. </p><p>I wondered if her Dexterity was that high, or if it was a difference due to the perks. Either way, she danced around the nine armored figures, making sure that their presence was more of a restriction to each other than actual benefit. </p><p>One of them had already fallen, and two others looked in critical condition. </p><p>Since she seemed to be in control, I once again rushed forward. </p><p>I needed to see what the main group was doing. </p>",

I didn’t know the reason why they were here, and even though their presence was suspicious, I couldn’t simply attack them. And, not just due to ethical reasons. </p><p>Information asymmetry was valuable in any circumstance, and had I attacked them, they would have realized that I possessed a way to see through the mist. Every other method I managed to learn about worked similarly to the effect of the trees, dispersing the mist to increase the range of vision, which worked for both sides. </p><p>Killing the dungeon bosses was the only method — that I knew of — that expanded the range of vision for the observer only. It was a strategic advantage I was not ready to give up. This meant that I continued to practice even as I wondered who was the target of the cloaked scouts: Me, or Eleanor…  </p><p>My mind wandered even as I called my System.

Still, I needed the confidence it would provide as I prepared to face a potential battle. </p><p>[Mana Blacksmith - Level 43]</p><p>[Health 1290/1290] [Mana 210/210]</p><p>[Vitality 86 / Strength 86 / Dexterity 65 / Essence 21]</p><p>[Skills (8/13)</p><p>Mana Repair (Epic) - 102 [Advanced Observe]</p><p>Mana Forge (Epic) - 107 [Advanced Creative Forging, Mana Control]</p><p>Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 139 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]</p><p>Nurture (Epic) - 219</p><p>Quake Hammer (Rare) - 200 [Persistent Tremor]</p><p>Blade of Retribution (Rare) - 200 [Strike of Retribution]</p><p>Breeze Spear (Rare) - 200 [Floating Stride]</p><p>Fire Bolt (Basic) - 25 </p><p>Shoot (Basic) - 25]</p><p>My distraction was punished by a ringing sound as the flat of Eleanor’s blade slammed against my helmet. “You’re getting lost,” she warned. </p><p>“Sorry, I’m just getting used to the new skill,” I said. “Fighting against the monsters is a different experience.” </p><p>“That’s why we have to practice,” she responded. “You’re lucky that I’m willing to waste my time helping you.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “And, it has nothing to do with the boredom you have accumulated through endless meetings.” </p><p>She avoided my gaze, and a shy giggle left her mouth. “Anyway, you have improved quite a bit,” she said, changing the topic. </p><p>“The dungeon is working for me,” I responded, suddenly feeling encouraged. “Having access to endless materials is proving to be quite a boon. I came up with a few inventions, including one that allows me to catch if someone gets near,” I said. </p><p>Technically, it was true. As long as I used a silver-gold alloy, I was able to expand the detection range of my Observe Perk quite a bit. </p><p>“Really, can you teach me?” she asked. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I said. “It requires me to use a perk I had received from the Repair skill, but it’s still quite useful. By burying a silver web, I can detect the presence of monsters and people alike.” </p><p>“Really, you did that through the Repair skill?” </p><p>“Yes. Is it a problem?” </p><p>“No,” she said. “I just never imagined a production skill having combat application.” She paused, and sighed deeply. “I can’t believe just how big of a misfortune your class is. You’re a natural-born warrior. You working as a blacksmith is a waste.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, I appreciate the variance,” I said even as I walked to the perimeter, and buried a long piece of silver string — which I created in my pocket by manipulating mana. At the same time, I watched Eleanor very carefully, trying to see if she noticed my ability to manipulate mana. </p><p>It was a risky test, but with the prospect of an ambush, I wanted to see what I could and couldn’t do near her without raising suspicion. </p><p>I was tempted to retreat, but after some consideration, I decided against it. I didn’t know whether the potential ambush was targeting me or Eleanor, but either way, acting unaware of the potential ambush was the better option than scaring them away. </p><p>If I were to fight against these spies, I much rather do that in the depths of the dungeon. Even before I started hunting the dungeon bosses, I had the home-ground advantage in the dungeon thanks to all the buried defensive bulwarks I had prepared for this exact eventuality. </p><p>My ability to see through the mist was even more important </p><p>“Handy,” Eleanor commented once I finished burying the silver string, and returned. Technically, what I buried wasn’t enough to catch any interloper, but it was good enough to make my warnings credible if they returned. Even if they didn’t return to attack as I feared, I could still warn Eleanor about potential assassins. </p><p>I wanted to keep my secrets, but not at the cost of letting Eleanor walk into the blades of a hidden assassin if I could help it. At this point, despite the number of secrets I had to keep from her, Eleanor belonged to the small list of people I could call a friend. </p><p>Speaking of friends, I wondered where Rosie was. Her guild was operational, but she was yet to return. </p><p>I elected not to ask Eleanor about it, but instead attacked her again, continuing our sparring session. I appreciated it, as even at the peak of the skill, the spar taught me a lot about fighting another human, particularly one that was flat-out better. </p><p>As we fought, the situation was interrupted by a sudden rumbling, and at a distance, the same two cloaked agents appeared at the edge of our range of vision once again, drawing a swarm behind them. </p><p>“Another stampede,” Eleanor gasped as she pulled out of an attack. “Natural or manmade,” she said. </p><p>“Definitely manmade,” I said. “There’s two people just at the edge of the swarm,” I said. </p><p>“Not for long,” she said even as she dashed forward to meet with the swarm. I bit my lip, holding back a curse as I followed her. She was as fast as me when I used Fleeting Step to the limit, making me glad I had gone through all that trouble to integrate Floating Stride into my repertoire. </p><p>Still, I let Eleanor ditch me before I started following her. “Wait for me, I can’t move as fast as you,” I shouted. </p><p>“Then, you can clean up!” she shouted, her attitude showing that she didn’t feel the slightest hint of threat from the ambush. </p><p>While I understood where her sense of invincibility came from — I was dealing with a version of it myself — it didn’t mean I approved. Especially since the enemy knew about both Eleanor and me being here, but despite that, they attacked. </p><p>As Eleanor went forward, the cloaked figure went behind the swarm, mana around them once again making the swarm ignore them. Eleanor burst forward, trying to engage with them. The swarm barely slowed her down, but she still failed to engage with the cloaked figures. </p><p>Despite that, the cloaked figures didn’t try to ditch Eleanor. Instead, they retreated in a smooth manner, slowly drawing her to a certain location. </p><p>It was not something I was willing to allow. I started rushing forward, only for ten figures to appear from the mist. Nine of them were clad in pitch-black armor, while the tenth one was cloaked as well. </p><p>The cloaked one, who was clearly some kind of scouting class, directed the rest. I changed my direction slightly to catch up with Eleanor, only for them to cut my path. </p><p>I wanted nothing more than to retreat, but I couldn’t do that without revealing I had detected their presence. And, at this point, it was not an acceptable sacrifice, so instead, I moved forward, but didn’t show my Fleeting Step. </p><p>Soon, I found myself face-to-face with the three armored figures. “Get out of my path, or die,” I called in faux anger even as the nine armored figures spread out, ready to cut my path. Their formation was enough to reveal what they had been trying to do. </p><p>It wasn’t a formation designed to surround someone, but to support each other in case I tried to ignore them and push forward. That alone was strong evidence to suggest that they were trying to delay me.</p><p>Their armament suggested it as well. Their armor was heavier than I expected, and every single one of them carried shields. Their equipment was identical, making them look like some kind of an assassination squad.  </p><p>I didn’t want to engage with them, but I needed information. So, I rushed forward, and attacked the one at the center of the formation, my sword covered with Vitality. The shield was sturdy enough to resist the blow, giving them a chance to counter-attack if they wished. </p><p>It was a risky move, but a necessary one, because, during the brief contact, I managed to use Observe, which gave me a brief, yet accurate snapshot of the shield. I attacked a second one before the first recovered, ready to retreat before they closed around me. </p><p>To my surprise, instead of leveraging the opportunity, they stayed spread in their formation, showing their intent to delay me. That alone had granted me a very important piece of information. They didn’t want to kill me but wanted to split me and Eleanor up. </p><p>I paused for a moment before I attacked the line again, but my intent was more about testing their equipment. It was new, not showing any sign of damage from anything but very brief sparring. No one had touched them since they had been purchased from the System Shop, not even to cast a repair spell — which was something I could distinguish at my current skill level. </p><p>They were also thick, heavy, and most importantly, optimized to resist sword attacks. As long as I used a spear or a hammer, I could have easily killed them. </p><p>It was purchased to delay a certain guild master who had famously only used swords. They targeted me, and not Eleanor, as Eleanor was too fast to be restricted by them. </p><p>Someone had gone through a lot of trouble to set up a unit to delay me. The only question, was whether they were trying to split Eleanor so they could kill me … or the other way around. </p><p>Ironically, I found myself desperately wishing that it was the first version, as that was destined to fail. At this moment, I had too many hidden advantages for such an attempt to succeed as long as I stayed in the dungeon. </p><p>Eleanor’s abilities were not as much of a secret. </p><p>I needed to make a decision, and I needed to make it immediately. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 66</p><p>I stayed with the Farmers while the raffle was being prepared, and watched while the schedule was set. I even made a copy of it in the view of everyone. I had no intention of checking the schedule of eight thousand Farmers, but just having that opportunity would intimidate some with bad intentions. </p><p>I didn’t have the time to micromanage them, so such subterfuge was necessary.  Then, I left, leaving the task of arranging the operational details to Harold. I needed to rely upon him a lot for this task.  </p><p>There was a benefit to handling the management of the Farmers through Harold. It was a well-known fact that not being seen too many times helped reflect a sense of authority, which was why even the generals before the Cataclysm didn’t fraternize with the rank and file, but it wasn’t the reason I didn’t stay with them. </p><p>No, I had a simpler reason. I had a lot of work to do in the dungeon. </p><p>Since I had officially mentioned to Eleanor that I would be building a forge in the dungeon, I needed to do so. For that, I would have to set up another forge, this time in a hidden corner of the second floor, maybe dig a cave for it. Admittedly, I had no intention of actually using that forge. It would be entirely for show. </p><p>I just needed a location for Eleanor if she wanted to visit. </p><p>Meanwhile, I would be splitting the actual task of forging the required materials between the third and fourth floors. The armor and the spears I planned to forge had to be made on the third floor, as they would be made of ordinary materials, and just staying on the fourth floor would destroy them. </p><p>Luckily, the arrowheads would be corrosion-resistant, so I could handle their forging on the fourth floor. </p><p>It was important. Unlike the armor sets and spears, I would be forging an absurd number of arrowheads, and on the fourth floor, I could use the steam engines to make the process even faster. And, the less time I spent on routine tasks, the more time I would have to explore the fourth floor without people getting suspicious. </p><p>I was glad that I had revealed part of my subterfuge to Eleanor and Maria. Not having to hide everything from them meant that I could do much more. Just the fact that I could bring sealed boxes in and out of the dungeon was a game changer. </p><p>“Now, the hard part,” I muttered as I left the town behind, and started walking the road between the dungeon and the town, alone. I wasn’t walking because I was suddenly unafraid of another possible assassination, but because I was afraid of them. </p><p>It was a simple bluff. The thing that was keeping me safe was Thomas’ erroneous belief that I was above level hundred. Even if he suspected that there had been something wrong with using Charisma, he would still believe that I was near that point. </p><p>It would make assassinating me the worst way to sabotage the town, especially when Maria and Eleanor were around. Luckily, my earlier stay in the dungeon could easily be explained as staying to protect the dungeon rather than trying to stay safe.</p><p>“I just hope he’ll think like that,” I said even as I left the road and started to walk in the wilderness. Naturally, many wild monsters attacked, but they were not even a challenge to my Stalwart Guard, let alone my Quake Hammer. </p><p>With its proficiency at its limit, the skill was truly amazing. For example, I could confidently face a team of assassins even if they chose to attack together. I wouldn’t, of course, not if I had any other choice. Why should I have suffered a brave last stand when I could easily ambush the enemy? </p><p>If it wasn’t for my confidence to defend myself — or at least, escape — I wouldn’t have dared to walk into the wilderness. After all, there was a chance that Thomas could ignore all the reasons that made me a bad target and attack me. </p><p>“Now, let’s get to work,” I said to myself even as I found a small cave and entered it. After killing the monsters inside, I paused for a moment and used my Cleansing Meditation to absorb the mana they let out. </p><p>[+15 Mana]</p><p>Monsters outside didn’t have that much mana in them, so killing almost thirty of them barely gave me fifteen points. No wonder mages didn’t want to live here. However, I noticed something interesting, which was only possible thanks to Cleansing Meditation. </p><p>The monsters outside also had a minute amount of tainted energy. Not as intense as the monsters in the dungeon, and likely not the same kind. But, it was an interesting detail. However, it wasn’t the time to explore that. </p><p>I started digging a tunnel through the dungeon floor, my Strength allowing me to handle that task at a quick pace, especially when I could use Vitality attacks against any rocks. Using mana would have made things easier, but I wasn’t entirely sure that I had no one following me. </p><p>I traveled almost a thousand yards like that, and, at my point of exit, I used the camouflage ring to walk another three hundred yards, found a new cave, and repeated the pattern twice. </p><p>Once I finished that, I modified the surface layer of the armor completely. The shape, the patterns, everything. Luckily, I had long designed my armor to be two-layered, with the top layer only there as a distraction, so it worked well enough. </p><p>I even created a new, large spear to give my alter ego a different identity. Of course, it was not actually a spear, but a hollow tube, which I used to check for mineral deposits. Luckily, iron oxide was easy to recognize. And, since I was merely searching for something with around five percent purity, rather than above fifty percent like any sane commercial operation would, I was able to find enough material to forge my boxes. </p><p>Not having the necessity to carry boxes of iron helped. </p><p>The reason for my complicated travel plan and disguise, which included even some material sourcing, was simple. Once I started arriving with the mysterious metal boxes, people would start looking for them. I needed a reasonable excuse. So, once I was deep in the wilderness, I used the ores from the surrounding area to create a simple, sealed metal box that was larger than my body. </p><p>The box had two features. On its surface, there was a stamp, with the text of Mystery Delivery. And, inside, there was another stamp, with the phrase ‘Better luck next time’. The trick was simple. Once I started arriving at the dungeon with boxes that were supposedly filled with treasures, people could start looking for them. </p><p>I created those boxes as a simple trick. Once I buried enough of them, it would give them a good idea about the method. My secretive supplier would bury hundreds of boxes around, and supposedly inform me about the correct delivery. </p><p>For that reason, the boxes I forged were nothing I couldn’t do when my Forging was merely at ten. After all, they were merely decoys. </p><p>That, along with my growing reputation as someone supposedly at or above level hundred, should be enough to deflect the attention. </p><p>For the next eight hours, I went deeper and deeper into the wilderness, using Fleeting Step to move faster than should have been possible, leaving boxes in the hilltops and valleys, each far away from one another, creating a very complicated treasure hunt. I could have done so without much fear because the monsters in the mana dead zones weren’t as dangerous.</p><p>Of course, that should make living in mana dead zones a better option. It meant the area was more secure. However, the economic disadvantages created by a lack of environmental mana — like the fact that we needed almost ten farmers just to support one warrior operating in the dungeon — were obvious. Then there was the even more important fact that leveling was difficult. </p><p>Technically, both could be bypassed. Unfortunately, the security was not always guaranteed. It was safer under normal circumstances, but not during exceptional events. There was always a chance of a dungeon break from an undiscovered gate, or a monster horde could drift near while they were migrating.  </p><p>There was a reason that our current town had many expensive and rare siege weapons. </p><p>Well, that, and the nighttime was still dangerous. </p><p>Once I had arrived near the dungeon, I modified my armor back to its previous state, once again using mana allowing me to bypass some cumbersome steps. I created ten of those delivery boxes, and even created a fully metal cart I could pull along, and arrived at the dungeon. </p><p>In front of the dungeon, there was a line, where the guards were carefully patting down every entrant to make sure there wasn’t anyone smuggling dangerous lure potions or other items of sabotage. </p><p>“Hey, why’s he not being searched? He’s bringing that much stuff inside —” one of the new arrivals questioned. A guard silenced him by poking him with the end of a spear. The others in the line were quick to get the message. </p><p>I deliberately acted arrogant and aloof, different from my attitude around the guards. With my fake identity getting more and more complicated, the less interaction I had with the others, the more I could maintain that. </p><p>The guards said nothing even as I brought a huge delivery into the dungeon. I moved at a leisurely pace, ignoring the people trying to follow me without being too suspicious. After all, they didn’t dare to follow me to the second floor immediately. And, the moment I arrived at the second floor, I demolished the cart and the boxes back into ingots. </p><p>I used Fleeting Step to disappear into the dungeon mist, making it impossible for anyone to follow me even if they were inclined to do so.</p><p>I had a full night to forge everything I needed. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 67</p><p>I first stopped by the fourth floor to bring a large cart filled with iron ores. These ores would be used for all the necessary materials, which came in three main categories. Namely, armors, weapons, and various other implements — farming, construction, shell removal, and arrow making. </p><p>The function of each category was obvious. However, their design was not straightforward. As long as I had the silver, I could easily forge fifty copies of my armor that would keep them safe from anything that the first three floors could throw at them. But, that was not an option because of the nature of my cover story. </p><p>While everyone else should believe that I was getting deliveries from an enigmatic delivery company, Eleanor and Maria were aware of the truth. So, if I armed the Farmers with a high-quality silver-iron mana alloy set, they would catch on that something was wrong. </p><p>Luckily, that level of defense was not exactly necessary for the first and second floors, considering they would be armed with crossbows. It just needed to survive one or two attacks from the monsters. </p><p>Instead, I decided to use a design from the System: a loose plate armor, which should be useful against both insects and human threats without hindering their mobility too much. I had used the design from the skill wholesale, without making even the slightest change. </p><p>These sets of armor were similar to those that could be purchased from a System Store. Yet, it was something an ordinary Blacksmith should have been capable of, as long as he spent a lot of money and consumed a lot of materials to improve his Forge skill, which should keep Eleanor and Maria from asking too many questions. </p><p>Creating fifty of them in one night was a bit excessive, but I could always claim that I had spent the last week doing that. However, those fifty armors were barely worth a few gold coins when purchased from the System store, so there would be no such questions.  </p><p>There was a reason people didn’t care much about Blacksmiths. The System Store always had better and cheaper alternatives. </p><p>Unless, of course, one decided to be a little unconventional. </p><p>Of course, the desire to make them look like System store purchases wasn’t the only reason I stayed loyal to the design of the skill. Using the skill directly meant that I could forge the armor far faster. A part of it was the high proficiency, making the earlier steps easier. The other part of it was the skill guiding me on exactly how to use mana to bypass many steps, from the alloy structure settling crystals, to proper cooling. </p><p>It was hard to keep track when I could easily forge an armor in less than a minute. An absurd speed that was only possible because the material wasn’t mana alloy. Forging those still took far more time. </p><p>However, speed wasn’t the only reason. Quality played a role as well. While I was able to come up with a lot of specialized designs, from a more generalized perspective, they were still extremely inferior. </p><p>The same was true for the first set of spears I had designed. They were made of the same iron alloys I used on the armor, which would work well against any threat, including humans. </p><p>Once that was complete, I went to the fourth floor, but I didn’t immediately start forging arrowheads. It would be faster for a day, but considering the amount and the scale I required, I didn’t want to spend an hour every day wasting my time on repetitive work. </p><p>Instead, I created myself a nice setup. It had three steps. First, in a large cauldron, I would mix molten iron with the dungeon crystals and finely ground giant monster shell — which I could hunt en masse believably thanks to my improved sword skill — while I used my mana to stabilize the process, giving me the necessary raw material. </p><p>After that, I would pour the mixture onto a large tray, with arrow-shaped holes in it, with a lid that overlapped. Together, they functioned like a traditional sand casting. Of course, in that traditional casting, sand was used, because the molten metal would meld together. </p><p>Then, I put that tray into specialized shelves to cool down, and worked on a second tray.  </p><p>For that, I covered the bottom layer with a layer of sand, so it could be separated easily, and the top part could be pulled. Once I did so, the arrowheads came as one connected sheet. To deal with that, I designed a huge scissor, made of composite structure. It allowed me to use an oversized mana blade to cut the arrowheads from the bottom. </p><p>The system was still primitive, but only the first part required me to use the Mana Forge skill. </p><p>As long as I had the materials ready, I would be able to forge tens of thousands of arrowheads at once. </p><p>The ability to use Mana during forging was just as big of a game changer as using it during combat. Too bad I couldn’t sell my products openly without turning myself into a target. If I could, I would have just moved to a city and worked from the safety of a proper workshop rather than in the middle of a dungeon with a permanent corrosive mist that destroyed everything that wasn’t designed for its unique nature. </p><p>Once the arrows had been completed, I brought them to the third floor before sealing them inside identical iron boxes, to be used in the morning. </p><p>With that, most of the preparation had been completed. </p><p>The next task was simpler. I finally opened the box Eleanor had brought for me. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Blade of Retribution (Rare)]</p><p>It was a domineering name, which was the only thing I knew. When I asked Eleanor about it, she had just smirked playfully and asked me to trust her. I chose to do so, particularly since it wasn’t exactly as critical of a decision as she might have considered. </p><p>Ultimately, for me, a sword was a supporting weapon at best. </p><p>Of course, there was no reason for Eleanor to sabotage me, particularly through an expensive tool like a Rare skill. I had no idea about the current state of the skill market, particularly when it came to the more expensive skills. </p><p>Without thinking any longer, I accepted. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 100 -&gt; Blade of Retribution (Rare) 1]</p><p>After the discomfort had disappeared, I once again grabbed the fragile composite sword with gold filling, designed for ranged attacks. A few mana attacks were enough to push the skill to a high level. </p><p>[Blade of Retribution (Rare) 1 -&gt; 79]</p><p>As the information flowed into my perception, I started analyzing the merits of the fighting style, and the first thing I could say was that Eleanor had picked well. The sword was truly excellent for a Blacksmith who decided to embrace the blade over the hammer. </p><p>In a way, it was not too dissimilar to Stalwart Guard, as it relied on defense and strong counterattacks, relying on the pairing of a shield and a sword, but there were significant differences as well. It was optimized for a bigger, almost oversized sword — though it could still function well with a smaller one —  and it was more mobility-dependent than Stalwart Guard. </p><p>I had to admit, even without the advantages that came from the tier upgrade of the skill, Blade of Retribution was a much better style. Stalwart Guard was better for fighting as a part of a small team maintaining formation while relying on the shield. Blade of Retribution was more reliant on mobility and footwork. </p><p>It was even better for my case, as my Dexterity was higher than an ordinary Blacksmiths', which meant I could fight better. </p><p>“Now, to improve, or not to improve,” I asked a tree. Unfortunately, it didn’t answer, leaving the decision to me. The decision was tricky. Improving meant that I could defend myself better, particularly against public threats where I might be reluctant to show my Quake Hammer. </p><p>And, it wasn’t just another assassin I was thinking of. If I were Thomas — or, one of his advisors — I might have bribed a few other people to find a reason to fight me. Unfortunately, for a warrior and a guild leader, there would be times I couldn’t refuse such challenges, particularly if they were nonlethal. </p><p>Not without raising a lot of questions that are best left unasked. </p><p>Alternatively, I could have kept my improvement slow, which would be more convincing to Eleanor. In the first half, I could claim that it was the learnings from the Stalwart Guard, but anything above a hundred would be a harder sell. </p><p>A tough decision, indeed. Though, I had to admit, even the ability to ask such a question was a luxury in the first place. It was only my systematic approach and my extensive preparation — mixed with some considerable luck — that had allowed me to ask such questions in the first place. Anyone else had to improve the old-fashioned way. </p><p>It was easy once I figured out the trick behind it … but then, I wasn’t exactly sure that was the case. I claimed the same when I was eleven and started learning college-level math questions on my own. </p><p>In the end, I decided to maximize the skill. On one hand, failure meant I needed to find an excuse to give Eleanor, while on the other, failure might mean death. “I just have to refuse duels for a week or two,” I decided. Hopefully, exhaustion and being busy setting up my guild would be a good excuse. She should be busy as well. </p><p>Even if we were available, I could still try to sandbag the duel. It would be hard, but the closer our skill level, the more believable it would be. </p><p> In the end, anything under a month to max out a Rare skill would be suspicious, so I didn’t even bother to try. </p><p>Instead, I spent an hour practicing everything that was granted by the Rare variant to make sure I had a good handle on what it offered below a hundred, before I went near the trees, and started targeting the insects with the ranged mana attacks. </p><p>Those ranged attacks were significantly worse than just cutting them directly, but the fragile blade couldn’t handle it. And, the aim wasn’t to kill them, but to maximize the attack. </p><p>[Blade of Retribution (Rare) 196 -&gt; 200]</p><p>[Perk Options — Strike of Retribution / Swift Step / Unbroken Guard] </p><p>“Difficult choice,” I said even as I read the available options. Strike of Retribution and Swift Step were both equally appealing. In the end, I decided to choose the Strike of Retribution, which turned out to be a ranged vitality attack. </p><p>It merely consumed forty Health, and delivered a smooth cut. I was happy with its existence. </p><p>But, even as I practiced, I realized that I neglected to check one important piece of information. I didn’t know if Perk Reset stones worked on higher-tier skills. </p><p>“Another problem for the future,” I muttered even as I started working on a new sword design, my new Perk already teaching me new things. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 68</p><p>The rest of the night had gone well. I even had a chance to catch a short nap. One that barely lasted three hours, but it was all I could get sleeping in the dungeon. </p><p>Once that was done, I went to the third floor, piled everything into a new cart — which included a small batch of fertilizer mix — and went back to the second floor, then the first floor, deliberately using the gates at the opposite sides. The gate was a good place to camp. It was away from the operations, while it was also fitting to expand the operations between two floors. </p><p>When I arrived at the first floor, I found Harold, along with fifty farmers, each holding a crossbow, practicing with targets they had set in a corner. “Good initiative,” I said to him. </p><p>“My pleasure, sir,” he replied, while the rest of the Farmers looked settled into their roles. </p><p>“Take four guards with decent Strength, and follow me,” I said. “You’ll be responsible for the defense of the new camp.” That was not a part of the agreement I had with Maria, but sometimes, it was better to ask forgiveness than permission. </p><p>Not that they would have refused. Our deal was heavily skewed to their favor — something deliberate on my part — while five guards were nothing they couldn’t give up. </p><p>I wanted them for two reasons. First, they would be responsible for cranking the crossbows until I could make a device that could handle it, but, more importantly, they were there to prevent any possible harassment from other guilds. </p><p>The guards might have refused, but my reputation for generosity proved useful. Instead of trying to get away from the task, the guards were competing for the opportunity. And, the best part, they still worked for Eleanor. </p><p>No other guild’s freelance work would have been treated as such an advantage. Admittedly, I would have shared that opinion a week ago, when I was trying to scrape funds for my experimentation, but the current situation wasn’t the same. </p><p>“Gather together, and don’t make too many sudden movements,” I warned the farmers. “We will protect you, but if you panic and run away, I can’t guarantee your safety.” </p><p>Then, I left the command to Harold, who was far more capable when it came to handling things while another guard started pulling the cart I had brought. Meanwhile, five of the farmers were dragging a large, wooden water tank with wheels, which was necessary to slowly grow the trees.</p><p> I took the point, killing the monsters with a slash while I used the extractor — the old, clumsy one made of bronze — to remove the shell.</p><p>“Watch carefully, you’ll be doing that as well,” I warned them even as we slowly traversed for a distance. </p><p>It was a good chance to show the process and remind them about my capabilities at the same time. The Rare skill flowed even more smoothly, enough to fascinate them. I was so lucky that Thomas had sent his assassins without proper time to practice, or my fate could have been different. </p><p>“We’re here,” I said as we finally arrived at the spot I had picked as my guild’s permanent camp. The epicenter was just a hundred yards away from the dungeon gate leading to the second floor. Meaning, we didn’t have to deal with it currently, but as we expanded, the small fort could grow to take it in, with a corresponding defensive structure on the second floor. </p><p>With the ability to easily produce arrowheads, it should be easy to scale up. I just needed to purchase more crossbows. </p><p>The rigidity of metals didn’t allow me to make a bow out of them entirely.</p><p>“Now, I want you to be responsible for the camp security while I handle the construction,” I said to Harold and the guards while I passed them five swords I took from my assassins, which I had modified further. </p><p>“Sir, are you sure?” Harold asked as he grabbed the sword, his expression wide. “These must cost a fortune.” </p><p>“They are valuable because I won them in battle,” I responded. “So, I won’t be happy if they leave the camp.” </p><p>“Wouldn’t it be better to use them to hunt directly,” he asked. </p><p>“Not unless you’re confident you can kill two thousand insects a day,” I responded. His widening gaze told me that it was not exactly a viable strategy. It wasn't a surprise. Any guard that was willing to join a new dungeon where they could only level up to thirty — well, forty was the absolute limit, but that was hardly efficient — wouldn’t have a valuable class. </p><p>And, getting Rare skills wasn't exactly easy, even with my setup. It required piling multiple giant monsters, and then it needed to give a combat skill rather than Nurture, which seemed to be the most common skill stone. </p><p>“Still, wouldn’t it be better to find five elites and rely on the swords to finish the dungeon?” </p><p>“No,” I said, but I didn’t bother explaining further, maintaining a sense of mystery. “Just kill any beast that gets near,” I said. The guards looked hesitant. “Don’t bother trying to keep the shell intact. Just cut them, and shout if there’s any sign of a swarm,” I said.  </p><p>I cracked open the first metal container, one with farming implements and other construction tools, though they were made of more ordinary alloys. “Now, grab a shovel, and start piling the dirt to the side,” I ordered while I started digging a deep pool, which not only started to agitate the nearby monsters but also the farmers. </p><p>“Sir, shouldn’t we be responsible for manual labor?” one of them asked hesitantly. </p><p>“It’s faster this way. Just grab a shovel, and start piling them to the side. I want a square, with twenty yards on each side, to my left.” For now, it was just a slightly elevated ground where the crossbowman could stand. </p><p>It was small, but once completed, it would function as intended. </p><p>Once the pool was deepened enough to easily hold all the water we had brought, I let it pour. It was not the ideal way, but since it was going to be a temporary one, it should function well enough. </p><p>Sometimes, good enough is all that’s needed. </p><p>“Now, who has the highest farming skill,” I called. They looked hesitant. “Anyone with Farming above twenty-five,” I asked. None of them raised their hands, but their regretful expression showed that they were not happy about it. “Fifteen?” I asked. This time, three people raised their hands. </p><p>While that number was low, I couldn’t blame them. After all, didn’t I suffer from the exact same thing when I was trying to improve Repair and Forge? </p><p>Production classes required a lot of resources to improve. And, if they were valued enough by their previous employer, they wouldn’t have accepted Maria’s offer to come to a mana dead zone. </p><p>“Good, how about Perks,” I asked. While asking about the Perks might be considered invasive for the combat classes, production classes didn’t share the same concern. Particularly the Farmers. “Tend,” two of them answered. “Resistance,” the third one answered. </p><p>“Alright, all of you, come here,” I said even as I pulled three potted bushes I had brought from the third floor. I wanted to see how their abilities stacked. </p><p>For two of them, I put some alchemical booster and watered them well. At the same time, I used some of the broken shells that the guards had collected in the process to the base of the plant. For the third plant, I didn’t add any alchemical boosters and assigned the one with Tend to it. </p><p>“Now, I want you to use thirty Health on the plants,” I said. They did, looking exhausted in the process. </p><p>The two plants only got slightly greener, while there was no reaction with the one without an alchemical booster. </p><p>“I … I gained a point of proficiency,” one with the Resistance perk gasped. One of them with Tend shared the same expression, while the one without the alchemical booster looked disappointed and fearful at the same time. </p><p>“No need to panic, we’re just testing,” I said. “Go and eat something,” I said even as I called two more with Tend perk. “Now, I want you to spend all of your Health to keep the plant alive,” I said. Then, I added a few drops from my alchemical mixture. </p><p>The plant died, while the two who tried to save them looked shocked and guilty at the same time. “We’re sorry, sir —” they started, their panic obvious, only to fall silent when I gestured. </p><p>“Don’t panic every time,” I said. “We’re just trying something here. Now, is there any improvement?” </p><p>“No, sir,” they said, which didn’t surprise me. A dead plant was a clear-cut failure, and skills rewarded success. It might have been different if they could have improved the plant until they stopped feeding Health, but even as they used the skill, the plant died. </p><p>“Should we set a Nurture circle, sir?” one of them asked. </p><p>“Nurture circle?” I asked. </p><p>“We pick a plant, add a lot of fertilizer, and use our Health one after another to enable the growth. It’s the fastest way to grow plants.” </p><p>“Interesting, but we don’t need to waste time on it for the moment,” I said. Instead, I uprooted one of the bushes, and put my hand on the other. “Just set a bucket chain.” </p><p>“S-sir. Too much water without a Nurture circle would kill the plant —” he started, only to gasp when I put my hand on the bush, and fed it with my Health. </p><p>[-42 Health]</p><p>The difference between Common and Rare Nurture showed a difference. I didn’t spend any more Health than they did, but the bush not only grew, but it also transformed, its misshapen branches straightening as it turned into a tree. </p><p>It was good, but not as good as using the poisonous water from the fourth-floor swamp. </p><p>The farmers around me froze, gasping in shock as the newly apparent tree had grown to an incredible size. “You have Nurture, sir?” Harold asked, shocked, who was close enough to watch the show.</p><p>“Of course, you never know when you’re going to need some emergency food in the wilderness or a dungeon,” I answered. </p><p>“Well…” he started, but I could see the hesitancy in his face, often when people were about to say something extremely insensitive. I guessed that there was some prejudice about warriors ‘wasting’ a skill slot. </p><p>“We can talk about it later,” I said. “Now, you bunch look like you have a question.” </p><p>“S-sir. If we’re not needed to grow plants, why are we here?” one of them stammered, no doubt afraid to be discarded. I hated the way poverty and discrimination ground people’s will into dust. But, fixing it would be a slow process. </p><p>Especially since the people in power preferred it to stay that way. </p><p>“You’re here to kill monsters, of course,” I responded. “Why do you think you’re training with the crossbows,” I said. The shift of emotion was fascinating. “But, you can’t start leveling before we finish growing these trees. Now, buckets!” </p><p>This time, they moved at a fascinating speed. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 69</p><p>“Not bad,” I called twenty minutes later, examining the tiny orchard we had created, though speaking out loud was mostly for the benefit of the new hires, as they still looked skittish. </p><p>After all, the orchard was underwhelming compared to what I had created, there were merely ten trees, and only one of them was as tall as me. Nine of them were smaller. I could have triggered their growth just as easily, but the water we had brought was mostly gone, and the rest was earmarked for the next experiment.  </p><p>Technically, Nurture was incredible enough to force their growth even without water and other nutrients, but then it would have slowed down enough to be completely pointless. </p><p>“Next, break a branch, and heal it with Nurture,” I said. Alchemical fertilizer Maria had allowed the tree to generate a new branch, but it was slow progress. My mixture worked much better this time since the tree was strong enough to handle the poison. </p><p>“T-three points,” one of the farmers gasped, looking shocked, while all the others looked regretful. </p><p>“Don’t worry, all of you will have a chance to improve your skill to at least twenty-five,” I said, underselling the potential significantly. Luckily, improving a common Nurture skill was hardly extraordinary. </p><p>People did not try to optimize it, because there was no strategic value to it, not when Farmers were the cheapest talent in the market. </p><p>I thought about offering them one of the Rare nurture skills, but I decided against it. While it might be the cheapest Rare skill, it was still a rare one, and I didn’t have hundreds of them. Keeping them for the ones that I eventually wanted to hire was a better option. </p><p>Once the branch was ready, turning it into a crossbow bolt was easy. I already had the device to cut it into the perfect shape, and plugging it in place was just as easy. More common arrows would have used some special glue, screws, or another solution to make sure the connection stayed secure. Since our arrows would shatter at one attempt, there was no reason to risk it.</p><p>As for fletchings, fashioning one out of wood was enough. It wasn’t the ideal material, but it didn’t need to be. With the mist in place, we were only trying to hit targets at thirty yards. Even without a skill, that was an achievable target. </p><p>With a skill guiding the attack, against a monster that only charged at a straight line, missing was harder than hitting the target. And, with the material of the arrow especially effective on them, it was inevitable.  </p><p>“Now, try and see if you can pull the bow back,” I said. Unfortunately, without Strength, only two of them were capable of it, and both of them struggled for almost a minute. I made a note to put together a simple device to assist it. </p><p>“No matter,” I said even as I quickly cocked every crossbow, the pressure as light as a feather under my touch. “Harold, leave one direction free and come here,” I said. “You’re responsible for reloading the crossbows.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said, but I was able to catch his slight dissatisfaction. It might be a while since I had to deal with a bunch of overeager doctoral students, but I knew exactly how people looked when they received a task they disdained. </p><p>A problem that was best nipped in the bud. “Look, they are still a bunch of people with no combat experience. I need someone excellent to command them from up close, someone that can keep them alive.” It helped that I was being honest. His role wasn’t exactly glamorous at this point, but very important. </p><p>Harold had the necessary common sense to manage the situation. </p><p>“I won’t disappoint you, sir,” he said. </p><p>I nodded before I returned to the front line, where five farmers were looking scared and excited while they held the crossbows. “A-are we really going to kill monsters, sir,” one of them asked, like he still couldn’t believe it. </p><p>I didn’t blame him. Dungeon access was an expensive luxury. Well, at least ones as smooth as our current one, with an open, straightforward surface. Based on what I had collected, the really dangerous ones — the ones that were even more hostile than the fourth floor — worked in reverse, with guilds getting paid to control them. But, those were not relevant for Farmers. </p><p>“Yes,” I said. I thought about mentioning that I planned to give some of the profit as well, but I kept my mouth shut about it. No need to overwhelm them. </p><p>We waited a bit, and soon, an insect drifted forward. All of them shot at it at the same time, and two of them missed in a hurry. Still, three bolts were enough to kill the insect as they shattered inside it. </p><p>It wasn’t a coincidence. I had already tried it before, and anti-corrosive material functioned akin to poison for these monsters. It penetrated through the armor only due to its unique properties, shattering in the process. And, the pieces worked like poison, because they were made from the shells of the giant variants.  </p><p>“I … leveled up,” one of the farmers gasped. </p><p>“Good, but next time, wait until it gets into thirty-yard range before shooting, and use your skill properly. Also, don’t shoot at the same time, but take turns. No need to get too excited.”  </p><p>“Now, bring the crossbow to Harold, and pick a new one,” I said, and watched them kill the monsters as they got near. </p><p>“Should we extract the shell,” one of the others asked. </p><p>“It’s not urgent,” I replied. “I don’t want you to start extracting before you put on armor. I don’t want friendly fire,” I said. </p><p>I let every single of them kill a few monsters, before I asked another question. “Is there anyone that’s still below level ten?” I asked. No one answered, but their smiles were a bit silly, like they were drinking. I didn’t blame them. The sensation of leveling up was fascinating, especially in the lower levels. And, for people who were unlucky enough to receive Farmer class, it was even more incredible, as most of them weren’t even level five. </p><p>They might be receiving only one Vitality and nothing else, but it still meant twenty Health points, and faster conversion of food, both critical for their farming abilities. Also, I was observing them. While the lack of stats meant that their outward potential didn’t match what others were showing, Vitality still gave them a general improvement. </p><p>For example, they were able to load their crossbows without assistance. It was still slow, so using the guards as a chain was still better, but I was hopeful that it would turn unnecessary soon. At least, for the current ones, which were pretty much the weakest on the market. </p><p>I would still need to figure out a solution if I were to ever upgrade them. </p><p>I didn’t allow them to start collecting before every single one of them donned the armor, and got used to moving in it. Luckily, the System design was lightweight, ergonomic, and adjustable, making the process easy. </p><p>Only then, I allow them to start collecting the shells, the extractors working just as well as a hunter using his skills. “Excellent work,” I said even as I started assigning tasks. “Now, we’re going to have five teams. Hunters, construction workers, farmers, arrow makers, and a reserve force. To start, fifteen will be hunters, and ten will be in the reserve force.” </p><p>“What is the job of the reserve force, sir?” a farmer asked. </p><p>“For the moment, collecting shells and making sure crossbows are loaded. However, in case of a swarm, I want you to be able to distribute crossbows to everyone while you all pull back to the fort.” </p><p>“A swarm. Is that likely, sir?” another asked. </p><p>“Maybe,” I responded. “But, it’s nothing that can’t be handled as long as we build the keep. And, with me here, there’s no need to fear any swarm,” I explained. </p><p>I waited until the farmers started operating, and soon, they started collecting shells. The numbers were not particularly impressive — well, by my standards, as I had no doubt that they would easily surpass any other guild’s output with ease — but it didn’t bother me. </p><p>After all, it was just a proof of concept, one that had worked. The first floor of the dungeon wasn’t teeming with monsters, so the number of monsters that chose to attack us was the main limiting factor. It would change once I was confident enough to let them roam without supervision, and it would get even better once I let them establish another fort on the second floor. </p><p>As the hunting team and reserve team spread around the base, the guards stayed back, doing nothing but watching with their swords in hand. </p><p>“It looks promising, sir,” Harold said as he got near me. “But, wouldn’t it be better if we can find hunters? That would be far more efficient I think.” </p><p>“Sure, as long as you can find me a thousand hunters in less than a week, we can do that,” I replied, and his eyes widened. </p><p>“A — a thousand, sir,” he gasped. </p><p>“A thousand, for each shift, rotating with eight-hour patterns,” I added, which made his eyes widen. </p><p>“I … I don’t think that will work, sir,” he said, looking reproachful. “Not unless Lady Eleanor allows you to monopolize the first floor, and even then, it won’t be efficient. There’s a limit to the number of monsters. Maybe a thousand in total, rotating in three teams?” </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, I didn’t know the dungeon only had one floor,” I responded. His eyes widened as he realized what I was talking about. And, once pointed, he didn’t question it. After all, the biggest challenge on the second floor was the presence of the ranged attackers, easily destroying armor and weapons. </p><p>Crossbows had better range. </p><p>“What’s next, sir,” he asked. </p><p>“Three things,” I said. “I want you to arrange for professionals to build a two-layered defensive encampment around the warehouse. Nothing too tall. Just five feet would be enough, but make it thick so that monsters couldn’t chew through it easily. I want another wall around the dungeon gate in case of an emergency.” </p><p>“And, the third one, sir?” </p><p>“I want you to come up with various scenarios. Assassination, monster swarms, fighting with other guilds, each solution prioritizing the lives of the guild members over material savings. And, make sure to train everyone on how to respond.”</p><p>“I won’t disappoint, sir,” he said. </p><p>“I hope you won’t,” I answered even as I grabbed the empty cart, and walked toward the gate leading to the second floor. “Now, you take the command while I go and hunt on the second floor.” </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 70</p><p>Going to the second floor and leaving the operation alone was deliberate. While I wanted to set up a sustainable hunting operation, I didn’t forget the real reason for it. Money was nice, but it was still a side benefit. A space I could freely experiment in was the part I truly valued.</p><p>Yes, I could stay there to improve the camp far faster, but the more I stayed with them, the more dependent on my orders they would become. It was another lesson I had learned from my old career as a professor, trying to lead the doctorate students. I might be able to answer their questions far faster than they could come up with on their own, but that meant they couldn’t solve problems on their own. </p><p>I needed them to operate independently. I deliberately added the task of designing emergency drills to Harold, as a challenge and a test. After all, I needed someone to deal with the guild operations, and he seemed to have the right mixture of deference and initiative. As an added benefit, it was someone trusted by Eleanor enough to be put in a position of command. </p><p>Amusingly, I was the only guild leader who would classify that as a benefit. In the end, guilds and the town had a complicated relationship, a mixture of both economic and military forces. Hiring one of the guards would reveal a lot of secrets that a guild would have liked to keep hidden. </p><p>Information asymmetry was a more dangerous weapon than any sword. </p><p>That was not the only disadvantage of my operation. Technically, by letting the operation develop in a way that didn’t require me to solve the problems directly, I was potentially creating competitors. Now that I had revealed the arrowheads, it wasn’t impossible for someone to reverse engineer it — or, failing that, start purchasing similar equipment from System shops to test it. It might mean some of my guild members splitting to build their own guild. </p><p>Luckily, that was not a concern for me. The more guilds operated in the town, the stronger the town would get, which meant I could operate more freely. And, if I really wanted to make money, I could easily sell it to other guilds. </p><p>With the ability to mass produce, it would be much easier. </p><p>While it was not a problem for me, it was one for the other guilds. I didn’t know how bigger guilds handled that risk. Eleanor had mentioned that there was some kind of method that the bigger guilds had to prevent it, but even she didn’t know too much about it, making it a difficult solution to implement. </p><p>“It’s hunting time,” I said even as I rushed to the fourth floor at full speed. There was a reason for my hurry. Now that I had established a guild, I was responsible for it. I didn’t particularly care for the efficiency of the operation, as I could already make the necessary ammunition en masse, which meant that, even with all the potential problems, it would still be profitable. </p><p>Their security, on the other hand, was a completely different matter. Even without possible interference from Thomas, the other guilds wouldn’t be happy to see us succeed. And, the dungeon was a dangerous place. </p><p>My presence could easily intimidate them, but if I made a habit of staying away from the base for a long time, they might start to get ideas. It meant I had to show up often, preferably with a random pattern, to make sure they couldn’t plan around my absence. </p><p>For that, Fleeting Step helped, but I couldn’t help but wonder if the advanced version of Swift Spear included an even better variant. </p><p>So, when I arrived at the fourth floor — switching to my best set in the process — I stopped by the base just enough to get my crusher, before I moved to the other side of the second ring, which I created to capture the beasts. There were already a lot of giant monsters, but they weren’t enough for my purposes. </p><p>I tightened my grip over my hammer, crushing a few shells to replenish my mana completely. Then, I opened the box, triggering an artificial monster swarm. Then, I killed thousands of monsters, my hammer moving like I was in front of an anvil, not bothering to remove their shells, knowing that it affected the skill drop rate significantly. </p><p>I was glad that I had long learned to use a weaker version of Fleeting Step without the assistance of the skill, as it allowed me to stick to using Hammer while I dealt with the horde. It was critical, as without the vertical mobility it gave me, allowing me to climb on the monsters with ease, I might have ended up buried under their bodies.</p><p>The utility of mobility was difficult to overstate. For once, I was glad that the Stats were not very well defined. While every Stat had a role based on the class, Blacksmiths received Dexterity to improve hand-eye coordination, but it also increased footwork and general flexibility as well. </p><p>It was certainly beneficial.</p><p>As I killed thousands of monsters, I made sure to leave them in piles of fifty, which guaranteed the drop of a Rare skill, their shape and glow making them easy to distinguish. Unfortunately, that ease didn’t apply to the content. </p><p>After an hour of steady hunting, I managed to collect a hundred skills, and sixty of them were Nurture. Of the remaining forty, I had two more Quake Hammer and the rest was incomprehensible because I lacked the prerequisite stats.</p><p>“Frustrating,” I said even as I created another pile of monsters. It truly was, especially since I couldn’t level up no matter how many monsters I had killed. I wondered if the other types of monsters could help me level up. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to experience that. Maybe if I could find the fifth floor — </p><p>My thoughts had been interrupted by the new skill stone that appeared, which gave me exactly what I needed. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Breeze Spear]</p><p>The moment I got that, I went back to the base and absorbed the skill. At this point, improving a Rare combat skill was something I had already optimized. A composite spear to allow me to use mana attacks in ranged form was all I needed. </p><p>It took me barely twenty minutes to improve it to the peak of nothing. I was happy to note that Breeze Spear was even more reliant on mobility. Combined with what I had learned from my Fleeting Step, it allowed me to move even faster. </p><p>[Breeze Spear (Rare) 197 -&gt; 200]</p><p>[Perk Options — Floating Stride / Hurricane Stab / Mercurial Dodge] </p><p>“Please no,” I gasped even as I read the Perk options. One in particular caught my eye:. Floating Stride. I wanted to ignore it and choose Mercurial Dodge, but in the end, I still chose it. The ability to move faster was exactly what I needed. </p><p>“Surely not,” I said, trying to convince myself, but the moment I used it, two things happened. I lost a hundred health. </p><p>And, my skill took over my body and I jumped. Soon, I found myself floating twenty yards in the air, my body clenched with fear. The fear was intense enough to forcibly disturb the control of the skill, and I landed on the ground with a loud crash, the metal armor and the metal floor creating a very explosive sound. </p><p>“That wasn’t so bad, right?” I asked myself. “Merely twenty yards, and even landing on a metal surface didn’t damage me. Harmless.” </p><p>Unfortunately, my amateurish attempt at self-therapy didn’t work as well. I still sat on the ground, my hands trembling badly while I breathed in and out, trying to stave off a panic attack. Doing that with my skill should have felt safer than relying on a griffin or a plane. </p><p>After all, I trusted the skills enough to deliberately trigger a swarm of monsters consisting almost exclusively of giant insects and fight against them. Why couldn’t I trust them to give me a vertical jump ability of twenty yards, with some kind of floating mixed in? </p><p>It was only rational, right? </p><p>Unfortunately, as much as we wanted to believe otherwise, we were not rational creatures. Hell, as a sociologist, I made a living out of studying how that shaped our society. </p><p>It took five minutes for me to even stand up. “I’m so glad I need to visit the first floor,” I said to myself even as I went back, the attacking monsters were merely a nuisance. Once I was on the second floor, I started hunting, once again using the mana trick to quickly kill the monsters and remove their shells with one hit. </p><p>Ideally, I should have been trying to integrate the Floating Stride into my moves. It was an excellent time. Instead, I relied on the movement trick I developed based on Fleeting Step, unable to bring myself to repeat it. </p><p>I remembered my old therapist likening facing my fears to fighting monsters. It turned out that she was wrong. </p><p>Fighting with monsters was easier. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 61</p><p>As much as I wanted to start forging the sword that could potentially allow me to use better mana attacks by leveraging the new materials and properties I had discovered, I didn’t do so immediately. </p><p>Instead, I sat on the ground and started working on a conceptual design and making some rough calculations based on my observations. It wasn’t particularly easy to figure out the necessary design. I tried to do my best to get inspired by electrical system structure. It could have even worked if I was dealing with a perfect insulator and a perfect conductor, but neither material had been perfect for their role. </p><p>And, my skills were singularly unhelpful. Every single design I could access relied on one type of material, whether it was an alloy or a pure metal. What I was trying to do with the sword was more of a composite material, with layers of different alloys and shapes. </p><p>While the rough calculations helped, there was a limit to what I could achieve without a computer to do anything computationally intense. In the end, without any supporting materials, at best I could come up with a rough design. </p><p>It was a short sword, nothing too complicated. A shorter, thicker scimitar, to be exact. The one end had been made entirely of mana-resistant hexagonal pattern, as fine as I could manage, to prevent the leakage, and the main body also had a similar outer layer. However, there was a thin layer of conductive silver-iron alloy that started from the center, and went forward to reach the center. </p><p>Forging it hadn’t been fun … because, with every move I made, I had to ignore the asinine suggestions of my skills to ‘correct’ the process, which would have ruined everything. It registered the composite approach as a mistake, and Repair was even worse. </p><p>Still, I bit my lips ignored the intense sense of wrongness, and managed to finish it. </p><p>“What a piece of junk.” I examined the sword with a big smile. Admittedly, it was not for no reason that my skill had been giving me an incredible amount of negative feedback about my invention. It was thick, poorly balanced, and unwieldy. I doubted whether it could survive even one hit, as the hexagonal gaps had destroyed its integrity. And, the conductive alloy I discovered was too soft to support the center. </p><p>Still, it didn’t matter. It was just a training wheel equivalent. </p><p>“Let’s try,” I muttered even as I focused on my mana. A mana glow immediately appeared around the blade, extending two inches without problem. More importantly, it was stable. I swung the sword a few times more, shifting between skills to get a better understanding of the flow. </p><p>It was a beautiful process. I was able to extend the mana flow almost half a foot before it destabilized. “Excellent work,” I muttered even as I tried a ranged attack. And failed. </p><p>It didn’t matter. </p><p>I went back to the drawing board, and changed the design multiple times, trying to find a way to achieve ranged attack. Unfortunately, I was soon met with an unfortunate realization. I had reached the limit. Not the material, but the technique. Just like swordsmanship gave me better control and tactical awareness, Forge gave me better control of the minute details. And, I needed to improve it to get finer control. </p><p>For that, I needed gold. </p><p>I looked at my remaining gold coins, wondering if it was worth the sacrifice to enhance the speed of improvement. Eleanor and Maria should arrive in one or two days at most, and I could probably arrange the delivery of pure gold, which must have been cheaper than system gold coins. </p><p>I just needed to wait two days, maybe one extra for material delivery. Was it worth wasting forty coins, especially since there was no guarantee that the amount would be enough to trigger the System and improve the skill further? </p><p>I was reluctant because it meant losing all my money. While I already had eight hundred coins in my account, it was just a promissory note. There was no bank to cash it, and there was no government I could sue them to get if they decided to hold it. </p><p>There was a reason most transactions were based on cash, and even that was only because of the existence of the System-backed coinage. </p><p>However, delaying three days, when I had solved every other problem standing in my way, was unbearable. “Why wait,” I concluded even as I pulled the coins and destroyed them, turning them into raw material with confidence.</p><p>Then, I went to the forge and forged a small stiletto dagger made of pure gold, the smallest weapon I could imagine. The System didn’t respond. I tried again, this time once again bleeding over it and using the Health trick, and pushed all the mana I had in my reserves. </p><p>[-200 Mana]</p><p>It didn’t trigger again. </p><p>“Let’s see if you will work,” I said even as I looked at the steam-powered crusher I had in place. </p><p>I spent easily two thousand points of mana. It failed again. “Alright, no surrender,” I said even as I repeated the experiment. This time, I made a couple modifications to the setup, expanding the crusher area to make its mana output even more intense, started it, and forged another gold dagger. </p><p>It only responded when I spent roughly twenty thousand mana points, something that would have taken a lot of time to crush by hand and interrupt my forging repeatedly. The forging alone took ten minutes. </p><p>The reward was worth it.</p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 102 -&gt; 117]</p><p>“Industrialization for the win,” I muttered even as I looked at the small, beautiful dagger in my hand. Curious, I tried to use it to create a mana edge. It conducted mana better than the alloy I discovered, but my sword maintained a better edge. </p><p>Confirming the viability of my composite design and my path to improve the class skills at the same time. </p><p>I once again started with the repetitive act of forging, damaging, repairing, and destroying. With my setup in place, I was able to extract mana easily. As an added benefit, the tainted energy was collected in a container, so whenever I ran out of material, I just needed to go to the edge of the base, open the container, and fight against the resulting swarm. </p><p>I was glad that I came up with a way to cut the shell with a mana blade, as it made the process far faster. And, I didn’t even need to carry them back. I just needed to put them in the conveyor belt, and they would go back on their own. </p><p>Excellent work. </p><p>Too bad the conveyor belt was too much work to expand even at moderate distances. Conveying power mechanically had its limits, not to mention every yard of metal belt took some time for me to forge and assemble. </p><p>Not the best use of my time, especially when the monsters were kind enough to visit my base in the first place. </p><p>As usual, improving the skill got harder the more it improved, and the incredible amount of mana it required to trigger made it even more difficult. However, in the end, I received my reward. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 202]</p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) - 201]</p><p>The perk selection had been almost trivial. Advanced Observe was a no-brainer. And, while I might have been split between Advanced Mana Control and Advanced Creative Forging, I only received Advanced Creative Forging as an option, which I accepted. </p><p>Advanced Creative Forging didn’t allow me to forge the composite weapons, but every little bit still helped. </p><p>“I wonder when I will be able to push it to the next stage,” I muttered, feeling impatient. It was greedy, I knew, but I didn’t care. Now that I had discovered the method of improvement faster and faster, I couldn’t ignore the addictive pull of its sensation. </p><p>I wondered if platinum would have given me the same boost gold did. Admittedly, the only reason I believed that was the fact that the next coin in the System was the platinum coin. Still, the theory was worth experimenting with. </p><p>But, even if it did, I couldn’t even imagine how much mana it would consume in the process. The mana requirement between silver and gold to trigger the system had gone up almost thirty times. I didn’t want to even imagine how much it would require for platinum, assuming the original trick held true in the first place. </p><p>Which, unfortunately, was not guaranteed. </p><p>“Prioritize,” I grumbled, reminding myself about the more important problem. One step at a time. I still needed to solve the issue of the ranged mana attack. However, instead of making a new variant of the sword, I started experimenting with gold, wanting to utilize its superior conductive properties. </p><p>With the setup in place, it didn’t take too much time to design a gold variant that conducted mana far better. Then, I simply replaced the silver core with the golden one, focusing on the hexagonal structure at the back of the scimitar. </p><p>An hour later, I was looking at a successful ranged attack. It barely went five yards before it dissipated, but I didn’t try to improve it. Instead, I destroyed the sword and instead started to work on a new weapon based on the same principles. </p><p>A hammer. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 62</p><p>For the hammer, I wasn’t exactly designing a ranged attack the same way I did with a sword. I could, but there wasn’t too much of a point. It wouldn’t give me any benefits. Instead, I picked a different direction. </p><p>Namely, the quake attack. </p><p>For that, I designed a new hammer. Its surface was covered with hexagons, gold and silver conductive patterns etched inside it like wires to not only carry the mana, but also distribute it in the same pattern as the Quake attack. </p><p>With this brand-new toy, I was able to create a weaker version of the quake effect. To test, I was once again at the mining pit, using the hammer to steadily destroy ore deposits, replenishing my reserves at the same time. </p><p>I tried to use it on the monsters. Unfortunately, the weapon proved too fragile, shattering upon impact. And, since I had a limited amount of gold, I couldn’t make a dozen hammers to bring it with me. </p><p>But, since I needed to replenish my ore reserves in the first place, I just continued crushing ore and loading it to the main feeder for the conveyor belt. Occasionally, I went back to the forge to redesign the weapon. </p><p>Of course, from a single-attack perspective, there were not many benefits to actually creating a mana attack, as the vitality attack was already superior. Yet, I focused on mana attacks first despite that. </p><p>While the vitality attacks were strong, they were also costly. </p><p>Of course, mana attacks cost even more to achieve a similar effect. Combined with the fact that my mana reserves were much smaller, its utility was supposedly limited. </p><p>If it wasn’t for one important fact: Cleansing Meditation allowed me to absorb mana far faster than I could replenish my Health. While my high Vitality allowed me to metabolize the food faster to replenish my Health, all but most concentrated extracts required several minutes to refill my reserves of Health. I just needed to stand still for five seconds to replenish my mana. </p><p>And then there was the fact that Health was a literal tool for survival… Armor could help to survive a lot of things, but it didn’t make me impervious. Blunt force trauma, in particular, still required Health to recover from. </p><p>However, the biggest part was that I didn’t have the research on vitality that I had on mana. I needed to once again experiment on many materials to understand how they worked when interacting with solid materials. </p><p>And, the recovery speed of Health meant that I couldn’t easily replicate it. </p><p>Not without a large number of assistants. </p><p>With all those factors included, trying to develop a mana attack was the better path until I had the necessary manpower. </p><p>I swung my hammer again, this time crushing a shell into pieces, and used meditation to absorb it. Five seconds of standing still, and my mana was replenished once again.  “Maybe I should try and see if I could figure a way to meditate while moving,” I muttered even as I swung my hammer again, destroying another small section of the ore mine. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 184 -&gt; 185] </p><p>So, I started trying to activate the meditation effect whenever I tried to move around, but it didn’t work as well as I had hoped. Whenever I tried to move, the mana shape destabilized or stopped rotating, which made the process of figuring out how to Meditate while moving rather annoying. </p><p>I could maintain the existence of the orb, but without the movement, it didn’t work. </p><p>However, repeated attempts failed to give a result. “Well, do I actually have to,” I suddenly realized. After all, I had already realized that mana had been reacting to the shapes. Why not transform that orb into a different shape. </p><p>But first, I decided to finish improving Quake Hammer to its limit. As much as the idea of experimenting with Meditation had been tempting, I didn’t want to do so immediately. Instead, I chose to focus on Quake Hammer. </p><p>It required two more trips to the forge to optimize the structure of the hammer based on trial and error before I could actually start delivering a decent facsimile of the first vitality attack, but it still depleted all my mana. </p><p>[-200 Mana] </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 199 -&gt; 200]</p><p>[Perk Options — Persistent Tremor / Shatter / Swift Dodge] </p><p>“What a tough choice,” I muttered. Swift Dodge was easy to ignore, as I had long adapted to using Fleeting Step without using the spear art as a crutch thanks to repeatedly using it to move around. The choice between Persistent Tremor and Shatter, on the other hand, was harder to decide on. </p><p>I had a feeling that, with my combat style, Shatter would be more useful, but I still chose Persistent Tremor. The implication was that it would create a lasting effect, and the experimental value of such a thing was too important. </p><p>“Let’s try,” I said as I used it on a thick section of ore. </p><p>[-300 Health]</p><p>“Well, that’s expensive,” I muttered even as I examined the surface. Unlike Quake Hammer, the attack didn’t disappear at once, but maintained its presence between the shattered pieces, throwing them around wildly. </p><p>It still had a mere two feet radius, but the devastation was incredible. It would work incredibly against a monster … or an armored human. </p><p>Though, I didn’t want to imagine how the remains would look. </p><p>I first moved back to the forge and activated the crusher. Then, as the mana flowed around me, I activated the meditative orb, but I didn’t rotate it, curious if it would absorb. It did, just very slowly despite the density around me. </p><p>I turned that into a hexagonal prism, and, even without moving, the effect of rejecting mana was displayed, but it was weak. It implied that, along with the shape, the movement was also important. Soon, I added a triangle to the intersection point, and it started channeling mana inside, once again with an absurd slowness, certainly not enough to make it worth it.</p><p>I added a triangle to every corner, but after a certain point, I was struggling to maintain the shape of the entity even without rotating it, as if I was trying to juggle a dozen balls in the air. Trying to maintain the shape of the orb was an interesting experience. I couldn’t just do something and start ignoring it. </p><p>Every piece of construct required me to maintain it separately while rotating seemed to be using something completely different. </p><p>I reduced the number of triangles and started rotating, but it failed. While the sphere — which I was starting to realize was not exactly a smooth structure, but the surface details were a mystery — was able to function better the faster it rotated, the triangles lost their effectiveness. </p><p>The lack of stats, I realized. No wonder Intelligence was a critical requirement for every mage. The sheer focus necessary to maintain even half a dozen shapes was incredible. </p><p>I stayed like that for hours, repeating various methods to increase mana absorption, but the best I could get was one point of mana in twenty minutes. Hardly groundbreaking. </p><p>Maybe the research institutes were right in rejecting me —</p><p>“Nonsense,” I growled even as I shook my head. It was absurd to feel depressed, especially after my string of successes. Absurd enough that I would have suspected that there was some kind of spell over me. But, an easier guess was in place. </p><p>It was the side effect of what I was doing with the meditation. </p><p>When I stood up, I felt tired and drained, like I had been lost in the deepest recesses of a dark depression, tired in a way I had never felt before. “Alright, that’s enough experimentation for today,” I muttered as I started tidying up everything. </p><p>It was the second time Meditation had caused some kind of trouble. Maybe I shouldn’t play around with it without consulting Maria first. </p><p>While I was mentally drained, I felt fine physically. So, I chose to pick the cart and went back to the third floor. However, after a few attempts of removing the shell with a mana attack, I realized that trying to use Mana turned out to be much more difficult. So, I stopped that as well and instead relied on the ordinary spear and extractor combo to collect. </p><p> I was exhausted mentally, but I didn’t feel like sleeping. Some pointless, mind-numbing physical activity might have been exactly what I needed. </p><p>And, if I could make more money in the process, even better. </p><p>Since I had been distracted by the latest set of experiments, I decided not to go up before collecting around four thousand shells, which would explain my longer-than-usual disappearance. </p><p>I could always say I took a trip to the third floor. </p><p>As I fought, I could feel that weird exhaustion disappear slowly. It wasn’t completely gone, but the sudden listlessness had disappeared. Still, I didn’t stop until I collected the target number of shells. </p><p>I went back to the fort, only to be greeted by smiling guards. “Good news, sir,” one of them declared happily. “We have just received the news. The caravan will be here in just an hour.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as the guards rushed toward the cart, enthusiastic about processing it. My habit of leaving big tips was already doing wonders. </p><p>Hopefully, it would also help when it came to recruiting. My experiments needed help. Just a few people would be enough, but finding someone trustworthy seemed like a challenge. Instead, I could just hire a bunch of people to work in the dungeon, both to help me make money, and to allow me to identify trustworthy assistants. </p><p>I wanted nothing more than to rest, but with the arrival of the caravan, things wouldn’t be as simple. </p><p>“So, does anyone have any interesting stories about the first days of this dungeon?” I asked, which was just an opportunity to question them. </p><p>Now that Eleanor and Maria had arrived, I needed to decide on a solution that was just innovative enough to help without being too suspicious. </p><p>I much preferred experimenting over killing monsters… </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 63</p><p>While I knew Maria and Eleanor were on the way, I stayed in the dungeon nevertheless, talking with the guards to learn about the various methods that they had used to explore the dungeon. It started as listening to them about the stories, but soon it turned into a Q&amp;A session as they proved very willing to answer my questions, where I started to ask very pointed questions about the tactics they had used to first explore the dungeon and determine its profitability. </p><p>At first, I was surprised by the candid way they answered the questions, even with Eleanor leaving me in charge unofficially. At first, I assumed it was my generous tipping that had earned me this privilege, but even that felt a bit excessive. </p><p>Then, it clicked. It was my power. More accurately, their perception of my power. From their perspective, I was already at least level hundred — with the gossip split equally on whether I had passed the threshold — and with that power, came respect. </p><p>It was just that I underestimated the intensity of it. </p><p>It was my mistake considering my job. While equality had always been more of an idealized concept than a true reality, it didn’t change the fact that, before the Calamity, all people had been in the same baseline. Yet, even then, people had a tendency to idolize the strong and the famous. It was inevitable. </p><p>Ultimately, humans were social beings, and the more complicated the society, the more we relied on heuristic patterns of thought. In the past, the rich, the strong, and the famous had been revered. </p><p>Here, a sufficiently high level meant all three. Levels meant power, in a direct, visceral way that was impossible to ignore. Then, with the world economy regressing to a primitive level, power also meant riches. It was a reason that there wasn’t anyone above level fifty trying to get into this dungeon. They had better dungeons to make money from. </p><p>Dungeons that didn’t require them to get away from what passed for civilization. </p><p>More importantly, the ones that didn’t put them in the middle of a political dispute. </p><p>This meant that, other than Eleanor and Maria, I was perceived to be the only high-level person here, and with that, came respect. However, it was one thing to acknowledge it in theory, another thing was to live through it. Even as a professor, I wasn’t used to it, though that was mostly due to my age making it difficult for my students to respect me. </p><p>Suddenly, I was glad that I didn’t have to deal with it for long. Arthur was a fake identity, one that I would abandon as soon as I made enough money. But, that was for the future. I still had too much to learn here. </p><p>I continued questioning them, trying to learn the tactics they had used. It seemed that they had already utilized some of the more obvious methods. Spears had worked to kill, but their wooden handles degraded even faster under the corrosive effect.  </p><p>As for bows, the cost of ammunition made it unsustainable. Special arrowheads were required to penetrate through the thick shells of the monsters, which inevitably ruined the arrow itself, making it more expensive. </p><p>I questioned whether they tried to raise some native plants. They confirmed that they tried and abandoned it quickly. Apparently, the native dungeon plants pushing back the dungeon mist was a known trick, but it wasn’t well explored, because there were better magical alternatives that could dispel that mist and reestablish better visual clarity. </p><p>Alternatives that didn’t work in a region that lacked mana — or, as my experiments showed, had a low mana density. And, according to them, the desert nature of the dungeon meant that growing any kind of plant was not worth the effort. </p><p>It meant that no one had bothered to experiment with the water from the fourth floor, at least properly. I could have revealed that, but it would have told Eleanor that monopolizing the fourth floor was possible despite the corrosive effect, which would ruin my business model. </p><p>Instead, I wanted to try something simpler. </p><p>“Lend me your bow. I want to try something,” I asked one of the guards. While they didn’t use them for hunting insects as it was expensive, some of them were still armed with bows to defend the fort. </p><p>Not many of them, which was probably why Thomas’ trick had been that devastating. </p><p>He passed the bow immediately, but I noticed the hesitance as he passed the arrows. “Just two arrows is enough,” I said. “And take ten shells from the latest order. It should be enough, right?” I said. I knew it was overpaying, but it was always better to keep people happy while asking for a favor. </p><p>I went back into the dungeon, once again relying on the mist to hide me from the view. But, instead of targeting them directly, I reached into my bag, and pulled a skill stone — one of many I carried with me — which I had been planning to consume. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Shoot (Basic)]</p><p>“Let’s add a ranged attack to the mix,” I muttered even as I consumed it. The sensation of absorbing a skill was disorienting as always, but a basic skill was easy to ignore.  </p><p>[Shoot (Basic) - 1]</p><p>The first few times, I used the bow to aim at the rocks, testing the skill. Just like the other basic combat skills, shooting only came with the most basic motion, nothing else. It gave me a general understanding of how to hold, how to pull back, aim, and shoot. </p><p>Even with the skill barely at one, I was able to hit a target accurately from ten yards away. Dexterity helped me with aiming, but the greater the distance, the more inaccurate my aim became. Compensating for that inaccuracy was possible, but it slowed the process of aiming even more. </p><p>There were several reasons that most people preferred melee over ranged. The first was the logistic challenge. While arrows could be used multiple times, they were still more fragile than weapons. They broke and got lost, and collecting them was a significant chore. Not to mention, it meant it was harder to replenish them during longer expeditions. </p><p>Especially since the best arrows came from the System Shops, like everything else. </p><p>As a result of all these factors, not only was killing monsters from the range more expensive, but it was also more challenging. Stronger monsters were either armored, which made arrows a very bad — or expensive — method of dealing with them; or they had been agile enough to avoid arrows even after they were shot, making the task of hitting them at a distance impossible. </p><p>Sometimes, they had just excess vitality, requiring an absurd amount of arrows to take down. </p><p>They were not really useful other than for support — unless someone had a special class — because magic was much more effective as a ranged weapon. Stronger, more accurate, and, most importantly, cheaper. </p><p>Well, cheaper anywhere with abundant mana. But, even in mana dead zones, it was probably a close call. Of course, the biggest reason for their relative lack of use was that they required Perception, even for their Common variant, which was not exactly a common stat. </p><p>And then, there were even fewer classes that had Perception and Strength at the same time, the second stat necessary to use bows with higher draw weight. Of course, they were still useful in many circumstances, especially near settlements, and more expensive crossbows with certain enchantments removed some of those drawbacks. </p><p>When all those facts combined, it explained why they were not as popular as melee while exploring dungeons, even in ones like ours.</p><p>“Now, let’s improve it,” I said. I could have practiced it again and again until I was confident in taking down the beast. Instead, I touched the arrow I had borrowed, and modified its surface with my mana, adding a few hexagons and arrow structure to make it better to hold mana. </p><p>Then, I pumped it with mana, treated it as a spear, and shot it to a nearby target. The rock I targeted had been demolished.</p><p>[-9 Mana] </p><p>[Shoot (Basic) 1 -&gt; 25]</p><p>One step was enough to maximize the basic skill. “Excellent,” I muttered even as I used the other arrow to practice a few more times, getting a better sense of the abilities and limitations of the skill. I quickly made a few simple bows and crossbows, all made purely of metal, reusing the bowstring from the bow I had borrowed. </p><p>Of course, those bows were useless garbage. Pure metal was not a good material for making bows. However, since my aim was to understand which weapons triggered the basic skill, it still worked. </p><p>And, a smile popped on my face when I noticed crossbows were included on that list. It gave me an idea for an interesting pitch. I broke down the weapons I forged into base metal — mana once again allowing me to bypass very cumbersome steps under automatic control of my skill — and returned to the fort. </p><p>Eleanor was waiting for me there. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 64</p><p>Eleanor didn’t say anything material until we were once again riding the griffin. </p><p>“I didn’t miss the sensation of flying,” I said, grabbing the saddle tightly. </p><p>“We can walk if you want,” she offered. </p><p>“No. I like being assassinated even less,” I replied. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” she said. “It was our mistake. It won’t happen again.” </p><p>I nodded. That promise was worth nothing, but I appreciated the intent behind it. “So, how was the recruitment?” </p><p>“Good,” she said. A one-word reply was not out of the ordinary for her, but I was able to catch a chipped tone, which meant it wasn’t particularly good. </p><p>That would have put a smile on my face if we weren’t currently mid-flight. Unfortunately, it took something far more incredible than the prospect of great riches to put a smile on my face while I was being tortured by the fact that there was no solid ground under my feet. </p><p>I kept my mouth shut as we covered the short distance between the town and the dungeon. I wanted to close my eyes as well, but the ability to catch a glimpse of the caravan that approached was too important to neglect. </p><p>It was a significant crowd, more than I had expected. Even a rough head count suggested at least ten thousand people, maybe even more. However, their subpar equipment — along with Eleanor’s dissatisfaction — suggested that there weren’t many elites among them. </p><p>Once we landed, we immediately walked toward the headquarters. Some distance away from us, I could see many blacksmiths going on a building that was no doubt the new forge, but this time, there were many more guards. </p><p>My failed assassination — the first one — had taught them the importance of security. </p><p>Maria was in her office, with a dark expression on her face. It immediately turned into a shocked expression, which was followed by a giggle. “D-Devon?” she asked, shocked by how I looked. I didn’t blame her. The thick beard and long hair looked ridiculous, but it was a good disguise. “You look … distinguished.” </p><p>“The word you’re looking for is old,” I replied as I sat across from her. Technically, my action was a little presumptuous for the medieval culture people were insistently pushing. A week ago, it would have earned a very disapproving glare from Eleanor. Two weeks ago, Maria would have punished me with second-degree burns. </p><p>Neither of them even blinked, showing how much progress I made in turning myself into a critical part of the town management. It was good, as that was the only reason I was willing to stick around a location where I was facing the risk of assassination. </p><p>“As much as I want to mock Devon for his horrible beard, we have more important things to talk about,” Eleanor said as she sat next to us. She didn’t wait for an invitation either, though it was more about the relationship between Eleanor and me. She was a stickler when it came to propriety around the other people, and the fact that she was willing to relax near me meant a lot. </p><p>Their trust might have made me feel bad for tricking them, but luckily, I was able to come up with a method that would actually help them. </p><p>“True,” Maria said, with sadness back on her face. “All but six of the guilds have pulled back from the agreement, and of that six, five of them had reduced their investment.” </p><p>“Only that annoying woman is willing to stay. She even promised to increase her investment,” Eleanor said, talking about Rosie. </p><p>“What about all those people?” I asked. </p><p>“Support staff,” Maria replied. “Almost eight thousand of them are Farmers, and most of the rest are the various classes here to build the second wall, secure the farms, and do other support work. We barely had three hundred people to join the dungeon, meaning it was only a hundred and fifty teams. Slightly more than what we had before Thomas proved what a monster he is. And, almost half of those teams work for Rosie.”</p><p>“Is it a problem?” </p><p>“Somewhat. They are low-leveled, so it’ll take a while for them to get into the rhythm.”  </p><p>“We can’t support the town with that much operation. We couldn’t before, and we certainly cannot now.”</p><p>“Really, that many Farmers?” I asked. “That’s surprising.” </p><p>“Not really,” Eleanor replied. “The current batch of food we have came from the city, and they are dense enough to make logistics not a problem. But, we can’t keep importing food. Maintaining such a long trade route through wilderness is next to impossible.” </p><p>“That, and it’s really difficult to grow food on a mana dead zone,” Maria completed. “Even in the mana-rich areas, the best farms rely on mana-gathering wards to feed the plants.” </p><p>“I didn’t know farmers could use mana,” I commented, acting unaware of the secrets, which would allow me to ask follow-up questions. </p><p>“They can’t, but the plants absorb it. The poorer the environment, the more Health they need to grow the plants. At one point, they spent more Health than they could get from the food, making it a problem.” </p><p>“I see,” I replied. “Can’t we use some of them to plant trees in the dungeon, then? I’m sure it’ll be helpful.” </p><p>“We tried, but alchemical fertilizers are required to do anything in the dungeon, and they are too expensive to be used in scale, especially in a hostile dungeon environment like a desert.” </p><p>I wondered if it was Eleanor and Maria’s inexperience that was making them miss the obvious solution of mixing them by hand and experimenting, or was it the dependence on the System that made people ignore the common sense solutions? </p><p>Admittedly, both were possible. </p><p>As much as I wanted to let them talk a bit more to despair so that they could appreciate my solution more, I decided to give them an alternative. “Actually, I might have a solution for you?” </p><p>“Really?” Maria had gasped. </p><p>Meanwhile, Eleanor smiled. “Yes, I forgot about that,” she said as she turned to Maria. “Our sword genius here can actually kill a thousand monsters in a day. While it’s not enough to keep us going, it should be enough to bridge the gap. As long as we delay the promised payment for the Farmers, and delay a few payments, we should be able to work until we hire a second batch.”</p><p>“But, what about the Blacksmiths,” Maria replied. “We need Devon to train them, so that they can learn how to repair the swords the same way.” </p><p>“We need to cancel that plan,” Eleanor said. “It’s a waste for a sword genius to waste his time in the forge. He needs to spend his time developing his Rare skill,” she said. </p><p>“Rare skill?” I interrupted. </p><p>Eleanor passed me a small box. “Surprise,” she said, her smile wide. “Finish learning it, and I’ll do my best to find you an Epic one.” </p><p>Maria seemed to be unhappy about that. But, why, I didn’t know. My best guess was that she didn’t like Eleanor changing her plan without consulting, but even that was sketchy. Maria trusted Eleanor more than that. </p><p>“Actually, I have a better plan. One that not only solves both our problems but can actually increase the dungeon production significantly. However, I need you to trust me on how to handle it,” I said. Both turned toward me. “I have discovered a way to make corrosion-resistant material.”</p><p>Their shocked gasps were a thing of wonder. “That changes everything. If we can arm everyone with swords made of them —” </p><p>“No, that doesn’t work. The material shatters quickly,” I said, quickly cutting that path. “But, it’s good enough to make arrowheads.” </p><p>“So, are you going to teach it to the other blacksmiths,” Maria asked. </p><p>“No, we can’t do that,” I said. “Whatever family dispute you have leading Thomas to sabotage you, it’s clear that he’s determined to pull something even harder. If we reveal that we can forge arrowheads that could be used in the dungeon, he might escalate.” </p><p>“What’s your plan?” Eleanor asked, but from her gaze, I could see that she was already convinced. And, I was sure that it had nothing to do with the plan, and everything to do with my melee performance. </p><p>“What would Thomas do if I occasionally received a box from the outside, filled with arrowheads,” I asked. </p><p>“He’ll do his best to find the delivery and rob them,” Eleanor said. </p><p>“That, or he’ll find which System Store you’re purchasing the arrowheads from, and bribe them to stop doing business with you,” Maria added. </p><p>“And, it means, he won’t have that much time sabotaging the camp,” I said. “However, I need both of you to swear that you’ll never reveal I’m the one forging them. Not even to the rest of your family. Let’s just maintain the fiction that I’m an old warrior friend. I don't want to die to an assassin’s blade.” </p><p>“That’s a good idea,” Eleanor accepted. Technically, I didn’t know just how sensitive that ploy was, but I wasn’t willing to take the risk. “But, how are you going to forge them?” </p><p>“Easy,” I said. “I’m going to set up a forge in the depths of the second floor, and forge them there. The boxes will only have the raw materials. As long as you order the guards not to search me, it’ll be enough.” </p><p>“That sounds good. What about the blacksmiths?” Maria said. “We still need them to repair swords.” </p><p>“Easy,” I said. “I will write them some notes, as well as forge you a set of weapons from bronze ingots without enchantment. They can use it to quickly level up their repair. Just don’t forget to have them sign better contracts this time.”  </p><p>“Sounds good —” Maria started, but Eleanor interrupted. </p><p>“We can’t afford it,” she said. “We’re already deep in red, and mana alloys are expensive.” </p><p>There, I smiled, ready to deliver the big stuff. “What if I sell the intact shells to you for two silvers each,” I said. It would have been a terrible sacrifice on my part if I hadn’t been earning far more from the dungeon itself. </p><p>“Really?” she asked. “And, will it be profitable at that level? We don’t have many sharpshooters.” </p><p>“The recipe I discovered requires some silver, so no. I still need you to purchase it for me secretly. I won’t be able to break even, but I should be able to keep going as long as I spend half a day hunting,” I said, which was another lie. Using an iron alloy would be more than enough for the arrowheads, and I certainly didn’t lack that. </p><p>But, I needed an excuse to bring piles of silver inside the dungeon, so a little lying was inevitable. Especially since, the more profitable I made it for them, the less incentive they would have to try to get the recipe and teach it to other blacksmiths. </p><p>“And, everyone will think that we’re paying you four silver, so we can earn more money than people expect. It will give us an edge during the auction.” </p><p>“You can even tell that we have a deal, and you’re purchasing the shells from me for five or six silvers,” I said. “That way, it’ll be more believable that I’m a level hundred.” </p><p>“Good idea, professor,” Maria said. “Too bad you’re still garbage at chess.” </p><p>“I’ll defeat you one day,” I responded, more than happy to play into her enthusiasm and entertain her. </p><p>“That still doesn’t solve the problem of recruitment,” Eleanor interjected. “We need to have a lot of archers.” </p><p>“No, we don’t,” I said. “I just need permission to recruit among the farmers while one of you went to the nearest town and purchased a lot of crossbows for me.” </p><p>“But, they still need the strength to pull back.” </p><p>“Not if I hire a couple workers with Strength only tasked to rearm the crossbows,” I replied. I was confident that I could figure out a small device that could figure it out, but no need to overwhelm them with too many ideas at the same time. </p><p>Maria looked at Eleanor, and they shared a pointed glance showing agreement. </p><p>Just like that, my first step to monopolize the dungeon was complete. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 65</p><p>The meeting didn’t end after we agreed on the details of my guild. There were still a lot of small details that needed to be determined. They were unrelated to me, and most of it was exhaustingly monotonous like the town layout and patrol schedule, but I stayed. </p><p>Having even an unofficial say in the town's development was too important to be ignored. Since I seemed to have been defaulted into the management of the town, I was happy to embrace it. </p><p>Once the meeting was done, we split. Eleanor went to meet with the guards to arrange the new patrol schedule, trying to make sure there would not be any problems. Maria flew to the nearest city to purchase as many crossbows as she could carry on a griffin along with some alchemical fertilizers. I didn’t need it since I had a better alternative, but I had requested some in order to have an excuse for keeping those plants in my possession.  </p><p>Meanwhile, I stayed at the headquarters for a while, writing notes on how to improve Repair quickly, then forging a set of weapons in increasing complexity that could be damaged and repaired at the same time. </p><p>They should be able to use that combination to quickly push their Repair skill to forties, which, combined with the Warm Blow perk, would allow them to repair the enchanted weapons. I didn’t write down my own Repair trick, instead derived a full set of simpler tricks that could be used with Warm Blow.  </p><p>The situation was complicated enough without another Blacksmith stumbling their path into Mana Forge. </p><p>As for the recruitment, I asked the guards to handle that, and ask for volunteers. Knowing how the warriors could treat the production classes, I made it very clear that I needed volunteers, and not coerced farmers. </p><p>If none of them wanted to join me in the dungeon, which was possible considering the danger, so be it. I could always find a different method. I wanted to improve, but not through forced labor. </p><p>Not when I could finally do something about it. </p><p>Once I stepped out, I found a sergeant I was familiar with from the dungeon waiting for me, but I couldn’t remember his name. Luckily, my new status meant that not remembering people’s names wasn't treated as something rude. “What was your name, sergeant? Sorry that I’m bad at names.” </p><p>“Harold, sir,” he said. I wondered if it was his real name, or if he was one of the people that changed theirs for a more old-timey feeling. But, I didn’t ask. It would have been pointlessly rude. “The potential recruits are waiting for you, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Where are they?” I asked. </p><p>“They are at the farm. I thought bringing a crowd here might be too much.” </p><p>“A crowd,” I asked. “You remember what I said about no coercion, right?” </p><p>“Of course,” the sergeant said, looking surprised. “I actually had to turn down bribes to bring them forward,” he declared. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “I would have thought that Farmers wouldn’t have been willing to risk themselves in a dungeon.” </p><p>“Not when you offer them double what they are already getting.” </p><p>“What?” I said. “I thought I offered them only a silver a day, with performance bonuses?” </p><p>“Yes, double what they are making,” Harold said. “We offer them half a silver, plus food and residence. Honestly, Lady Maria’s offer was already generous enough. Apparently, they had almost fifty thousand farmers respond to the application, so they were able to pick the best.” </p><p>“What about the danger?” I asked. I had known that farmers were struggling, but not to the point of moving to a potentially dangerous new town. </p><p>“Well, some of them. The money is already more than what they earned in the city. After removing costs, they are lucky to earn a silver a week in the city. Most barely break even,” the guard explained. “More importantly, it’s hard to level up in the city. They have to save for months to get access to even the simplest dungeon.” </p><p>“So, my offer to work in a dungeon…” </p><p>“Frankly, you can probably find volunteers that would work for free. It’s a waste of silver,” he said. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said. “No wonder they didn’t even ask about how much I will pay for the bonus,” I said, which made the guard skip a step. “What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“The performance bonus? That’s more money?” he asked, surprised. </p><p>“Well, yes. What did you think it was?” </p><p>“I thought it would be the right to kill monsters so that they can level up,” he said, surprised. “That’s the traditional way. The opportunity to be protected by someone at level one hundred while doing so…” </p><p>I frowned. I knew that the situation with the Farmers was bad, but I had clearly underestimated the extent of their plight. </p><p>“I didn’t know that,” I said. Suddenly, I realized that my offer of letting them hunt monsters with ranged weapons was more attractive, enough that I could probably make them pay for the privilege through weeks of physical work. </p><p>Not that I had any intention of actually doing that. What was the point of such cruelty? Just to keep salaries low? It was like the worst parts of capitalism and feudalism mixed in to create an unholy abomination. </p><p>Humanity… somehow always capable of making a bad situation worse. Even when there is no need. </p><p>I said nothing as we left the town, and started walking toward the farming center, where the farmers were working hard to tile the land and plant, leading the horses. The part nearest to the town was being turned into an orchard, while the more distant parts were being tiled to the beast land. </p><p>With the beasts pulling the plows, the process was fast. While Farmers only had Vitality as a stat which didn’t give them the ability to deadlift half a ton with ease, it was still enough to raise their endurance to an inhuman degree. They tiled the land with a steady pace, showing more enthusiasm than I had expected. </p><p>However, as I came closer, I realized that their steady work had a frantic edge, and I could already hear a few whispers about the guilds leaving the caravan to go back. They were probably assuming that some of them would be fired and sent back. </p><p>Admittedly, it was a realistic fear. Without my intervention to save the finances, Maria was already considering delaying the payment, and firing some of them to reduce the cost was the logical next step. Especially, with the number of guards gone, it would be a reasonable setup. </p><p>“The volunteers for the dungeon, gather around,” the sergeant shouted. “Sir Arthur is here to make the selection for the team that’ll join his guild.” </p><p>The workers froze before they all started to gather, already pushing each other. “Anyone that creates a commotion will be disqualified. I don’t want a stampede!” I shouted, which had been enough to freeze them. “No running. Walk calmly, and don’t push each other.” </p><p>Even as I shouted at them, I didn’t blame them. I knew exactly where they were coming from. It wasn’t even two weeks ago that I would have been a part of a similar group. Not for a silver coin, maybe, but five coins would have made me just as desperate. </p><p>While they gathered in a calmer manner, I climbed on a rock so that they could see me, and looked at Harold. “Listen to the rules well. I don’t want any guard violating them either,” I warned him. </p><p>“Understood, sir,” he said enthusiastically. </p><p>Machiavelli might have had a dubious reputation for his statement about it being better to be feared than loved, but his book had another, lesser-known quote that was certainly true. If one could arrange it, it was best to be loved and feared at the same time. </p><p>Luckily, the inherent threat of someone level one hundred — even if it wasn’t exactly true — and my new role in the inner circle handled the fear part, and my generosity worked well for the loved part. </p><p>“I’m sure the guards had mentioned what I want to do. I need people who will accompany me to the dungeon. I have already arranged with Lady Maria, so I can borrow you for a day or two before you return to your tasks,” I said. “Since we have that many volunteers, I want to make a few changes.” </p><p>“I’m willing to work for free—” one of them shouted. </p><p>“I’ll pay a silver as long as I can spend five minutes hunting in the dungeon!” another one shouted. </p><p>“I will —” </p><p>That looked like it could turn into a stampede. “Enough. No commotion,” I shouted. While I didn’t want to act like a jerk, trying to explain something to eight thousand people at once was not an easy thing. That was why I didn’t explain the exact details of the offer. They seemed to be ready to kill each other for an opportunity to visit the dungeon and kill a few monsters after a full day of work. </p><p>I didn’t want to see what they would do if they learned the job was to kill monsters from a safe distance. </p><p>From a pragmatic perspective, I could have easily convinced them to work for a pittance, or even sign some very punishing debt contracts, which I could easily enforce because of my direct contact with the management. I had no doubt that many in my place would have done exactly that. </p><p>It was pointless. I paused for a moment, which both allowed them to process the importance of the moment, while also giving me a chance to adjust my recruitment plan. My initial plan was to just hire the volunteers to join my guild, but I decided against it. </p><p>Not only could it turn messy to give them the opportunity, but it was also a waste. The higher their level, the less benefit they would get from killing monsters. I expected them to reach level fifteen quickly, and progress to twenty-five at a reasonable pace, only to be stalled during their class upgrade due to the lack of mana. </p><p>I decided to level up all of them. While it might slow down setting up my operation, it would give Maria a bunch of farmers who could work longer and produce more food. Selling it back would have been cumbersome, but it would mean the town could grow without expanding the number of farmers, which would be a bonus. </p><p>And, I doubted she would have a problem with increasing the self-defense capabilities of the farmers. Giving them both Stab and Shoot, which was produced in the dungeon, would make things very easy. </p><p>I just needed to prepare a set of armor for all of them so they didn’t die in an accident. </p><p>“Now, let me explain the rules. We’re going to set up a small raffle, and every volunteer will have a number. We will be rotating the dungeon workers, so all of you will have the opportunity to level up. The ones that impress me in the dungeon will have the chance to join my guild directly for even more payment. But, anyone who risks their fellow farmer’s life in the dungeon will lose that chance. Safety first!” I warned. “Feel free to change your mind if that’s not attractive.” </p><p>No one answered, their enthusiasm growing. I was about to stop when I realized how people could act when faced with such opportunities. “There will be no buying and selling your places in the line, and anyone that tries to force others to give up their place or anything else, I’ll deal with personally,” I warned. </p><p>Then, I pulled my sword as I jumped down, cutting the huge rock I had been standing into smooth pieces with a few Vitality attacks. </p><p>Sometimes, the best way to avoid punishing anyone was to show the power to do so. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 56</p><p>Once I had returned to the fourth floor, the first thing I did was add another layer of trees and kill every beast surrounding the forge. The existence of lure potions scared me. All it would take was for someone to throw one into the center, and my forge would be ruined. </p><p>The monsters didn’t even have to attack directly. Just the existence of giant insects, stampeding wildly, would be enough to ruin my work. </p><p>While I doubted that another layer of trees would help, there was no real harm in expanding my safe zone. </p><p>However, once that was done, I started my experiments. My aim was to understand how mana moved at a macro scale. For that, I finally raised the silver and iron pole with an empty center, which I previously used to search for iron deposits, and started my incredible experiment. </p><p>Which was to push mana from one side, and try to observe its movements before it dissipated. </p><p>It was a simple experiment, but it would help me better understand mana in its natural state. Merely observing didn’t help. Only a limited amount of information could be derived from looking at a glass of water. Worse, in my case, that glass was opaque, and I could only look at it from fifty feet away. </p><p>It was impossible to overstate just how bad my understanding of mana was. For example, whenever I broke a shell, the mana cloud disappeared soon after. However, I didn’t actually know what happened. Was it some kind of energy that disappeared completely like light? Maybe it was like heat, and it searched for some kind of equilibrium with its environment, and I just lost the ability to perceive it once it dropped below a certain level... </p><p>There were limits to what indirect observation would bring. I couldn’t even assume that it didn’t disperse just because of the existence of mana-dead locations. After all, heat dispersed, but there were still places that were freezing and boiling hot on Earth. </p><p>Trying to deduce fundamental working principles from macro systems was an extremely difficult task. Admittedly, even direct observation wasn’t easy. Or, the ancient philosophers wouldn’t have had such misguided assumptions about the way the world worked. </p><p>“Let’s start simple,” I grumbled even as I pushed some mana to the center of the pipe, using Mana Control to deliver that as a ball, hoping that the mana would follow the pipe's direction. </p><p>The aim of the experiment was simple. I wanted to understand how mana moved in its natural state. My observations weren’t exactly conclusive. In its free state, it reacted similarly to something in between liquid and gas, however, it was not consistent It changed freely for no reason … well, no apparent reason, at least. </p><p>However, whenever I used the perk Mana Control, it turned into some kind of extremely malleable tactile material, not unlike some kind of soft plastic. It had been similar to when I used Mana Manipulation, but, for the lack of a better term, it felt more … liquidy. </p><p>“I wish I studied material sciences more,” I muttered. When I had been studying, I had readily dismissed anything mechanical or material-based as an area of study, feeling that they had long reached the bottleneck of development, instead choosing to dabble with computer engineering before I finally picked mathematical sociology as my final direction. After that, I abandoned anything on the physical side, though I still worked on the software part. </p><p>Coding my own models, at least the core components, was always easier than trying to explain them to someone else. </p><p>However, my lack of grounding on the more experimental side of things was coming to bite me in the ass. I probably could have come up with a lot of interesting experiments if I had been more familiar with the more esoteric side of the material sciences. </p><p>Instead, I needed to start from scratch. </p><p>“Let’s begin,” I muttered. </p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>The setup for the experiment was simple: Maintain a hold on the mana using Mana Control, bring it to the center of the pipe, and shift to Repair the moment I let go of the mana, hoping that it would give me enough time to observe it. </p><p>It failed. </p><p>Spectacularly. </p><p>The mana just dispersed before I could get a sense of its movement. I repeated the experiment, this time with more mana. The result had been the same, but I didn’t let that stop me. I repeated the experiment a hundred times. </p><p>The only thing I gained, was the dispersion shape of the mana being slightly affected by the pipe. Unfortunately, even that was a bit doubtful, as the silver and iron mixture had let the mana pass through. Whether there was no resistance, or there was only a slight resistance, I didn’t know. </p><p>“Back to the drawing board. I need a material that resists mana better,” I said. Unfortunately, due to the way Observe worked, I needed to rely exclusively on metals.</p><p>Worse, while the Mana Forge offered many materials, it didn’t exactly come with an analysis report. I instinctively knew which metal would hold a better edge, and which one would be more durable, but it didn’t index them based on their mana resistance. </p><p>I was curious whether it was not available, or it was something that would be unlocked once the conditions were fulfilled — whether it was finding the raw materials, or reaching a certain skill proficiency. </p><p>However, that question, at least in the short term, was just one of idle curiosity. I needed far more gold than I currently had in my possession to improve them further … and, that was assuming I could infuse enough mana to trigger a System response, which was not exactly a given. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I said to myself and started on my experiment. </p><p>The first step was easy. I just needed to make a box, put mana in, close the box, and watch its dispersal. It was a simpler setup than the pipe, which, I had to admit, was a bit too ambitious of me. </p><p>The first rule of experimentation was to start from the most basic alternative. And, for that, I had to go back to the third floor, as the ordinary materials would have been just destroyed on the fourth floor. </p><p>Luckily, I had kept my third-floor forge intact, just buried. I made a dozen boxes made of available materials. Copper, bronze, iron, silver, and, with the tiny amount of it I had, gold. All except gold, I had created both pure versions, vitality-only alloys, and mana alloys of. </p><p>Then, I infused several bursts of mana into each material, trying to get a general sense. Of the pure materials, iron functioned the best for my purposes, while gold performed the worst. Of course, another way of saying that was that gold might be an excellent conducting material for mana, but that was currently not the experiment. </p><p>Also, technically, I couldn’t call that effect conduction without a lot more experiments. After all, I still didn’t know whether the mana was disappearing, or just reaching a point below my detection capabilities. </p><p>Then, there was the performance. Across the board, mana alloys performed the worst, letting the mana pass through easily. “Interesting,” I grumbled, my mind already wondering whether that fact had anything to do with better mana alloys allowing for stronger enchantments. Maybe it was creating a medium to collect the environmental mana. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I said again while still taking notes. One benefit of working on the third floor, it allowed me to use paper. </p><p>Meanwhile, alloys made out of Vitality were more of a mixed bag. Some of them performed better than their pure variant, some of them worse. None of them were good enough to work for my purposes, but it was still valuable. It meant that, possibly, there was a solution. </p><p>“Next, the shape,” I said, and forged a hundred different shapes from pure iron, from simple cubes of various sizes and thicknesses to exotic curvy shapes that would have challenged even the most complex 3D printer. </p><p>I didn’t expect much, which was why I was surprised to notice a hexagonal prism performing excellently, somehow forcing mana to linger inside for a significantly longer time. Yet, the moment it started slipping through the surface of the metal, it started dispersing. </p><p>There was no reason I could think of that would cause a hexagon to somehow work better … but then, that was the point of experimentation, wasn’t it? To understand how things had been working. </p><p>“Let’s find an answer,” I said even as I forged a dozen hexagons, of varying sizes and shapes. Then, I started pushing mana inside and observing the results. Soon, I had a sheet of paper in front of me, and I started trying to find a formula that explained the phenomena. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was a very tedious calculation by hand. The simple arithmetic operations didn’t give me any results, but that wasn’t too much of a surprise. </p><p>However, after going through some common formulas, I actually managed to find a good formula. One of the classics. </p><p>Newton’s law of cooling. I first played with the transfer coefficient and transfer surface area, confirming that those two rules held true. Then, I started increasing mana density, and calculated the rate of the mana transfer. </p><p>I found out that, similar to heat energy, the higher the mana difference, the faster the transfer. </p><p>Interestingly, the formula only worked when I assumed that there was a certain gap between environmental mana and what I could detect from the environment, which was very strong evidence for my theory that the disappearance of the mana meant that it was below my detection threshold. </p><p>It had many interesting conclusions, but none of those conclusions were really relevant. Especially since I still wasn’t certain whether the core conclusion I had driven was accurate, or if I was misrepresenting the principles. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the luxury of repeating the experiment a hundred times in different forms to conclusively confirm it. </p><p>I still had other experiments to run. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 57</p><p>I decided to hold the first iteration of the next experiment on the fourth floor. While I was afraid that the corrosive effect might ruin the experiment, considering the trial and error process I had to go through, I felt that it was an acceptable compromise. </p><p>I could always use the anti-corrosive material on different floors to confirm my conclusion, but the reverse wouldn’t have worked. </p><p>Before starting, I mined another huge pile of iron ores, and refilled the blast furnace. I didn’t need more iron under the circumstances, but it was not an excuse to waste the capacity. I could always store the excess. Also, watching the rhythmic movement of the steam engine was calming, reminding me that my work was not for naught. </p><p>I forged a hundred different variants of anti-corrosive alloys, each shaped into the same hexagonal cylinder with thick walls and a hollow core, and half a foot tall. A boring process, so the reminder was certainly welcome. I only stopped to refill the blast furnace, and occasionally to mine more iron ore — which was rapid thanks to Quake Hammer. </p><p>Then, I filled each of those containers with five different intensities of mana, noting down the rate of dispersal for each set — this time writing them on clay tablets as paper disintegrated on the fourth floor — while leaving the containers on the shelves I had created. </p><p>Once the results were compiled, I picked the ten most promising results and created ten variants for each result. And, I repeated that cycle until I was looking at five hundred different cylinders. Luckily, with my Forge skill above a hundred, forging all those different materials barely took four hours. </p><p>“A good halfway result,” I said. Without the skill to help me, even with a modern materials lab, the same experimental cycle would have taken months, and a dedicated team of tab technicians, manufacturers, and assistants. </p><p>I could have continued to experiment, but I decided to visit the first three floors, and maybe even leave the dungeon momentarily to see how it worked outside. For the trip, I only took five cylinders with me, making sure there was a great performance variance between them. I wanted to bring more, but it would be too suspicious. </p><p>Hiding the cylinders wasn’t the only preparation I had made for the trip. I stopped by the third floor and reforged the armor I wore whenever I went outside. Its surface stayed the same, but I added two layers of protection underneath. </p><p>I still remember how easily I was able to kill my assassins due to their poor armor. Just because I was in disguise didn’t mean I had to wear substandard armor. </p><p>With that done, I tested the experimental hexagonal cylinders and observed the dispersal rate of mana change between the third and the fourth floors. Mana dispersed faster on the fourth floor. The difference was significant, but the relative dispersal rate stayed the same between the cylinders.</p><p>That much could have been accounted for by environmental differences, but the mechanics were in doubt. A glass of water cools down at different paces in a room and in a freezer. But, the cooling rate would be different if the glass was in front of a ventilator as well. </p><p>My current setup wasn’t designed to detect the difference. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I muttered even as I traveled between the floors, and confirmed that it was true for the first two floors as well. The higher the dungeon was, the slower the mana dispersed. </p><p>And, since I was returning to the camp, I spent some time hunting insects on the third floor, bringing another thousand shells to the guards. Just because I was experimenting didn’t mean I had to stop making money. It was also a good chance to check in with the guards and confirm there was no problem. </p><p>Finding out mana dispersed at different speeds in different dungeon floors had been curious. But, ultimately, the difference had been minor. However, the real interesting phenomena occurred when I walked out of the dungeon to ‘get some fresh air’. </p><p>The mana dispersal rate outside was far weaker. Even on the first floor, the mana I pushed in had merely stayed in for two seconds before disappearing completely, while outside, it stayed in the container for almost thirty seconds. The difference was resounding. </p><p>What was even more interesting was the direction Mana flowed. Inside the dungeon, the mana had dispersed in every direction at the same time. Meanwhile, outside, the dispersal seemed to be moving toward the ground. It was hard to be certain, particularly since I needed to keep the cylinders concealed from the guards.</p><p>My new status didn’t mean I could act with impunity.  </p><p>I wished that I could stay out to observe the differences between the dungeon and the outside world more, but I didn’t want the guards to notice anything extraordinary. I could go into the wilderness, but I didn’t want to do so without Eleanor around. </p><p>It would be a pity if I died in another assassination attempt. </p><p>This meant that, the difference between the dungeon and the outside world was added to the list of interesting phenomena I couldn’t explore any further because of more immediate concerns. “Frustrating,” I grumbled as I started walking through the empty wasteland of the dungeon once more. </p><p>On my way back, I chose to practice an enhanced version of the Fleeting Step, this time dragging the cart behind me. It was an interesting experience. I fell many times, and broke the cart more times than I wanted to admit, but the improvement had been interesting. </p><p>Once I returned to the fourth floor, I brought my attention back to my material research. However, in the third cycle, the returns started to not be so worth it. </p><p>Still, I had my material. First, I created another thin tube, this time in a hexagonal shape, and kept one end blunt. </p><p>[-20 Mana]</p><p>“Success,” I muttered as I used Observe on the tube again to examine the movement of the mana. This time, rather than just slipping out of the tube, it stuck around, dispersing in a directional manner, giving me the chance to get a feel for the mana movement. </p><p>It didn’t teach me anything practical, but that was the nature of scientific experiments. The aim was to reach a better understanding, not to develop anything useful. Once the working principles were in place, the technology would inevitably follow. </p><p>Speaking of technology, I wondered if I could scale up the tubes enough to function as mana storage. I forged two more tubes. From the outside, they looked the same, but one of them was solid, while the other was made of thin layers, kept apart by the thinnest connectors I could forge. </p><p>The layered one kept the mana inside far longer. The difference was between three seconds and eight seconds. At first glance, it felt like an unimportant practical difference, but it was not so. </p><p>At this point, forging required more and more of my mana, which meant I had to take a lot of breaks to destroy the shells. However, maybe I could create a device, and link it to the steam engine. Add in a simple gravity feeder, and it would output mana far more regularly.</p><p>Creating a crank system that would power that device, and making sure it ran constantly wasn’t easy … but then again, I didn’t need to do so for an experiment. A manual variant was much easier to create. </p><p>Soon, I was looking at another layered tube, with a thick crusher attached to the end. I used it to shatter the shell piece into smaller pieces, and a burst of mana followed. </p><p>With an unexpected result. While the pure mana passed through the layers easily, the same wasn’t true for the tainted energy. It stuck around, unable to penetrate the layer. </p><p>“That’s interesting,” I muttered. Up until now, I had been running the experiment using my own mana, as it was far easier to control and measure. And, excited by the progress, I didn’t even consider how the tainted part of it would have reacted. </p><p>From an absorption speed perspective, it wasn’t really important. I already had Purification, which made the absorption much faster. </p><p>However, it didn’t mean it was useless. On the contrary. </p><p>Excited by the process, I immediately forged another hexagonal tube, large enough for me to fit in, and with a hexagonal door that could be sealed from inside. Then, I sealed myself in with my hammer, and with a lot of shells, and started shattering the shells. </p><p>The pure mana escaped easily, but the same wasn’t true for the taint part. Its density started to get more and more intense. Once I destroyed half of the shells, I crouched down, and started channeling my Meditation skill. </p><p>It took fifteen seconds for the first notification to appear. </p><p>[+1 Mana]</p><p>However, rather than stopping, I kept going. I could feel the strain as I ran the skill, which signaled excellent progress. I stopped only after a minute had passed, ignoring the rare notifications of mana alert. </p><p>What was really valuable was the one that appeared once I stopped. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 53 -&gt; 61]</p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered, happy that my research was already paying dividends. I wondered why the jump was so sudden. But, at this point, I was used to seemingly nonsensical ways skills could jump. Luckily, one thing I wasn’t lacking was shells. I repeated the same thing again and again, running the skill longer every time.  </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 61 -&gt; 78]</p><p>[Meditation (Common) 78 -&gt; 92]</p><p>[Meditation (Common) 92 -&gt; 99]</p><p>“One more to receive my perk,” I said as I repeated the experiment once more. I received my reward. </p><p>Just not the one I had expected.  </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 99 -&gt; Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) 1]</p><p>“That’s interesting, but it’s a waste of Perks,” I examined. I could have always repeated the same thing with Skill Stones … or could I, I suddenly added. After all, I still didn’t know if I had the prerequisite stats for the Uncommon version of the skill. </p><p>Then, once I checked the skill, I was met with another surprise. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 1 [Controlled Flow, Enhanced Sensing, Purification]</p><p>My perks were still in place. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 58</p><p>“Let’s see what’s the difference between the two methods,” I muttered even as I focused, and attempted to activate my newly obtained skill. An imaginary orb once again started rotating, though both the speed of the rotation and the pull were far less than I had expected. I actually had to open the hatch and disperse most of the tainted energy that had been collected to succeed. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 1 -&gt; 7]</p><p>“At least it improves faster,” I said, and I shattered a few more shells. Another minute of meditation gave me two more mana points. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 7 -&gt; 19]</p><p>“Well, no perks,” I growled. While I didn’t expect more perks, I had still been hoping for that to be the case. I pushed again, which brought my skill’s proficiency to its thirties. The sphere started rotating even faster, already surpassing the performance of the Common variant had on its level fifties. </p><p>However, the more interesting part was that, once I passed level twenty-five, I could feel that it wasn’t a singular method anymore. Instead, I could feel a second option, a sphere with a deep gap around its equator line. </p><p>It was not a straight line, but a wavy gap, almost like a trench, or a water canal. </p><p>Switching between the two had been instinctual, but the actual application of the skill was not. As I rotated, the sphere moved sluggishly, with the foreign energy clogging its flow. It was an interesting experience. The skill was giving me direction, but I failed to actually push it. </p><p>The reason soon became clear. The tainted energy, for lack of a better word, was clogging the structure. I had a good idea of what the function of that line was, so I opened the hatch once again to cleanse the room of the tainted energy, slowly increasing intensity once more. </p><p>The gap at the center almost worked like a centrifuge, the mana was gathered there, while the tainted energy was pushed to the surface, essentially separating the two factors. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said even as I focused on the shape of the channel. It felt immutable. But then, as I repeated the process a few more times and pushed it above fifty, it changed. I could feel that I could transform both the surface of the sphere, and the shape of the ditch. </p><p>However, when I tried to do that, I was met with something I hadn’t faced ever before. The Skill refused to engage, like I was trying to lift a weight I wasn’t capable of lifting. </p><p>“I wonder if it’s due to my lack of stats,” I muttered. I vaguely remembered the sensation when I had first acquired Mana Forge, but back then, I didn’t have too much time to process it. I couldn’t help but feel excited, wondering whether it would mean I could unlock another Stat while leveling up. </p><p>But, I wasn’t in a hurry for that. I still had a lot of experiments to run. Level fifty was the biggest opportunity I had to upgrade my class once more, and I wanted to maximize the opportunity there. </p><p>Still, while it didn’t rotate automatically, that didn’t mean I couldn’t reshape it. Curious, I transformed it to a simple hexagon and rotated … it pushed both mana and tainted energy away. “Interesting.” I maintained the hexagonal shape and used it to run the process in reverse and discharge my mana. </p><p>It worked far better. </p><p>I ignored it temporarily. I had a lot of time to experiment. Instead, I started gathering and releasing mana again and again, increasing the density of the tainted energy whenever the skill development stalled. </p><p>Soon, another bonus arrived. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 98 -&gt; 102]</p><p> [Perk Options — Advanced Purification (Purification) / Superior Sensing (Enhanced Sensing) / Efficient Absorption / Channeled Flow (Controlled Flow)] </p><p>I chose Superior Sensing, as it was the one that would help me most when discovering the secrets of mana. I was glad to do so. I could actually see some more details. Unfortunately, they were hard to describe, and that enhanced visibility only worked while I was meditating. </p><p>Soon, the maximum density of tainted energy I could achieve stopped giving me benefits, which meant that the immediate benefits had stopped. Not that I was complaining. I had already pushed my meditation to an incredible level. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 134 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]</p><p>“That’s enough meditation for today,” I said to myself, even as I stood up, and left the hatch. With two of my tasks complete, I was about to focus on creating the steam-powered crusher. </p><p>Now that I could refill my mana completely in seconds, breaking the shells actually turned into my biggest problem. However, once I stepped out of the steel coffin I had created for myself, I had to delay that. The reason? </p><p>The density of the insects around my base had increased significantly as if someone had broken a weak lure potion. But, I didn’t start looking for a spy because of it, since the aired-out concentrated tainted energy was a much better explanation for their presence. </p><p>“Interesting discovery,” I muttered even as I rushed forward. I chose to use a sword, as it was a good opportunity to work on the mana attack. I was prepared to work hard to create something even halfway usable. </p><p>So, when I bisected the first giant insect effortlessly, I was actually surprised. Unlike my previous attempts, the mana edge solidified around the blade effortlessly, enhancing the cutting edge perfectly. It almost looked like I was using a skill … but then, it was not. Whenever I used a skill, there was always a slight sense of separation. </p><p>The difference was subtle, like the difference between riding a bike and swimming. Both gave a sense of control, but the former was reliant on the shape of the tool more than the latter. </p><p>In my case, the skill still handled my movements, but the mana around the blade was under my direct influence, changing shape through my control, weakening, and strengthening as I focused on the mana field.</p><p>It didn’t take long for me to understand the source of the sudden improvements. My experiments. </p><p>After all, I had spent several hours working with mana. And, more importantly, it was not mere repetition work, but experimental work that had forced me to interact with mana, both directly, and based on different materials. </p><p>The more I practiced, the more I realized that change came from many different directions. One was simple. By repeatedly using Mana Control to shape and release mana again and again, I had gotten more familiar with the way mana moved, and the uncommon variant of the Meditation had further improved my understanding. </p><p>Of course, what I was doing with the mana blade was nowhere as tight as using Mana Control. Still, using it repeatedly gave me a better instinct for mana’s liquid form — or, at least, what I temporarily named, as it was not exactly an accurate descriptor — which translated somewhat into the more solidified form a mana attack used. </p><p>Then, there were my insights on the movement and dispersal of mana, particularly understanding how it roughly followed a similar path to Newton’s Law of Cooling. That alone gave me a better idea of how much mana to push into the structure. More importantly, knowing that there was still a mana cloud around me even if I couldn’t detect it allowed me to compensate for it. </p><p>However, the biggest benefit came from an unexpected source: How the mana interacted with the metal itself. </p><p>During the experiment, I had created hundreds of different alloy variants, focusing on nothing but the way they interacted with mana. Of course, I had just focused on observing the way they kept the mana contained, but since that was done with Observe, I had caught far more minute details than just the speed of dispersal. </p><p>And, after thousands of observations, I had managed to get a better sense of how to maintain that mana field. “Suddenly, I’m glad that I haven’t destroyed the containers,” I chuckled even as I continued to cut down the giant insects, trying to angle my attacks so that I could kill the beasts and remove their shells at the same time. </p><p>Of course, that way, I was only able to get a broken shell, and it dropped the skill quality considerably, but I didn’t care for either the sales potential or the skills. The most important thing was to have even more material for my experiments. </p><p>Once the density of the monsters had been dropped to a certain degree, I went back to the shelves, and forged another set of containers, this time going the opposite direction, and focusing on creating a metal that allowed the mana to flow freely. </p><p>What followed was another cycle of experimentation. I alternated between using a hammer, sword, and spear, sometimes using the mana blows through the Mana Forge skill, and sometimes experimenting with it directly. It was another session of experimentation someone else would have classified as boring, but not me. </p><p>No, I was too busy inventing a new mana attack for my Quake Hammer. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 83 -&gt; 85]</p><p>“Success,” I said even as I looked at the horde of monsters surrounding my base. </p><p>But, as I looked at them, I only saw walking proficiency points. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 59</p><p>“Too bad I have to stop,” I complained even as I smashed another giant insect, and started walking back. I had drifted away from it to hunt even more giant monsters, which had been even easier with my new hammer technique … especially since, once I got far away from the base, I stopped bothering to collect the shells. </p><p>I hadn’t brought the cart with me, and bringing them back would be an unnecessary chore. However, just because I didn’t bring back the shells didn’t mean that the adventure wasn’t useful. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) - 142]</p><p>The new variant of the mana attack once again pushed the skill to develop smoothly, until it stalled after one hundred and forty. Reaching a hundred points gave me an even better vitality attack, with its effects spreading to everything in a two-foot cone. </p><p>Unfortunately, it also consumed more than a hundred Health, meaning it couldn’t be used casually. At least, not before I confirmed whether the root plants I was raising on the fourth floor were edible. </p><p>I wanted nothing more than to return to my lab and continue experimenting on mana attacks. Unfortunately, I needed to show my face upstairs occasionally. Which meant, I had to waste another hour hunting the ordinary monsters. </p><p>“I can’t believe how quickly the money loses its allure,” I muttered. Now that I was getting richer, I immediately lost interest in working for more money. I wanted nothing more than to stop hunting, and focus on my experiments. </p><p>However, I learned my lesson from the last time when I assumed that money would be coming indefinitely. Even with all the tricks I had discovered, making money wasn’t that simple. I was able to monopolize the dungeon only because nobody else had discovered how to handle the corrosion effect, allowing me to make a ridiculous amount of money every day. </p><p>But, that income could disappear just as easily. All it would take was one of the ploys of Thomas to succeed, or someone else to find an anti-corrosion enchantment or come up with another solution. </p><p>“Maybe I should start delving deeper,” I examined. While the idea of finding the entrance to the fifth floor was a very time-consuming adventure, it might prove to be necessary. Unfortunately, it needed to stay an idea, at least for the moment. </p><p>Instead, I once again went to the third floor, about to start the tedious process of hunting, when I remembered how the monsters of the fourth floor had reacted to the concentrated tainted energy. “Why not multitask,” I muttered even as I went to the fourth floor and brought the chamber here. </p><p>It weighed more than a ton, especially when it was filled with broken large shells, but my metal cart easily handled that weight, while my strength handled the carrying. Once on the third floor, I closed myself in once more, and started to break the shells. The mana easily escaped the room, while tainted energy stayed in. </p><p>However, I didn’t waste too much time. The moment the mana density had dropped below a certain point, I opened the hatch, and the tainted energy rushed out. </p><p>Which immediately triggered a swarm that wasn’t any less impressive than the one triggered by the lure potion. Luckily, without the need to fight off a team of assassins at the same time, it was far easier to deal with. </p><p>I continued cutting them down, the sword in one hand, the extraction device in another, multitasking to play around with the shape of the sword attack even more. With the number of monsters attacking, extracting all of their shells was nearly impossible. </p><p>I was just about to see if I could modify the mana field around the sword in a way that would allow me to kill the monster and get the shell at the same time, something more interesting caught my gaze. </p><p>Some of the monsters were moving away. </p><p>It was the first time I had seen the monsters actually behave like that, which I felt like an incredible discovery. One that I wanted to observe. However, instead, I just followed and killed them, not even taking away their shells. </p><p>It felt like letting them go away would have been irresponsible. </p><p>Only after I dealt with every monster that was trying to get away did I start playing with the mana field around the blade, trying to extract the shell and kill the monster in one blow. When the swarm finally calmed down, I was yet to succeed in that, but I made some nice progress. </p><p>Still, I was more excited about the experiment rather than adding another sixty gold coins to my account. </p><p>“So, what’s going on?” I asked as I arrived at the base, and noticed the guards were looking stressed. </p><p>“The news is not good, sir,” one of the guards whispered. “I heard that two of the guilds had already pulled back from the operation. And, it looks like others are considering pulling back as well.” </p><p>“Oh?” I asked. </p><p>The guard nodded. “Yes, the news of the dungeon disaster has spread, and some of the guilds are already packing up.” </p><p>“Really?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes. Everyone fears that we’ll end up getting fired.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, the other guilds pulling out is excellent news,” I answered, loud enough for the guards to look surprised. “Well, the less guild there is, the more money I would make,” I said. Then, I smiled excessively widely. “And, I doubt any other guild masters would be generous enough to tip you guys with gold coins, right?” </p><p>I was speaking loudly to maintain their morale. </p><p>“Right, sir,” the guard replied, relieved. </p><p>The world might have changed to an unrecognizable mess, but money still solved all problems.</p><p>“Now, count all of it and record it on my account,” I said as I took a new cart, once again going down. Only after I had left the fort behind, I frowned. </p><p>The news of guilds pulling back was certainly not good. If Maria changed her mind about operating the dungeon alone, a lot of plans I had would have been ruined. The biggest reason I was able to achieve everything in such a short order was their lax management. </p><p>I wasn’t sure if I could do the same if they changed their mind and sold the dungeon operations to someone else. </p><p>Technically, my bragging about hiring a lot of people and earning even more money from the dungeon was not a lie. I could do so, but doing so would be troubling. Having only five more fighters, each armed with one of the modified looted swords would make me a lot of money. </p><p>However, expanding that operation further didn’t have the same advantage. Trying to build a guild that could single-handedly operate the dungeon meant that I needed to reveal some secrets, which, in turn, made me an even bigger target for assassination.</p><p>“No need to borrow trouble from the future,” I muttered even as I passed through the gate. Ultimately, it was just gossip, and I didn’t know the real scale of the problem </p><p>However, there was nothing I could do about that before Eleanor and Maria returned with the caravan, so I didn’t want to waste my time. </p><p>Instead, I returned to the fourth floor. I had another experiment to make. </p><p>For that experiment, I decided to keep things simple. I went back to my hidden base and created another tree ring just a hundred yards away from the outer ring. Then, I made a cage out of the strongest anti-corrosive material I had. </p><p>Capturing one of the ordinary monsters had been slightly more troubling, but then I dragged it to the center of the woods. </p><p>Then, I made a copy of the container I used to practice meditation. I could have brought the other one back from the third floor, but that would mean that I had to carry that back and forth whenever I wanted to use it to trigger another swarm.</p><p>Assuming, of course, there wasn’t a disastrous consequence. </p><p>Once the container was complete, I positioned it against the cage, and once again broke multiple shells into pieces, periodically leaving the beast under its effects. </p><p>After three bursts, the beast started to struggle, trying to run away. However, the cage was strong enough to hold it back, so after several attempts of breaking out, it started to turn listless. Then, it fell into a coma. </p><p>It was the first time I saw a monster sleeping, or doing anything that could be defined as living. So, I stayed there to watch it, curious about what was going on. </p><p>I didn’t waste my time. At the same time, I started practicing with my sword, once again focusing on the mana field around the blade. Soon, I had already succeeded in spreading it two inches away from the edge blade, which gave it an incredible cutting ability. </p><p>However, it was unnecessarily mana-consuming and unstable. The moment I stopped providing extra mana, it flickered slightly, and it destabilized immediately.  </p><p>“But, what if I modify the sword to better channel the mana?” I muttered, already deciding on what to work on next. Maybe I could copy the general shape of a sharpening enchantment, adding some hexagonal tubes into the metal to channel the mana better. </p><p>Such a modification would have made the sword weaker, but still, it was a worthy experiment. </p><p>However, those thoughts had been interrupted when the monster woke up, only to attack me with a ranged spit. </p><p>I didn’t expect monsters to be able to evolve. </p><p>This had implications… but exploring this revelation would take some preparation, as triggering that evolution had been very wasteful. It used the material from almost ten giant insects. Hardly cost-efficient for practical purposes. </p><p>The mystery behind this occurrence, on the other hand… </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 60</p><p>“I need to find a way to contain mana for longer,” I muttered as I returned to the forge, and started working. Which meant that I needed more materials, which in turn required more time spent on mining and operating the blast furnace. </p><p>With my Quake Hammer, the actual mining didn’t take too much time. Carrying the ore to the blast furnace and loading it, on the other hand, took much longer. “No, I need to automate things. I continued working on another steam engine. </p><p>This time, it was the improved version, with a separate condenser chamber, meaning the steam cooled down in a separate chamber. That way, the cylinder didn’t have to heat up and cool down repeatedly. Therefore, not only did the power strokes move more regularly, but it was also more power efficient. </p><p>The trickier part was to connect the power arm to a set of gears and power shafts to convey the power into other materials. Originally, it was not that difficult. Just a thick fabric line would be enough. Unfortunately, here, the fabric didn’t survive long under the constant corrosive effect. </p><p>“It looks like I have to forge a lot of gear,” I said and began working. An hour later, I was looking at a brand-new steam engine, with multiple moving wheels, and gears to transfer power. Then, I started forging a conveyor belt. Unfortunately, I needed to make the moving parts out of thin metal plates rather than another simple fabric. </p><p>It was wasteful, but I didn’t have any other options. Inventing new materials wasn't as easy without the skills helping me to skip some critical stages midway. A few tricky mechanical parts were difficult to work out without any rubber or plastic, but I managed to do it. </p><p>Barely. However, it was more or less the limits of what I could achieve mechanically without additional effort. </p><p>The ultimate setup was simple. I had connected the new steam engine to multiple gears, allowing it to take over three critical roles at the same time. Working the conveyor belt, which was connected to a large reservoir into which I piled the raw iron ore I mined. Pumping out the water from the mining pit to keep it easy. And, feeding the blast furnace with materials and bringing away the excess. Well, blast furnaces, as I had built two more to benefit from the automation, which allowed me to stockpile refined iron, just in case. </p><p>As for the old atmospheric steam engine, I moved it next to the forge and fashioned it into a simple crusher that would destroy insect shells. It had a main output line, which would channel most of the mana toward the forge so I could use it to reshape metal. </p><p>I tried to come up with a way to channel the excess tainted energy toward the secondary experimentation area, but I failed. While the metal contained the tainted energy much better than mana, it was still not enough for it to reach the target almost two hundred yards away. </p><p>I might have tried to figure out a method of somehow forcing the monsters to evolve into something more profitable, but I did not. It was just an experiment to understand the dungeon’s secrets better, not to mention it was a good way to prepare for the fifth floor. </p><p>So, instead of creating a pipe System, I just created an inner cage to hold the foreign energy from the broken shells, which I could carry manually. </p><p>With that done, I started another set of experiments. A whole new set of containers, this time all made from the same alloy, but integrating hexagon shapes in different ways. Some, I etched the metal with hexagon shapes. Some, I created overlapping layers of thin containers with nothing but air in between. </p><p>As I worked, I periodically visited the cage to feed the monster with the tainted energy, watching it get more and more agitated. Since I expected it to transform into a giant insect, I even forged a new, reinforced cage. </p><p>Of the two experiments, the container one was the first to give a positive result. </p><p>The best performer was the one that I had shaped as a modified beehive, with the hexagon structure spreading not only as a layer but as a three-dimensional structure. It had outperformed any other container significantly, holding mana inside for more than a minute before it dissipated completely. </p><p>It had potential. </p><p>“I wonder why hexagons contain mana so much better,” I thought to myself. Unfortunately, when it came to science, why was often far more difficult to discover than how. Repeated experiments could discover the latter, but the former required a much deeper theoretical approach. </p><p>And I lacked the information necessary for that. </p><p>In the end, I decided to take the beehive pattern as an interim success, and start working on a way to mass produce it. While experimenting, I basically etched every hexagonal pattern directly with mana, which allowed me to forge them perfectly. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was difficult to make anything truly large-scale using that method. I tried to simplify the design. In the end, I came up with the idea of casting two thin sheets of metal: one smooth and one with a beehive pattern. Then, I would layer them multiple times, and then cut the whole layered sheet into six pieces and weld it together as a hexagonal cylinder. </p><p>However, creating a setup for casting was a level of automation I wasn’t ready for. Instead, I had forged one by hand, enough to confirm that the principle worked well enough. </p><p>“Mass production is not urgent,” I muttered as I grabbed another container filled with tainted energy and rushed toward the captured insect. During the last blast, it started trying to get away, so I was hoping to trigger the next development. </p><p>It did, but to my surprise, it didn’t transform into a giant one, but a flying one. </p><p>“Well, that’s not good news,” I said even as I watched the monster fly with surprising effectiveness. The biggest weakness of the ordinary monsters had been their mobility. However, their flying variant clearly didn’t share the same flaw, which was not encouraging for the future. </p><p>Even I wasn’t sure whether I could handle them if they collapsed around me like some kind of three-dimensional swarm. Not unless I had a better attack. </p><p>“Alright, creating a ranged mana attack is back on track,” I said as I walked back to the forge. </p><p>Of course, this meant that I needed to start my containment experiments from the beginning, this time to find the best patterns to actually increase mana conductivity. </p><p>After all, I was still a Blacksmith, and making tools to enable ranged attacks first was much better than blindly practicing the same technique again and again. </p><p>***</p><p>Just like that, with the absence of Eleanor and Maria, I found myself locked in a routine for the next two days. I stayed in the dungeon and didn’t go back to the town. Most of my time, I spent in my hidden base, alternating between trying to discover new variants of monsters and new materials, and restructuring the base, utilizing the wide availability of materials. </p><p>Though, several times, I went upstairs to bring ever-growing piles of monster shells. I had managed to figure out how to cut the shell with a mana attack directly, which allowed me to make almost a hundred gold with each trip. Three trips a day, and two days later, my account had almost reached eight hundred coins, a level of money I couldn’t have imagined before. </p><p>However, making more money had been the least interesting part of my time. </p><p>Experimenting with monsters was far more interesting. I had discovered two new variants of the normal-sized creature, which included a faster melee variant, and an armored one; and three variants for the giant one, one with an even thicker shell, a ranged variant, and one that looked like a burrowing type. </p><p>And, while I was experimenting with that, I also discovered why the monsters had been gathered whenever parts of the dungeon had been destroyed. Whenever it was destroyed, the same tainted energy was free, though the amount was not enough to be noticed by my Meditation. The Observe caught it, but only barely. </p><p>While it was interesting, the emergence of the new monster types was dangerous and, therefore more important. The potential existence of a flying one was problematic enough, forcing me to make some significant modifications to my base. I had not only created a roof over the forge, but also turned it into a roof garden to dissuade any possible attackers. </p><p>The potential risk of the burrowers had been easier to handle. I had just added a thick metal floor to the base to make sure there wouldn’t be any nasty surprises if the dungeon started to have more monsters. </p><p>The trick with the lure potion had been dangerous enough, I didn’t believe that it was the only way people discovered to sabotage dungeons, not even for a second. While I didn’t like the general attitude of this new world when it came to research and discovery, not for a moment did I believe that the same negligence applied to dungeons. </p><p>Dungeons had military implications with an immediate return, and no research that offered short-term improvements to the military had funding troubles. I had no doubt that the new research institutes I had been applying to — unsuccessfully — were focusing more on that than anything else. </p><p>However, while redesigning the base and experimenting with the monsters had taken a lot of time, it wasn’t the end of my research. I had also experimented with metals, which gave me an iron-silver alloy that was particularly good at conducting mana. </p><p>After several more experiments, I was able to discover that while hexagons were good at capturing mana, triangles were good at directing. </p><p>All that remained was to weaponize it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but collapse against the warm stones, the biting of the wind suddenly not as painful as I suddenly started to deal with the implications of my epiphany. </p><p>Providence was not a singular entity. </p><p>It was an ephemeral realization, but it wasn’t wrong. I knew that what I felt wasn’t just the presence of the mountain, shaken by the cultivators, but something greater. Much greater. Unfortunately, the contact was too brief, and my own knowledge of Providence came as an auxiliary to Alchemy. </p><p>More importantly, it was limited to the perspective of Kartpa Valley. </p><p>As I idly captured some snow in hand and flicked it to molten rock, watching it fizzle, I tried to understand my understanding, which flowed away just like a half-remembered dream. Most of the details were already gone, but some of the facts I didn’t doubt.  </p><p>The moment I interacted with it, I could feel that it was a great, concept, surpassing not only the mountain, but even the misty mountains. It was a much greater challenge. </p><p> For a fleeting moment, as I interacted with the providence, I felt in contact with a great concept, far more expansive than just the mountain range … or even the area that had been ruled by the historical Everdawn Empire. </p><p>Yet, it was shackled, locked, tempered down, even the slightest shuffle locked down by Providence itself. It was a groundbreaking realization, one that forced me to revisit everything I had concluded about the world I was in, and the clues from the Providence. </p><p>Of course, that raised the question of when I moved according to the suggestions of Providence, which was one of the two sources I had been following. Was it the imprisoned part, or the dominant one — </p><p>Then, a big realization hit. My encounter with the Nascent Soul cultivator. What if I wasn’t the only one that was directed by Providence there. </p><p>“It was a trap,” I growled.  While it had been helpful in the end, if it wasn’t for all the abilities granted by the System, I might have been captured by him. And, I had a feeling that, once a cultivator had a treasure like me that could multiply any resource they granted, it wouldn’t have ended well. </p><p>In the end, I stopped thinking about it. The realization was too big for me to properly process. And, I was still in the middle of a supernatural volcano that might make my life very difficult if I let the path of balance I had been following slip away. </p><p>Not to mention, the cultivators were still outside, trying to suppress the eruption. </p><p>I took another step, my foot slipping on a patch of slick ice, and I barely caught myself before I tumbled backward. “No distraction,” I reminded myself even as I continued to walk forward, paying more attention to my surroundings. </p><p>Before I reached the summit, the path of balance had finally led me into a tunnel, one made of stones that finally radiated the familiar presence of Burning Ice, properly combined into one existence rather than being left out to fight. </p><p>“Finally,” I muttered as I walked the tunnel, enjoying the story of the faded murals, each showing flickers of life that made me suspect that the recent presence of Providence had been helping. I could have rushed through the corridor, but I did not, as each mural revealed a story, the embedded concepts letting me learn more about Ancient Martial arts than my whole research combined. </p><p>None of them had related above Blood Qi realm, but it didn’t make them worthless. There were different arts, Apothecary, Forging, their own brand of formations that they called Land Mastery, and many different weapons. </p><p>It wasn’t a guide of how to do them, but more of what the sect had achieved. I was sure that they had never imagined anyone like me, with a deep foundation in every art imaginable — cheating during learning was an incredible luxury — glancing at the secrets of their art from their murals. </p><p>But then, considering everything that happened to them, I doubted that they would be unhappy about it. </p><p>I didn’t let myself lost in the details of every single art, but focused on the general lines. And, those general lines gave me the impression that ancient martial arts were … primitive. </p><p>It was not a value judgment, but a statement of fact. Apothecary techniques were nothing compared to the flexibility of Alchemy, their fighting arts lacked the explosiveness of  Qi arts, and Land Mastery was rough and inflexible compared to everything that could be done with formations. </p><p>Yet, I wasn’t sure about the source. Trying to compare Qi and Essence was difficult since they worked with such different principles. It was almost like trying to compare an old historical machine with a computer-operated one. </p><p>Their disparity didn’t just come from the principles, but also the time and effort that had been put behind each. </p><p>I was tempted to stop and think about the implications, but in the end, I decided against it. I was already in a race against time, as it was unknown how long it would take for them to arrive. I continued to move, until I came across a locked door. </p><p>Breaking it down was easy, but instead, I used the environmental Qi to simulate the feeling of Burning Ice essence, a trick that required both formation knowledge and a deep insight into Burning Ice essence. The door pulled open under its own might, inviting me in. </p><p>“An intact library. Finally,” I said even as I rushed in. It was filled with text that had been printed directly on some kind of metal, no doubt to make sure it stood against the ravages of time. It succeeded. </p><p>The shelves were filled with many scripts that went into detail when it came to every single art, both production and combat. Of those books about techniques, I put all but one into my storage ring … the only exception being land mastery. </p><p>I had a feeling that it would be useful. </p><p>But, at the center, there was another book, one about the history. I read it first, unable to contain my curiosity. It explained more, but also less. Most of the history, like the great battles between the Everdawn Empire and many sects, didn’t really capture my attention, other than the reason for the constant battle. </p><p>The sects, at least ones that had been called orthodox ones by the author, believed that martial arts should not be a part of the secular world, but a way to bond with nature and chase a higher level of existence. </p><p>While Empire ‘debased’ the martial arts by making it a part of the secular world and using their rulers as the spiritual pillars instead. </p><p>I didn’t let the wording influence my conclusions too much, as the broken records I had managed to cobble from the ruins of the Everdawn Empire showed a similar strong bias.  </p><p>However, the records about the last battle were the most interesting, as it started showing mentions of the ‘outsiders’ that offered to support the sects against the Empire, bearing gifts. The sect mentioned that they had chosen neutrality, only for some of their members to turn traitors and start serving the outsiders, tales that I had to skim over due to the threat outside. </p><p>There was no name for the outsiders, but the way their abilities had been discussed, it was becoming increasingly clear that those they mentioned were cultivators. The description of abilities like formations and storage rings was simply too distinct. </p><p>“Why they are so weak, though,” I said. The historical records mentioned the cultivators as mysterious but weak, only a threat to Blood Essence realm cultivators. I would have assumed that it was about Blood Essence realm martial artists being significantly stronger in the past, but it was clearly not the case either. </p><p>One good benefit of having such a detailed breakdown, I could set some accurate understanding of the situation. And, on that description, there was no cultivator achievement that couldn’t conceivably couldn’t be replicated by any of the sect cultivators I encountered. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t know why. For the Burning Ice sect, up until the end of the records where they had decided to seal the mountain and retreat, they were yet to understand the true power of cultivators, treating them as slightly stronger merchants and troublemakers rather than a source of overwhelming power. </p><p>As for why, I had many ideas, but none of them was supported. So, instead of wondering about it, I packed the historical records at me, but not before peeking at some of the auxiliary historical records that showed the recordings from the cultivators. </p><p>Of those sigils, I recognized only one of them. The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. </p><p>It would have been shocking … if it wasn’t for the giant flying boat outside. But, with that, I could only acknowledge that the Treasure Pavilion was too mysterious to be poked around, and focus on my next step. </p><p>Safely retreating in a way that I couldn’t be followed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>If I was still on the flying boat, the remaining distance would have merely taken a minute. Instead, on foot, the travel took almost eight hours, but I didn’t treat it as a waste. First of all, the passage of time allowed the ship of the Treasure Pavilion to intervene with the volcano, forcibly suppressing it with formations. </p><p>It was a spectacular formation. While I lacked the ability to replicate it because I lacked the Golden Core chapters of any formation technique, it didn’t prevent me from understanding what was going on.  </p><p>And, that intricacy was truly interesting. </p><p>First of all, I could see twelve Golden Core cultivators working on the formation at once, which was an absurd number, especially since, at a glance, I could see that they were much stronger than the other Golden Core cultivators I had tangled with. </p><p>Then, there was the formation they had been using. It was too complicated for me to decipher the actual function, but I could feel the Providence somehow fluctuating in response to the formation, signaling that it was actually a Nascent Soul formation. </p><p>It meant, either they were true geniuses who were able to operate a major realm above their capabilities, or they had a high-level formation scheme that they needed to power up to use. </p><p>I didn’t know which was the more valuable investment, but either way, it was enough to show two things. Treasure Pavilion came here, knowing exactly what they would find. And, they were prepared to deal with the risks. </p><p>However, I wondered why the people who intervened with the volcano didn’t wear their colors. On the contrary, even the second team they had sent to check my location after the first one met their unfortunate end wore their colors. </p><p>They probably had a complicated reason relating to fate, karma, and providence. And, as I approached, I soon noticed an interesting detail. The Treasure Pavilion Ship moved constantly, but whenever there was a new burst, it was always aimed at the ship itself, showing not only the explosions were not random, but also the Treasure Pavilion was treated as the enemy. </p><p>Why, I didn’t exactly know, or care. What I cared was, that even with the Nascent Soul level formation, the volcano explosion wasn’t something they could control easily. So, when I approached the volcano, I didn’t immediately burst forward, knowing that I needed to stay safe from not only the cultivators, but also the mountain itself. </p><p>And, it wasn’t exactly an easy process. The closer I got, the more details I was understanding about the mountain. And, one of those details was the way Qi and Essence moved around the mountain. It wasn’t a formation per se, but the function was similar. I would have called it proto-formation, but even that would have been an exaggeration.  </p><p>The best analogy was that, if the formation was a perfectly forged steel sword, the energy that danced around the mountain was a shattered piece of obsidian. Natural, unwieldy, fragile … but no less dangerous when applied correctly. </p><p>I knew that, with my formation knowledge alone, I couldn’t have traversed through the mess. Even at the Major Integration, it had limits. But, comparing that internalized knowledge with my intimate knowledge of the ancient martial arts, Burning Ice in particular made it possible. </p><p>It allowed me to ‘see’ a path through the natural formation that was around the mountain, a shifting path where ice and fire danced, neutralizing each other harmlessly. I had a feeling that it was the intentional part of the design, allowing only the people who understood the true essence of their martial art to climb the mountain. </p><p>The only problem, I had to limit the number of formations around me. In the end, I chose a visual illusion only, betting that none of the cultivators had senses sharp enough to detect my presence through the chaos of the fire and the ice that danced on the mountain, especially with the Providence still in flux. </p><p>Also, one good thing, the moment I stepped on the mountain itself, the effect of the mist had stopped. Why, I didn’t know, but it meant I could get rid of another layer of formation, so it was good news. </p><p>“I’m a moron for doing this,” I said even as I started to climb the mountain on my own power, unable to leverage any formation, which was harder since I was still unable to use any Essence, and I couldn’t just call more Qi without the fear of triggering another volcanic eruption. </p><p>Luckily, even after I had completely shed my previous martial arts power, the physical improvements it had brought were still there, making the action of climbing a treacherous volcanic mountain during a blizzard merely challenging rather than downright suicidal. </p><p>I pulled my cloak tighter around me, the fabric whipping wildly in the blizzard’s fury, but it did little to stave off the cold that invaded my body, nor did it completely stop the snow lashing against my face. </p><p>Yet, I wasn’t unhappy with the challenge. For all my faults of personality — that I was open-minded enough to acknowledge — I had never been one to avoid physical exertion, or I wouldn’t have tried to make a career out of being a professional sprinter before an injury ruined my life. I had always alright putting in the effort … I was just greedy for more than just a meager paycheck. </p><p>I found myself smiling even as snow lashed against my face, their essence-enhanced nature lashing against me, stinging like tiny needles. The annoying, but it made the challenge real. </p><p>It was different than the volcano that loomed over me, a massive silhouette shrouded in a thick, roiling cloud of steam and snow, still spewing ash and magma, devastating threats. I was reasonably confident that I wouldn’t die if it exploded. Not only did I still have my flying boat with me, but also I had a treasury of Qi and other items in my Inventory that I was reluctant to use, but if the choice was between respecting Providence and saving my own life… </p><p>That was not even a choice in the first place. </p><p>As I climbed, my attention wandered, watching the heat of the molten rocks destroy the snow the moment it touched, only for the relentless blizzard to replace them again and again until the molten rock to lost its red color … only to be replaced by another drop. </p><p>It was a clash of extremes, a constant, unending struggle between fire and ice where there was no victory in sight. What a vain struggle. </p><p>At least it was beautiful. </p><p>I pressed on, pushing myself to the limit as I climbed as fast as possible, not wanting to be outside once the cultivators finished dealing with the raging volcano. My breathing started to pick up speed, my own body heat replicating the heat of the rocks even as the icy winds scoured my skin. </p><p>The higher I climbed, the more volatile the air became even at the thin line of balance I had been following. Hot steam erupted from the fissures, battling with the cold air as the blizzard turned even more chaotic. Luckily, even without actually cultivating its essence, my knowledge of the technique allowed me to move without harm … well, except my skin cracked from the constant hot and cold switches, but it was a risk I accepted. </p><p>Yet, even as I climbed, I started to feel a vibration under my feet. It was different from the quakes of an explosion. It was more like a throbbing heart, as if the volcano itself was alive. Soon, the winds around me gained the same mystic rhythm, matching my breathing. </p><p>I assumed that it was just an illusion, until a sudden flash of Providence wrapped around me, too fast for me to react, and —</p><p>APPROVAL.</p><p>It disappeared just as quickly as it had arrived, leaving nothing but a deeper understanding of the concept of Burning Ice. I felt like I had been judged, and luckily, received a passing grade. </p><p>It must have been the lingering impact of the Symbol. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but pause, wondering what would have happened if I had been found wanting. Nothing good, I presumed. I was still confident that I could survive with the System, but I was glad that I didn’t actually take that challenge. </p><p>Yet, that realization soon disappeared,, leaving me to process the sudden new realization about fire and ice, elements opposite in nature that should have been in eternal conflict, yet here, they were in a delicate, impossible balance, made stronger by it.</p><p>I breathed even as I waved my hand, and the Providence around me stirred once more. However, it wasn’t the violent pull of the System that left Providence in momentary chaos. Instead, it was a brief movement from the Providence. It was just a momentary control due to the epiphany I was enjoying, the ability to do so disappearing in an instant. It had no practical effect. </p><p>But, the knowledge it brought was even more impactful. As, when the Province stirred gently under my control, it only moved partially, before it was forcibly stopped by … </p><p>Providence. </p>",

    "content": "<p>My reflexes took over as I started constructing a formation … an illusory one, creating a scene of destruction even as I dodged the attack. Luckily, my Black Grade ship was nimble enough to achieve that. The Qi attack was fast, but the great distance gave me a chance. </p><p>However, since I didn’t have much time, I pulled about five thousand strands of Qi from my inventory, as much as I didn’t want to. It wasn’t the amount of Qi I had in my inventory. With my prison for rogue cultivators growing, all I needed was to manufacture a fake conflict for them to start ‘insulting’ me by intimidating me with their presence, giving me enough Qi to deal with the situation. </p><p>Five thousand strands of Qi was a significant amount, the kind that was out of reach for any Foundation Establishment cultivator I had interacted with, including the sect outer disciples. </p><p>The problem was, that it drew the Providence from the environment, which was already something I was reluctant to do. Here, with the nebulous feeling that, somehow, Providence was locked and imprisoned at the horizon, I was even more reluctant to do so. </p><p>However, that reluctance was nothing compared to the threat from the Qi attack traveling to me at a shocking speed. Dodging the first attack was easy, but the follow-up attacks wouldn’t be. I needed to convince them that their attack succeeded.   </p><p>As I constructed the illusion formation, I felt the Providence around me flicker. Only then, I use the full speed of my boat, dipping down to the ground. A good choice, as even through the defenses, I felt the overwhelming power of the attack. </p><p>I didn’t fancy the chances of my boat against it. </p><p>As I landed, I immediately shrunk the boat into its miniature form and rushed toward the nearest cave, only when I was at the entrance of the cave, safely behind multiple formations — once again using four hundred strands from my inventory — I turned my attention to the giant flying ship that appeared. </p><p>When I said giant, I wasn’t exaggerating. It was big enough to treat an aircraft carrier as a sailing boat. An accurate measure was difficult to get from such a great distance, but its length was easily more than thirty thousand feet. </p><p>A size that, if it was aligned vertically and one side was on the ground, would create a very valid hazard for airplanes back on Earth. It took a while for me to pay attention to its flag. </p><p>Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. </p><p>My eyes widened. Based on the way the other forces paid respect, I had expected them to be strong. But, this strong … However, before I could really ponder the implications of their power, I had to pay attention to other things. </p><p>At first, I had thought that my attention would be occupied by the dozen figures that had left the ship, all but one on their flying swords, the only one exception at the center, flying on his own power, indicated a team of Foundation Establishment cultivators, led by a Golden Core Elder, all dressed in the distinct colors of the Treasure Pavilion, no doubt wanting to check my location. </p><p>It changed with a sudden, earth-shattering explosion from the volcano, spewing ash and superheated steam. It would have been a perfect coincidence … only I could feel the stirring of Providence from the volcano, telling me that it was not a coincidence in the slightest. </p><p>I gulped, glad that I wasn’t closer to the volcano. With the ash cloud blocking my sight, I didn’t know what happened to the team that had just left to examine my location, but I wouldn’t bet on their survival. Not when I could feel the essence as a part of the explosion, making it far more dangerous than an ordinary volcanic explosion. </p><p>And, a volcanic explosion was dangerous enough without any such enhancement, even against cultivators. </p><p>“Let’s not waste the opportunity,” I muttered even as I started working hard to manufacture some items that believably came from the destroyed wreckage, using environmental Qi for the task instead of my inventory. </p><p>I didn’t want to tempt another explosion. </p><p>Luckily, the ash cloud gave them something more urgent to deal with, which gave me some time to work on the fake crime scene without tapping into the System, letting me use the new spread of abilities. Artifact forging to create pieces that could conceivably come from the wood of the flying boat, alchemy to give them an aged look as well as adding some very convincing fake blood and flesh, calligraphy, and formations to make it more convincing, and even a few talismans to look like a storage room that burned. </p><p>It took five minutes for me to create what hopefully was a convincing outlook, leaving me alone with my real problem. </p><p>What to do. </p><p>Every instinct I had told me to retreat. After all, not only the mountain itself was an extremely dangerous location, evidenced by the intense explosion, but the presence of the Treasure Pavilion made things far more of a challenge. </p><p>The safest tactical move was to retreat, leaving them alone. Unfortunately, it wasn’t exactly the best idea in the long term. </p><p>For one, finding an intact ruin had taken a long time for me, and that was by following some clues I couldn’t just replicate. Clues that I was reluctant to write off as coincidence considering how every random decision I had taken brought me toward it. </p><p>Knowing Fate is not just nonsense that had been created to con people out of their money made it difficult to write things off as coincidence. Especially since I was a literal chosen one, albeit a discarded one. </p><p>But, even discarding the value, there were strategic reasons for me to stay. For one, the presence of the giant flying ship itself. My own experience with the flying boat showed me just how ridiculously expensive was compared to establishing a physical base. The only reasonable excuse for operating out of the ship, was that it was a recent arrival. </p><p>It made sense. The main base had recently started to receive Providence through the auxiliary symbol that I had been supporting. From there, my best guess was that one of the explorers who was better than the ones I had been dealing with had informed the Treasure Pavilion about the discovery of a new base, and they came to raid the place. </p><p>Considering the single-minded interest they showed toward the ruins, their presence wasn’t surprising, but the fact that they were able to discover it faster than me despite all the advantages I had meant nothing good. This might be my only realistic chance of somehow getting in contact with the intact form of ancient martial arts. </p><p>And, even if the worst case didn’t happen, I would still require years. Years that I didn’t have, with Pearyin’s Dao Gate, Everdawn Conspiracy, the fake mystic land crisis of my own making … I didn’t have years. </p><p>Worse, even if I took that risk, and assumed I could keep all those problems simmering, it didn’t solve the most urgent problem. </p><p>That the Treasure Pavilion had the ability to track me back. Just like how I could follow the track of Providence, they could follow it back to my mountain base. And, since my understanding of Providence was very limited, I had no idea whether I could resolve it by destroying the mountain base and reversing the cultivation of the recruits. </p><p>And, even if fixed it, then what. My search for the ancient martial arts was still a vital part of my future path, and sooner or later, and even if I decided to abandon the mortal domain, the misty mountains looked like the only option. </p><p>Even if I relied on a blind search, sooner or later, I would come across them. </p><p>Of course, none of those actually prevented me from feeling like an idiot as I ignored every survival instinct I had and approached the volcano that spewed out an endless stream of magma and ash. The blizzard around the mountain, getting more and more intense, hardly helped the situation. </p><p>However, as I approached, I wished that I had some of the Burning Ice martial artists with me. I had no doubt that, seeing the way the essence of ice and fire danced together, they would have leveled up their understanding significantly. </p><p>For me, it only represented a devastating danger especially since I was reluctant to actually cultivate the essence, still afraid of the implications. </p><p>“Onto the breach once more,” I muttered as I moved toward the volcano on foot, multiple formations around me to keep me invisible and secure. </p><p>Hopefully. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>In the end, I was able to kill three more gargantuan beasts before exhaustion won over me. </p><p>To my surprise, finding them had been the easy part. All I needed to do was to grow a lot of trees, and once the number had passed a certain point, a gargantuan beast attacked. While the reason for their hatred was a mystery — the disruption of the mist was my best guess — the effect was not disputable. </p><p>It helped me to draw them closer, and my vision expanded significantly in the process. </p><p>As I absorbed the resulting light, my vision increased even further. Session one added three more yards to my vision, the third one added almost four, and the last one added slightly more than five, which was more than I had expected. </p><p>Compared to that, the excitement from another level up, bringing me to level forty-three, faded in importance. </p><p>Initially, even my most optimistic assumption was for it to turn into some kind of additive effect, with each boss monster expanding adding some more to my view, while the more realistic assumption was for its effect to lessen with each consumption. </p><p>The quasi-exponential growth it was displaying was certainly welcome. </p><p>I was tempted to hunt a couple more, but my need for a nice, long sleep proved to be more important. I was exhausted. </p><p>Walking around in the dungeon with a significantly expanded range of vision felt amazing. Even with my skills and armor ensuring my safety, walking around blindly in a monster-filled pocket dimension was not a comfortable feeling. </p><p>Especially since I had already dealt with two assassination attempts. </p><p>Once I reached the second floor, my range of vision barely surpassed two hundred yards, which was an incredible benefit against any potential assassins. And, that advantage would expand even more as I continued to hunt for the gargantuan beasts. </p><p>With every day, the dungeon was starting to feel like home. </p><p>Once I reached the outpost, I decided to check the immediate surrounding area, making sure to stay outside the view of the hunter teams, watching the way they operated. I had checked their operation many times, but the benefit of distant observation was valuable. </p><p>I immediately caught two problems. The new recruits who had classes other than farmers were bullying the farmers. It wasn’t anything too extreme, mostly slurs, mixed with occasional pushes and shoves, but I decided to nip that in the bud. </p><p>I might lack the power to fix that anywhere else, but I wouldn’t allow that to happen in my own guild. </p><p>The second thing I noted was several farmer teams, doing their best to steal some of the shells, embezzling from my profit. That, I decided to ignore. It was not ideal, but there was a limit on how much I could pay them before my actions started to be treated as not just stupidly generous, but actually suspicious. </p><p>And, I had too many secrets to handle such a suspicion. Letting them steal a few was a good idea. Maybe I should ask Harold to create a semi-official channel so that they weren’t ripped too badly by the other guild members. </p><p>Harold was not in the base, so after a quick walk in the base, I returned to my room. “Let’s see,” I muttered even as I put my hand on one of the silver murals that covered my walls, using my Advanced Observe Perk to check every place that was connected to it, checking the existence of various metal seals I had created. </p><p>It was not paranoia when I had multiple enemies, with one of them already showing a willingness to kill me. </p><p>Then, I moved to the next stage, which was sealing the room. Locks, even the intricate ones that could have been used as a bank vault, were not secure in a world with both Dexterity and Perception. However, as a blacksmith, I had a much easier trick. I welded the door shut. </p><p>It was not impossible to breach the reinforced door, but it was impossible to do so without alerting me. </p><p>Only after that, I laid down, not removing my armor. Sleeping in armor was not comfortable, even with Health to resolve the worst of my stiff body, but it was another sacrifice I had made for my security. I closed my eyes, letting sleep claim me, my overactive mind replaced by restless dreams that were impossible to remember. </p><p>However, even that restless sleep proved to be a luxury, when I had been woken up by the insistent ringing of a bell. </p><p>”What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“L-lady Eleanor is here for an urgent meeting, sir,” the unlucky member said. </p><p>“Really, what a bad timing,” I grumbled in frustration. “Just as I was trying to sleep,” I added, and caught a surprised expression, one that he schooled immediately. </p><p>“Spill,” I said. </p><p>He looked uncomfortable. “I don’t know what you mean, sir,” he said, looking panicked. </p><p>“No, you clearly wanted to say something. Speak,” I ordered. </p><p>“I  … It’s just that I didn’t see you work in your chambers for so long, sir. Ordinarily, you leave the paperwork to Sir Harold.” </p><p>It felt weird, before I remembered to ask an important fact. “How long have I been in my room?” I asked. </p><p>“About two days, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Working on new tactics is time consuming,” I said, throwing out a simple excuse for the situation, one that might not have been entirely believable, but hierarchy had its benefits. People not bothering to ask questions was one of them. </p><p>I said nothing else as he led me outside, where Eleanor had been waiting for me. Her expression, more enthusiastic than anything else, suggested that she was here for a spar more than anything. </p><p>Luckily, it had been more than ten days since I had received the skill from her, so there was no harm in showing my great progress. Whether to reveal the full extent of it was a different question, which I would decide based on her reaction.</p><p>“Follow me,” she said, her impatience clear. From anyone else, that dismissive attitude would have been a grave insult, but I knew that she was obsessed with the art of the sword as much as I was obsessed with my studies, so I understood her frustration. </p><p>I would have been equally irritable if I had been distracted by a week of non-stop meetings in the middle of my studies. </p><p>I managed to keep my desire to tease her suppressed until we left the outpost behind, knowing that teasing her in front of the guild member would affect the authority we had been reflecting. It had been a fact I had dealt with for a long time. </p><p>“So, how was your week,” I asked even as we moved deeper into the dungeon. She groaned in frustration. “Come on, it can’t be that bad.” </p><p>“No, it’s worse,” she said, making a face. “Now that we’re making some money, there’s a lot of purchases that need to be done. More siege weapons, construction material for the town, new skills…” </p><p>“Sorry about that. I know it’s all my fault —” I teased her, which she interrupted by throwing a rock at me. </p><p>“Don’t be a smartass, or I’ll bring you with me next time.” </p><p>I chucked. “Hey, it’s not like I had a better time,” I said. “I spent most of my time forging the arrowheads, which left time for nothing else.” </p><p>“Really?” she said, but I could see her disappointment. </p><p>However, her disappointment only made me amused. I chuckled even as I drew my sword and attacked her. She drew hers to parry mine, which launched a short yet intense duel where she stayed defensive, letting me show my abilities. </p><p>“Impressive,” she said as she shifted from the defense to offense, and I found myself defending, while her attacks escalated more and more, her frown turning into a big smile.  </p><p>I didn’t hold back, but I didn’t push myself to my full capacity either, and just relied on the sword skill. </p><p>A reasonable time had passed since I had received the skill, and even if she had realized that I had reached the limit of the Rare skill she had gifted to me, I could explain it. She already believed that I was some kind of sword genius, and even if she found that unconvincing, I could reveal the existence of the composite swords I designed to make the attacks more reliable. </p><p>“Not bad. You have worked hard,” she said even as she started putting in an actual effort. She was nowhere near the real limit of her skill, but it was an actual challenge. In a way, the situation was very similar to the chess games I played with Maria. </p><p>I had no chance of victory — as long as we relied on swords only — but unlike Maria, Eleanor didn’t enjoy a one-sided beatdown. Instead, she limited herself in certain ways to make our sparring an actual challenge. </p><p>However, just as we fought, I noticed something distressing. Two people, both dressed in black cloaks, approached us silently, paying more attention to the ground than their surroundings. Interestingly, the monsters around them ignored their presence, which I suspected to have something to do with the subtle blue glow surrounding them. </p><p>And, once they were about a hundred yards away from us, they stopped, waiting for something. My guess was that they were waiting for us to speak and confirm our identities. </p><p>It was not good news. I realized that, without exploring the fifth floor and killing the boss monsters, there was no chance for me to notice them. It was that confidence that made them act like that. “Try not to overemphasize the defenses of your extremities,” Eleanor said even as she attacked from below. </p><p>“I don’t want to lose a leg,” I said while I defended and retreated at the same time, but my focus was on the unexpected presence of the two. The moment Eleanor and I spoke, confirming our identities through the mist, they started moving back. </p><p>Leaving me with a decision to make. </p>",
