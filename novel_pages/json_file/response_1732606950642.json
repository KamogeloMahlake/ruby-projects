    "content": "<p>Staying for more and revealing myself was tempting … but the risks were too high. Not because I was afraid of her reaction, as I trusted myself to control that. </p><p>The risk was about delaying my magical learning. The fake assassination of Sapphire would happen in a couple days, and I had already alerted elves about that to gain some credibility. I wasn’t sure whether my cute spy would reveal that to other elves or would try to keep closer to her chest — especially since I gave her a way to manipulate Aria from her perspective. </p><p>Regardless of her ultimate choice, having detailed knowledge about the working principles of their magic would come in handy to handle the ploy — not to mention the long-term benefits. </p><p>I stayed concealed while she dealt with the report — enjoying the show whenever she took a break — while preparing to leave the moment she gave me an opportunity. I still didn’t want to use magic to conceal. About fifteen minutes later, she decided to visit the kitchen, and I used the opportunity to slip out.  </p><p>I dashed toward the entrance I had created, removing the magical wedge once I left the garden, carrying a pile of books with me. </p><p>Returning to the palace was not difficult, but since I needed to experiment, I changed my destination and left the city instead. However, this time, I didn’t go to the meadow that I used with Cinder and Isolde. Instead, I moved even farther — empowering my speed with living flame — until I reached an abandoned mine. </p><p>I chose the abandoned mine for two reasons. First, the place was concealed enough that I could use some explosive spells without arousing suspicion.  Second, and more importantly, I hoped to find some monsters using the tunnels, and some live targets would help me to test the potential of the elven spells. </p><p>Normally, it was not ideal to practice in uncontrolled conditions, but I was willing to take the risk to quicken the process. </p><p>Even as I moved, however, I did my best to skim through the books, using my speed reading abilities. Such an approach was not enough to understand and unravel magic — but it was enough to give a cursory understanding of the issue. </p><p>And, the best thing I could define elven magic was … likening it to fabric. Many thin strings of mana, of different natures, wrap around each other, reinforcing each other to give strength while also minimizing the impact. </p><p>No wonder their wards were nearly impossible to detect despite their strength. It almost had no outward presence. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean it was a flawless technique. On the contrary, the more  I read,  the less I was afraid of fighting an elven caster. Not that they suddenly turned into an enemy that could be easily destroyed or anything, but the biggest disadvantage of their technique was clear. </p><p>Perfection required slow, deliberate action. It was possible to manipulate many mana strings at the same time, but the thinner they got, the more string was required to create the same impact. The finer structure made it very difficult to detect and counter, but did little to actually improve the power, at least not enough to be worth the effort. </p><p>And, ironically, the finer the mana strings,  the harder it got to multitask without making them snap — a warning that was clear in the beginner books. </p><p>Combined, it created an interesting picture. Elven magic was strong, stable, and mana-efficient … but required both incredible expertise and a lot of time to cast properly. Excellent for utility spells that required to stay concealed, and for creating defensive positions when time was not a concern … but not the best method to deliver intense, flowing attacks that I preferred. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured as I considered what it meant for the land they had come from. The nature of their spellcasting would have surprised me if I didn’t know they came from a different plane, but with that, not only it made sense, it allowed me to make some guesses about nature. </p><p>One of those guesses, I was almost certain. They had trouble accessing enough mana, and amusingly, it was probably about their supposedly legendary casting abilities. They either used the mana their home plane could access to the limit, or their ruling classes somehow restricted the accessible mana to protect their power. </p><p>Radical, yet reasonable at the same time.  </p><p>Of course, the exact nature was more of a guess. The important thing was to understand the drawbacks of a plane with a lot of accessible mana. </p><p>Never attack a defensive position, constantly unravel the surrounding mana in case there were hard-to-detect spells buried around, and always make sure to keep the battles mobile to make sure their stability advantages wouldn’t snowball into a deadly avalanche. </p><p>“I owe Cinder a big favor,” I murmured as I realized the incredible advantages living flame could provide me in such a battle. The destructive abilities of the living flame worked wonders to destroy their stealth spells. </p><p>Of course, on the flip side, the spell structure of the phoenixes was especially bad to destroy the defensive structures if an elven mage dug in defensively … which I assumed based on my limited understanding. </p><p>No wonder they were rivals for centuries, with their fundamental advantages clashing like that. </p><p>I was able to unravel the traits of the elven magic pretty easily, but that didn’t mean I could replicate the feat. It was more like understanding how someone punched. The concept was simple, but it required a certain strength and a lot of practice to be successful. For their unique casting method, it was even harder. </p><p>“Let’s see if I can push myself,” I murmured as I forced myself to create a dozen mana strings, which was difficult to do even with the assistance of the Tether. I had gone through the skill principles, and even then, it required almost an hour for me to cast the simplest spell, a bolt that I learned when I was barely a teenager. </p><p>Only forming ten times slower, and spending five times the mana to maintain the same effect … elvish spells were supposed to be more efficient, but that was only relevant when they were cast by someone other than a complete amateur. I chuckled as I threw it to the nearest wall, and focused on my palm, creating another ball of ephemeral energy, holding it still for several seconds as I examined it … trying to improve it. </p><p>I still remembered the first time I was starting to learn mana bolt, a few attempts were enough to make my small, underfed body collapse …  it took more than a month for me to even get a limited sense. </p><p>Luckily, my reserves were much bigger after years, allowing me to repeat the attempt a hundred times, and the only thing I needed to deal with was my wandering attention. Soon, they were stable enough to dent the walls of the mine.</p><p>“It’s progress,” I murmured with a shrug even as I conjured another bolt, this time trying to put more power in it, but the lines destabilized and the spell collapsed, my hand stinging badly. </p><p>“Now, it’s time to practice,” I murmured as I started climbing down. Dealing with the little monsters and critters that would make an abandoned mine their home was beneath me as an ex-dark lord, but it wasn’t the first time I ignored the sting on my pride. Instead, I chuckled, and started climbing down. </p><p>Soon, a shadow popped from a corner, rushing toward me, only for me to nail it. Yet, even as it dispersed, I frowned. A mana shadow. </p><p>My frown didn’t have anything to do with fear. Mana shadows were a threat against someone without magic, but destroying them was just trivial. I was surprised by its presence. It required some magical energy to form … and required a lack of magical predators to keep them down. They either appeared in lab conditions … or places with recent magical activity. </p><p>I moved down further, suppressing my magical presence further, limiting myself to mana bolts … while the mana bolts I was using were wasteful, they were reasonably stealthy, giving me a chance to practice and stay concealed at the same time. I continued digging down, curious about the source. Ordinarily, I would have sent a subordinate to poke around … but I found myself dangerously lacking when it came to the number of capable people I could order around. </p><p>I had some, but none that would avoid making a mess… Luckily, it wasn’t the first time I had to take a dangerous problem. </p><p>However, I was expecting to find a natural formation of magic, or maybe the migration of a large creature. </p><p>I didn’t expect the presence of a large, man-made ward. It was strong,  but not particularly skilled, and I could see the signs of many different artisans … how fascinating. I was tempted to poke around, but was that really the right idea. I had quite a lot </p><p>Should  I go down, or leave now that my initial practice objective was completed successfully…</p>",

    "content": "<p>For a moment, I did nothing as I watched my sexy coach struggle to stand up, my mind on the implications of the totem animal. If I was a petty man, I might have blamed Juana for it, but I didn’t. At least, it happened when I had my pet near, which was the safer option than empowering another human. </p><p>It would have been much worse if it happened when I didn’t have a convenient target like that. The only reason it worked was the persistent connection between me and my pet created by that experimental rune… Lucky again.</p><p>But, when my sexy coach managed to push herself onto her feet, and leaned against one of her lockers to deal with her trembling legs, I decided to focus my attention fully on her. Whatever this totem animal was, I could deal with it a few minutes later,  I thought as I watched her push her panties with a desperate speed. </p><p>When she pushed her ass out, her short skirt was wholly inefficient to hide her wetness from that angle. “It’s time to take your reward, sir,” she whispered. My gaze widened as I noticed a little surprise. A plug in her ass, making it a beautiful invasion. </p><p>“Well, isn’t that a surprise?” I growled as I took a step, and the distance between us disappeared immediately as I put my hands on her wide ass. She had an amazing ass, and seeing it prepared for me was a nice surprise. </p><p>It showed commitment to the bet, I thought even as I caressed her impressive ass, enjoying the shiver of her caramel skin. </p><p>“Yes, sir, just for you. You deserve it for your amazing victory,” she whispered, her excitement impossible to fake — and even if I doubted my senses, there was no doubt about the way her arousal echoed magically, her lust almost a physical object. </p><p>I raised her skimpy cheerleader's skirt even as I gripped the plug and removed it carefully. Then, I threw it away as I slid two fingers inside her wet pussy,, fingering her rather than using my cock.</p><p>No, that had a different purpose. </p><p>“R-right now, sir,” she whispered even as I pressed it against her widened hole, ready to make her my ass slut. </p><p>“No time like the present,” I whispered as I pushed forward, enjoying her tight clamp around me. </p><p>\"God, too fast,\" she whispered, but the arousal in her tone was impossible to mistake. And, her ass was lubricated enough that it slipped easily. </p><p>“Then, you should bend over better to reduce the impact,, little miss,” I said as I watched her open the locker to create a grip for herself, her cry loud enough to echo in the room. Just to make a point, I slapped her ass, and she moaned louder. </p><p>I might have teased her a bit more, but she had gone to the trouble of preparing a beautiful surprise for me, so I worked hard to maximize her pleasure. My fingers stayed in her pussy, pumping in the same rhythm. She whimpered as I picked up speed. </p><p>“Damn, I’m glad that I made that bet,” I whispered as I impaled her ass. </p><p>“Me too, sir,” she moaned honestly, every push making her tits dance. “Me too.” </p><p>Even with the preparation, it must be hurting, but she took it like a true champion, in a way that a whiny cheerleader could never achieve, reminding me that she was not a coach for nothing — though I doubted she would take it as a compliment, so I kept that observation for myself. </p><p>Instead, I continued impaling her. Her ass, perfect thanks to a combination of the genetic lottery, constant exercise, and optimal age, was difficult to ignore even before factoring in her true identity as my superior — bureaucratic superior only, with the rather nebulous dance of power, but still enough to matter — making the moment even more delicious. </p><p>“Enough warm up,” I suddenly said as I pulled back, letting my smile widen. “Now, are you ready for the real thing, little miss?”</p><p>“R-real thing,” she gasped while I positioned myself. She tightened further, but she didn’t ask me to stop … so I slammed into her, hard enough that it echoed in the room, loud enough to rival her cry. I started banging her with a speed I wouldn’t have dared without my magical ability to heal. </p><p>Soon, her cries turned into whimpers, grabbing the locker for balance as invaded her ass, truly and mercilessly. </p><p>Her whimpers were constant, yet not the kind of howls of pain I expected as I picked up speed. Her resistance was no joke, and probably the pleasure she was feeling gave her a better focus. </p><p>“Damn, little miss, you’re something else. Maybe I should talk with your dean about a permanent transfer. I wouldn’t mind permanent access to this ass.” </p><p>“It can … be … arranged,” she gasped, interrupted by moans, though her tone was different as she said so. It was not her fake cheerleader voice, but her true voice. </p><p>“What would it take?” I asked. </p><p>“We have — several more matches — that need to be won,” she whispered. </p><p>“And, since I managed to put the football team in such great order, you want me to continue,” I said, not stopping impaling as I said so, each stroke going deeper into foreign territory. It was hard to decipher the mixture of whimpers and moans she let out under the invasion of pleasure, but I decided to take it as a positive. </p><p>“Let’s change location,” I suddenly ordered, and before she could react, I grabbed her legs and lifted her, pumping into her ass with each step. She looked at the door worriedly, but I just chuckled, bringing her to the showers instead. </p><p>She tried to remove her top. “Keep it on,” I ordered as I brought her to the showers, and turned the water on. The warm water hit us, drenching her uniform enough to add some transparency, which was exactly what I needed to make it even more fun. </p><p>\"Does it feel good, little miss?\" I asked, leaning forward a bit, going even deeper as I pushed her against the wall, trapping her with no hope of escaping. It helped her, with her trembling too badly to keep her upright without that little assistance. </p><p>\"Aaaaah, it feels amazing, sir,\" she admitted, bathing in pleasure. “But I want even more.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about that, little miss, I take my role seriously,” I answered. “I’ll make sure you can’t leave the room unassisted.” </p><p>Determined to keep my promise, I began taking long, slow strokes inside her ass, and her whimpers rose. Soon, I picked up speed once more, and her gasps were replaced by moans, showing just how much she enjoyed being a little anal slut. </p><p>\"Please, harder,\" she still begged, impressing me.</p><p>“Impressive,” I answered as I grabbed her hair and pulled her head back, invading her tight hole even more aggressively. </p><p>Her moans accelerated, soon turning into screams; making me glad for the quality of the stadium. “Do you want me to cum inside your naughty ass?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, sir, fill me up,” she moaned, her authority abandoned under the shower, her cheerleader outfit drenching so bad that it might as well not exist. </p><p>“As you wish, miss sports director,” I whispered into her ear, enjoying ruining the fantasy at the last possible moment. </p><p>As I deposited my load into her, I watched the most animated orgasm I had seen in my life, it echoing as a magical entity as well as a physical reaction. She shook, she trembled, she screamed; and it was the hottest thing I'd ever seen as her caramel skin glistened wetly. </p><p>“Amazing performance,” I said as I pulled back. She fell on her knees, edging unconsciousness.  </p><p>“O-of course,” she whispered. “I take my bets seriously.” </p><p>“That you do,” I answered, letting my smirk widen. “Now, do you want me to help with your car, or would you prefer to come to my office as I start working on the plan for the next week.” </p><p>“Neither,” she answered as she shifted her stance and opened her legs. “Don’t tell me that we already reached the end of our fun. I’m just warming up.” </p><p>“Oh, that sounds like a challenge. Are you sure you can handle it?” </p><p>“Only one way to find out…” she said as she slipped her hands under her skirt, using her fingers to widen her entrance. I licked my lips as I captured the sight, my insides being tickled with excitement. </p><p>“Before we start,” I said as I leaned down, ripping her top to leave her tits naked, finally drinking the amazing view of their glistening expanse … my shaft already raging to go.</p>",

    "content": "<p>There was surprisingly little to do after the match. The team had gone for a celebration, and while the head coach was supposed to be visiting the losing team and making sure there were no hard feelings, the split in the roles worked to my benefit. </p><p>It was Coach Juana and other administrators that needed to deal with it, leaving me to deal with my own issues. It was why I had the luxury of playing with my phone as I waited for my bet to happen … well, I was learning Ancient Greek and Latin, which was not exactly a fun game, but the speed I achieved made it interesting. </p><p>The jump in my capabilities surprised me despite their source. For the first time I had started, I truly felt like a superhero … or better, something divine. </p><p>Speaking of divine, I corrected myself as I heard a knock on the door of the room I was currently in. The locker room that the visiting team used, thankfully already cleaned after their visit. “Come in,” I called, already with an idea about the identity of the visitor.  </p><p>Coach Juana was at the entrance, wearing a large windbreaker, that was long enough to cover even her knees. I switched apps to check the corridor, to see if there was anyone else, but it was clean. “How can I help you, miss…” I started, deliberately letting my words linger, giving her the chance to set the pace of our bet. </p><p>After all, it only stipulated a costume, and nothing else. </p><p>The coach took a deep breath before she unzipped her windbreaker, only to reveal she was wearing the same cheerleader outfit that a bunch of dancers had been wearing on the field as the team got absolutely reamed and demolished. </p><p>Now, it was my beautiful coach’s turn to experience the same. </p><p>“I … my name does not matter, sir,” she whispered as she let the windbreaker fall. “I’m just here to fulfill the bet between you and my coach … I’m the payment,”  she whispered. </p><p>“Payment, you say,” I whispered as I let my gaze drag down. I had seen her naked, but wearing a set of cheerleader outfits that was too small for her. I had a feeling that she felt the bet was unwinnable, which left her scrambling for an outfit. “Why don’t you give me a twirl and show me the full merchandise before I accept the delivery.” </p><p>Not that the results were bad. On the contrary, the barely fitting outfit looked even better on her, especially since she had forgone some critical parts like the shorts that were supposed to go under the tiny skirt to prevent accidents — accidents like what had just happened when she twirled, giving a full view of her generous ass — or the sports bra that was supposed to prevent her tits from pushing against her top. </p><p>Amazing. </p><p>She stayed with her back turned, using the opportunity to lock the door. It broke character to do that without order, but I let that slide. If there was one thing she wasn’t willing to do, it was to get caught and humiliated publicly. It was a private affair. </p><p>Considering the implications, I had no problem with that. </p><p>“Acceptable body,” I said after she finished locking the door. “Now, why don’t you walk closer so I can enjoy my reward, little girl.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered hesitantly, but as she started walking toward me, her hips danced too wildly to agree with the shyness she tried to reflect. Clearly, I wasn’t the only one that was enjoying the show. She stood in front of me, waiting for my order. </p><p>“Why don’t you take a seat while you explain to me exactly how you’re going to pay for the failure of your team,” I whispered. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she answered, this time her tone throaty enough to drive me crazy, showing her flirting game wasn’t bad when she wasn’t just passively fingered by a student. Then, she surprised me by proceeding to sit on my lap with a sexy wiggle, one that I'm sure would have made a weaker man cum. </p><p>Her tiny skirt didn’t make a barrier, leaving the task to her thong, which was hardly better. Her back pressed against my chest while she raised her legs, displaying a lot of it. I chuckled to myself, wondering just how much she would push.</p><p>\"So, little miss,” I whispered as I hugged her naked belly. “Your team failed, and failed horribly. Tell me, are you disappointed?” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she answered with a very gaspy, erotic voice that came extremely insincere with the answer. “It was hard to watch my boyfriend, the quarterback, fail so badly against your team, taking sack after sack.” </p><p>“Too bad your limp-dicked boyfriend is no match against my genius tactics, especially the modified zero blitzes I pulled,” I whispered, and Juana started moving faster. Hardly the most roleplay-related sentence to mention tactics, but that was not targeting her character, but her. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered as her hips moved faster. “Your success is … undeniable. You deserve a reward, just as my incompetent quarterback boyfriend deserves a punishment. Don’t you agree?\" As she spoke, I started to realize that it was turning out to be less of a punishment than I had been expecting. Clearly, the scenario spoke to her. </p><p>I was tempted to change the scenario a bit, but then changed my mind. Her enjoyment was hardly a disadvantage, after all. I wanted a more obedient coach and sports director  … and I was getting what I wished for very spectacularly. </p><p>“Why don’t you show me how you’re going to punish him, then,” I said. </p><p> \"By doing anything you want, sir,\" she smiled.</p><p>\"The word 'anything' is very dangerous, little miss,\" I warned. “Are you sure you’re willing to take such a risk?” </p><p>“Nevertheless, that’s the bet, sir. You win by a margin, and you get a cheerleader whore you’re going to use until you’re spent … in any way you wish. I promised to do anything to save the honor of my school.\" Confident in her sexual irresistibility, her hand went into my pants. “And, taking this hardly a chore, sir.” </p><p>“Chore, no, challenge, yes,” I said with a chuckle. “Why don’t you go onto your pretty knees and we can start warming up,” I ordered. </p><p>She followed that quickly, the angle giving an even better view of her slutty top. I caught her gaze as she looked up, excitement glowing in their depths. Enthusiastic, she pulled down my pants and leaned forward. </p><p>Soon, my cock was in her mouth. It wasn’t the first time we were playing around, but the enthusiasm she displayed as she leaned forward recklessly shocked me. She was an amateur at it, with a little style, but her athletic abilities were more than enough to compensate. </p><p>Soon, she was deepthroating my shaft without the slightest external assistance. I leaned back, enjoying her service. I only intervened once. When she reached to remove her top. “No, keep it in place,” I said to her. It was hardly an impediment from the angle, and they made her look even younger. </p><p>“You’re a very enthusiastic cocksucker, even for a slutty cheerleader,” I commented, and she shivered. “Not very skilled, though.” </p><p>She quit sucking me and looked up. \"I didn’t have many complaints, sir. My boyfriend loves it.\"</p><p>I chuckled, deciding to lean into the absurdity of the roles even more. \"Well, as a head coach, I’m an old man. I’m not a boy, and I expect more. I expect true worship. Do your best to take it down your whore mouth. Only pull back when you need a rest, and even then, lick it. Truly worship it.\"</p><p>Under different circumstances, she would have been insulted by those words. Yet, lost in her cheerleader fantasy, she gave me a determined gaze as she began to bob up and down at a steady pace, achieving the impossible rather quickly. </p><p>\"That's better slut, now work on the speed.\" That excited her more, and her hold tightened on my legs, using them as leverage to pull even faster. I could feel the arousal bubbling down the surface. Her amazing mouth, her costume, her surprisingly enthusiastic service … altogether, they worked fascinatingly. If it wasn’t for my supernatural control advantages, I would have already painted her throat. </p><p>I held myself back, but my blood still boiled with desire. With lust, even, I realized, realizing that I was resonating with her the more I worked with her. </p><p>Instinctively, I realized that I could assign her as one of my Acolytes …  and as the realization hit, some kind of fragment left me, moving toward her. My eyes widened with panic as I tried to stop it. It was too risky … not in terms of her health, as the System was very safe. </p><p>No, it was too risky for me. If there was one thing my experiences with my own guide showed, it was very easy to be discarded once empowering someone. And, I knew too little about what Acolyte meant to trust the System to protect me as well. </p><p>Since I couldn’t pull back the assignment, I focused on another direction, and sent the connection to another nearby target.  </p><p>Toward my armored pet, who was currently resting in my office, enjoying a large piece of lettuce. </p><p>[Totem Animal Assigned]</p><p>That was not the notification I expected, but I knew too little to say whether it was good or bad. Distracted by that supernatural battle, I didn’t bother suppressing my reaction, and exploded in her mouth. “Don’t dare to waste a drop, little miss,” I warned her. </p><p>Impressively, she didn’t miss a beat as I coated her throat, catching all of it as I ordered. </p><p>Despite the mishap … an excellent start.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I turned my attention to Naomi, I had a plan. I wanted to focus on her, bring her to completion before I turned my attention to Sarah, then finish the adventure with Carrie, the true architect of the situation. </p><p>With that in mind, I pulled back slightly, sliding my cock across Naomi’s belly, ignoring the amazing threesome next to me, with Carrie doing her best to devour my seed from Irene, and Sarah gave her a similar service. </p><p>“Stop wasting time,” Naomi growled as she shifted her hips, which positioned me at the entrance between her legs. </p><p>“Who am I to ignore such an elegant order,” I said as the tip of my penis bumped up against her wet entrance.</p><p>“Asshole—“ she gasped, but that was all she was able to say as I slipped inside her, the pleasure enough to silence her. “Damn, girl… You’re right,” I whispered, enjoying the look of her eyes, wide with shock. </p><p>Her interrupted insult started to make things go off the rails. “She’s quite rude, isn’t she,” Carrie said as she stopped grabbing Sarah’s head. Sarah rose, but surprised me by pulling Irene off Carrie, who grabbed Noami’s hair. </p><p>“Not you too—“ Naomi tried to say, which was all she was able to say before I leaned down and captured her lips. But, even as I started kissing her, a part of my attention was on Sarah, who was already grabbing Irene’s tits. </p><p>Irene’s response was even more interesting, two of her fingers already inside Sarah, invading with a shocking aggressiveness … all the while, Ida worked hard to record everything. </p><p>Things were turning into an orgy … not that it was a problem. I had all the permission I needed to push deeper inside Naomi recklessly, her moans hitting my lips. “Damn girl, are your nipples made of rock?” Carrie commented. </p><p>“I’m aroused,” Naomi answered after I pulled back. “But it’s nothing against the hardness inside me.” </p><p>“Fascinating,” Carrie said as she watched each subsequent inch of me disappear between Naomi’s legs, their moans mixing, \"I can't believe we're really doing this...\"</p><p>\"Neither can I,\" I assured her. \"But you girls are the ones that visited my house, determined to abuse my body for your own naughty purposes. I’m the victim here.\"</p><p>“Yeah, right,” Irene managed to answer between her moans while Sarah worked on her tits. “My heart is going out for you, you bastard.” </p><p>“And I can see it,” I answered, referring to her nakedness. It was amusing to see her that she could still blush from the mention of her nudity … while her fingers had disappeared between Sarah’s legs, busy fingering her. </p><p>They had some amazing personal hang-ups. </p><p>I was distracted by a slap on my chest. “Hey, stop flirting and fuck me, you bastard,” Naomi said, playful, but that didn’t mean her jealousy was fake. </p><p>“Careful what you wish for. You don’t want to take another challenge you can’t handle,” I said, reminding her what Sarah did when she got too uppity. </p><p>“Hey, I can take whatever you can give, big boy,” Naomi growled. </p><p>“Really, even if I fuck you as hard as I can manage,” I warned her, my voice suddenly sharp. </p><p>Her eyes widened as the realization hit her that it wasn’t just playful banter but something more … but that didn’t make her retreat. “Bring it on, big boy,” she said.</p><p>That was all she was able to say as I grabbed her waist, and started fucking her. And when I said fuck her, I meant it. Hard, fast, and completely merciless, enough to shut down her mind. The rest of the show came to a stop immediately, reckless invasion barely a speed bump under my reckless invasion. </p><p>They just watched as I invaded their friend with reckless domination that they hadn’t seen before. Even Ida forgot to take photos, while Carrie just gasped in fascination. “Damn, something like this is even possible,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, you know math, I know this,” I answered smugly, not even skipping a beat, all the muscles I had built through endless exercise coming very useful. She didn’t even answer as she watched the way I drilled one of her best friends — along with her other best friends. </p><p>It was spectacular … but short. Before I could even cum, Naomi was experiencing her second string of orgasms, trembling and moaning. “A … break,” she begged between her moans. </p><p>“You’re lucky that you have friends that are willing to take the load,” I said as I spanked her ass, then I pulled. </p><p>Then, skipping a beat, I grabbed Sarah’s hips, and pulled her on top of Naomi. “Now, you were begging me to fuck you for the last few days. Let’s see how long you can handle a proper one,” I said to Sarah as I slipped inside her. </p><p>“More — than — this — bragger,” Sarah managed to say between moans, referring to the same girl she was using as a bed. She was tight, she was hot … and, despite all her bragging, she was not ready for this. </p><p>But, just because she wasn’t ready for it didn’t mean that she didn’t enjoy the overwhelming assault immediately. She moaned, gasped, and screamed as I worked in her entrance with all the dedication of a varsity athlete dreaming to be a professional.</p><p>Feeling left out, Carrie sat her naked body down on the carpet beside me, smiling with pride as my eyes were inexorably drawn to her tits.</p><p>\"See anything you like?\" she asked, spreading her legs apart and started playing with herself.</p><p>\"Don’t eat snacks before the proper game,\" I warned her. “You deserve a reckless fucking more than everyone else,” I said. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said with a giggle even as she grabbed her tremendous tits and started playing with them instead. In a daze, she watched, not even commenting as Irene reached to caress her tits as well.</p><p>“Damn, those are better than mine,” she whispered as she joined the fun, though her gaze still on mine…</p><p>I didn’t want to miss the fun. Continuing to fuck Sarah, I shifted my weight onto one hand, and with the other, I reached out and started playing with Irene’s poor, neglected tits.</p><p>The party was spectacular, their combined moans filling the air as much as the smell of their arousal filling the room. Sarah clenched around my shaft desperately, the sensation of Irene’s tits heavenly under my fingers.</p><p>It was getting harder not to cum, but I achieved it. Experience helped. Still, all that self-control was only gonna do so much for me. </p><p>The moment was simply way too hot … so, when Sarah clenched around me again in a raging orgasm, I exploded inside her, filling her to the brim. </p><p>“I … I’m going to miss this when I go to college,” Sarah whispered deliriously as I pulled out, leaving her collapsed on top of Naomi — who was still too dazed to push her friend away, and just spooned her instead. </p><p>I was hoping for a moment's respite from all the wild stimulation as I pulled.</p><p>Carrie had other ideas. She immediately approached me, her legs wrapping around me. I was momentarily too soft to start … but Carrie had an idea. </p><p>“Ida, Irene, I need your help,” she ordered while her legs trapped me. Ida approached me from the right, Irene from the left, and suddenly, their lips were on my cock.</p><p>\"Daring,” I groaned as their lips started to work on my cock, extremely sensitive after ejaculation. </p><p>“Well, I deserve what they got,” Carrie answered hungrily, not intimidated even a bit despite what she had watched. I could have answered, but I was busy groaning as Ida’s finger dragged across my chest, too hot to handle. </p><p>I turned to catch her gaze, but she just looked smug as she pulled back, taking a quick photo. </p><p>I would make her pay, I thought even as my shaft returned to life  … but before I could even take action, I was already wrapped by a hotness. </p><p>Carrie was too excited to wait for more.</p><p>Later, I thought as I grabbed Carrie’s ass and pushed, hard enough for the sound to explode deafeningly. The dance of her amazing tits gave me enough reason for me to delay her punishment for a few minutes … </p><p>Irene hugged me from behind. Ida continued to take photos. And, at a distance, I could see Sarah and Naomi stirring, both too stubborn to accept defeat. </p><p>“Damn, I love nerds,” I smiled even as I pushed deeper into Carrie. </p><p>Life was good…</p><p><em><strong>THE END…</strong></em></p>",

    "content": "<p>“Open your legs, sweetie,” I said as I positioned myself above her. </p><p>“You need a better connection … of course,” she murmured, a little annoyed, but mostly aroused. Her core glistened as well, showing she was ready for my invasion. </p><p>“Brace yourself, and try not to use any mana,” I suggested as I slipped into her wetness. She hugged me, her arms tighter than necessary.  She was afraid … not that I blamed her. </p><p>I started moving, slow and tender, even as I closed my eyes, focusing on the magical side of things. </p><p>Her Divine Sea was churning chaotically as another point of foreign Divine Spark joined the mix before the previous one could have been assimilated. Left without intervention, I could easily imagine a few more points erasing Seldanna from existence. </p><p>Which begged the question … what they were trying to do. I doubted it was a fancy execution, especially since Seldanna was, for all intents and purposes, a peasant that could be killed without any political implications. </p><p>Meaning, they had a different objectives. Pity I didn’t have the time to go around and search for that answer. </p><p>{+2 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>Not with the process getting faster and faster, as my homemade System warned me. I turned my attention to Seldanna’s Divine Sea, our connection at the maximum level, which was necessary as I interacted with the new Divine Spark through her Divine Sea  — as my Divine Spark would have just purified it, destroying the point. </p><p>As I touched the Spark, memory fragments rushed into my mind. Memories of war and disaster, the sky itself splitting, rains of fire mixing with raging tornados, the very ground disintegrating. </p><p>{+10 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>The memories flew too fast for me to pin them down. The only thing I could understand was that the view was from the perspective of a forest, made from trees that dwarfed the Tree of Life that we were currently in. </p><p>The intense flow of the Divine Spark forced me to add some of my Tantric Mana to the mixture, softening the foreign Spark to make it easily absorbed by Seldanna. </p><p>Just in time. </p><p>{+10 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>As I saw the memories, I realized that I wasn’t sharing the perspective of the trees … no, I was sharing the perspective of an incredibly strong being that was using the trees as a medium to fight against those beasts … only to fail horribly. </p><p>{+10 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>Shocking, as the being was channeling an incredible amount to channel directly, wasting more than a million points each second — maybe even more, but lost in the fragmented memories. </p><p>I had a feeling that I was getting my first experience of what a god was … and it scared me, even worse than I did when I realized the power of the Eternals. </p><p>{+50 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>Yet, despite all their powers — no, all his power, I corrected, the memories giving me a better understanding of his identity. Just to be on the safe side, I wrapped the Divine Sea of Seldanna with a layer of mana, and over it, a layer of my Pure Divine Spark. It prevented Seldanna from using any mana, but it also prevented those memories from touching her. </p><p>{+50 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>I could isolate myself from those memories easily. My stats helped to strengthen my mind, and even without that advantage, I had a better advantage.  The memories came buried in Nature Spark, which was distinctly not me. Seldanna, as a Nature-Spark carrier, would have a more difficult time. </p><p>Still, a few days of meditation were all she would have needed to cleanse those memories, I thought as I continued to decipher the fragments. The battle raged, as I saw the glimpses of other Divine Sparks, sometimes used against the trees, sometimes allied. Fire, light, Healing, Martial …, and others that I couldn’t recognize. </p><p>{+100 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>Yet, there were other concepts, like pure elements and undead, that constantly fought against the trees, cutting the reach of the lone god of nature that tried to stem the tide more and more. </p><p>Soon,  I found myself revising Seldanna’s capability of keeping the memories isolated from hers. The intensity of the memories got stronger, which made it much more unlikely that Seldanna could have handled those memories even if she meditated for years. </p><p>Even for me, they were impossible to isolate. I wanted to process them … and if I still had access to System, I might have succeeded, but without it, it was a hopeless affair. The more intense the memories got, the harder they were to comprehend. Soon, I had to cut the connection with the memory, and start destroying them.</p><p>{+100 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>Either that, or they would pollute Seldanna’s Divine Sea.  </p><p>Luckily, the memories weren’t the only thing that came with the flow. I also received a lot of magical knowledge, and I did my best to save some, separating them from the others. For them to be safely recorded. </p><p>Yet, I could feel that, the flow was not slowing down but getting faster, making me fear that I would have trouble controlling the flow. Luckily, I was prepared for that. </p><p>{-1000 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>{+1000 Purified Divine  Spark}</p><p>The amount of Divine Spark I took from the forest left the tribes in a dangerous position, but the forest already stored enough mana to keep them safe for a few days, so it should be alright. And, if we were still trying to deal with the connection a few days later,  we had much bigger problems.  </p><p>I focused on helping Seldanna metabolize the Divine Spark, feeling the most recent rush would have been enough to contain it. Unfortunately, another notification was quick to steal that confidence. </p><p>{+200 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>I squeezed my teeth, focusing fully on the mental state while my body continued to move, a part of me annoyed that I couldn’t enjoy the beautiful, desperate embrace of Seldanna even a bit, missing a special moment. Luckily, my reflexes were fully trained in the art of lovemaking, and even with my wandering attention, Seldanna was moaning ceaselessly… </p><p>{+500 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>The next burst of Divine Spark was enough to destroy my confidence that I could actually suppress the flow. Luckily, I had other methods to cheat. A bit riskier,  but it was still better than cutting the connection that offered such incredible benefits … or worse, letting Seldanna burn out with an overflow of power. </p><p>I dived down into her Divine Spark directly, letting my Divine Spark mix with hers. My Divine Spark formed a scalpel before cutting a generous portion of her newly acquired Divine Spark. I didn’t have time to ask for her permission, but I was sure that she would forgive me. </p><p>And even if she didn’t, I could earn it the fun way. </p><p>{-200 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>{+200 Purified Divine  Spark}</p><p>So, I was shocked when a voice echoed in my mind. </p><p>“HOW DARE YOU STEAL MY POWER!”</p><p>The voice echoed in my mind … no, not my mind, I realized. In my Divine Spark, particularly the newest part that I was in the process of purifying completely. And, it was certainly not Seldanna. </p><p>I didn’t try answering. Trying to answer angry incorporeal voices didn’t seem to be a good idea … especially when the voice in question tried to hide his presence as harmless memory fragments, creating a trap. </p><p>I bit my lips as I focused my Divine Spark, purifying the amount I cut far faster than any other attempt. Just as well, as the flow suddenly increased. </p><p>{+5000 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>He was playing for the keeps. The sudden infusion of the new Divine Spark not only threatened to kill Seldanna, but also destroy our surroundings completely. Her Divine Sea was ruined completely already, losing all coherence. </p><p>Unfortunately for the incorporeal being that was trying to drown us, that was all that did. The two-layered protection, the first layer mana, the second layer Purified Spark, was especially effective against the tactic. </p><p>I would have pitied the guy if he wasn’t trying to steal the body of my lover. An amazing ploy, yet somehow, his minions picked a target that was uniquely equipped to prevent it by a complete accident. </p><p>I decided to attack back. </p><p>{-1000 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>{+1000 Purified Divine  Spark} </p><p>“STOP,  MORTAL!”</p><p>I expected the being to either stop, or attack harder. Yet, it did neither. </p><p>{+4000 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>Weird, I thought as I focused on the connection, only to realize it getting stronger, despite the flow lessening, and the realization hit. The being didn’t have the ability to stop the flow … not at this point. </p><p>He was a god, I realized, and the memory fragments were from the war between Gods and the Eternals — though the memories confirmed the war was certainly not that simple — and he was probably sleeping in the tree for centuries, one last relic from the forests that he once commanded.  </p><p>Unfortunately for him, I had no intention of even trying to speak. The god was knowledgeable and strong …  and also desperate. A  horrible combination to face, and now that I had the opportunity, I had no intention of allowing him to succeed. </p><p>Ironically, killing him was too simple. I just followed the strengthened connection with a line of Purified Spark, and reached the center. I found his soul at the center of the tree, hibernating to protect himself with his lack of power — giving me the realization that,  true godhood required a lot of Divine Spark to prevent fading away. </p><p>The power that I isolated from him … making him die ignobly. I destroyed the rest of the memories as quickly as I could manage, prioritizing speed over perfection. I had dealt with such problems too much to assume that it was the end of it. </p><p>Especially not in a plane that was dealing with elven traitors, undercover teams from the Eternals, and an ongoing undead invasion…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 2542}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 8000  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 152}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 9104}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, we’re in a safe location, and I have established several alerts to make sure we won’t be ambushed,” I said with a smirk. “Do you have something more interesting in mind to kill some time while we waited for the idiot who dared to imprison you?” </p><p>“Well, no…” she whispered. “But, this is Tree of Life, the holiest place for us elves…” </p><p>“I need to make sure nothing is wrong with you, and the closer we are, the better,” I answered with a smirk. “Your clothes would only get in the way. And, what’s the problem. You venerate nature, and can you imagine anything more natural than what we’re about to do?” I said even as I got rid of the remaining fabric on her body, leaving her completely naked. </p><p>“But…” she whispered, which melded into a moan as I put a gentle kiss on her neck, making her tremble. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re not excited to do it at the center of the Tree of Life. Can you imagine somewhere even more appropriate…” </p><p>“Well, no,” she whispered, trembling on my lap as she said that. “But, still…” </p><p>“You know, I’m not exaggerating when I say it’ll help  me to examine you.” </p><p>“Really?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes. Would I lie to you?” I said as I put my hand on her chin, my tone husky enough to make her shiver. The blush that covered her whole body was not a surprise, as Seldanna was innocent enough to be extremely vulnerable to charm, her inexperience and social status working against her. </p><p>My recently boosted Stats helped greatly as well. </p><p>“I… Still…” she murmured, trying to find words, only to fail spectacularly. She was silenced when I raised her head to meet my gaze, her lips parted slightly. I didn’t bother saying anything else, and just leaned forward for a  kiss. </p><p>She responded, her tongue invading my mouth readily while I reached to her chest, enjoying the softness of her breasts. “Damn, girl, I missed it,” I whispered as I pulled back for a breather. </p><p>“Shut up, and start your examination,” she said and leaned forward to continue the kiss, while her fingers moved along my body, getting rid of my clothes. Her initial hesitancy was quick to disappear, leaving its place for pure arousal, one that was enflamed further by her close encounter with deadly danger. </p><p>While she got rid of my shirt, I leaned forward, adding some very necessary hickeys on her beautiful tits. “Naughty,” she gasped, but considering she fell on her knees and got rid of my pants right after, it was not exactly an insult. </p><p>“And I missed this,” she whispered before capturing my girth between her lips… I wanted to focus on her body, but I wasn’t exaggerating when I said our closeness would allow me to examine her situation better. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was that the connection I had felt that led to her was not an illusion or a mistake. There was truly a thin connection of Divine Spark connecting her, and the Tree of Life was the other end of the connection. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured, and Seldanna’s gaze found mine even as her head continued to bob. I smiled at her, acting like she was the intended target of my words. </p><p>The true target was the connection itself. It wasn’t a strong connection … nor it was particularly stable. My first thought was that it was poorly made, which wouldn’t have been surprising. </p><p>The proper ability to manipulate the Divine Spark was a rare ability, after all… </p><p>Yet, the more I examined the weak connection, the more I realized my initial assumption was wrong. The connection was not poorly made …  or even actually made artificially in the first place. The more accurate way to define it was to say it was growing organically, no different than a tree. </p><p>However, the growth was very slow, which was why it took a while for me to realize that. I didn’t question why such a connection was growing. It was clearly a ploy from whoever threw Seldanna in this special prison — probably the High Priest. </p><p>Similarly, I wasn’t panicking about the connection itself, not when I could easily snap it off. Yet, I did not. </p><p>Such a connection was not necessarily harmful. Oh, I had no doubt that whatever her captor planned was careful about her safety … but with my constant observation, things were different. </p><p>A sharp hint of pain brought me back to the present. “Pay attention to me,” she warned, leaving teeth mark on my shaft. </p><p>“Someone is pushing her luck,” I answered, my throaty tone putting a smirk on her face.  I smirked back even as I grabbed her waist and pushed her onto her back before crouching between her legs, assaulting her delicious folds with my tongue. </p><p>Circling around her knot, it triggered a rather loud moan, but from the way her legs tightened, I could feel that she was satisfied by the action. “You’re the one that pushed your luck,” I said.  </p><p>She failed to come up with an answer against my satisfied smirk, and soon, it was impossible for her to actually do so, because I let my tongue free, raiding and invading every sensitive spot between her legs, teaching her a new meaning of the pleasure. </p><p>I expected her to retaliate by grabbing my hair, twisting her body, or retaliating in some other way. Yet, she did not, just accepting it passively as I invaded her core with my tongue. She might not be the most experienced lover, but still, there was a certain ego boost in stripping the rebellion from a sexy blonde with a few brushes of my tongue. </p><p>She gasped and moaned as I pushed her steadily toward a climax, so much so that she didn’t even bother to comment as I removed the rest of my clothes, matching her in nudity. She did gasp in shock when I added my fingers to the assault of my tongue, dancing at the entrance aggressively. </p><p>Moans filled the prison as the climax finally hit her, opening her soul even more. While she gasped for breath, I turned my attention to the magical details once more. </p><p>The first thing I noticed, the growth rate of the connection increased several times. Soon, the soft connection turned into a magical root, one that reminded me of the ones the Guardian Trees stretched through the Aether Dimension to gather and convert mana, only stronger, and it started sending tendrils through Seldanna’s Divine Sea. </p><p>My first assumption, it was a method to drain Seldanna of her Divine Spark, one that would strengthen the tree. But that didn’t make much sense, not with the crystals on their possessions. Why bother doing that.  </p><p>Then, I notification popped into my view, showing my first guess was wrong. Diametrically so. </p><p>{+1 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>“Okay, maybe they are not trying to steal her spark,” I  murmured as I examined her soul space, ready to address the problems. I expected her Divine Sea to turn chaotic, as foreign Divine Spark required quite a bit of effort to suppress and absorb. </p><p>However, I expected a weak wind from just a point of Spark … but what I found was a raging storm, threatening to destroy her Divine Sea. Without my help, it would take barely a minute for a point of Spark to destroy her sea. </p><p>It was not about potency … but control. The Divine Spark she received was moving with a deliberate movement, thrashing to destroy her sea. </p><p>I had many ways of resolving that, including purifying that lone point of Spark, but I chose to apply an indirect method. </p><p>{-300 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>{+300 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>The sudden influx of Divine Spark calmed her Divine Sea, preventing a dangerous rapture, and giving me a chance to examine the nature of the connection. The foreign spark continued to rage inside her,  trying to find a way … which gave me the impression that, while it was being controlled,  the intelligence behind it was animalistic rather than sapient. </p><p>Which explained why the connection continued to grow despite my intervention.  I was ready to intervene and reverse it, but it was better to watch without taking action. Divine Spark was a complicated issue, so, the more observation, the better. </p><p>“Is something wrong?” Seldanna whispered suddenly. “I can feel something  weird with my magic … it’s fluctuating.” </p><p>“It’s complicated,” I answered. “They cast some kind of  spell on you, one that’s supposed to drain your power, but I managed to block it.” </p><p>“It doesn’t feel like that’s the end,” she said, worried. </p><p>“Technically, it could be. I could stop the process easily if you want…” </p><p>“I’m guessing there’s a but,” she said, catching on to my implied point. “Why don’t you tell me rather than dawdling?” </p><p>“It’s an opportunity. I can let the process continue and do my best to control it. If it works, you’ll be much stronger.” </p><p>“How much power, and how stronger?” she asked. </p><p>{+1 Nature Spark, Elven Priestess}</p><p>The notification was a warning that I shouldn’t delay the treatment. “A tough question. About the danger, I’m quite confident that I could terminate the process if it goes too badly … and about the power, we’re talking about a significant amount.” </p><p>“How significant,” she asked. </p><p>“Potentially,, enough to make you the strongest person in the capital by a wide margin,” I said. It was a guess, but considering the source of the connection, a pretty safe one. </p><p>She waited for a moment, then her expression solidified. “Do it!”</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 342}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 8000  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 1152}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 372}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Mia was lost in a daze until her newest employee deigned to speak. “Are you ready for the real thing, boss,” he said, his voice making her body tingle, but he spoke again before she could say anything. “Sorry, my dear fiancee?” </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” Mia found herself growling. </p><p>“And, I’m about to push into you,” he declared crassly, though  Mia shouldn’t be surprised considering he was first hired as a janitor. “Assuming you can handle it, of course.” </p><p>Mia was many things, but a coward, she was not. “I can handle anything you can do, little man…” she declared, even though the way his muscles pressed against her worked wonders to remind her just how absurd the statement was. </p><p>He chuckled, and she assumed he was thinking the same. Then, he got rid of his pants, and his shaft … his huge, monstrous shaft landed on her ass, and she realized the true joke. </p><p>His pants were keeping it small, and now freed, the possibility of taking it filled it with fear … or at least, that was what she tried to convince herself that tremble was truly about… </p><p>“One last chance to retreat, my dear fiancee,” he offered, but even as he offered, he was already pulling her panties down. She knew that she should take that offer, but somehow, she did not. </p><p>Even if she was about to be bent over her own desk like she was damned secretary rather than the owner of the business, the one that built an empire from nothing. It was wrong …</p><p>Yet it was right. </p><p>She said nothing as he grabbed her, his hips pushing forward to invade her core slowly, straining her capacity in a way even her toys hadn’t done before … yet, somehow, it was smoother than she expected, showing just how wet she was. </p><p> Despite her feelings of defeat, her body was betraying her. Her nipples were so hard she felt they were going to cut through his skin as he grabbed them, squeezing them like a barbarian. She opened her mouth to warn him, afraid of bruises …</p><p>But only a moan escaped her mouth as he started moving … and drilled inside her. She didn’t want to use that word, but there was no other way to describe the way he fucked her fast … far faster than any of her boyfriends in college, and after, she never had the time to date. </p><p>“You’re handling the foreplay better than I expected,” he whispered, and her eyes widened. </p><p>“What do you mean, foreplay —“ she started to ask, shocked by the way she described the situation. The way he was buried inside her didn’t feel like foreplay. </p><p>Then, he used his strength to raise her, and she understood what he meant when she found herself hanging in the air, with no hope of retaliating as he started to pick up speed, each push touching places that she had never even thought to be possible. </p><p> Floating in the air, she lacked the ability to change the pace as he started to move around her desk. And, expecting that to continue, she found herself stumbling when her leg pressed to the ground. “Something wrong?” she asked, panicked. </p><p>“Nothing wrong, my dear boss, I just thought you would appreciate a better angle,” he chuckled. “It’ll be more fun if you can catch the gaze of any employee that decides to walk in, don’t you think so?” </p><p>“You’re a bastard,” she growled, but that was all she was able to say as she trembled under his assault, her naked body a toy for his touch. Well, not entirely naked, she thought. She was still wearing some outfits that cost more than thousands of dollars … but considering that exorbitant bill was concentrated on beautiful branded shoes she was wearing and nothing else, it was hardly a benefit. </p><p>Mia had always claimed that a pair of beautiful and expensive shoes was all a woman needed to feel strong. </p><p>It didn’t work as well when she had a monster buried in her core, rearranging her insides. </p><p>“I … I need a minute,” she gasped, not expecting him to follow, which was why she was surprised when she found herself leaning against her desk, her body suddenly free of his invasion. She breathed hard, but didn’t try to stand up, aware that, with the way her legs trembling, it would have been a hopeless affair. </p><p>“A minute is too long,” he said, his tone smug. “You have fifteen seconds before I taste your wet pussy again,” he whispered. </p><p>She froze at his commanding tone, but she wasn’t too far gone into the pleasure to miss the irony. Here she was, behind her desk, the symbol of her power, and she was following his orders like a secretary… That was wrong. </p><p>“You think?” he said, and suddenly, she realized she had made the mistake of speaking those words out loud… It was a huge mistake. She froze, afraid of what he would do. Continue to  fuck her … or worse, stop ….</p><p>She didn’t expect him to actually agree. “You’re right,” he said, shocking her. “You’re the boss, you should be the one taking the lead,” he said. </p><p>Her surprise lasted barely a second. He sat down on her seat, and pulled her with her. “Since you’re the boss, why don’t you take the lead and show me just how much of my pathetic cock you can handle.” </p><p>“R-right,” Mia said, then growled with sudden anger. She was not a weakling. She could handle it. With a bout of recklessness, she pushed her hips as hard as she could manage, devouring his cock faster than his earlier ramming. “How about this!” she declared in victory. </p><p>“Not bad, not bad at all,” he said, his moan of satisfaction giving her a hint of victory, a face-saving score at the end of the game… And, the game was not over,  she thought as she shifted her hands on his legs, using the leverage to push even deeper. </p><p>She would make him cum first. She would be the winner… She moved her hips, the time losing its meaning.</p><p>…</p><p>Or not,  she corrected several minutes later — or maybe hours, but she had a feeling she wasn’t that strong — as her body started trembling with another orgasm, her arms losing their strength to hold her up. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t handle that little,” he said, his laugh grating her nerves. “We’re just starting.” </p><p>“S-shut up,” she whispered, lacking the strength to continue. </p><p>“Why don’t you use your beautiful lips to finish me, then,” he reminded her even as he pushed her on her feet, somehow finding time to use her discarded panties as a makeshift tie, and pushing her arms behind her. </p><p>“That’s demeaning,” she growled, looking at his shaft, glistening with her juices. </p><p>“And failing to make me cum after all those orgasms is not,” he answered, and she found herself blushing. She didn’t enjoy being defeated, regardless of the form. </p><p>“Maybe, but at least clean it first—“ she started, and then stopped. She would have loved to argue more … but with his cock filling her mouth, it was impossible. And, it wasn’t like what he said was wrong … </p><p>She owed him at least one climax. She forced her mouth open, working on her new duty … desperately hoping none of her employees had a sudden bright idea that would make them visit her.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I looked at the exhausted state of Aria while the elven spy dragged herself away, I decided to call it a night. Teasing them was fun, but I still had some work to do. </p><p>Like learning where exactly was their base, and how they accessed that. But, that didn’t prevent a jolt of disappointment from passing through me as I left Aria behind in her room, exhausted, tainted, and collapsed in her chair. It took quite a bit of willpower to ignore the temptation to stay back and spend more time with her, but I was afraid the spy would get away, and once she did, it would be hard to follow her. </p><p>Even as I dressed quickly, I cast a subtle tracker on her, one that would only send a weak signal when she used magic, hopefully, her aura hiding it. Not the best method to follow someone, but her impressive magical abilities didn’t leave much range to operate. </p><p>I sighed as I listened to her footsteps getting away, but I didn’t follow her immediately. I focused on establishing an impressive number of wards to dampen my presence despite the risks it contained. The number of wards around me actually reduced my own defensive spell casting … but that was something I had to suffer to follow someone with such a strong magical sensitivity. </p><p>I wouldn’t have dared to do so if it wasn’t for her … distracted mood. She wasn’t paying much attention to her surroundings. Even with it, It was risky to do so, of course, but not as risky as letting my opponents make strategic moves while I sat without doing anything. </p><p>I walked fast, maintaining the dampening wards as I closed in the distance, and soon, discovered my little spy, under some kind of invisibility spell. </p><p>I wondered if she was her brand of exhaustion working, or if she was that poor of a spy and relying just on her magic. Because such invisibility spells never worked well for spying. It hid her from view, but it also left a magic trail behind that could be followed by a determined agent. </p><p>The latter theory, about her incompetence — as a spy, not as a mage —  got stronger as I followed her. Rather than using a secret passage, of which there were many in the palace from servant passages to emergency extraction tunnels, she just walked down to the palace garden. </p><p>Soon, she stood in front of the garden wall, only to temporarily melt the wall rather than using a more mundane method. Once again, the spell itself was near perfect, but also unnecessarily complicated and left a track to follow. </p><p>After she left the palace, following her got harder. She summoned a disk that allowed her to fly, still invisible, and I used her magical presence to track her as I run through the rooftops, pushing my body to the limit as I tried to catch up. </p><p>Soon, she landed on the roof of a mansion neighboring the mage guild — which didn’t surprise me considering I had already discovered links between elves and the mage guild. Though, I still didn’t know whether it was a connection that went quite a bit to the past like the subservient one between the phoenixes and the dark families, or something more recent. </p><p>That question was important, but not immediately so. I started examining the mansion. It was deceptively a defensive location, with tall, magical walls surrounding the garden, and several trees in the garden that was placed carefully to create a kill zone while still looking beautiful. </p><p>I had a guess that it wasn’t my shy spy that had built that. She lacked the sense of practical utility to do so. </p><p>However, the wards that surrounded the building were certainly so. There were several wards, distinct from the walls, perfected to catch any agent that dared to approach the place, or somewhere else. </p><p>It would take a while for me to sneak in. First, I created a small warded location to keep me hidden, right at the roof of the building with a nice view of it that would keep me isolated from outside. </p><p>Breaching the wards was important, but it was not urgent, at least not for the night. I stayed on the roof, slowly trying to understand the nature of the wards, and how could I bypass them. I didn’t know enough about the elven magic to unravel her wards without raising an alarm, but luckily, I didn’t need to. </p><p>Not when her lack of attention worked wonders to give me the opportunity I needed. She had established her wards, but while doing so, she ignored the walls had their own enchantments, and it was clashing. </p><p>And, I didn’t need to know the working principles of her magic to abuse that mistake. Slowly, I shaped my magic into a chisel, softly hitting the breach again and again,  weakening the connection of the impact. </p><p>It was a slow, exhausting task, and it took almost an hour to create a small breach that I could sneak inside … but sneak inside, I did. </p><p>As I entered, I felt a flare of magic in a very close location. My trusty shadows were there to hide me, disappearing from the view in the poorly-lit garden. </p><p>I wasn’t shocked to see it was Emma, leaving the garden, using a sigil to open the gate from inside. I memorized the sigil even as I shook my head in dark amusement. At this point, Emma’s weakness and her tendency to betray were getting amusing.</p><p>I might have intervened,  but luckily, Emma was not as smart as she thought she was,  meaning whenever she tried to betray, she was accidentally creating breaches that  I could leverage instead. All told, she helped more than she harmed … she just did so accidentally. </p><p>As much as I wanted to go and visit my spy,  my presence here was difficult to handle. Instead, I started exploring the downstairs — the lack of additional wards was another mistake — and even magically copied several books on elven magic. </p><p>I doubted that those books were anything important considering there was no protection — and I could feel several additional wards, both for the basement, and for the upper floor — but under my circumstances, basics of elven magic were much more useful. </p><p>Just like the phoenix magic had been. Too bad that it was not intense enough. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have any time to start working on the topic. I heard a voice coming from upstairs. I hid, only to see my cute elven spy walk down the stairs, only a towel around her. </p><p>Rather than taking the risk of dashing away, I moved behind the bookshelf, using the simplest way of hiding myself. Unlike the palace, I didn’t dare to use the shadows, because her mansion wasn’t filled with magic unfamiliar to her.</p><p>Luckily, the ordinary method of hiding worked excellently with her lack of attention. I smiled as I watched her sit on a couch, and started working on the documents I had provided for her. I was happy to note she was just removing them from their envelope, meaning she hadn’t talked to Emma about it. The last thing I needed was that politically-incompetent elementalist poking around. </p><p>With her attention on the documents, I could sneak back to the garden, but I paused when I noticed her shedding her towel, revealing her amazing body, still bruised after my merciless attention, her nipples still hard. “That bastard,’  she muttered as she grabbed her breast, squeezing. Tempted, I cast a spell. It was a weak one, tantric in nature…</p><p>Inflaming her arousal even more, one that would stay in her memories. It worked quickly, resulting in an amazing show, though, that was not my only aim. I wanted her to be distracted as she read the report, in case there was a slight mistake. Though, I certainly didn’t expect her to be horny enough that she stopped reading the documents altogether and conjured a toy for herself. </p><p> I should help, I thought, no matter how much staying and helping sounded tempting…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was just leaving the locker room, having just finished the delivery of a rousing speech that enhanced the team morale — not that it was difficult to do when we were currently leading the game by a wide margin, a few words enough to make their enthusiasm burn. </p><p>We were leading a game that we were supposed to be trailing, and even our quarterback was looking ready to return the game. They were happy. </p><p>I was happy as well, but only a part of it was about the status of the game. I was sure that people would have treated that statement weirdly if I told them — doubly so if they knew what was in line for my victory, in terms of the bet with Coach Juana and the cheerleader outfit — but regardless, that was what I felt. </p><p>The responsible thing, was the line of writing that popped on my face. </p><p>[System Repair - Stage I - Complete]</p><p>“Excellent news,” I murmured as I made a mental call, and my field of vision was filled with other writing. </p><p>[DIVINE SYSTEM I</p><p>Traits: (Divine Body I, Divine Mind I, Divine Aura I)</p><p>Domains: (Lust I, Command I, Athletics I)</p><p>Acolytes: ()</p><p>Intent Pool: 0.2%]</p><p>“Don’t tell me,” I murmured suddenly as I felt the stirrings of panic when I realized I had lost quite a number of abilities. A lot of Traits were simply gone, and the rest had lost several ranks in the process. Just like that, my earlier mood had evaporated. </p><p>I wasn’t panicking, but it was a close thing. I had been relying on my Traits quite a bit, and the sudden loss was not welcome. Rather than going out like I was supposed to, I dashed toward the nearest storage room, and hacked the security camera on the way. </p><p>“Let’s see just how badly I had been weakened,” I said as I turned my attention to a box that weighed around a hundred pounds. Not something I couldn’t lift, even if the shape didn’t allow for easy lift. I didn’t want to rely on the System for my first attempt. </p><p>With a pull, I raised the box up to my head, and achieved that very easily. “Okay, that's weird,” I murmured. I wasn’t surprised by the fact I was able to lift it, but by the ease I was able to do so. The weight might as well not exist. </p><p>Even when my Strength was at stage five, I felt some pressure from such a weight. Curious, I moved to other weights. Two hundred, three hundred, five hundred … a thousand; and most importantly, still easy. “Okay, maybe they didn’t exactly drop,” I murmured as I placed the box that would have required a forklift to move. </p><p>Then, a small discussion I had with my guide, back when in my first chess tournament, drifted into my mind. She had dismissed the benefits of the Traits quite readily, dismissing them as being mere Heroic Traits. And, now, I had the Divine Traits. </p><p>And, my limited experimentation showed that she was not entirely unjustified in dismissing that. I was truly supernatural, above human limits. </p><p>Maybe the name of Divine System was not exactly unjustified. </p><p>Still, further tests were needed. Curious, I opened the code for the hacking program I used for the stadium … only for it to look like the scribbling of a young child. I would have cursed the coder if I didn’t have vivid memories of programming it. </p><p>The level of improvement was flat-out shocking. </p><p>“I wonder how the storage work,” I murmured as I walked back to the stadium, enjoying the cheers as they filled the Intent Pool. It was good that the System had the ability to store Intent, so I didn’t need to always steal from the flow to use my abilities. </p><p>[Intent Pool: 0.4%]</p><p>Though, the Intent Pool wasn’t the biggest challenge I had been dealing with. No, that honor went to something else. </p><p>Domains. Athletics, Command  … and Lust.</p><p>They sounded impressive, but I didn’t know what exactly they were for. I could easily imagine they somehow acting like umbrellas to hold the Traits, but my instincts were telling me that it was not the case. No, that mostly went to my Traits … those domains worked differently. </p><p>I needed to discover how.  </p><p>Luckily, the match was the best opportunity to do so, as I could imagine it falling under the definition of both Athletics and Command. Not the most fun one, of course, that honor went for the bet that I had with Coach Juana, who was looking at me. </p><p>“Any changes for the second half?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing much. I want to see their plan first before taking action,” I added, turning my attention toward the opposing side, reading their lips as they discussed their plans — another benefit of my Divine Traits, as my senses were much stronger. </p><p>They were trying to change the pace of the game with a few tricks plays that would ruin our pace. Too bad it wouldn’t work, especially with both my senses and abilities experiencing such an incredible improvement. </p><p>One such improvement, I caught rather easily. I was able to expand my tactical aura of the whole team easily rather than focusing on a smaller part. Despite their inexperience, my players blocked excellently, creating a path for the kick returner to escape easily, bringing us to the fifty-yard mark. </p><p>“Not a bad start, right,” I said as I looked at Coach Juana, smiling. She looked excited at first, but it soon left its place to a deep blush, remembering what was on the line. </p><p>“Marcus, be ready for a tough second half,” I warned as the offensive team took the field, along with the backup quarterback while Arthur watched from the side, still not in full form. “They’ll be hitting you a lot.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I can handle it. I’m still fresh,” he bragged, unaware of the magical reasons for his strength. With a chuckle, I gestured him to take the field … and from the side, started a long, laborious rush to get our point. Shallow passes, interior runs, and other tactics pitted our team against theirs in the most physical way possible. </p><p>It took more than eight minutes to conquer the field once more, but we got stuck around the ten-yard line. Still, a kick gave us three points, which was enough for us to maintain our lead, bringing the game to the score of seventeen-three. </p><p>Their next attack worked better, but mostly because I didn’t want to push myself using my new abilities too much. With the match under control, I wanted to reduce the suspicion of any possible observer. I maintained a loose coordination aura … which came with a timely sack, forcing them to kick as well. </p><p>“Coach, I can play,” Arthur said, and I decided to allow him. Their defense expected some more runs, and was unprepared for the long passes — a mistake that cost them a big pass, costing them a fifty-yard chunk when Arthur suddenly threw a deep pass to Marcus, giving us another touchdown as the third quarter was about to end. </p><p>The gap in score was demoralizing for our opponents. With their growing exhaustion, the mistakes started. They threw two interceptions, one of which we managed to convert into a touchdown. They managed to score with a desperate hail mary as well, but it was too little, too late. </p><p>The game ended. Thirty-one to eleven. </p><p>An incredible victory, the cheers breaking through the stadium. Interestingly, even as they cheered explosively, the intent pool didn’t get filled as much as I expected. And, since I could feel the intensity of the Intent that was generated, it was more about the capacity of the pool. </p><p>[Intent Pool: 23.5%]</p><p>“Great game, boys,” I cheered as I went to the locker room, where the team was celebrating in shock. The last thing they expected was to win, especially in such a decisive manner, and the results spoke for themselves. </p><p>“Coach, coach, coach!” they cheered, taking me to their shoulder, aware of just how much of a role I had played in the victory. I let them do so. </p><p>When they finally let me down, Marcus walked to me. “Will you visit the den for the celebration?” he asked. “We have some fun things in mind.” </p><p>I patted his shoulder. “Don’t worry, just go and have fun. I have my own  celebration party to attend to.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>I left the questions about the chaotic nature of the Tree of Life behind as I climbed the stairs, once again disguised as a servant. Their habit of using Chosen as  Servants might be wasteful, but it was beneficial for my purposes. </p><p>It gave me an excuse to surround myself with nature mana, creating an outer shell that would hide any illusion I might need to cast underneath. With that assistance, I picked a faster pace, climbing the stairs. </p><p>Seldanna finally stopped moving, suggesting she was finally imprisoned. I needed to make sure she wasn’t suffering from any kind of problem. The connection didn’t show her distress increasing, but better safe than sorry. </p><p>Even with all my advantages, an hour later, I was still searching for her, unable to find her. My ability to sense her was distorted, which was an achievement.  </p><p>Even more interestingly, I could see several elves discreetly running around, their discussion implying panic. Curious, I slid closer, listening to their discussion. “Any clues in the cell?” one asked. </p><p>“Not yet. Not even our best magical tracker could find her. She somehow disappeared from existence. No mana presence, no life energy, nothing,” the other answered. </p><p>“We need to find her. The prince already relayed his intentions to speak with her. I don’t want to tell him that I failed him … not in such a critical time.” </p><p>The first one sighed. “Why does he want to talk with a savage in such a time in the first place? I thought we had bigger worries.” </p><p>“I don’t know, and I’m not stupid enough to ask such questions,” the second one said. “Why don’t you take that as a lesson and focus on searching, so you don’t get demoted for losing the savage that the prince needs.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought as I listened to their discussion about the disappearance of the prisoner. It wasn’t hard to guess that they were talking about Seldanna, though. From their whispered discussions, I could hear that Prince Arun suddenly developed an interest in her…</p><p>My guess, it was about the report about the God Forest. Probably they realized something extraordinary, and they probably linked it to the Eternals … or, as they knew, the mysterious merchants. </p><p>Either way, they might send another force to that. I used the connection to send an order to the trees, and the whole forest used nature mana to turn into treants, and started moving. I ordered them to join the tribal elves, before starting to migrate — with orders to take any other elven tribe they had seen with him and move to the inner parts of the plane. </p><p>Hopefully, their numbers would allow them to absorb the other tribes without Seldanna’s assistance. Though, even if they failed, the moving forest should be enough to confuse the Prince … and whoever was responsible for making Seldanna disappear. </p><p>I watched the soldiers search Seldanna for a while, only for them to fail. They had been using many mundane and magical means, but none worked. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t rely on just mana. I used Divine Spark to create a path between me and Seldanna, tracing it toward the prison. To my surprise, even that didn’t work as smoothly as I hoped, giving an accurate read only when I managed to get a lucky break, and got closer to the entrance of her new prison. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured as I realized the entrance of the prison was actually carved into the Tree of Life itself, which, from everything I had seen, was a heretical behavior for Elves. Though, while heretical, it was extremely useful. The chaotic dance of mana worked excellently to hide anything inside the prison, to the point that they didn’t even assign any guards, trusting the tree to keep the intruders away. </p><p>And, not for a wasteful reason. The secret path was actually filled with the same chaotic flow I felt earlier, threatening to erode me. It would have been scary if I didn’t experience much worse when I first arrived. </p><p>The elves weren’t traversing the chaos every time they walked, of course. On the wooden walls of the tunnel, I could see many etched wards, capable of temporarily protecting the tunnel. However, activating those would mean alerting the others. </p><p>Luckily, as a constant source of Nature mana, I could easily merge with the dance of nature mana, and the occasional Sparks that I collided with were easily dealt with. </p><p>{+4 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>My objective was not to drain the Divine Spark, but I wasn’t going to bother trying to avoid every single scrap when absorbing was easier. And, it didn’t even harm the tree, as the floating crystallized pieces were clearly harmful to its general health. </p><p>And, the deeper I moved, the more I started to feel that the assistance was necessary. I was not in very deep compared to the general thickness of the tree, but still, I could feel something was wrong… I didn’t have any direct evidence … just a general feeling. </p><p>Before I could analyze that, I came across a door. barely a few hundred feet deep. Unlike the tunnel, the room was protected by active wards, ignoring the storm of mana that raged around. The wards were strong … but with my enhanced stats, barely enough to delay me for more than a second. </p><p>I found Seldanna alone, worried. “You —“ she gasped as she turned. “You’re here!” </p><p>A wave, and the chains that were holding her fall apart. She dashed forward immediately, hugging me. “Don’t worry, sweetie, I’m here,” I said, patting her back to calm her down, her arms tight around me. </p><p>I wasn’t in a hurry to make her move, as we were in the safest location. The one that imprisoned her here was confident that it was impossible to find the location, and ignored other disadvantages. </p><p>Including the fact that they couldn’t observe the location. </p><p>I felt safe, as even if they walked in, they wouldn’t send a big force, and I would have the absolute advantage. Worst came to worst, I could try to drain the tree of Divine Spark to get stronger. It would be risky, as I could feel the tree was already giving me a bad feeling, but it was not a concern I would take if I suddenly faced a deadly situation. </p><p>I hugged her for a while, letting her calm down, until I spoke. “Now, why don’t you tell me what happened since you arrived?” </p><p>“Really? Shouldn’t we escape first?” she said. </p><p>“No,” I answered as I waved my hand. “Believe me, this place is much safer than anywhere else we can find in the capital. And, since we’re here, we shouldn’t waste the opportunity to look around a bit.” </p><p>She looked doubtful, but she still said. “If you think that’s for the best,” she whispered.</p><p>I chuckled as I waved my hand, and a chair appeared in the otherwise empty room. I sat down, and pulled her down to my knee. She continued hugging, not wanting to avoid the proximity. “Now, tell me what happened since your arrival,” I said. </p><p>“That was confusing. First, some kind of commander tried to question me about the forest and how it suddenly managed to appear, and didn’t believe me when I explained it. He kept asking about a group of merchants,” she said, looking at me at this point. </p><p>“I know who they are asking about, but I’m not one of them,” I explained quickly. “The merchants are the ones that are supporting the undead. I discovered it very recently as well.”  </p><p>She nodded, blushing slightly as she questioned me, but I let it slide. She had her concerns, viable ones. “Then, they mentioned one of their useless princes, and left me in my cell…” </p><p>“Not this one, right?” </p><p>“No,” she answered. “I was suddenly attacked by a magical rush, and I was immobilized. Then, a robed old man appeared, and for some reason, asked me which god I was working for, and why I was betraying them.” She stopped, snarling in anger. “Like I owe those smug entitled monsters any kind of loyalty in the first place.” </p><p>“Any idea why he asked you that?” I asked. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she said. “He just used some kind of crystal on me, and based on the results, he started questioning.” In other words, he tried to drain her Divine Spark, but the amount of spark she had was the same. So, either he failed to drain, or stopped halfway intentionally. Either way, the mysterious interrogator — probably the high priest — used the crystal to assess the state of her Divine Spark, only to realize it was somewhere between Demigod and God — though the exact nature of the latter was still a mystery for me. </p><p>“Then, what happened?” I murmured as I found myself frowning. I suddenly felt a flicker, another line of Divine Spark connection establishing with her. It was soft, vague, and impossible to notice if she hadn’t been sitting on my lap. </p><p>“He mentioned something about sacrifices, forced me to eat some kind of fruit, and dragged me here. I was afraid of being poisoned, but I don’t feel anything like that,” she explained. </p><p>“I don’t know what it was, but I’m sure it wasn’t poison. I suspect it’s something much more interesting,” I murmured, letting my smile widen. “I think I need to check it carefully, without anything to intervene,” I said. </p><p>And pulled off her robe. </p><p>“H-here,” she stammered, shocked, not expecting.

    "content": "<p>“Fascinating…” </p><p>That was the word that escaped my mouth as I scaled a mountain while my mission was to follow Seldanna and her escort closely — to make sure they didn’t have another traitor that might decide to freelance for personal benefit. I knew I was close to the capital, so, finding a city when I climbed over a mountain hadn’t been surprising. </p><p>The nature of the capital, however, was very much a surprise. </p><p>At first glimpse, I found myself thinking that I had just come across an ordinary meadow, a large tree, surrounded by some shrubbery. But with my senses, it took a second to realize it was just a scaling error. The city was far more distant than I realized, and what I took for shrubbery was trees. Huge, intimidating trees that on average, taller than a mile… There were thousands of such trees covering the huge plain, with houses on the branches…</p><p>Then, there was the tree at the center. Tree of Life. </p><p>I would have said a huge tree, but that would have underrated it to a criminal degree. No, huge were the trees that surrounded it, most taller than a mile, with houses on their branches. </p><p>The wooden titan at the center made them look like shrubbery, almost fifteen miles tall, its branches cutting through the clouds and touching the sky — and that was not an exaggeration. Enhancing my senses with magic, I could see that the branches were actually touching the planar border.</p><p>It was not hard to assume that it was responsible for providing most of the mana that was responsible for maintaining the constant cyclone of mana that protected the plane from the ravages of the primordial aether. </p><p>Fascinating, I thought even as I flexed my magic to create another hideout, this time smaller, with a beacon but with little defense. Here, the nature mana was much denser, and I didn’t want the risk of getting caught.  The stronger the defenses, the easier for it to be detected. </p><p>That also went for my disguise attempt. If it wasn’t for the hundreds of elves entering and leaving the cover of the trees — both by flying and by walking — I might even have abandoned my mission and just saved Seldanna before she arrived in the capital. </p><p>Instead, I sent her a subtle magical message saying that I was about to enter the city along with her, and that she shouldn’t worry too much. </p><p>Creating an outfit for myself based on the elves that were entering the capital didn’t take long. I based my outfit the way their civilians — or, what I assumed to be civilians, walking around with no visible weapons — before I climbed down the mountain, dashing while concealed in magic, slowing down only when I got closer to the city. </p><p>I should be able to teleport to Seldanna in an emergency, but it was better to have alternative paths in case of an emergency. </p><p>Yet, even as I passed through the first line of trees, consisting of the smaller ones that were merely around a thousand feet tall, a smile found my face. In a world under the siege of the undead, I wouldn’t have thought I could find a peaceful neighborhood like this. </p><p>Unlike their tribal counterparts, the elves in the capital moved with a very distinct lack of hurry that I had only seen the noble scions back in the main material plane. Not that I blamed them — much — as the streets were not only lined with huge magical trees that constantly radiated nature mana, but also with huge treants that were slumbering under the trees, with huge weapons made of wood and silver next to them, ready to act. </p><p>One thing was certain, the security here was not a joke. </p><p>Pity it was completely geared for defense, and wouldn’t matter once the undead covered the rest of the land. </p><p>I ignored the greatness of their strategic mistake as I moved deeper into the capital. The inner parts were richer, both in mana, and in material wealth — evidenced by the decoration and the way the elves were dressed. </p><p>Also in security. I had to change disguises three times, and used the underground tunnel trick twice before I could even take a step into the inner city. </p><p>There, I could see that the trunks of the trees were decorated with silver, gold, gemstones, and other precious materials, enough to equip an army with top-tier weapons. It wasn’t to say that they were completely useless, as they enhanced the magical potential of the guardian trees somewhat; but from any practical perspective, the effort was not aligned with the final impact. </p><p>Arrogant. </p><p>As I pushed my way through another security point, this time manned by some serious figures that were decked in the same kind of armor that was worn by the commander of the strike force, disguised as a servant — and didn’t that awaken some nostalgic memories — when I finally left the trees behind. </p><p>All but one. </p><p>At the innermost circle, there was no tree but the Tree of Life. The shadow it cast underneath, and the roots that no doubt dug deep and wide, left no chance of survival — especially if my guess about its astral presence was at least partially correct. </p><p>Without the numerous trees to be hidden, sneaking into the tree was much more difficult. Luckily, the lack of trees didn’t mean the lack of plant life. The place was filled with all kinds of smaller plants, shrubbery, flowers, and tall grass. </p><p>And, to my convenience, maintained by an army of servants. </p><p>It was another sign of decadence that every single servant had some Divine Spark inside them. They were firmly in the Chosen territory, with Spark fully crystalized, but even a careless observation put their potential around ten points on my measurement scale. </p><p>A great waste, as the mages of the tribes weren’t as strong … and even the soldiers that were sent to the border weren’t as uniformly strong.</p><p>The signs of decadence were getting even more obvious, to the point of getting blinding. They were fighting a war that probably risked all their lives, yet they had the luxury of letting their mages work as gardeners without worry. </p><p>I sat in the tall grass, pulling nature mana to hide as I continued to observe, trying to see maybe I was missing something, that their gardening had a bigger importance … but no, it was just gardening, to make sure everything was perfect. </p><p>It looked perfect. Not only every single blade of grass gave a wild yet cultivated look, but also their magical presence was the healthiest I had ever felt. </p><p>I rolled my eyes as I took a step further, walking around the perimeter to find a safe path toward the tree. Just like the other houses, the titanic tree had many buildings located on its trunk, connected with bridges of wood and crystal — another beautiful yet excessive display of decoration — and I just needed to find a path for myself. </p><p>That proved to be more challenging, as the elves that had the right to step there preferred flying rather than walking, but the presence of the bridges convinced me otherwise. And, by juggling between a servant and a soldier outfit, I finally managed to find a bridge that was unattended by the soldiers, ready to climb. </p><p>But, before doing so, I put my hand on the trunk of the Tree of Life. I remembered the traitor admitting that other traitors stealing Divine Spark, and I wanted to examine it. I was careful in my probing, sending a slow and steady tendril to breach the outer layer … the only problem, it didn’t work as well as I had hoped. </p><p>Inside the tree was a veritable storm of mana and Divine Spark. Not the most confusing or intimidating storm — as I swam in Primordial Aether, which had been a much scarier experience. The Tree of Life reminded me of my own God Forest somewhat, but the nature of it was much more chaotic. </p><p>My guess, it was having trouble absorbing the constant new Divine Spark generated by the elves that surrounded it, locking it in a weird state. It prevented the tree from having any kind of sentience… </p><p>But also, it was enough to block my measurement capabilities to a significant degree. There were ways to bypass that, a few wards to support my sensing capabilities while sending a stronger probe would give me what I needed … Too bad it would also ruin my disguise. </p><p>I needed to find another way. Luckily, the spy revealed that the other traitors had been using the acorns to steal divine spark, and there was no way for them to succeed with the current level of protection. Meaning, there were spots with weaker natural resistance </p><p>I was already pushing my luck, and I didn’t want to get caught worse. </p><p>With a sigh, I started climbing the stairs, toward where I could feel Seldanna’s presence. </p><p>I had a beautiful elven priestess to save.</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 338}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 8000  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 1452}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As Irene stood behind Ida, the rest of the group looked at us as well, looking at me. I might have blushed … but I didn’t, instead catching Irene’s gaze. </p><p>“It’s hardly her fault, sweetie. I remember your horrible attempts to hide the fact that I had slipped inside while we were together. I’m sure the photographs look amazing.”  </p><p>Naomi laughed. “Photographs, really?” she looked at the blushing Irene. “It’s always the ones that you least expect.” </p><p>“Ain’t that the truth,” I said, though even as I said that, I continued to pump into Ida’s tightness. Though, I wasn’t just agreeing with Naomi about Irene. It was true for all of them, each surprising me in their own way. </p><p>Their nerdy facade hid truly horny surprises — as shown by the fact that, even as Naomi tried to tease Irene about being slutty, she was twisting Sarah’s nipple for punishment.</p><p>“S-shut up, it was an accident,” Irene said as I put my hands on her hips and pulled her closer, capturing her lips in a kiss, silencing her — even as Ida’s hips did her best to make me die of pleasure. </p><p>“Really, an accident?” Naomi asked, and I decided to let Irene answer. I stopped kissing her, but I didn’t let her go. I just let my lips drift down to her amazing tits, teasing her nipples. </p><p>“Yes, an accident. We were doing a photoshoot … and my costume had a little malfunction.” </p><p>“Which costume?” Naomi asked. Irene didn’t answer, which made Naomi smirk. “Don’t tell me you wore the gladiator costume!” she gasped. “No wonder you ended up putting out on the first date… That costume might as well not exist.” </p><p>“I … shut up,” Irene gasped, though the moan that followed might as well be my bite. </p><p>“You’re one to talk,” Sarah countered. “With the way you were throwing yourself at him…” Sarah cut in. </p><p>“But that was not enough to stop you from interfering, you controlling bitch,”  Naomi said to Sarah as she twisted her nipples, silencing her. Carrie still teased her from the other side, her smile the brightest I had ever seen her. </p><p>Amazing show… But I turned my attention to Irene. “You  know that what happened wasn’t an accident, right?” I asked with a chuckle. “This little cutie was aware of what was going on all along, even teasing my balls when she was behind us.” </p><p>“T-that’s true,” Irene said, trying to sound angry, only to moan when I spanked her ass. </p><p>“Don’t act like you didn’t know what was going on. In that costume, you might as well just arrived naked … no, even that wouldn’t have worked as beautifully,” I answered, and she blushed. </p><p>“Maybe, but still, it doesn’t make it—“ she tried to say, but I interrupted her again. This time, pushing her lips toward Ida, forcing a kiss. </p><p>“Just make peace,” I said, chuckling even as I slipped my fingers into her core … my shaft still in Ida, banging mercilessly. It was a fascinating dance. </p><p>Under attack from both sides, it didn’t take long for Ida to climax explosively. Under different circumstances, I might have held her hips and kept her in place, but today, I was feeling merciful. </p><p>I looked at the four naked horny girls still waiting their turn … yes, I was feeling merciful, and nothing else. </p><p>As Ida took a step back … and promptly collapsed on the carpet, I grabbed Irene’s hips and pulled her down, the sudden change of pace enough to earn a moan from her. And, unlike Ida, she was facing the others… </p><p>“Damn, girl, you’re taking it like a true champion,” Carrie moaned as she watched the view with passion, her fingers still torturing Sarah. And, she was. Already wet from the extended foreplay, it slid easily. </p><p> And, I used that to my advantage, invading her mercilessly, each push exploding in the room even as my hands landed on her tits. “Let’s keep those babies in place,” I whispered. </p><p>“No, let them dance,” Carrie commented, who was watching the show with great enthusiasm. I would have been shocked at the intensity of arousal in her tone, but considering she had already pulled Sarah’s head down, getting a tongue treatment, that was not a big mystery. </p><p>Not that Sarah was complaining, especially since Naomi was behind her, with her fingers invading her core again and again, in a twisted version of a double-team. </p><p>“As you wish, my Queen,” I answered mockingly as I stopped teasing Irene’s nipples. She did not complain, far too captured by the swirling circles I was drawing as I moved down her body, caressing her stomach. </p><p>The teasing sensation was driving her wild with lust, reflected in her desperate cries. The pure, sexual moment was clearly too much for her as well, even more than our rather twisted first time… </p><p>Her screams of pleasure were music to my ears. She writhed uncontrollably in my lap, her core squeezing to extract my seed, her moans incoherent as she chanted for me to continue going. </p><p>Not a hard order to fulfill. </p><p>All the while, her hips tried to dip even lower, threatening to break my legs… Though, when she grabbed my leg, I expected it to be for balance, and didn’t expect fingernails to claw my skin. </p><p>“Damn, girl, you can’t be trusted,” I said as I hooked my arms under her legs and stood up, easily lifting her, still inside her. </p><p>“C-careful,” she gasped. </p><p>“Don’t worry, honey. You can trust your barbarian king,” I said as I increased my pace even more, walking closer to the others … though, as I did so, I made a mistake that a quarterback shouldn’t do under any circumstances, and lost track of one of my opponents. </p><p>Ida.  </p><p>I realized that when the flash went off, capturing a candid view of the hardcore show we had been doing. “Try to keep your mouth closed, Irene.  You look like a whore…” </p><p>“I don’t think … she has a choice in that matter,” Naomi commented while Irene covered her face with her hands, overwhelmed by the sudden reversal, once again under Ida’s camera. </p><p>“At least she could make sure she doesn’t look like a cheap whore,” Ida answered with a sharp smirk, her alter ego once again in play. </p><p>I felt a lightning bolt of pure pleasure shoot through me as Irene tightened around me at her words. “I’m not cheap,” she gasped, but the way her hips quickened after the insult showed she was having mixed feelings over it. </p><p>An amazing show indeed… </p><p>Ida took another photo once Irene looked at her, giving her a better pose. My shaft was throbbing hard, close to the explosion, while Irene’s moans doing an excellent impression of a porn star while her tits jumped with every push. </p><p>A masterful performance.</p><p>Too bad it didn’t take long. Soon, Irene tightened even more, while her weight suddenly lost its tautness, giving all the signs of a spectacular climax. </p><p>And there, I made my first miscalculation. I expected to last longer … but the show was taking its toll on me, and her climax was simply too tight. </p><p>I filled her. </p><p>She shivered as I did so, trembling helplessly. I could have pulled out hurriedly, but luckily, Ida was to the rescue. “Don’t worry, she’s on the pill,” she said, removing the worry of filling her to the brim… </p><p>I kept her in place even as my seed dripped down, Ida dancing around us like a bee as she took many pictures. Considering she was naked during the show — not to mention all the other aspects of the show I was enjoying, I returned to life rather easily. </p><p>I could have discarded Irene to rest, but I decided to have some more fun. I closed the distance between me and Carrie, and placed Irene on her shoulders, her pussy pressing against Carrie’s lips… </p><p>“Just as you like it, fresh,” I said with a chuckle as Carrie started working on Irene, and I turned my attention to Naomi, who was already on her feet, ready to steal her turn…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“I’ll kill you,” Mia gasped the moment the door was closed, jumping to her feet. “Actually, no, I’m not going to kill you. I’m going to torture you first, until you beg for death.” As she declared her anger, she wished that she wasn’t trying to keep her tits hidden with  one arm. It damaged her authority significantly. </p><p>Maybe it was why he looked amused rather than scared. </p><p>“Take my words seriously, you stupid janitor,” Mia gasped, and when his smirk was erased, replaced by an angry expression, she thought herself scored a win. </p><p>“Is that the way to speak to your fiancee, when you were enjoying my cock just a second ago,” he countered, and just like that, any satisfaction she had was erased. </p><p>“Get the fuck out of my office,” she gasped. “Or I’ll make you wish you are dead.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” he answered, his voice grating her for some reason. She didn’t like just how confident he was as he leaned forward … she felt her power disappear just a bit as she fixed her pose, trying to keep her tits covered. “So,  you would be happy if I turn and leave.” </p><p>“Of course,” she answered, trying to sound more confident than she was feeling. A part of that lack of confidence was the monster in his pants, almost pressing against her leg — and worse, she wished to move just a bit closer to feel that. </p><p>She watched as he bend over a bit more. “So, you don’t care about that big client and all the money she’ll bring.” </p><p>That caught Mia flatfooted. “What do you mean.” </p><p>“What I mean, if I leave that door without you apologizing to me for your hurtful words, I won’t play along with your little scheme. Have fun explaining to her why your loving fiancee suddenly dumped you.” </p><p>Mia froze. It had been a while since anyone … let alone a lowly janitor, dared to threaten her. “You can never do that!” she declared, feeling confident. She was the boss. Who did he think he was… </p><p>“Really, watch closely then,” he said. And just like that, he pulled back, so fast that her mind didn't even have time to register the consequences of his declaration when he was already halfway. </p><p>“Stop!” she ordered, shocked at his reaction. </p><p>He did not, continuing to walk toward the door. </p><p>“Stop, I order you!” she gasped. He ignored. “Please, stop,” she gasped, raising her arm. She might have even rushed forward to stop him, but her legs were trembling at the realization. She was about to lose her biggest account, one that she had been working for more than a year, for a moment of arrogance. </p><p>Big mistake. </p><p>She remembered his words. “I’m sorry for insulting you, Darion. Please, stop!” she shouted once more. That arrested his movement, and instead, he leaned against the door. </p><p>A reminder of just how close she got to ruin everything. </p><p>“A good start. But I can do with hearing what exactly you are sorry for,” he said. </p><p>“D-don’t push it—“ she started, only for his expression to turn stormy. “N-no, I’m sorry for being an arrogant bitch,” she gasped hurriedly. </p><p>“Good, all that remains is to earn your forgiveness,” he answered. </p><p>“H-how about another three months of bonus,” she offered with a small voice, one that she was sure that it would be rejected. </p><p>“No, honey,” he answered, his voice making her heart beat faster. “How about apologizing me like a fiancee would. After all, we need to practice for your great heist, right?” </p><p>Mia froze, realizing what he was asking for. She was about to reject that, as no money was worthy of debasing her … but a memory stopped her from verbalizing that. A recent memory, where she had been on his lap right in front of his lap… Which was as pleasurable as it had been humiliating… </p><p>Was that wrong to take him on his offer, Mia suddenly found herself thinking. After all, she was the boss, and he was the employee. There was no insult there. She was the one taking advantage of him… </p><p>“I’m leaving if we’re going to stand here all day,” he warned. </p><p>Mia never felt this insulted in her life … which was why she found it mysterious when her decided to rebel and drop her jacket down. She turned her back to hide herself, but she doubted it was particularly effective with the angle she chose — and if she worked hard, she might even convince herself that it was not intentional. </p><p>“Good, now show me,” he said, and she turned to face him, but the feeling of shame managed to win this time, and she covered her chest with her arms…</p><p>“Better,” he said throatily, his frown turning into a smile that somehow stole all her strength. She had never felt such sensations, though, if she  was being honest, the memory of the monster underneath her did most of the job. </p><p>More than one of her college friends blamed her for being a size Queen, after all. </p><p> She dropped her arms before she could realize what she was doing, even giving him  a shy look, like he was actually her fiancee. </p><p>“A good start, now, show me your other  assets. Lean against the desk. I need to see if my fiancee has the booty to make it worth it,” he declared. Mia felt her face blush. She had never been insulted this much. “Drop the pants,” he added. </p><p>No, she corrected. She hadn’t been insulted this much … and she had a feeling it wasn’t the only record she would broke today… She got rid of them quickly before taking the same pose — but not neglecting to put on her pumps back on —  glad that she had picked something interesting to wear today. </p><p>Not the most impressive color, but fancy enough, and transparency certainly helped to put her ass to best of light… And, her ass certainly needed all the help. </p><p>“Not bad,” he murmured, his footsteps getting closer. </p><p>“I’m glad to bring you satisfaction,” she bit back, though her voice was less sarcastic than she hoped to sound… The way her core was burning in anticipation made it hard to sound sarcastic. </p><p>“Good, now, let’s enjoy the goods,” he said, once again crass. Intentionally so, she realized, but that realization was less shocking than the daring way he grabbed her tits in the middle of the office. He was certainly impatient. </p><p>Still, she wasn’t prepared for the feelings that overwhelmed her when he grabbed her tits and mauling them like a barbarian. But at least, that position allowed  her to look away, which allowed her to maintain a semblance of control.  </p><p>She was certainly not prepared for him to suddenly force her to turn, and end up sharing a gaze. She wanted to avoid it, but somehow, his gaze managed to enchant hers, forcing her to get locked at their dark depths… </p><p>He was a dangerous man … a dangerous man that was busy mauling her ass like he owned her, treating her like a cheap whore. </p><p>Worse, she was unable to say anything. For a moment she thought that she would be able to gather the necessary drive to push him away … but right at then, he chose to got rid of his shirt. And, his muscles, his dark, knotted, impressive muscles that she had never seen anywhere but magazines, made that drive evaporate. </p><p>At that moment, she realized she had never been with a true man … and the prospect of finally being with one didn’t feel too terrible.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Now, before we start the meeting…” Mia murmured as she looked at her newest employee, unable to prevent herself from shuffling in discomfort even as they left the garage behind. After all, the favor she was about to ask was not a comfortable one. </p><p>She was nervous, which was not a usual emotion for her.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t have time to waste,” he said, his smirk deep enough to annoy her. </p><p>She wanted to explode in anger, which was the usual way she dealt with uppity employees, but this time, she had to choose a different path. The nature of the emergency favor she had to ask left no chance otherwise. “We need to talk about the meeting first,” she said. “If you can handle it correctly, you’ll earn yourself two months of salary as a bonus … no, three months,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, it must be something illegal,” Darion said, his smirk beginning to annoy her. </p><p>“No, just a little misdirection,” Mia answered immediately. “I just received a surprise visit from one of the biggest clients of the city but … she’s  a bit peculiar.” </p><p>His smirk got even bigger. “Let me guess. You want me to seduce her. I have to tell you, it won’t work. As much as I want to make my … boss happy, I have standards.” </p><p>Mia didn’t like his tone. She liked the way his gaze danced on her even less. “No, that’s not it,” she started, but then, she paused. After all, it was more or less what she wanted. “Not exactly at least.” He didn’t say anything, and Mia explained hurriedly. “Madam Presley has some unique tastes,” she admitted. </p><p>“That’s strike two, boss,” he said, and Mia bristled once again, annoyed that she didn’t have the chance to truly break him into obedience. Her other employees could never dare to talk back to her like this. </p><p>“Not like that,” she admitted. “She likes to … steal what others have.” </p><p>“Oh, so I’m going to play your boyfriend.” </p><p>“Fiancee, actually,” Mia admitted. “I have mentioned that I have a fiancee, and she wants to meet with him.” </p><p>“Oh, naughty. As long as she’s beautiful, I have no problems with that boss. I’m a very willing worker.” </p><p>“I can imagine,” Mia answered tersely. “Just keep your mouth and act as a fiancee would, and a quick meeting later, you’ll have your bonus.” </p><p>She stood at the entrance of her office, looking at the huge doors she had designed to intimidate visitors, for once feeling the receiving end. She took a deep breath, trying to suppress her panic. </p><p>The sudden arm, wrapping around her shoulders didn’t help. “What are you doing?” she gasped. </p><p>“Making sure we look like newly engaged, of course. A little PDA would help sell it. Don’t tell me you can’t handle it.” </p><p>“Of course, I can handle it, you oaf. Just keep your role in mind!” she warned, and opened the door. </p><p>She found Madam Presley sitting on her seat, which annoyed her, but she did her best to ignore it. After all, she already knew her habit of stealing what others had, and her seat was what she wanted to start. </p><p>Just as she was about to take a step forward, Darion spoke. “I have to admit, she’s a pretty tasty piece of ass. I might even give you a discount.” </p><p>“Act like —“ Mia started, only to freeze when she felt his hand going where it wasn’t supposed to do. “What are you doing?” she whispered, trying to act normal. </p><p>“Acting like your fiancee, of course,” he said as he pushed her forward, closing the door behind them. His fingers delved deep into her ass aggressively. She barely kept down a desire to kill him. The smile on the face of her slutty client was the only thing that kept her down. </p><p>“Honey, maybe you should try to keep it down. We don’t want to disrespect dear Madam, right?” she said loudly. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it,” Madam Presley answered. “It’s always good to see young lovers acting their love. Feel free to act how you want.” </p><p>“You see, honey, she’s happy for a freshly engaged couple,” Darion said, fueling her anger further. </p><p>Mia let out a fake giggle as she turned her back to her client and looked at Darion. “Act normal, or I kill you,” she whispered as she threw him the most annoyed glance she could muster, unhappy with just how much he was taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>Unfortunately, as she said so, she could see his patience draining. She just made a mistake. “Either play along or tell her the truth,” he whispered back, his voice sharp enough to make her shiver in fear. </p><p>“How lovely,” Madam Presley said, and Mia decided to play along. The sale was too important, and more importantly, there was a limit to what her new employee could do next to a client. He had to have a limit. Unfortunately, as she turned toward the desk, his fingers found her ass once more, squeezing even harder. She was sure there were at least a few red welts there. </p><p>“So, we need to discuss our deal. I’m thinking a national campaign, one that’ll last at least three months,” she started, and Mia found herself a genuine smile. A national campaign meant hundreds of thousands at a minimum, likely millions; and it would bring a lot of new clients as well. </p><p>She couldn’t miss that deal. </p><p>“Something we can handle,  easily,” Mia answered, doing her best to ignore his fingers as she tried to come up with the best pitch to convince her. </p><p>“Maybe we should take a seat while talking,” Darion cut them off. </p><p>“Good idea, honey,” Mia asked, ignoring the sudden desire to stab him. But sitting down would be nice. At least, she would get rid of his fingers on her ass. </p><p>Yet, just as she tried to move toward the empty seat, she felt his grip tighten, and before she could react, she found herself on his lap!</p><p>“Honey, you’re being too disrespectful to our important client,” Mia said, her words sharp and merciless. She would kill him for taking liberties with her to this degree. </p><p>Worst, she was about to lose her client! </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s good to see young love flourish,” Madam Presley said. “It makes me trust you more, actually. A marketer should be in touch with her feeling.” </p><p>“You see, my love. Let’s get in touch with your feelings,” he said as he changed her position, and she found herself with her jacket half open, and with his shaft buried right into her crack. “And, like this, you can talk with her easily, right?” </p><p>“Excellent idea, young man,” her client commented before she could say anything. Mia had to swallow as she saw her smirk. She was clearly taking their move as a show of their love, which probably made her eventual victory even tastier. </p><p>At least she believed her, Mia repeated, trying to ignore her humiliation. A humiliation that got more intense as his grip tightened around her legs and make her move back and forth, simulating a lap dance. “You’re very skilled, honey,” he whispered, which made her tremble even worse. Anger … and if she had to admit, also arousal. </p><p>Such a terrible situation, she thought repeatedly for the next ten minutes, doing her best to deliver the outline of a national campaign, ignoring the monster under her. </p><p>“An excellent summary, I think you got the job,” Madam Presley said as she stood up. </p><p>Mia gave her a genuine smile. “Really!” </p><p>“Yes,” she said as she walked closer, and leaned forward. “Of course, we need to sign the contract, but no need to make that a boring work event. Why don’t you two visit my private club, and we can make a fun event out of it,” she said. </p><p>“S-sounds good,” Mia found herself whispering, not expecting that closeness, her arousal not making it any easier. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she stood once more, but as she did so, her jacket opened, far too wide to be accidental, and revealed her chest, her bra doing very little to her breasts. </p><p>“Oh, very good indeed,” she heard Darion say. Madam Presley smirked, then walked away… </p><p>“G-goodbye,” Mia stammered as she jumped to her feet, with no intention of extending her unique situation. </p><p>She had an employee to kill.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Now, we’re going to play a game,” Sarah said, once again taking control as I slipped under the blanket. </p><p>“Oh, how interesting,” I suggested. “What exactly is this game?” I called. “We don’t have anything to play it.” </p><p>Sarah smiled while the others blushed. “Simple. You have some paper there. You’re going to write a number between one and a hundred, and each of us will have a guess. The one that guesses the closest number fails,” she suggested. </p><p>“Oh, what’s the cost of failure,” I said, not missing the nature of the rules that made it very easy to win, and very difficult to lose. It wasn’t hard to guess where she was going. </p><p>“Simple, the one that fails is going to move to your blanket, and suffer there for seven minutes. I call it, seven minutes in hell.” </p><p>“Oh, interesting name.” </p><p>“Of course. I can’t imagine the punishment worse than getting stuck under the blanket with you,” Sarah declared daringly, while the rest blushed, showing that their shared threesomes didn’t fully cure their shyness. </p><p>“Ahh, it hurts me here,” I said as I put my hand to my heart, letting the blanket slide to reveal my muscular chest. It wasn’t the first time they were seeing it, but it still made them blush. </p><p>“You don’t have the heart to be hurt, your chest is filled with muscles,” Sarah responded, still frustrated. Clearly, denying her three times in a row didn’t help her mood. </p><p>“Enough talking, let’s start the game,” I said as I grabbed the pen and paper, and wrote my first number. </p><p>Eleven. </p><p>“Let’s start guessing, ladies,” I said, and they started. </p><p>“Forty-two,” Carrie guessed.</p><p>“Seventy,” Naomi said. </p><p>“Twenty-two,” Irene guessed. </p><p>“Fifty,” guessed Sarah.</p><p>“Ten,” whispered Ida. </p><p>“Sarah, you’re very lucky,” I commented, and she shuffled in her seat, ready to stand up. “You didn’t lose, and you don’t have to suffer my torture,” I added, and her smile disappeared, replaced by a frustrated expression. </p><p>“Jerk,” she murmured. </p><p>“Come on, Sarah, one would think that you actually wanted to lose. I can’t imagine you doing that,” I said. “Ida is the unlucky loser.” </p><p>“Too bad, sweetie,” Carrie said with a smile, and Sarah turned to her, a suspicious expression on her face, her enthusiasm probably cluing about the truth of her first time. Still, it was just suspicion. </p><p>“C-close your eyes,” Ida commented, still shy… </p><p>I could have teased her, saying that wasn’t in the rules, but she was cute enough to earn that right. “Sure, sweetie,” I said as I closed my eyes, enjoying her footsteps, getting closer slowly… </p><p>I only opened my eyes once I felt the blanket move, followed by her presence settling at my side. “And the clock starts,” Sarah said, raising her phone. </p><p>“Let’s not waste time, sweetie,” I said as I wrapped my arm around her waist, but despite my words, I started softly. I leaned to her neck, and launched a dedicated assault, my hand joining around her waist. Two ‘safe’ locations, enough to break her shy resistance. </p><p>Meanwhile, her eyes stayed wide open, looking at her friends, their expressions varied. Naomi was annoyed, though it was more of a competitive annoyance than anything else. Irene had a vindictive smile on her face, no doubt remembering how Ida dominated her during her first time. Carrie was just horny …</p><p>Sarah was the only one looking at Carrie. “You … you bitch,” she gasped, finally convinced at her conclusion. “You set me up?” </p><p>Carrie turned to her, her smirk even bigger. “Oh, really. You were the one that threw yourself to him on the pool, trying to steal him when you were supposed to help, and I’m the one that set it up,” Carrie answered, her smirk even wider. “Though, it was fun to watch the great Sarah being treated like a submissive whore, unable to resist anything.” </p><p>“You … watched,” Sarah gasped. “You recorded me!” she added, turning to me. </p><p>“No, of course not,” Carrie answered while I continued kissing Ida. “I was even in the bedroom, but you were too distracted to notice,” she said. This time, every single girl turned to Sarah, their blush thick. </p><p>“I think Sarah needs a punishment for her ploy, right,” I said. </p><p>“Like that little blonde minx can take me down,” Sarah said. </p><p>“Maybe, but I’m sure Naomi would help,” I said, and Naomi smiled, enthusiastic to pay her back. And, before Sarah could even react, Naomi shifted place, and Sarah ended up with Carrie on her right, and Sarah on her left. </p><p>“Yes, we’ll punish her,” Naomi said. “What she did was wrong!” </p><p>“Like you’re any different—“ Sarah started, only for a gasp to steal her words. </p><p>“They are so silly, right,” I whispered to Ida even as I increased her teasing, and pulled her onto my lap. A little finger teasing, and she was ready to be slid in. </p><p>“T-this is too much,” she whispered as I slid inside her slowly. “T-they will watch.” </p><p>“It didn’t bother you the previous time,” I suggested, and she blushed, unable to admit her own mental tricks. “But don’t worry, they are not watching you, they are too focused on punishing Sarah. </p><p>Admittedly, that was only partially correct. Ida looked back, only to see Sarah trapped between two, her hands already bound — which was visible as their blanket already slid to waist level, the earlier game already lost its meaning. However, while Naomi and Carrie were focused on Sarah to make her pay, Irene had a different focus, watching us. </p><p>Naturally, she had another target for her fun revenge. </p><p>After a glimpse there, Ida turned her gaze to me, missing that little detail. Instead, she focused on the movement of her hips, slowly riding me. </p><p>Just because she was shy didn’t mean she was any less horny than her friends. Peer pressure wasn’t the reason she was under the blanket with me, naked. Peer pressure was the reason she was in here while the said peers were watching … and since she was convinced by their distraction, the weight lost its importance as well. </p><p>Left to her devices, she would have ridden me slowly and steadily, turning it into a beautiful, sensual dance. Too bad that I had other aims. I grabbed her hips, raising her before pulling her down. </p><p>The moan that she let out was spectacular, enough to interrupt the punishment for a while. “Wow, seven minutes in hell indeed,” Carrie commented as she turned her gaze, but that didn’t stay for long. </p><p>Ida somehow managed to keep the blanket up, and that made us a less interesting sight that Sarah’s naked and bound body, trembling as Naomi twisted her nipples. </p><p>I put my hands under her hips, enjoying her tight ass, trying to make her move faster of her volition. I tried tickling her a little bit to remind them, but she kept her pace. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, we were on a literal clock, so I took total control of myself, pushing her deep even as I kissed and molested her a wild animal. A bit excessive, maybe, but I wanted their attention mainly on me. </p><p>My poor, fragile ego… </p><p>Ida moaned as I dominated her, her determination to hold the blanket up lost and it slid down. Irene smirked at the moment and stood up, uncaring of her full nudity — not that it mattered at this moment, with what her friends were doing — as she slowly closed in. </p><p>Her naughty smirk was sexy, but her gaze on Ida rather than me, showed she was more interested in revenge than joining. It didn’t bother me considering the potential shape of her revenge… </p><p>I let her approach as I continued dominating Ida, each second making her moan louder. A grunt escaped my mouth as I shifted from her lips to her tits, enjoying the way her back arched to display them even more. </p><p>Irene cupped her breasts suggestively even as she approached, showing that revenge might be her primary aim, but it was certainly not the only one. A true shock, right? </p><p>As Irene stood behind Ida, I made a game of tracing my tongue along the edges of her breasts before focusing to suck her nipples, hard enough to leave a mark.</p><p>Ida moaned repeatedly, until Irene’s hands landed on her shoulders. Surprised by her presence, she stopped — though, her body continued to jump as I pumped without ceasing my move. </p><p>“I thought the blanket was supposed to stay up all the time, miss photographer,” Irene whispered, and Ida shivered. In fear … but also in arousal.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Filling the unfortunate elven spy with my seed was fun. Pity that I couldn’t focus on the beautiful sensation, not when I was already trying to come up with the best plan to integrate myself into the elven spy’s confidence; in mind as well as in body.</p><p>My initial, reflexive decision was to call Valkyrie so that they would trigger the fake assassination before the elven spy could take a move to stop it. But then, I stopped. Why should she bother to stop, when she had much better access to Aria, who was next in line? </p><p>I was sure I could convince her to allow assassination to happen and use it to hit back at Phoenixes … a good way to get rid of Cinder’s rivals. One spell, two birds. </p><p>Excellent ploy. </p><p>“Why don’t you fix your illusion and tend to the princess, while I go and pick the evidence,” I whispered. “Make sure you maintain your maid disguise, however. It’ll be very critical.” </p><p>“You think so,” she answered, still gasping as her body trembled after her most recent orgasm. Not that I blamed her, as our embrace had been rather challenging — for all her holes. </p><p>“Yes, I think so, miss elven spy,” I said as I slapped her ass, hard enough to explode. She managed to hide her gasp, but only for a moment. Soon, I slipped two fingers into her ass, and she gasped. “Try to play along. Your secret identity will help us a lot,” I added, using her distracted state to implement her simple suggestion, that we were a team. </p><p>Normally, it wouldn’t have been very effective … but things were different after the rough fucking she had just experienced. She was in a very suggestive state, and my fingers pushing into her ass were not helping. </p><p>“W-what do you want me to do?” she asked. </p><p>I looked at Aria, thinking of something that she would like without making the spy suspicious. “Bind her arms and legs, but lick her a bit, keep her from I’m not here,” I suggested, knowing Aria would enjoy it, and bondage should be enough to give the spy an illusion of control. </p><p>Leaving that beautiful sight was a disappointment, but I could have tried to do more, but once again, work interfered with my fun. I left them behind, and my next target was Sapphire’s study, picking all the supplies I could gather, without even making them aware of my presence. </p><p>I didn’t want to distract them from my plan, not before I could come up with a refreshed plan. In the secret tunnel, I sat down, and once again started to use some of my lesser-known skills. Two in particular. </p><p>Forgery, and knowledge of paperwork. Two underrated abilities when it came to spying. </p><p>When it came to spying, most people were more obsessed with digging the hidden information or converting enemy spies. Boring tasks like creating the necessary paperwork were trusted to commoner underlings with the necessary skills. Too bad for them that it usually allowed me to catch their attempts of misdirection. </p><p>Because, those commoners were never trusted with the true function of the forged paperwork, which meant they never came out truly right. For example, I was trying to forge some orders coming from the darklands, about setting up a new safe house. The details, such as using the correct cipher, were rather basic, and my opponents didn’t miss it as well. </p><p>The other details, like using the correct paper type, not so much. For example, darklands and Empire didn’t use the same type of trees to make paper, nor they used the exact same process. As a result, the paper had a different feeling. If I had the time, I would have imported the correct type of paper … but since I didn’t have the time, I needed to use some magic. </p><p>The kind that was used by the craftsman and other workers, carefully changed the nature of the paper to make it convincing. The ink, even the feather I used to write was used the same treatment…</p><p>Then, I started the difficult part. A pile of paperwork, some from the darklands, directly about the orders, some observation reports from the rival houses, even some innocent reports from the Empire, the kind that was created by city guards for incidents, unaware of the depths of the issue they had stumbled upon. </p><p>The strategic design of the paperwork didn’t take long. I was too used to creating misdirections. The trick was, never to spell out the full direction that the enemy needed to believe, as that only made it more suspicious. The trick was to create an outline that could have several explanations … then let the suggestions fill the rest.  </p><p>It was an art. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I murmured as I finished creating the necessary documentation, before started casting several more spells. Without the tether to assist me to cast several necessary spells in parallel, that step alone would have taken hours to get right, but the control helped me immensely. </p><p>Altogether, it created a beautiful, convincing story… </p><p>I packed the documents before returning, only to see our little spy was not idling. She had bound Aria as I had suggested, but unlike my suggestion, she hadn’t been licking. Instead, she was fingering her, and fingering furiously. She didn’t look like a maid, or even like a spy that was trying to look like a maid. She clearly wanted to make her payback for her earlier treatment. </p><p>Holding back my chuckle took everything I had even as I sneaked toward them, and she was distracted enough to miss my presence. Only when I slipped two fingers into her ass, she noticed my presence with a beautiful hiss. </p><p>“The documents are on the table,” I said as she turned to catch my gaze. </p><p>“Is this the best way to tell me?” she whispered back. </p><p>“Maybe not, but certainly the most fun way,” I answered as I added a third finger. “Just making sure our ploy is realistic before you walk away. You need an excuse to look exhausted. Now, play along,” I ordered, and I pulled Aria’s blindfold off. </p><p>It was enough for our spy to freeze, and I used the opportunity to replace my fingers with a different limb. Her gasp of shock was beautiful. “I’m trying to convince her to make you her permanent, special maid,” I whispered, reminding her of her role. </p><p>She grunted as she tried to contain a cry, while I turned my attention to Aria. “She’s a very enthusiastic maid, isn’t she, my princess. Very discrete,” I said, pausing as I pulled back, and slammed even deeper. “And very discrete.” </p><p>“You think so?” Aria stammered between moans, clever enough to keep her statement vogue to allow me to play. </p><p>“Yes, my princess. I’ll make sure she keeps her mouth and attends to you more often. You can trust me, in everything.” </p><p>“I — know,” she said, interrupted by a gasp in between. “She’s very cooperative.” </p><p>“Yes, my princess. She clearly loves this,\" I crooned, pushing deep. I pumped hard and fast, causing her resolve to crack, as her breath burst through her lips in a loud moan.</p><p>Keeping my pumping, he reached over and grabbed her tits, twisting her nipples for additional arousal. Once again, my insistent pumping was not just about the pleasure, but I had an ulterior motive. This time, I wanted her to leave extremely exhausted, which would make following her to her base even easier. </p><p>I needed to understand her path and her other assets to manipulate her correctly. </p><p>A plan that worked when I pulled out, only for her to collapse immediately. “I think the princess had enough of your services, sweetie, why don’t you fix yourself and leave,” I ordered as I spanked her ass… </p><p>As she stumbled away for her ruined clothing, I leaned to steal a kiss from Aria … my mind was already on the plan once more.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I opened our first play with a tight defensive scheme around eight yards, forcing them with the choice of forcing a long-distance pass, and a short, easy gain of five yards. They chose five yards… </p><p>Only to learn it was not exactly easy when the receiver was tackled by one of the defensive tackles coming from behind, who stopped chasing the Quarterback before he even threw the pass. The thump was audible even from the stands… </p><p>In another sport, it might have earned some shocked gasps. In football, against the visiting team, it earned deafening shouts. </p><p>“Not bad boys, but the next time, hit even harder,” I called. “This was a one-time gift for the beginning.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” they shouted even as they followed the defensive scheme I signaled and fell into the necessary pattern, and I enjoyed the cheers as much as the Intent that came along with it. </p><p>[Repair +1%]</p><p>The opposing coach looked angry, and considering his age, I could feel that a heart attack was not out of possibility. I smirked as I waved, hitting him with another burst of Taunt. To his credit, he managed to ignore it, and the next two plays followed up with a run and another short pass, both targeting players considerably bigger, turning it into a collusion battle. </p><p>Such a rough strategy was rarely used at the college level, as it impacted the games that followed too much to be a winning strategy. But, the coach probably realized we were ready to sacrifice other games for a quick and memorable victory. </p><p>We needed that, but our opponent didn’t want to give it. Reasonable, considering no one needed the reputation of being defeated by a newbie and the team he had cobbled from the remains of a broken defensive squad and practice squad. He met us with equal ferocity. </p><p>A good strategy. I felt bad that it wouldn’t work, considering my team was constantly being renewed by the fake staff of Hermes I created, and his team was getting exhausted far faster. His offense was being battered, while my defense stood strong. </p><p>For ten minutes, they fought for every yard painfully, a time that I used to my benefit and subtly examined Arthur. The damage to his body was clear. Not impossible to treat for me, from what I could detect, but I was afraid of the effects I couldn’t detect. </p><p>I was still a novice at magic, no matter how much the System helped me. Ten minutes, and it ended up with a field goal. We were still up by four, and they were kicking off this time. Then, my enhanced perception picked up something. </p><p>Their special teams were too tense, and I had a feeling about what was coming. </p><p>An onside kick. </p><p>I gave my team a signal to be ready for it, even as I called the System and checked the status of its recovery. Just a few more percent… </p><p>[Repair - Phase One - Progress - 94%]</p><p>Fascinating. I was almost there…  I smiled as I watched the team easily handle the onside kick, and take the ball in a very advantageous position. “It’s time for another touchdown,” I ordered them, focusing on Arthur. Even with his rest and my assistance, he didn’t recover that much … so I want to get the most point I could of him before I had to pull him out of the game. </p><p>We were moving toward a touchdown, but this time, despite our excellent position, it wasn’t a simple, smooth affair. Unlike our previous team, split between Spencer and Coach Bill, their team didn’t hate each other, which meant that, after our earlier defensive beatdown, they were more than happy to respond in kind. </p><p>We moved forward, but it was not cheap. Arthur was trembling with the strain of his hidden runes. The break between quarters helped, but not much. It was not all bad, however. Arthur was sacked once, and as he started looking exhausted, our opponent misread the problems of Arthur, and started pressuring him even more. </p><p>He was forced to scramble, which would have been enough to trigger his collapse, but his enhancements had been enough to allow him to deliver passes at the last moment. It was supposed to protect him from a late hit, but not when the opponent was angry. </p><p>“Roughing the passer, fifteen-yard penalty,” called the referee as Arthur collapsed in a late hit, struggling to stand up. </p><p>“We are subbing for him,” Coach Juana commented. </p><p>I might have argued against that, but my attention was grabbed by two things. </p><p>[Repair - Phase One - Complete]</p><p>[Recovery in Progress]</p><p>With my greatest mission completed quicker than I expected, I was willing to give Juana what she wanted. Her concern after the last hit was reasonable. “As you wish, Coach,” I called, and gestured to our backup quarterback, who had been the running back before. “Go and run them to death,” I called. </p><p>Arthur looked unhappy at the decision. “I can still play, coach,” he called. </p><p>“Not unless the medical team clears you,” I said, pointing at the medical tent.</p><p>“But —“ he started. </p><p>“No, you took too much to stand up after the latest hit. The risk is unacceptable,” I said. I reached to him, and started examining him once more. I smiled, realizing that, with each second, I was getting a better sense of what was going on inside of him. The jump was not great, but enough to be noticeable, and it was certainly safer for him to stop than to push for more.  </p><p>The repair was already showing some benefits. </p><p> I wasn’t obsessed with Arthur’s safety. He was an adult, and he was the one that took a risk without considering the full risks, but considering any mess had the risk of creating a scandal later, I decided to follow Juana’s direction. </p><p>Also, I didn’t want her to blame me for cheating to win our bet. That was not a benefit I wanted to sacrifice, not yet. </p><p>As Arthur disappeared into the medical tent, I turned my focus on the game. While going through the repair, the System wasn’t devouring Intent with the same intensity, so rather than trying to absorb Intent, I turned my attention to trying to use it more effectively. </p><p>A jolt of Recovery-Intent was all that was needed to juice the running back and the backup quarterback as they pulled their trick plays, hitting hard against the defensive line. It took three attempts, but they managed to break through the line, and brought us a touchdown. </p><p>“Fourteen to three,” I said with a smirk as I looked at Juana, who was celebrating as well. “Aren’t you happy that we’re eleven points ahead,” I said, and she looked blankly. “One point more than ten,” I reminded her, and the realization hit. </p><p>And, along with it, a thick blush. </p><p>I chuckled, enjoying her silence as she went through a mental conflict. She didn’t want to lose the bet … but she also wanted to win. It mattered to her even more than it mattered to me. And, not to mention, as the official head coach, she couldn’t just wish for our defeat while the team could hear. </p><p>The situation was delicious. </p><p>I would have loved to tease her about that, but we still had nine minutes before the end of the first half. Ordinarily, I would have been focused on getting more Intent, but with the System in recovery, that was not a viable option temporarily. </p><p>Instead, I started experimenting with new aspects. With my increased sensitivity, I realized it was considerably easier to channel intent. I wondered how it would work with active use, and called for a Blitz play. At the same time, I extended a web of Intent between the six players that were assigned to rush, channeled through Tactics. </p><p>The results were …</p><p>Even more spectacular than I expected. They rushed forward with a coordination that would have made a professional team jealous, three faking a rush from the right to distract the offensive line, while the fourth and fifth attacked. They even handled the sudden block from the running back excellently, and gave us a spectacular sack. </p><p>“We’re the pirates, and we pillage,” shouted the linebacker that managed to get the sack, the team celebrating the sudden nine-yard gain we achieved. </p><p>I celebrated from the sideline, though mine was less about the sack itself — which was merely nice — and more about the sudden range of possibilities that had been opened to me. The match suddenly got much more interesting. </p><p>Curious to test the new limits, I delivered a few more rushes. A bit excessive, and a couple mistakes allowed them to gain a few big chunk plays. But, I had an even better understanding of Tactics and what I could do with them. </p><p>The biggest limitation, I could only focus on a few players at the same time, and only when they shared the same objective. Trying to enhance both the coverage and the rush didn’t work well — I learned in a play that cost us twenty-five yards, bringing them dangerously close to a touchdown. </p><p>But, that also gave me a chance to reverse it. I called a seven-man zero blitz, triggering the panicking quarterback even more, but, this time, my aim was not the quarterback. Even if I took him down, they were already in field goal range. </p><p>No, I wanted to finish the half without giving them any more points, so even as I assigned the majority of the defense to a rush, they were only the bait. The real dagger was the safeties, who I pulled deceptively forward, giving the quarterback to throw a long pass to touchdown… </p><p>Too bad for him that I chose that moment to enhance Marcus with Strength. Not too much, just enough to give him a little edge in jumping… And, just like that, what was about to be a devastating touchdown turned into a timely interception, ending the half. </p><p>Fourteen-to-three. </p><p>Not bad for a team that was expected to lose. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The first thing I felt as I stepped into the stadium was … disappointment. The stadium was already full, but that wasn’t enough. Not when I could sense the listless nature of the crowd. There was almost no intent flaring even as we stepped into the field … and, with my growing sensitivity, I could sense that our rivals were generating significantly more Intent despite their people being barely a tenth. </p><p>Our fans were here because we didn’t allow them to return the tickets — a small thing I had insisted to Coach Juana and she listened, a benefit of our growing, well, cooperation. I wanted them here, because if they were not in the stadium, I couldn’t excite them. </p><p>[Repair - Phase One - Progress - 61%]</p><p>And, if I couldn’t excite them, I couldn’t gather the necessary Intent to repair the System. Simple math. </p><p>However, not everything was bad. I had been afraid of the challenge of gathering the necessary Intent as the coach, but a little experiment showed that, as long as I concentrated, I could pull a significant portion of the Intent targeting our team. Curiously, the same didn’t work for the Intent generated by our opponent. </p><p>Fascinating. The only problem, I couldn’t use the System for any other outward purpose, including the traits, while that was going on. Luckily, their passive effect on me still worked. </p><p>Even more, reason to make sure the team could win without my intervention. </p><p>“Are you ready, team!” I growled, putting the full force of the System behind my words to motivate the team in the absence of the cheer. “We’re starting with a kickoff. Let’s give them a nasty surprise.” </p><p>“What do you mean, coach?” one of them asked. </p><p>“We’re going to start with an onside kick,,” I said, and they gasped in shock. I had a feeling that, without some Intent to reinforce that statement, their reaction would have been significantly worse. And they would have been justified. </p><p>Onside kick meant that, rather than kicking the ball as far as possible to make the other team start from deep into their side of the field, a short kick to our side of the field, and contesting to catch it. The other team had the much better advantage to grab the ball, and if they did, they had a much shorter field position to cover before a touchdown… Moreover, successfully pulling an onside kick required a lot of coordination, something our last-minute team lacked significantly. </p><p>But I was not above cheating.  </p><p>“Yes, coach,” they accepted as I quickly went through the tactic, and our kickoff team took the field, excited for the opportunity. I watched them with a smirk, even if the cheers were muted. </p><p>As our kicker pulled back, I gathered my intent, ready to intervene in a simple manner. A telekinetic push. I couldn’t pull that many times, not without arousing suspicion, but adding a weird bounce to the ball was the edge I might need. </p><p>We kicked the ball, and something nice happened. Our opponents started pulling back even before registering the ball was flying much slower, not registering even a possibility of an onside kick. A little telekinetic push later, the ball was with us. </p><p>The cheers only exploded a moment of delay as the audience processed what had happened, then broke into a thunderous applause … one that was accompanied by a strong wave of intent that left my insides tingling. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said with a laugh as I looked at Arthur. “Go ahead and show how good are you as the starting Quarterback,” I called him. </p><p>“Don’t worry, coach,” he answered, smug. “I’ll make you proud.”  I didn’t blame him. After all, I could feel some of the Intent gathering on the runes he had drawn before, reinforcing his abilities. </p><p>[Repair +1.2 %]</p><p>“Good, make sure to check my signs,” I said, then, as my team took the field, I caught the gaze of the opposing coach, from the other side of the field. I waited until I made eye contact with him,, then made a chicken gesture. </p><p>He started cursing even as he suddenly reached for his playbook, and after a furious recalculation, he shouted to some of his players, and adjusted his play. I just gave Arthur a signal, asking him to be ready for a six-man rush. </p><p>Their coach was angry, and wanted to make me play. Too bad that in his anger, he had chosen to use one of the plays that were easiest to read. Though, even with a perfect read, we almost failed. The offensive line collapsed in an instant, forcing Arthur to retreat fast, before he throw to one of the players that were currently not guarded. </p><p>A nice fifteen-yard gain, bringing us to their side of the field. I waved at their coach from a distance, making a show of laughing. A behavior that was extremely unsportsmanlike, but under the circumstances, I was willing to let that slide. </p><p>[Repair +0.4%]</p><p>The benefits were good enough to make that acceptable. </p><p>The next play, I called a run play, one that resulted in barely a yard of gain as our offensive line failed to create a decent corridor for our newbie running back. Not exactly the gain I was searching for for the first down.  For the second down, I decided to trust Arthur’s abilities instead. </p><p>After examining their defensive layout, I signaled to Arthur, calling for a quick double-slant play, one that had Marcus as the first target. After giving that order, however, I started to make a few big motions, trying to sell the idea that I was going to push for a long pass. </p><p>Their coach bit the bait, and set a deep two-cover scheme that made sure nothing could go in the depths, but he did while still rushing with five, leaving the middle empty. The ball reached the hands of Marcus, who managed to juke two players before finally being caught by a third one, delivering a very painful hit… </p><p>But, he held the ball, and to the twelve-yard gain he accomplished. Another run play layer, I called for a deep pass, once again ordering Marcus to push forward, feeling the intent to turn into a wave as the ball flew true. The safety tried to cut off Marcus, but the attempt failed. Marcus grabbed the ball … and run for a touchdown… </p><p>An excellent pass, and, since it was barely two minutes since the game started, enough to turn the earlier disinterest of the crowd into something spectacular, giving me the biggest improvement I had expected. </p><p>[Repair +5.6%]</p><p>Unfortunately, not all news was good. I turned my gaze toward the celebrating team, only to see Arthur’s face already contorted and sweating. Whatever the runes were doing to him, it wasn’t something nice. I observed the way he took some of the Intent resulting from the play … only to receive a stronger-than-predicted side effect. </p><p>Feeling merciful after that, I kept my focus on him, taking the excess intent. </p><p>“Make sure they pay for every yard with pain, boys,” I shouted, and it earned great cheer from the defensive team. Their enthusiasm was high after the quick score. While they took their position, I stretched a tendril of Intent on Arthur, triggering his recovery more than the small healing item I had created, and his expression slowly turned normal. </p><p>Still, he needed a bit to recover. </p><p>Our kickoff team lined up for another kickoff. I was tempted to pull another onside kick, but this time, they would be prepared for it. Not to mention, two successful onside kicks would be suspicious enough without putting them back to back. </p><p>While the team prepared to launch, I turned my attention to Marcus, our old cornerback, and the new star receiver. “Marcus, I need you to play safety,” I suddenly called, cutting off his celebration. </p><p>He looked at me, surprised as he took a step forward. “Why, coach?” he asked. I appreciated him for having enough presence of mind to keep it to a whisper yet sticking him to the title. Leadership helped me to maintain control over the team, but every bit helped. </p><p>“A little change of plans,” I said, which was true. I wanted to keep Arthur away from the field, especially until I could make sure the runes wouldn’t just kill him. But, it was not something I could just come out and explain to Marcus. “Slight change of plans about our defensive strategy. The touchdown came too quick, and their offensive team wants to pay back.” </p><p>“And you don’t want them to succeed,” Marcus answered. </p><p>“Whether they succeed is immaterial. What I want them to pay every yard with pain and bruises….” </p><p>“And, to do that, you need to make sure they can’t just take the top off with a long pass.” </p><p>“Exactly. That’s where you come in. You’re going to play the single safety,” I said, patting his shoulder even as I flooded his body with healing energy, making sure he stayed fresh. “Do you think you can handle it?” </p><p>He nodded, and I smirked. It was going to be painful… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I did nothing for a while, just listening as the silence fell into the pool. I might have called it boring, but the water made the panicked shuffle of the girls clear, the sound of water moving to hit my ear like a song. </p><p>“Okay, girls, you know how the game goes. You need to make a bit of noise so I can find you.” </p><p>Sarah was the first to speak. Well, to be fair, speaking was not exactly what she had done. It was a cry, a moan even… A sexy sound. </p><p>And a smart one as well, because it triggered a reaction from the other girls as well, most gasping. Irene exclaimed. “Sarah!” And, to her great misfortune, she was too close to me. Two strokes, and before she could even realize it, I already caught her. </p><p>“I caught you —“ I started, only to be interrupted. </p><p>“Stop!” a voice called. I stopped, surprised. I was surprised, because of the source of that voice. Not Irene like I expected … but Sarah again. I was sure that she had a trap in mind, so I listened. </p><p>“Okay,” I said, but I still kept my hand on Irene’s waist, far lower than it was appropriate, enjoying the way she shivered under my fingers. “Tell me why?” </p><p>“Another rule for the game,” Sarah said. “Whenever you catch someone, you need to identify your victim correctly.” </p><p>“Why should I accept that rule,” I answered with a chuckle. “It only makes the game harder.” </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t handle it, big boy.” </p><p>“Well, I might, but I should have some time to assess my target. Otherwise, it would be unfair.” </p><p>“Excellent,” Sarah said. “But you should let your current catch go. It’s not fair for her to get a new rule immediately.” </p><p>“I … I don’t mind,” Irene interrupted. “I’m the one that got caught. I need to … suffer  … the consequences.” </p><p>The usage of the word earned a derisive laugh from Sarah. To be fair, she wasn’t the only one laughing. She was just the loudest. </p><p>“Let’s start, then,” I said as I put one of my hands on her stomach, and the other on her back. I started moving my hand on her back, enjoying the way she shivered. I had been planning to play along slowly, teasingly, but then, Irene managed to change my mind. </p><p>A soft moan escaped her mouth. </p><p>That was all I needed to let my other hand climb up, right at her chest, groping her, a daring move that earned gasps from everyone else. “Daring,” Sarah commented from a distance, but I could hear the jealousy in her tone. </p><p>“Well, it’s hard to recognize people blindfolded,” I answered with a chuckle, not stopping my fingers from delving into her softness. </p><p>I enjoyed it for a while. “It has been a minute, make a guess,” Sarah called, though this time, there was no hiding her jealousy. “Do you want to make a guess, or should we leave you two alone!” </p><p>“If you insist,” I answered, then leaned forward. “I’m going to guess that I’m holding a redheaded goddess,” I moaned throatily, and without even waiting for a response, pulled off her bra and wrapped it around my arm.  </p><p>Yet, rather than letting her go, I cupped her naked breasts, her nipples hard against my palm. “You have to let her go to continue the game,” Sarah called once more, frustrated that her little scheme not developing as she expected. </p><p>It was a pity that I was blindfolded, because I could easily imagine her looking angrily at Carrie for her excessive permissiveness. The game was a thinly veiled excuse to exert control, and it was already ruined. </p><p>I didn’t say anything. I was having too much fun to risk calling her on it. Instead, I pulled back, and started swimming back and forth, moving faster than they could react — though, from the sounds they were making, they were not trying to make it particularly hard to get caught. </p><p>Soon, I managed to catch another, the tightness of her body, developed through endless yoga, was impossible to be confused. “Hmm, another one. Now, I just need to guess,” I said as I leaned forward,, trapping Naomi between my body and the edge of the pool, my shaft buried between her cheeks. </p><p>I said nothing as my hands disappeared underwater and grabbed her firm thighs, molesting them recklessly. Her moans were beautiful. “Hmm, a little flabby. I’m guessing the owner doesn’t exercise much —“ I started. </p><p>“How dare you!” Naomi exclaimed as she pushed me back. Unfortunately for her, I had already grabbed the string of her bottom, and as I moved away, I dragged her bottom with me. </p><p>“Oh, come on, Naomi. I can’t believe you fell for that. You’re such a virgin,” Sarah called, her call made more amusing by the fact that she was there when Naomi lost that.</p><p>“Shut up, Sarah,” Naomi called, her tone shamed. </p><p>I chuckled as I raced around the pool once more, leaving them to their little fight. They sniped at each other, while I managed to grab Ida. “Hello, my exotic beauty,” I said as I slowly freed her from her top, but I continued to squeeze her breasts. “Let’s make sure I know who are you,” I added as I enjoyed her tits. </p><p>“Enough playing,” Carrie called, her tone a tad jealous and frustrated. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I called, and suddenly, I dove underwater. It didn’t make me invisible, but it shocked them enough that I managed to catch two of them at the same time. One of them was clearly Carrie, but the other, I only recognized as I pulled toward me. </p><p>Sarah. </p><p>Nice. </p><p>“And, I caught Sarah and Carrie, completing the set for the first round,” I said teasingly. </p><p>“W-wrong,” Sarah said, trying to conceal her voice. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said as I pulled Carrie’s top, freeing her amazing tits as they deserved before turning my attention to Sarah. I carried her toward the edge of the pool, trapping her just like I did to Naomi. </p><p>I pulled her top off immediately. “So, are you saying that, if I opened my eyes, I’ll not see Sarah?” I started, then leaned forward, whispering in a way others couldn’t hear. “Shuffling like a needy whore, trying to anger me, just because she’s too arrogant to actually beg for what she truly wants.” </p><p>My shaft pressed against her stomach, making her shiver more. </p><p>“O-okay, you guessed right,” she admitted, one that was an answer to my latest statement and not just her cheating attempt. </p><p>“Good, a punishment, then,” I said as I pulled her top and bottom at the same time — though, considering how little they were, it should count as one. I didn’t limit it to that, and before she could react, I gathered her arms behind her back, and used her swimsuit to tie them back. </p><p>With that done, I pushed her out of the pool. “You better get some timeout for cheating,” I said mockingly, like I hadn’t just pushed her to a point that made her reveal her naked body in a very compromised manner. </p><p>Pity I was still blindfolded. </p><p>As I pulled back, Sarah whispered. “Hurry up, we still have our next game,,” she said. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, she was still being punished, so I decided to deliver the slowest, most extended game of tag imaginable. I caught them many times, of course, but just by deliberately calling them the wrong names, I extended the game quite a bit. </p><p>Not a great hardship, as each catch ended up with another half-naked beauty pressing against me. I even gave a piggyback ride to Naomi after one of my ‘failures’, her naked pussy pressing against my neck. </p><p>Unfortunately, as fun as it was to tease Sarah, I didn’t extend the game for more than fifteen minutes, not wanting to ruin the mood. One by one, I divested each girl of their clothing, leaving Carrie to the last, trapping her near the ladder as she tried to escape. </p><p>I tried to ‘prevent’ ending up with my face temporarily burying into her wet ass. A glorious feeling for certain. </p><p>“Wait for two minutes, then come to the living room,” Sarah ordered before we escalate further. Considering how entertaining her previous game had been, I decided to listen to her. </p><p>Two minutes into the pool, I removed the blindfold, found a towel, and walked back into the house. </p><p>In my living room, a surprising sight was waiting for me. The girls were all sitting on the large couch, which was not that surprising. </p><p>The surprising part was that all of them were under one blanket. And, I was too familiar with them to miss the discomfort on their faces — more intense on Irene and Ida, and a fake one on Carrie. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to deduce that they were all naked under that blanket. </p><p>“Sit there,” Sarah ordered before I could comment, pointing at an armchair. Large, but for a single person, but another blanket was waiting for me. “Sit down and get rid of that ugly swim shorts!” she ordered. </p><p>I was too happy to follow that, curious about what was our next game…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“I don’t have time to discuss the nature of your betrayal,” I said as I flooded his body with my mana, creating a drunken effect even as I destroyed certain parts of his mind, forcing him to speak truthfully. </p><p>It was near-irreversible, but considering I had no intention of keeping him alive, it was not exactly an unfortunate trade-off for me. Instead, I turned my attention toward my target. “First question. Tell me how the war started…” </p><p>That launched an interrogation that lasted for almost an hour, and gave me a lot of answers I had been searching for. </p><p>Apparently, what I had learned from Seldanna about the start of the war had been misleading. Her guess had been a few weeks at best, but the traitor claimed that it had been almost a year since they had first come across first undead presence, only to be destroyed immediately…</p><p>This launched a long campaign of hide-and-seek, where the undead fought to establish a stronghold where they could spread their power, and the elves from the central city doing their best to squash it — without even bothering to inform the border tribes, apparently, treating them more as a nuisance than potential assistance. </p><p>He had summarized dozens of battles to me, each incredible success against the undead… Yet, even as he went through the battles, something was tickling my mind… The battles he described were incredible, worthy of stories, requiring heroics, bravery, and sacrifices… If I hadn’t already used magic to strip him of his ego, I might have assumed he was trying to exaggerate the battles he was in,  but that was certainly not the case. </p><p>More importantly, only two names were coming across as heroic repeatedly, and he was not included… Prince Arun, and High Priest Ivasaar. </p><p>“Suspicious,” I found myself murmuring. </p><p>I had fought against the undead many times, and the way those battles unfolded didn’t sound reasonable in the slightest. </p><p>“And when you discovered you can trade Divine Spark in that fort?” </p><p>“What?” he asked. </p><p>I realized we might not be sharing a name. “What you had in that acorn,” I said. </p><p>“Essence of Life,” he corrected, which sounded interesting. Maybe it was another valid name, but it was almost like they were deliberately cutting the link between the Gods and the energy they were trading. </p><p>“Good, tell me when you heard about that?” I ordered. </p><p>“I heard two subordinates of High Priest conspiring to steal some of the acorns and bring them directly for a trade,” he said. “They were talking about a mysterious group trading Undead Essence for a miraculous version of Essence of Life, and for a price, they even extract already absorbed Essence to allow improvement…” </p><p>“A good service,” I muttered. The profitable nature of that little offering was certainly fascinating. From what I had seen, it was impossible for the others to absorb two different sources of Divine Spark without conflict, so they wanted to get rid of their weaker source first before replacing it. </p><p>And, here they were, Eternals, offering to absorb the weaker source, something they already wanted, for a steep price, and from there, they were offering some kind of exchange service between different Divine Spark — and I doubted they were just doing some equal exchange. </p><p>A profitable trade, enough to make me question whether they were here just to profit from the battle … or their presence actually predated the battle and they were the ones that fueled the battle in the first place. </p><p>After all, my memories of Zokras were there to remind me that the Eternals were not above-using undead as convenient patsies for their purpose. </p><p>“I wonder if the undead is their only ploy,” I found myself murmuring. After all, the victories of the elves, particularly the High Priest and the Prince, didn’t make much sense either. It almost gave a sense of a choreographed fight. </p><p>Pity that was not something the traitor would know. Or would he? “Tell me where you get that acorn from?” I ordered. </p><p>“It’s the great invention of the High Priest, allowing us to prevent the undead from resurrecting,” he answered. </p><p>Which gave me the answer I was searching for. High Priest had some kind of connection to the Eternals. Probably a willing accomplice, but I couldn’t just assume that with certainty. There were other possibilities, trickery, magical control, blackmail, or they might even succeed in convincing him that it was a way to strike back against undead, and they needed to hide the origin of the invention… </p><p>Regardless of the extent of his willingness,  however,  it was clear that the Eternals had infiltrated the Elven Capital to a dangerous degree, highlighting the need to act carefully. </p><p>“And, I’m guessing that you’re under strict orders to bring back those Acorns back to the High Priest, and never use them on anything else, am I right?” </p><p>“Yes, and any contamination has the risk of creating an explosion.”</p><p>I thought of another question. “And, how did you discover you could use those Acorns on the trees and not just undead,” I asked. I had a feeling that he wasn’t as smart to come up with that trick. </p><p>“I have caught one of the soldiers of Prince Arun sneaking around the Tree of Life, sapping its energy,” he admitted. </p><p>“Why didn’t you try the same?” I asked, even as I wondered if some naughty elves walking around, stealing the divine spark of important guardian trees explained the fall of that border tree. After all, even its remains were impressive. But I abandoned that track for the moment. </p><p>“Tell me more about the capital, how it works, and its social structure of it,” I said. I said nothing as he gave me the breakdown of their societal structure. An immobile social structure with a strong caste system, with almost no mobility — not helped by their incredibly long lives — between the groups. Royals, nature priests, soldiers … and servants were collected from the tribes. </p><p>Or, as the way the traitor was framed, given the chance to serve their betters and make something out of them. </p><p>No wonder the tribes were antagonistic against them. </p><p>The capital was clearly smaller than I would otherwise expect, but the power difference — provided by the tree of life, if his words to be believed — allowed the city elves to easily bully the tribes, and squash any attempt of building alliances — not that it was particularly difficult if the way they reacted to extinction events was any indicator — and maintain their monopoly of power. </p><p>That monopoly didn’t help them as the undead slowly yet inevitably invaded their home. </p><p>“Goodbye, little traitor,” I said as I delivered my final blow after I had learned everything I could in short order. I did so, because I felt the wards I had left with Seldanna signaling movement once more. I wanted to go and protect her. </p><p>Not to mention, I liked the mentions of the Tree of Life, and the capabilities it boasted. I wanted to see how it worked. I had a feeling that I would learn a lot from how it worked. And, the combined objective of protecting Seldanna and sneaking around left me with one option. </p><p>It was time to wear a disguise once more. </p><p>But, before that, I needed some assistance. </p><p>If I was going to go around concealed, once more disguised, I needed my relevant skills as optimized as possible. </p><p>Even if it burned all of my purified spark storage, even tapping into the Guardian Forest. </p><p>{+6 Charisma}</p><p>{+6 Manipulation}</p><p>{-3800 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>{-342 Guardian God Forest}</p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured as I stopped for a second, once again enjoying the feeling of getting stronger. My mana suddenly flow stronger and softer at the same time, but also it gave me confidence that I could easily conceal myself as a servant once more. </p><p>Even in a society as structured and xenophobic as the Elven capital. </p><p>“But, one more thing to be done,” I murmured as I closed my eyes once more, reaching to Aether Dimension to pull Aether, breaking it down to pure mana, converting it to HP and mana, just in case I met with an emergency. </p><p>God Forest had hundreds of thousand of points of mana hidden, of course, but the distance meant that it took a while to reach it. Worse, if anything blocked my access to Aether Dimension, it would also block my access to that stored mana. </p><p>I wanted to bring some more. </p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 8000}  </p><p>{Mana: 15000}</p><p>With that done, I teleported, ready to shadow Seldanna once more. </p><p>It was time to step onto the elven capital. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 338}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 8000  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 1452}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I felt time stop as I tried to come to a decision. My first reflex was to blast my elven spy with a  spell to make sure she couldn’t attack me now that her identity was revealed. </p><p>And,  if I had any stirring in her mana, I would have done so. A lifetime habit of self-preservation would have ensured that. Yet, it didn’t take long for me to realize that things weren’t going that badly. </p><p>She was surprised and afraid, but also catatonic with pleasure. It gave me a  chance. A simple spell came first, one that raised a piece of fabric against Aria’s face. She was quick to understand what I was driving at, and blindfolded herself. </p><p>It was good, as I didn’t want to use more magic than necessary, not wanting to trigger my cute elven spy. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was the easiest part of my plan. Now, I needed to earn the trust of the dangerous mage that I had been ramming for a long while. “Now, keep it calm, we can come to an agreement, miss spy,” I whispered into her ear. </p><p>Before saying anything, she ripped off her own blindfold, and looked at me, her eyes glowing as she started gathering her mana. I tensed, ready to retaliate, but instead, I just spanked her ass. </p><p>“The princess is not aware of what’s going on, let’s keep it like it until we can decide what’s going on,” I whispered once again, this time grabbing her shoulders and lifting her, so that the couch didn’t cut off her sight. She saw Aria, blindfolded. </p><p>“As you see, your identity is secure. We just need to make sure we come to an arrangement before we fight and ruin things for both of us,” I whispered, once again leaning hard into the temptation. It was not the sexual kind, but my earlier exploit made those words much more effective, it was clear on her face. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. It was hard to think after experiencing a chain of orgasms — especially if they were far more intense than anything else she had experienced. “Why?” she managed to ask. I spanked her again. Shocked, she just moaned, even as she changed her direction, coming face to face with me rather than looking at the princess.  </p><p>“Simple, I’m also a spy, just for another group,” I whispered back as I pulled out of her. </p><p>Her eyes widened in alarm, finally gaining the sharpness that I was afraid of. Unfortunately, a manner of confrontation was unavoidable. All I could do was soften it as much as possible. </p><p>I chose to soften it in a unique manner. I had already pulled out of her tight hole, so I did the only thing that made sense. I plunged into her wetness. “What —“ she had started before I slipped in, only to turn into a moan. “I’ll—“ she followed as I invaded her core mercilessly, and that time, I silenced her with a searing kiss. She was shocked, but as my tongue invaded her mouth, I could feel her gathered mana dissipate. </p><p>A good time to talk, but I kept her pushed against the couch even as I maintained the kiss, extending the moment for a while, partially to soften her more, but my enjoyment was not exactly taking the backseat. I kept that a minute before pulling back. </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to answer. “I … what are you doing?” she asked, shocked, but luckily with enough presence of mind to keep it to a whisper. I wasn’t afraid of Aria hearing, but I wanted the fiction to stand. </p><p>“Making sure the princess doesn’t suspect while we have our discussion, of course,” I answered. “We don’t want to make a deal, only to realize we somehow ruined the opportunity in the process, right?” </p><p>She didn’t answer, though whether it was about the convincing nature of our argument, or the merciless nature of my drilling, was not a question with a ready answer. “R-right,” she finally answered, but only after a lengthy delay that included a lot of moans and gasps. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one enjoying our little subterfuge. </p><p>She turned her back to look at Aria, only to see her still blindfolded, otherwise naked, and masturbating. “Don’t worry, she doesn’t suspect a thing,” I whispered to her. “We can discuss our plan.” </p><p>“Who do you work for?” was her first question. </p><p>“Not the elves,” I answered, and felt her tense at the mention, along with a flare of mana. I needed to distract her. Remembering the way she reacted when I brushed against her ear, I leaned forward, and gently bit her pointy ear. The way she tightened around me showed that I hadn’t misread the sensitiveness of her ears. “Calm down,” I whispered between nibbling, my voice throaty. “I’m not against elves either. I have a certain … bird … that wants to sabotage the other birds.” </p><p>“W-what—“ she gasped, this time much louder. Luckily, silencing her was not a chore. I jammed my tongue into her mouth, stealing her words. Enjoyable, but my mind was already on the next steps. </p><p>  When I pulled back, she was still frozen. “Don’t worry, we don’t want to do anything but play screen between them and the royal family, to make sure they don’t find what they are searching for.” </p><p>“And what are they searching for?” she asked, trying not to sound suspicious. </p><p>“I don’t know, that’s above my pay grade. My mission was just to observe the princess, and her naughty habits allowed me to take the opportunity. But my contact seems to be confident that they’ll try to reach the princess.” </p><p>“Really? Not the Queen,” she asked, surprised. </p><p>It took all I had to keep my smirk down at the opportunity that was presented to me. The assassination of the Queen might have multiple functions. I was already planning to frame the elves, but naturally, elves wouldn’t believe that. However, if I inform them about the possibility, and the suspicions of the Phoenixes … things would get much more interesting. </p><p>I frowned, stretching my acting capabilities to the limit. “No. And that’s suspicious. Actually…” I whispered, then I stopped, cutting myself off, like I had made a mistake and slipped something I shouldn’t have. It was a basic trick, one that any spy should ignore, but we had already established that my opponent wasn’t exactly an excellent spy. </p><p>Moreover, I was still sliding in and out of her ceaselessly, which was a believable reason for slipping into something important. </p><p>“Actually, what?” she asked, her voice suddenly sharp, followed by a sudden magical pressure targeting me, enough to break a weaker man in seconds. It wasn’t a hard trick, at least the targeting aspect. The fascinating part was when Aria didn’t even react to the pressure, meaning she was targeting me exclusively without even the slightest slip. </p><p>Her control of magic was even better than my generous estimates. Even with the Tether, I would fail to match it. A sense of inadequateness filled me, which I fought by continuing to fill her core even more aggressively, which, as an added benefit, distracted her a bit more to allow me perfectly frame the answer. </p><p>“We’re trying to get a guard for the Queen, just in case,” I admitted, trying to look scared. “We have some suspicions that … they want to equalize the playing field by putting the Empire into chaos,” I admitted.  </p><p>“Really, do you have any proof,” she asked. </p><p>“Only circumstantial,” I said. “I can bring you there once we properly convince the princess about the situation, and I could show you all the documents we had collected. But, are you sure you want to collect the documents and study them before sending a few guards to protect the Queen? What if they hit tonight?”</p><p>“It’s a risk I’m willing to accept, what’s the chance they’ll hit tonight. I rather not risk my credibility by taking a risky move. We’re going to move in an instant,” she answered, and suddenly cast a spell, hitting Aria with a sudden sleep spell. She might have resisted if it wasn’t for me — well, maybe, as the spell was focused and Aria was distracted — but I was still in the room, and, justifiably, she trusted me to protect her. </p><p>Elven spy was important, but certainly not important enough that I would ever sacrifice my beautiful princess to integrate myself into their faction.  </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention to her move. It was a bad answer, and an even worse move. It revealed her political position to me. Just from her answer, I easily deduced her likely position in the organization by a comfortable margin — not at the bottom, but certainly not at the top — as well as the amount of trust that was extended to her. </p><p>It would have been something else if she was simply mistrusting me, but her reaction showed that she believed me — her pleasure working wonders to skewer her poor decision-making even further. </p><p>What a fun way to subvert a spy. </p><p>“As you wish, I’ll bring you to those documents,” I said, yet, I continued to slam into her. </p><p>“When?” she asked, realizing I was slamming inside her. Though, despite her words, she made no move to push me away, showing I wasn’t the only one enjoying the pleasure. </p><p>“Just as I finish,” I said and I quickened.  “Right now!” </p><p>The panic on her face was simply beautiful. “Not inside —“ she started, but that was all she was able to say as I silenced her with another kiss, filling her with my seed… A fascinating sensation to fill the tightness of mythical ethereal beauty, especially when she was trying to look angry, only to be prevented by her climax…</p>",

    "content": "<p>It took a while for me to leave the stadium, making sure my dear Coach left before I did, but I didn’t waste my time. Instead, I continued the long and thankless effort of trying to decipher the book, to at least develop a general understanding of the subject. </p><p>From what I could decipher, the simpler diagrams were not above my capabilities, especially the ones that include one rune with no interconnection — unlike what I had watched Arthur draw on his padding in blood. </p><p>The writing implied that he used his own blood, some kind of conduit to make sure he could absorb some Intent — though they called it several different terms, including Aether, essence, magic, and mana, in the book, which might be interchangeable, or I lacked the context to understand the difference. </p><p>Either way, most of the warnings were about interacting with the energy I called Intent, and the plethora of danger it could create if one tried to use it directly. It was somehow … polluted, or at least, that was the impression I got. </p><p>I was very lucky that the System allowed me to skip that step completely, cleansing Intent to prevent that side effect from occurring. “It’s fascinating, isn’t it, buddy,” I murmured as I looked at the box that held my pet as I leaned back in my chair in my dorm. “Not only I can do magic, but somehow, I have the ability to cheat.” </p><p>Unfortunately, my tortoise did nothing but shuffle in its place, uncaring of my presence. I shuffled in my place in discomfort as well. Even if the sudden burst of power that I attained came much easier compared to other people’s magical abilities — who were clearly working for it for months, with dedicated organizations — I was aware that the other shoe would soon drop.</p><p>I still remembered the warning of my guide about upcoming disasters. A scary proposition. </p><p>It was why, rather than watching more films to make sure I was prepared for the tricks of my opponent, I was practicing drawing runes. My fingers danced on paper, first practicing repeatedly to get familiar with the patterns. However, an hour into the practice, I started adding just the slightest amount of Intent to the runes. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured after my third repeat, realizing I was starting to get a sense of the meaning of the rune. It was a soft, nebulous feeling, hard to pin down like trying to remember a dream. Curious, I started going through some of the other safe runes — well, as much as I could decipher based on my broken translation, but avoiding words like death, fire, and curse was not exactly a complicated process. </p><p>Instead, focused on runes I could link to enhancements and protection, repeating them again and again on the paper, imbuing more and more Intent to the flow, each repeat giving me a more instinctual understanding of the runes.</p><p>As I practiced, I wondered about the actual meaning of the runes. Were they just random, artificial scribblings that somehow attained magic due to the effort of men, or whether they came from an external source.</p><p>I could imagine my guide and other angels teaching them — though probably not dressed as a dominatrix. </p><p>Though, as I practiced them more and more, I was starting to understand that shape mattered. The intent danced through the structure in a certain pattern, and it probably affected the impact. The protective runes were mostly circular, while the transference runes had more linear shapes. </p><p>Others, like death and fire, had much sharper edges, the shape itself scary enough without the translation. The pattern suggested that, at least to a degree, the shape had some kind of meaning. </p><p>How much it truly impacted me was not a question I could answer right now.  Instead, I repeated the patterns again and again, trying to expand my understanding of the concepts… </p><p>An hour into the practice, I started to get a better sense of direction, realizing that I could affect the rune more than its shape. For the lack of a better term, I could add some flavor to the runes as well, as long as I channeled the Intent through one of my Traits. Interesting… </p><p>“It seems that it’s time to have another experiment, little buddy,” I said as I turned toward the tortoise. He turned toward my voice slightly, and I chuckled, imagining his annoyance. </p><p>I was not the best pet owner. To my defense, I was almost completely sure that the rune I was about to draw on him wouldn’t actually hurt him. It was a protection rune. </p><p>With the decision done, I turned to the practical aspects of it. How to draw. I soon picked a nice piece of stick that would allow me to draw. The ink was a more troubling aspect. I could just infuse intent as I draw, but from the ones I drew on the paper, I realized doing that didn’t keep it for long. I experimented with the ink I had in my room — which wasn’t much, I wasn’t obsessed with calligraphy — but it didn’t hold Intent in a permanent manner. I experimented with water, coke, and even beer, but none of them worked either. </p><p>“It looks like Arthur had a good reason for using blood,” I murmured. I had been hoping that, with the System, I would be able to bypass that, but that didn’t seem to be the case. With a sigh, I grabbed my blade and cut my finger. I didn’t react as I cut my hand, waiting for enough blood to the pool before I used Recovery Intent to cover the wound. I wasn’t afraid of pain itself, but cutting myself was not something I should reach as the first possible solution in any case. </p><p>After flooding my blood with Intent — which held it much better than random ink, or even that lightning-infused wood — I turned my attention toward my little pet. “You’re going to be the strongest tortoise ever, my little buddy,” I said as I grabbed the stick, and started drawing the rune at the center of its back. </p><p>Protection. </p><p>I didn’t know how exactly it would function, but it seemed like the safest bet from the small range of runes I had developed an understanding of. I drew slowly, much more carefully than in my earlier paper experiments, targeting perfection. And, with the assistance of the Precision trait, when I targeted perfection…</p><p>Perfection I would get. I kept my focus on the rune as it slowly grew, the intent dancing as I slowly drew, mixing with the presence of my pet. I was careful, not wanting to ruin my first proper magical attempt where I wasn’t using the System as the shortcut. </p><p>Somehow, it felt significant. It was marking a milestone of my journey, moving from passive to active, symbolizing my choice. I could have summoned my guide and begged for her guidance, and she would have taught me if I bargained with her. I didn’t trust them to teach me really important stuff, but I had a feeling that what I was trying to do didn’t even register to her as a beginner effort. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t trust her, not enough to trust her to set the fundamentals of my understanding about the nature of magic and everything that came with it. She was not to be trusted not to manipulate me. </p><p>Fumbling in the dark was no less dangerous, but I rather burn myself rather than be stabbed in the back. At least, it would be my fault. Was that preference healthy? No, I was mature enough to admit that it was not, but I was also stubborn enough to ignore that realization. </p><p>My mind dancing to the implications, I finally finished drawing the rune. As I put the last line, I felt some kind of … presence settle over my pet, one that felt like some kind of static. To test, I make a little telekinetic push, but it failed to find purchase, just sliding away. I repeated several times, with increased strength, but only when I used enough push to break a door, it reacted, its energy depleting slightly. </p><p>“How interesting,” I murmured, quickly replicating that rune twice, one on the door, one on the window, hoping that it might work against the shadows if they targeted me again. </p><p>Unfortunately, the results weren’t as impressive as I had hoped. It still worked, of course, but, for the lack of a better term, drawing on dead objects didn’t find a … purchase. The sense of clicking that occurred when I drew the rune was missing, and my telekinetic pushes took much more energy. I had a feeling that I had to replenish them every few days to avoid a disaster. </p><p>“Still, the room is not burning in cursed fire and no sudden shadow demon is attacking me. Altogether, a satisfying first experiment,” I murmured as I abandoned the runes, and turned my attention to the computer. On one screen, I started writing some code to make sure I infiltrated the computer systems of the campus — including the emails of the management to allow me to keep track of the political issues — while on the other screen, I watched the tape I had on our opponent, from the perspective of my latest playbook. </p><p>I wanted to be prepared for the match tomorrow. </p><p>After all, I had an important bet riding on the result.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as the opportunity granted by her pleasure tempted me to push forward and take her, I kept myself back. I could have, but that would give the impression that she was just a passive contributor to our little dance, which would give her a chance to turn me down the next time. </p><p>Not to mention, I couldn’t forget that, along with being one of the sexiest women I had ever seen, with curves to die for, Juana was both the head coach and the acting sports director, with many ways of ruining my life. No, I wanted her to help me more. </p><p>And for that, I needed her to beg, and do it desperately. </p><p>The long play was the game. I kept my touch limited to her soles, enjoying her bruised silence interrupted by moans, curious how frequent they would get before she surrendered. Amusingly, she still kept the paper to her face, as that prevented me from understanding her shameful status. </p><p>A minute into the massage, I let my fingers climb up. She didn’t pay attention to that, maybe because it allowed me to adjust the pacing of my touch, maybe enjoying the intensified pleasure.</p><p>The first results arrived soon. She dropped the paper she was holding, revealing her beautiful face to me, contorted with pleasure. I took that as an invitation to climb to her thighs once more, happy to see them part invitingly. Her resistance was fluttering. Yet, for the next five minutes, I stayed on her thighs, driving her crazy, but keeping her on the edge, even as her wetness grew, slowly turning her panties transparent. </p><p> She abandoned her attempts to keep her moans concealed, ringing in the room without suppression. “M-maybe you should go … faster,” she finally admitted, showing just how close she was to the edge after playing with her for such a long time. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, with no attempt to hide my smirk, but didn’t touch her panties. Just increased the intensity of my dance. She caught my gaze, but realized I had no intention of following her order. Her expression tightened. I felt curious, about whether she would ask for more, or if she was angry enough to stop it. No</p><p>She surprised me by not doing either. Instead, her hand moved down and slid inside her panties, The movement of her fingers was too wild to be hidden by her panties. “Cheater,” I said, chuckling even as I stood up. </p><p>“I don’t have time to wait for a slowpoke,” she answered, her tone sharp enough to almost hide her arousal. “I have important things to do, and I can’t waste my day waiting for your lazy massage to finish.” </p><p>Even as she said so, she was playing with herself, the wet sounds were enough to drive me crazy. “Oh, those sound like fighting words,” I said, leaning hard into the taunt. “Are you sure you can handle an actual … massage.” </p><p>“Oh, I can handle anything a little boy as you could deliver,” she answered, taken by the taunt. </p><p>“Oh, those are fighting words,” I said as I leaned against her, feeling her breath against my face. “But I’m giving you an out. At any point, say that you’re a little weak girl, and I’ll stop.” </p><p>“In your dreams,” she answered. </p><p>“Oh, believe me, you are frequently in my dreams,” I answered, the sudden seductive twist enough to make her blush. But that was all she was able to do before the game changed. I grabbed her, and before she could even process it, I pushed her against the desk. With my enhanced strength, ripping her panties was trivial even if they were heavy-duty kind, pulling from both sides to prevent strain.</p><p>And just like that, she found herself on the desk, her bountiful ass pointing toward me, her wetness defenseless. </p><p>I wasn’t in the mood to miss that beautiful, defenseless state. I pushed forward, and her wetness wrapped around me, wet enough to pull me inside. “\"Ugh, too fast!\" she moaned even as I dipped aggressively into her wetness. </p><p>“Oh, really, those words sound like you want to skip the challenge, my dear coach. You know the magic words to stop me,” I said even as I clutched her hips tightly, and began thrusting rhythmically without even waiting for an answer. </p><p>“You’re an asshole,” she gasped. </p><p>I chuckled, carrying a dark promise. “Oh, my dear coach, don’t give me ideas,” I said as I dragged my finger on her puckered hole, enjoying the way she froze. It would be a lie to say that didn’t tempt me. She had an amazing booty, and invading it in such a visceral manner was beyond tempting. </p><p>For a moment, only the constant slaps ruled the room as I invaded her core again and again, but soon she managed to gather her breath. “Try touching there again, and I’ll kill you,” she warned. </p><p>Amusing. I could have pushed her directly, of course, but I had a much more amusing trick in my mind. As I pushed deeper into her, enjoying her moans, I spoke. “Well, daring words. But I have an alternative idea. How about a bet?” </p><p>“Never!” she said. </p><p>“Not even if I win tomorrow’s game,” I said even as I quickened my invasion, enjoying the explosion of sound. “Not a bad bet, right.” </p><p>“Impossible,” she said between moans. “It’s hopeless.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Then, there’s no harm in betting for it, right?” </p><p>I could feel her mind racing as I stretched her tunnel with my merciless invasion. Considering she was already dangerously close to the edge before we started, it was not the best time to bargain, but she was too combative to mention that. </p><p>“Win by two touchdowns —“ she said, only to be cut as I spanked her ass. </p><p>“Don’t be greedy, my dear coach,” I said. “But I’m willing to do for one touchdown, how about it?” </p><p>“Ten points,” she countered. </p><p>“Ten points, and I fuck you in the locker room, right after the team departs, while you dress as a cheerleader of our opponent,” I answered. </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” she said, moaning as I slapped. </p><p>“Tell me if you can’t handle even that slight risk,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“What I will have in return,” she said. </p><p>“I’ll be under your orders for the whole night, doing whatever you want,” I answered. </p><p>She moaned. “Why would I even care about that—“ she tried to argue, but another spank silenced her. </p><p>“I don’t know, the way you are tightening around me like a virgin, or the way you begged to be fucked earlier.” </p><p>Her blush was spectacular. “I … I didn’t want to be fucked,” she whispered. </p><p>“Sorry, my mistake. You just wanted to be fingered like a bored suburban soccer mom. I should have known that you couldn’t handle proper fucking.” </p><p>“How dare—“ she started, only to be silenced again. This time, I pulled out of her, only to flip her. As I slid her again, I ripped her bra off as well, leaving her amazing tits to dangle with each merciless push. </p><p>My hands landed on her breasts. It wasn’t the first time I was seeing her beautiful breasts, but the way they danced as I slammed into her mercilessly was another story. “Damn, it’s hard to believe they are all-natural, coach,” I said. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she said as she closed her eyes, this time interrupted by an intense trembling. She was climaxing, and she was climaxing aggressively. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her a bit more, but I could see her straining under her orgasm. I felt merciful, but not merciful enough to actually stop. Instead, I continued to slam into her as I felt hypnotized by the sway of her tits in a rhythmic dance. </p><p>It was a pure, unadulterated fucking, one that made me glad for all the security measures the room possessed, making sure the voice was appropriately blocked. It was a beautiful, ceaseless dance. </p><p>\"Oh God, yes,\" she began moaning as I leaned forward to capture her tits, playing with her nipples. That didn’t surprise me. Our earlier play at her office showed just how sensitive her breasts had been… </p><p>\"Fuck, Coach, you are getting even tighter. I can’t wait to see just how tight is your ass,\" I said, earning a furious glare. But, despite the response, she said nothing, limiting herself to grunts and moans. \"You love this, don’t you?”</p><p>That earned an answer. “J-just, shut up and fuck me,” she gasped, finally surrendering to her urges. </p><p>“As you wish, Coach. It’s a pleasure to see your face as you cum,” I said, enjoying the shame mixed into her arousal. She was truly a marvelous woman. </p><p>When she climaxed again, I was at the edge of an explosion, so I pulled out at the last moment, spraying her body with my seed, the white contrasting beautifully with her caramel skin. “I’ll kill you for this,” she muttered, barely conscious. </p><p>“Of course, you will, my dear Coach. You just need to win your bet,” I answered with a chuckle as I sat down, ready to help her dress before leaving the classroom. As much as I wanted to watch her struggle, I wasn’t going to let her go alone in a stadium filled with bored football players. </p><p>She was mine, and sharing was definitely not on the table. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The emotions awakened in me as I connected to the System again were… complicated. </p><p>On the one hand, it was an excellent opportunity, one that shouldn’t be squandered. Having access to my skills again, even in a reduced capacity, increased my abilities significantly, and I could use the fortunate access to solve some of the questions I had about magic. A great opportunity. </p><p>Yet, even as I used the information access to parse through the information, a part of me couldn’t help but be dissatisfied with the access. I felt like it was damaging my growing independence, and, at this point, I was enjoying my independence significantly. </p><p>“Less time pondering, more time focusing on practical concerns,” I murmured. Self-assessment of my emotional state might not be a waste, but it was certainly not the time. Not when I could suddenly come face to face with enemies I couldn’t rival. </p><p>I turned my attention to the connection between the System and the environment. The first thing I noticed was that, the connection itself was hampered. It was draining Divine Spark from the environment, but at a much slower degree compared to back in the mainland. It didn’t even drain any mana. </p><p>Though, the reverse was also true. There was no convenient mana or HP recovery, and the skills were … for lack of a better term, faded. The mana conversion feature, for example, was not working. Stats weren’t working either, but they were not just dead like before. Classifying them as half-awake was a more accurate definition. I had a feeling a push would awaken them. </p><p>I didn’t dare to experiment. Instead, I turned my attention to an even more important aspect. Companion module. Interestingly, that was just as dead as the earlier. </p><p>“Isn’t that interesting,” I found myself murmuring, my smile getting bigger. I had already assumed that the Companion process was something like an alternative System, and what was happening here just confirmed it. The connection here with the Main System only… </p><p>And it implied, if I could understand how such a connection cut through the primordial aether, I could replicate it for my unique brand. </p><p>Or even better, create one that was completely under my control… </p><p>With the assistance of my skills, I was already coming up with some really interesting methods such a connection could be created. It would have been weak and ineffectual compared to the main system, but it would be under my control, and my control only. </p><p>What a fascinating possibility. </p><p>I wanted to go upstairs, and find the source of the connection… The only problem, I wasn’t confident enough to deal with the Eternals. Not with my current capabilities. It would have been different if they didn’t have the System, but they did, possibly with a method to keep their Stats at least partially active. </p><p>It was not a situation I was willing to face in a hurry, not without something pushing me. I had already received the answer to my question. The crystals were coming from the Eternals, and they were using the System to devour the Divine Spark. </p><p>I might have thought differently if the Eternals weren’t using the connection with the System to devour the Divine Spark. If that had been the case, raiding their storage, which would have probably held tens of thousands of Divine Spark for my benefit, would have been an incredible strategic benefit. </p><p>Unfortunately, wishing didn’t make it a reality. </p><p>However, just because I didn’t want to go upstairs didn’t mean I wanted to escape either. The sudden connection with the System was convenient, and I started resolving my problems. My first target was Proto-HP, using Biomancy to develop a better understanding, using it in tandem with Tantric — which I always had full access — to examine the internal structure of Proto-HP, to understand how it could be used better. </p><p>I stayed in the basement for three hours, carefully examining the structure, and soon, I attained two important benefits. One, I managed to increase its efficiency. </p><p>Two, I discovered a way to safely put some to someone else. It was not completely solved, and it certainly required some experimentation to understand the limits and drawbacks, but it was a start. </p><p>I might even stay longer, but I felt the wards between the basement and the upper floors flicker, and decided to beat a  retreat. </p><p>It was not the time for a confrontation, not yet. </p><p>However, just because I didn’t seek a confrontation didn’t mean I wanted to leave them alone. First, I pulled a mile away — though, for a chance, I didn’t leave any beacons,  afraid of those getting detected — then pushed toward the surface. </p><p>I examined the castle from a distance, examining its structure. The first thing I noticed was the towers, five of them, one at each corner, and a taller one at the center. Each tower had a crystal at the top, creating some kind of magical cage to protect the castle, but even at a distance, I could see that it was too complicated for it to be the only purpose. </p><p>I was willing to bet those crystals were responsible for the System access. The mana usage was too intense to be just for the defensive effort. </p><p>Unfortunately, intimidating walls and magical towers weren’t the only things I had noticed. I could see dozens of people at the walls, confirming that not trying to breach the castle was the better idea. </p><p>“It’s time to retreat,” I said I retreated back to my tunnel, and as I moved back, I collapsed the tunnel behind me, until I had reached the outer layer. </p><p>I pulled back another mile, then created myself a barebones shelter, just enough to teleport, hold a few detection wards, and other fundamentals, with no care for comfort. Then, outside, I started building a subtle detection ward that was hard to detect. </p><p>Ward, I built even farther, because I didn’t want to alert the Eternals. No, for that purpose, they were the bait… </p><p>I didn’t need to wait for the first bite. Barely two hours since I started establishing that ward, before I even finished, I felt a tug at the ward. I went out, magic around me enough to keep me invisible, enough for me to detect a procession of the undead. Five liches, twenty death knights, and a thousand zombies. </p><p>Not a small army, especially since I could sense the liches were even stronger than I expected. I could have attacked them directly… But I wanted to try something different. </p><p>They were trusting the liches to protect the crystals, their presence glowing against the detection ward. I moved underneath them, until I was near them, and let a thin string of mana toward the crystals … draining slowly. </p><p>It would have been a hopeless task if they had the ability to actually sense Divine Spark. Luckily, none of them actually had that ability, and used the crystals to bypass that. That inability allowed me to act like a thief, and when they finally stepped out of the range of my wards and entered the range of the Eternals, half of the Divine Spark with them belonged to me. </p><p>{+1480 Purified Spark}</p><p>A fascinating amount. Of course, I would have loved to take all of it, but I doubted the Eternals would just wave as those groups got attacked. One or two, I could get away, but more attacks would bring attention that I wouldn’t want. </p><p>Instead, I was happy with the fascinating amount of Divine Spark that I was able to steal with next to no effort. </p><p>I waited for a sign to leave, but before I did, I saw a familiar face. The unlucky traitor, left the wards with a huge frown on his face. “I’ll burn that cheating forest down,” he murmured as he moved toward the forest. </p><p>My wild guess, the Eternals measured the crystal he had and realized it was empty, not giving him what he was hoping for in exchange for his betrayals. I might have let him go away, but I didn’t have any need to be a traitor. </p><p>Instead, halfway in, I attacked him. Before he could even realize my presence, I stabbed him with a pure mana line, and pulled it to steal his Divine Spark. </p><p>{+21 Purified Spark}</p><p>Not exactly strong, but not weak either. </p><p>“W-what’s going on!” he gasped, shocked as he tried to summon mana. If the environment he was in was generous with Nature mana,  he might have put some kind of useless defense, but in the middle of a desolate land with more necrotic mana than nature mana, he was just helpless… </p><p>I appeared in his sight, wearing an illusion to make me look like an elf. “We have a lot to talk about, traitor…” I said, the churning of mana around me enough to turn me into an intimidating sight. </p><p>“I’m not a traitor!” he tried to argue, but a flood of pure mana was enough to intimidate him to keep silent. Of course, it was suspicious for an elf to use pure mana, but I didn’t care about that. </p><p>It wasn’t like he would survive after the interrogation… </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 16</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 16</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 4038}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 4140}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 1794}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I watched the traitor as he slowly drained the Divine Spark from the forest, trying to process the implications of the betrayal. </p><p>Not the betrayal itself, of course. I had long learned people were willing to sell others for their benefit, and concepts like honor and loyalty were mostly transitional. </p><p>I was more interested in the possession of the acorn, and the crystal buried inside to steal the Divine Spark, the exact copy of the one that Undead possessed, but with some organic layer to cover up the similarity. </p><p>I didn’t react, because I wanted to check something first. While the traitor was busy stealing my Divine Spark, I started to examine the remains of the elves that had been betrayed. Particularly, their bags. </p><p>I wanted to see if that crystal acorn was something unique. A tendril of mana that sneaked into their bags soon discovered eight more, confirming that, no they were not unique. Moreover, five of them were filled with Necrotic Sparks, gathered from the undead. </p><p>I drained them. </p><p>{+145 Purified Spark}</p><p>{-5 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>Not exactly a treasure, but nothing to be scoffed at either. Far more than I was losing. </p><p>Once I finished purifying those, I turned my attention to the real issue. Why they were working hard to gather Divine Spark. I had initially assumed that the undead was stealing the Nature Sparks to protect their dominion, but what the elf had mentioned while bragging to his dying friend suggested another option. </p><p>They were selling them to others. For a good price as well, considering the timing of the traitor. The existence of a buyer was troubling, adding another layer to the ongoing battle, not just in the current plane, but also in other planes. </p><p>It explained why I was seeing many planes being invaded by the undead. Some mysterious group was supporting them — of which I had some suspicions, but I didn’t want to overreach and miss something important. </p><p>Worse, that mysterious group was probably playing both sides, providing them with identical containers, and absorbing the Divine Spark from both sides as payment for their services. I needed to target those buyers. </p><p>I just needed to ascertain the identity of the buyer and make sure they were who I was suspecting. Luckily, I had the target to question, a target that probably have the buyer prepared if the intensity of his betrayal was any indicator. </p><p>The perfect target to tail. The only problem, I didn’t want him to drain all of the divine sparks I had on the forest. Easy to solve, I thought as I flooded the crystal with my mana, and triggered its limiter, giving the signal it was full. </p><p>At the same time, I ordered the forest to stop radiating nature mana, and instead channeled their production to the underground storage wards. Together, it gave the sign that all divine spark was stolen successfully. </p><p>“Huh, I expected the forest to have even more,” he said, then shrugged. “Maybe it drained faster than I expected.” </p><p>I said nothing, and waited to see if he would try to create some kind of fake battle. He did not, confirming his intention not to return. Instead, he climbed to the roc, and took flight. </p><p>I didn’t follow him immediately, but instead pulled some necrotic mana from the environment to create a fake battle scene at a small distance and dumped the bodies there. I didn’t want the other elves to get suspicious. Not because I cared about the life of the traitor, but because I didn’t want them going around and blaming the tribal elves. </p><p>I still needed them. </p><p>Luckily, creating a fake battlefield just took a minute, and soon, I was caught up with the traitor. </p><p>His path was interesting. Rather than going toward the center, was going toward the planar edge, which reinforced my initial suspicions about the source. </p><p>After an hour of the persistent following, and soon, and soon, I watched him stop in front of a magically protected area. It was just the first layer, some kind of identification layer combined with an assault ward if the first one triggered. I deciphered it in seconds … because I recognized the magical tradition the wards had been constructed…</p><p>A very familiar tradition. </p><p>The Eternals. </p><p>“Hello, my old friends,” I said, a dark smirk appearing on my face as I came across the source of my trouble at such a great distance from home. I was getting suspicious due to signs of someone purchasing any kind of Divine Spark regardless of the type, as the System had the ability to absorb them — while the Gods either lacked it completely, or their method was inefficient enough to necessitate a trade.  </p><p>Either way, an ambitious ploy. </p><p>Unfortunately, entering there was not exactly an easy job. If it wasn’t for my familiarity with their unique brand of warding, I wouldn’t even dare to try, and even with the experience, I couldn’t just make an attempt. </p><p>It was not a bunch of undead I could just destroy before escaping. They had much more flexibility. “I wonder if they forget to defend underground again,” I murmured as I started to dive down, slowly creating a tunnel. It was the method I had used the previous times I had fought against them with great impact, and I saw no reason for it to suddenly change. </p><p>Unfortunately, the process was much slower this time. I lacked the assistance of my skills and my exaggerated stats, but the wards were still as strong as the ones they had used during their training exercise. Worse, I didn’t have access to Earth mana, which made digging a much slower process. </p><p>Still, I resisted the temptation to hurry up. I slowly dug through the wards, not caring about the fate of the traitor one way or another. Though, once I had reached deep enough, I set up another warded teleportation beacon, and even teleported to check Seldanna. Through our connection, I could feel that she was safe, but I didn’t want to take the risk. </p><p>Luckily, her escorts didn’t have any traitors — or if did, they didn’t have a reason to attack. </p><p>Once ensuring there was no immediate danger, I returned to my long and thankless task of digging a tunnel deep into the underground. A long, exhausting work. Not the physical kind, but the attention I had to constantly pay. I held back any possible complaints, and kept my attention on the task. </p><p>“So complicated,” I murmured once I reached the ward, examining the mana flow. One advantage, I was almost sure that the ward was not established by a caster, but through an item. Even better, it was not as overwhelmingly strong as the defensive wards they had used for the training, nor it had that constant detection feature. </p><p>Together, it allowed me to slowly unravel the weaker defenses underground string by string, creating an entrance that was just big enough for me to stumble through. Once passed, I used the earlier trick, and followed the shell of the ward, moving miles and miles inside. </p><p>Until I finally came against a secondary ward. It was much stronger, and it was trickier to bypass as it was physically integrated into the foundations of the fortress I had found myself in. Still, bypassing was equally straightforward, just required more time. Half an hour rather than a few minutes, but I had enough time to exchange some for safety. </p><p>After some careful magical tinkering, I was inside, in the basement of the castle. I dared to push without more preparation, because the fortress didn’t prevent teleportation — well, it tried, but nothing that couldn’t be penetrated by wasting a few thousand points of mana. </p><p>And, if there was one thing I wasn’t lacking, it was mana. </p><p>Once inside the second ward, I found myself in the bowels of their fortress. Bowels that were protected by layers and layers of wards from the inside. Too bad that my access had ruined most of their access. For a moment, I wondered about the benefits of using copious amounts of explosive wards to ruin their life. Though it was more of a fantasy than an actual objective. </p><p>It didn’t take long for that desire to lose its allure, because soon, I felt a unique pull, one from the System, trying to steal my Divine Spark. However, it was much weaker than the usual pull, a shadow of its endless devouring. Ignoring that had been trivial. Yet, that barely took my attention…. </p><p>I had a much more important issue. I felt a stirring in my soul space, the connection once again alive. And, just like that, I had access to the System once again. </p><p>What a surprise. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 16</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 16</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 2537}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 4140}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 1794}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked to the kitchen to prepare some snacks, I was facing one of the most important decisions of my life. </p><p>Take an aggressive stance to heat up the party, making the day the best day of my life … or stay passive, and see what kind of devious little ploys the girls would come up with to make the day special. And, considering their surprise arrival, I had a feeling that a significant portion of them had plans in that direction. </p><p>Without a doubt, watching them as they enact those plans would be fun. </p><p>I started to prepare the promised snacks, leaving them to splash in the water and enjoy the iced tea, a decision not taken … when I heard footsteps, no doubt there to take the control away from me. One of them wanted not to spend any time. </p><p>Soon, Sarah appeared, her every step optimized to show her assets. Someone didn’t want to waste even a second out in the heat and away from me, it seemed. </p><p>“Hi, Sarah, anything I can do to help?” I said. </p><p>“No, I just came to get something to drink. Not a fan of the tea,” she said as she slowly walked into the kitchen, her expression sharp enough to show that she was still feeling slighted after my decision to leave her at the door after arousing her to the limit. </p><p>I wonder what she would say if she knew, after that, I was greeted by a threesome. </p><p>“The fridge is ready for your orders, my Queen,” I said mockingly, which only earned a scowl. She clearly expected a more explosive reaction, and I had no intention to give her. I was not that easily manipulated. </p><p>She frowned as she walked closer, and stopped when she stood next to me, watching as I prepared the snacks. “You’re quite handy, aren’t you?” she asked. “Preparing it from scratch.” </p><p>“That’s what you have to do when you’re serious about nutrition,” I answered, keeping my attention on the ingredients, like I wasn’t standing next to a sexy girl that might as well be naked considering what she was wearing. </p><p>“Well, it shows,” she said as she gave a smack against my ass, one that lingered far too long to be just friends even before moving down to squeeze my thighs, enjoying my muscles. Her fingers soon turned seductive. </p><p>In my defense, I tried to ignore it, and managed not to look at her. But a certain part of my anatomy, already charged by the earlier show, chose to awaken, straining my swimwear.  </p><p>She just grabbed it without any preamble, showing that her recent experiences with me had started to change her confidence level even more. Not to mention, she had always been the bravest. “I wonder if I can find something to quench my thirst,” she whispered, keeping eye contact as she played with it over my swimsuit. </p><p>I smirked back. It was enough playing. “As I said before, only if you beg,” I answered, enjoying the flash of anger that passed over her face. </p><p>“Beg, never,” she gasped, scandalized, but not enough to hide her arousal. “Your loss,” she declared, though it was not as convincing as she had hoped. Doing her best to ignore me, she opened the fridge and leaned forward, the light creating a halo around her. </p><p>I was sure that the way her bikini top slipped to give me a glimpse of her nipple was a complete accident. </p><p>I said nothing as she leaned more and more, which showed her barely-covered ass in the best light, before she finally grabbed a bottle. “That should … quench my thirst,” she whispered as she slammed the fridge door, and opened the bottle. </p><p>Then, she showed she had one more little ploy. As she drank, she let some of the water spilled down her cleavage, shivering beautifully as the cold hit. I watched as the droplets splashed across her breasts, dripped down her cleavage, and caressed her stomach. </p><p>Kitchen lights hit her beautifully, each droplet clinging to her skin, making her sparkle. </p><p>I had to admit, it was tempting enough for me to change my earlier resolution. Maybe a little kitchen quickie wouldn’t hurt. “You’re playing a dangerous game, Sarah,” I warned her, my voice suddenly sharp. </p><p>Her smile widened. “Oh, I don’t know what are you talking about…” she whispered. </p><p>I gave her a serious expression as I closed the distance. “Of course, you don’t,” I whispered to her ear, nibbling softly. She moaned even as her hands landed on my shoulders, reaching for a kiss. </p><p>Too bad for her I chose that moment to pull back. “Unfortunately, you need to play better to win,” I told her, enjoying the way she shivered as my words slammed into her. </p><p>I grabbed the tray of snacks and left the kitchen, leaving her back, angry and aroused, curious about what she would do. </p><p>“Snacks are here,” I said as I arrived at the poolside, and earned their gazes, but none of them was looking at the tray. No, their gaze was on my midsection, where I was sporting a monster erection. I had deliberately didn’t adjust it, giving them a show. </p><p>Also a warning … Sarah was already working hard, and they needed to join the game quickly if they didn’t want to lose. </p><p>“Come to the pool,” Naomi asked, her voice throatier than necessary. I wasn’t surprised that she was the first one to react. After all, she was the one that had lost against Sarah the last time, and lost spectacularly. “We’re the ones that ambushed you with this party. You shouldn’t work hard like a servant. Let us entertain you.” </p><p>“Sounds tempting,” I said as I placed the tray on the table, and threw myself into the water. </p><p>I swam to the middle of the water, and Naomi swam toward me, just as quick, splashing me with water. “Oh, no, you don’t,” I said, splashing back, and suddenly, it turned into a beautiful, lighthearted game. </p><p>Well, almost lighthearted, I corrected as I watched Carrie fix her top after her third accident, giving me another flash of skin to enjoy. </p><p>Even better, it didn’t take long for the others to catch on. Irene was the first, and her bikini top suddenly lost its strength to contain her amazing bosom, and started to give me more glimpses. Naomi was not too far back. </p><p>Ida was the only one that was still reticent in joining our little game, and Sarah was still absent after her most recent defeat. </p><p>We continued horsing around in the water for half an hour, which was fun and sexy at the same time — like anything else was possible when three shy beauties continued to flash at me to the best of their abilities, and the fact that they still managed to hide it from each other, unsuccessfully I might add, made it even more entertaining. </p><p>After all, neither Naomi nor Irene knew about the full extent of our little game — not that they had any right to complain with their own little tricks. Ida knew much more, but without her camera, she was too shy to take advantage.</p><p>Then, there was Carrie, who was more than happy to play the mastermind. “Oh, why don’t you give little Ida a piggyback. She’s afraid of coming to the deeper parts.” </p><p>That earned matching glares from Naomi and Irene. Whether they were unhappy that it added another player to their game, or they felt Carrie’s words sounded mean, I didn’t know. </p><p>I couldn’t blame them if it was the latter. Without knowing what happened in my house when Carrie visited with Ida, it felt like a catty statement to put her down. With the memories of what Ida had done to Carrie, however, it felt much more playful. </p><p>“I’m here to command,” I said as I grabbed Ida, easily lifting her to my shoulders, her warm presence welcoming as we walked toward the deep end of the pool. </p><p>I turned back with a sound of a splash, only to see Sarah diving. She looked sly, showing she had a way to take revenge. “How about we play a game, girls?” Sarah said. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” Naomi asked quickly, split between dissatisfaction and enthusiasm. She had a clear idea about the lengths Sarah could go to when slighted, but also there were limits to her actions when all of her friends were with her in the pool. </p><p>I was just as curious. </p><p>“Let’s go with something simple, Marco Polo,” she said as she threw a bunched-up fabric at me. </p><p>“Isn’t it, a bit … childish,” Naomi muttered, relaxed and disappointed at the same time. </p><p>Sarah smiled. It was a smile that made Naomi shuffle in discomfort, and made my arousal even more intense. “That’s why we’re going to play that with a twist. Our hero here will be the one that’s seeking always, and whenever he catches one of us, he gets a … reward.” </p><p>“And, what’s the reward?” Irene asked. </p><p>“He removes a piece of swimsuit whenever he catches one, of course.” </p><p>Silence ruled the pool for a moment. “Isn’t it a bit … much?” Naomi cut in. </p><p>“Feel free to get out of the pool if you can’t handle it,” Sarah declared, sharp. Clearly, after her latest defeat, she was not in the mood to play around. Then, she smiled. “And it’s not like it’s much. We have all seen each other naked,” she lingered, then looked at me. </p><p>“Except our host, of course,” she added, unaware she was wrong about that part. “But he’ll be wearing a blindfold, so he doesn’t count. But if you don’t want to play, just climb out of the water.” </p><p>They said nothing as they looked at each other, waiting for the others to make a move. They looked tense, but none of them moved. </p><p>With a chuckle, I put on the blindfold… </p>",

    "title": "Darion's Office 15",
    "content": "<p>Darion had a smile as he drove back to the office despite the silence of his charge, and he didn’t bother hiding it. After all, his bodyguard assignment went much better than he had been expecting with her friend working hard to make things very fun. </p><p>He even caught the sight of a dirty voyeur toward the end, thinking she was invisible on the balcony, watching their aggressive threesome. </p><p>Darion was tempted to see if he could convert that threesome into a foursome … a pity that Mia chose that moment to call him, asking him to return to the office due to an extreme emergency, with several threats of being fired if he got delayed. And, while he normally cursed and closed the call, his new job was proving to be rather more impressive than he would have otherwise expected, so he played along. </p><p>So, with a sigh, he had to cut the fun short and return, leaving the task of dealing with the voyeur for a later date. </p><p>Lily didn’t appreciate the sudden stop any more than he did, and did her to best to delay him by teasing him ceaselessly during the drive. It started innocently at first. He didn’t respond to her advances, and that was not just about handling the journey as fast as possible. </p><p>No, Lily wasn’t the first uppity woman he was dealing with, and he knew that, if he let things slide even a bit, she would do her best to take control. So, even as she teased him exaggeratedly, he didn’t give her the attention she was looking for.</p><p>Even when she got rid of all her clothes as they pulled through the driveway. </p><p>He looked at her, seeing her smile widen. “It’s the end of our journey. Unless you have something to tell me,” she whispered, confident that she had the upper hand. </p><p>“There’s one thing,” he answered, and her smirk widened further, thinking victory was within her reach. “Your other clothes are in the trunk, don’t forget to put them on. You don’t want Mia to catch you and ground you,” he said and left the car. </p><p>The gasp she let out was beautiful, almost enough to make him ignore the value of what he was missing. Patience, he repeated in his mind. By not giving her what she wanted, she was just going to be more desperate to prove herself. </p><p>“H-how dare you?” she gasped as she threw herself out of the car. </p><p>“You need to be straightforward, red? I don’t speak snotty teenager.” </p><p>Her frown got bigger. “How dare you act like you’re not affected!” she gasped. “I know you’re just trying to hold on to hold the upper hand, trying to play me. I’m not a weak girl that’s fallen to that.” </p><p>“Good, because I have a meeting to go to,” Darion said and turned back, walking toward the door. Admittedly, he was feeling bad leaving a naked, horny redhead behind, but that was something he had to suffer. </p><p>Or not, he corrected himself as he heard her aggressive footsteps closing in, realizing he had underestimated her impatience. He acted unaware, and let her grab his arm … only to turn and grab her hard, easily cutting her off her feet. “I don’t like people attacking me from behind,” he whispered, watching her panic melt into arousal as his tone hit her. A rumbling, throaty tone.</p><p>She might be a spoiled brat, but she was smart enough to understand what he was driving toward. </p><p>“I … I’m sorry,” she gasped, her tone equally throaty. With her naked body pressing against his, he decided to revisit some of his priorities. Maybe the meeting wasn’t that urgent. </p><p>“Unfortunately, we need to make sure you learned your lesson, red,” he whispered as he shifted his hold, grabbing her ass aggressively even as he positioned her for a searing kiss, one that she would be completely helpless against. The anticipatory tremble she displayed in his arms was simply beautiful. </p><p>“I …” she whispered as he leaned forward, her lips open, but before she could steal a kiss, he shifted position, grabbing her legs and bringing her toward the closest surface, a lone chair, the perfect surface to teach her a lesson. As he licked her breast, she let out a beautiful moan, confirming his decision to delay the meeting was a smart one. </p><p>“Let’s make sure you’re ready for a punishment,” he said as he lay her down, pressing his fingers against her entrance, dancing to soften her for the upcoming invasion. He still had a meeting, and he didn’t want to be too late. So, a merciless invasion was the best solution. </p><p>“Oh, faster,” she moaned. </p><p>She was lucky, Darion decided. Any other time, he would have slowed down just to remind her he was not for her to order around, but with the time crunch, he wanted to finish as soon as possible. Even more, stopping halfway was not an option, because it would mean he ended up in a boring meeting while dealing with blue balls. More of a punishment for him than for her. </p><p>Unfortunately, before he could even start, he heard a click on the door. Someone was opening. He immediately stood up and stood at the door, ready to kick out the unwelcome visitor while Lily dashed toward the wall, the only place she could hide from the cracked door. Darion was ready to slam the door and finish his job. But, a glimpse of a familiar white jacket stopped him. </p><p>He didn’t expect it was Mia to arrive. </p><p>“So, how can I help you, boss,” he said, warning Lily about the identity of their intruder just in case she wanted to play around. </p><p>“Why are you delaying. I heard the car pull in five minutes ago, yet you’re not in the meeting. Do I need to buy you a dictionary to teach you the meaning of hurry?” </p><p>Darion smirked even as he positioned himself at the entrance, a seductive pose that would make sure she wouldn’t try to burst in. Yet, even as he positioned himself, he couldn’t help but glance at Lily’s naked body, begging for his attention. A true pity. “I was just making sure the car has no problems, boss. I’m a contentious worker.” </p><p>“Enough, stop playing around. We still have a meeting to attend,” she said, her voice panicked. </p><p>“We?” Darion asked, recognizing the opportunity and pouncing forward, more to mess with Mia to pay her back for her intentional cockblock than any real need for some extra money. “From your tone, I’m guessing it’s very important. Any bonus for me?”</p><p>*** *** ***</p><p>Lily was slowly losing control of her breath as she listened to her bodyguard standing at the door, bargaining with her sister about bonus pay while she stood just two feet away, completely naked. It was an incredibly stupid risk to take. If Mia tried to enter, she would be grounded for months, and he would be fired… </p><p>Yet, she never felt this aroused in her life. Just a mistake, and she would be caught. The temptation was too much. She let her hands go free, which dipped down, right into her wet folds, invading her core. </p><p>“A bonus! When you’re late. You’re pushing your luck!” she heard Mia gasping in anger. Normally, her anger would have just made Lily flinch, but with Darion standing right at the door, protecting her, she felt safe enough to delve deeper into her core, enjoying the moment fully. </p><p>The result was beautiful, with pleasure invading her core. Yet, her shock grew more along, surprised Mia was just trying to convince Darion rather than firing him. A surprised gasp escaped her mouth. “What was that?” Mia asked. </p><p>“The car is having a bit of engine trouble, it’s getting too wet,” Darion answered. </p><p>“Is that something cars too?” Mia asked, surprised. Lily found herself blushing, knowing that it was directed at her. Not that she could blame him. She was sopping wet. </p><p>“Of course,” Darion said. “I can show you how it works if you want.” </p><p>Lily felt her legs losing strength, fearing Mia might actually accept the offer. Yet, even as she collapsed, she didn’t stop playing with herself. </p><p>“Enough, we don’t have time to waste,” Mia cut, her tone sharp. “The meeting is too important for us to waste time like this. Follow me!” </p><p>Lily stayed on the ground, playing with herself, wondering what made Mia act like this. She had never seen her act like this, and even Darion’s maddening charisma didn’t explain it. </p><p>Whatever the meeting was, it was something really important…</p><p>“I wonder if Darion could use the opportunity…” Lily found herself muttering. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Lily was angry. </p><p>Or, at least, that was what she tried to convince herself she was feeling as she watched her bodyguard walk away, with her best friend in his arms, lifted easily like she didn’t weigh anything — a fact that would have been surprising if it wasn’t for the fact that she had first-hand experience of his strength.</p><p>Those muscles were not just for show. </p><p>The other feeling she had was exhaustion, which came with the explosive climax she had experienced, the most intense one she had experienced. He was certainly not like the college boys she usually hung around. </p><p>A fact that Mary was slowly realizing if the expression Lily saw on her face was any indicator, the same expression that forced Lily to stand up and walk toward them. She could see him whispering some things in Mary’s ear, who responded rather shocked. </p><p>Lily could imagine what he was whispering, and feeling shocked was entirely Mary’s fault. What did she expect to happen after catching them in a very naughty example of public sex? Though, admittedly, she wasn’t in a position to blame her if that was the case…</p><p>Lily was the one that dared to tease him that much even after she caught him fucking that slutty secretary, thinking that the authority of her sister would have been enough to keep her safe, which was clearly not the case. She smiled sardonically at the realization as she stood up and walked toward them. </p><p>Today had been her defeat. While she had some ideas for the future, they didn’t prevent her from ‘enjoying’ her defeat. </p><p>As she got closer, she watched them play around in a very exaggerated version of foreplay, with Mary leaning against his naked body, letting his hands do whatever they wanted… Including getting rid of her panties, and allowing Mary to match them in nudity. </p><p>Lily watched Mary’s beautiful expression carefully, finding shock and arousal dancing in her eyes, forcing them to grow bigger as she struggled to comprehend what was going on in her own pool party, the greatest evidence that she hadn’t expected things to collapse in that manner. </p><p>Her smile got even wider when she saw his shaft sliding under Mary’s body and forcing her legs to part open, showing just how reckless he wanted to be. A different man might have been afraid of Lily’s reaction, but Darion didn’t even bother looking at her. </p><p>It was supposed to make her angry, but somehow, it made her even hornier. She just wanted to arrive at their side and join the foreplay, with a few ideas on how to drive Mary even crazier. Before she could arrive, however, she saw him lift Mary, who gasped in shock. “W-wait, that’s too soon—“ Mary gasped. </p><p>Lily quickened her steps, realizing what was about to happen as she watched him bend Mary against the chair. She wanted to catch the moment that Mary found herself filled to the brim. </p><p>“Ahh, too big,” Mary gasped, signaling that Lily’s little mission ended up in a failure. She hadn’t been expecting that to happen that easily, which meant she was late. Luckily, not too far away to miss the shocked expression on her face. </p><p>“What’s going on here?” she asked, chuckling. </p><p>Mary seemed to miss her humor. “Lily, sorry, I didn’t expect things too —“ she tried to say, only to gasp in shock as Darion pushed deeper into her. </p><p>Lily pushed Darion back. Or at least, she tried to, but he was immovable. “Trust me and flip her,” she whispered. </p><p>Darion did that, and Mary found herself empty once again, balanced on the raised part of the pool chair. “W-what,” she whispered. </p><p>“He’s giving us a better view, so that I can help, of course,” Lily smirked as she crouched. It was not something she would have done before, but she found it was much easier to ignore her sensibilities once she had been caught by her friend. </p><p>Mary deserved payback, and Lily was not above escalation. </p><p>“W-what, help?” Mary gasped. </p><p>“Of course help,” Lily answered as she wrapped her hand against his monster. Or, more accurately, tried to wrap, but it was thicker than she could succeed. “You’re always a little princess. Can you really handle that monster?” </p><p>Mary’s expression of annoyance was beautiful. “Of course, I can handle it. I’m not weak like you. I can handle more than you can,” Mary answered rapidly, her expression sharp. </p><p>“Oh, how about a little display, then,” she said as she looked at Darion. “Since you’re my bodyguard, you need to listen to my orders,” Lily said, as sharp as she could manage, but only got an indulgent smirk back. Luckily, her order wasn’t hard to follow. “Fuck her hard!” Lily said as she pulled back. </p><p>Darion didn’t answer, but that wasn’t needed. The hungry way he grabbed her legs and pulled closer was answer enough. Then, the sound of their hips colliding exploded, ramming Mary mercilessly. </p><p>“So, how about that,” Lily said smugly as she watched Mary lose any hope of answering, busy moaning loudly. Seeing she had no intention of answering, she leaned forward, both getting a better view of the show, and giving Darion a better view of her naked body. </p><p>Just because he was distracted didn’t mean she wanted to be forgotten. </p><p>“So, does this redheaded slut has any preferences,” Darion suddenly asked as he spanked her. Mary tried to moan in protest, but between her cries of pleasure, it went unremarked. </p><p>“Oh, she always likes to be on top. She says the control it gives to her is important,” Lily said. It was a bit of exaggeration, maybe, but she could see how exactly it would affect Darion. </p><p>“Oh, control, you say,” Darion answered, his smirk almost enough for her to pull him back and take Mary’s place, but she help back. Mary deserved her punishment. “Let’s see how well she will control me.” </p><p>Mary barely managed to gasp as they changed position, and found herself on top of Darion. Unfortunately, Darion’s grip on her ass, and the merciless push of his hips, made sure that repositioning could never give her any advantage. </p><p>Fascinated by the move, Lily leaned forward, watching his shaft disappearing into her friend repeatedly, her moans loud enough to deafen her, her core burning in desire. </p><p>She lost the track of time as she listened, but when Darion flipped her once more, she lay next to her bestie, and joined the fun by mauling her tits. “Wow, girl, I didn’t know they were so firm,” she whispered. </p><p>“S-shut up,” Mary answered, the best she could do between incredible moans. </p><p>Their little encounter was going fun, far better than she expected when Mary said that the house would be empty for the whole day. Though, Lily still couldn’t believe an exchange student like Mary managed to arrange a stay in a mansion, just because the owner was bored living in a foreign country and wanted some company… </p><p>Luckily, she was not at home, but on some kind of shopping trip. Otherwise, she could never miss the commotion. </p><p>***</p><p>Fatima didn’t know what to feel as she watched the show that was going on in front of her… She was supposed to be shopping, but after some late night, she decided to sleep late, a decision that was interrupted by the cries coming from her garden. Curious, she went out…</p><p>Only to see a shocking sight. Her young house guest, and one of her friends … both under a man, were being railed again and again.</p><p>Fatima was not a virgin, certainly not, but she had never seen anything like that, leaving her in a mess of confusing feelings…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Ultimately, I decided to play the obedient servant and ask Aria for her opinion. “What do you think the next punishment for our clumsy maid should be, my beautiful princess?” I asked Aria. </p><p>She shivered in excitement even as our unfortunate spy stilled under us. “Well, you have worked hard to prepare her. It’ll be a pity to skip the fun,” Aria whispered, pulling slightly back to allow me to move, but still sitting on her back to keep her from moving. </p><p>Aria’s presence midway made it harder for me to watch our little spy, so I telekinetically moved a mirror. Our spy didn’t react, which was evidence of the confusion she had reached. I hadn’t kept the spell particularly subtle, and expected her to react. Yet, she didn’t even register. </p><p>The reason, I understood was when I started watching her face in the mirror. </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer, only to stop with a resigned expression halfway, an expression that repeated several times as I pulled my fingers back. There was no doubt she was seconds away from losing her anal virginity, but her pleasure-addled mind was unable to come up with even a single argument to stop us. </p><p>And, clearly, it wasn’t only the fear of ruining the mission that kept her back. With her eyes bound, she was unable to catch my gaze, but I could easily imagine the helplessness that would have danced in those depths if that hadn’t been the case. </p><p>Altogether, a beautiful attempt to suborn a spy, I thought as I pressed against her puckered hole. “Take a deep breath,” I said mockingly even as I pushed, the crown slowly disappearing despite her tightness. My earlier play with my fingers had worked well to stretch her, but not enough to prevent a cry filled with pain. </p><p>Her hold was tight, but her position didn’t allow me to truly enjoy the perks of her body. So, I gestured for Aria to abandon her seat. She jumped off, her tits swaying beautifully enough to create a temptation to stop what I was doing and focus on them instead. </p><p>She was truly beautiful. </p><p>I didn’t do it, of course, as not only my elven spy had the beauty to rival her, but also broke her strategic priorities. Aria, quick to capture my gaze, sat on a nearby chair and started playing with her tits to give me the visual stimulus I required. </p><p>As I enjoyed that, I jumped behind the couch, carrying our spy with me. “What—“ she gasped at the sudden motion, but I grabbed her hands before she could grab her blindfold. </p><p>Her legs were already trembling, and if she wasn’t holding against the back of the couch, she would have collapsed from the exertion of pleasure. “That’s the other part of your punishment, try to stay on your feet,” I warned her. </p><p>Then, I pushed, deeper and faster than it would have been reasonable under more ordinary circumstances, for which our current situation did not qualify. Not only I was taming a slutty spy, but also I was burning with my own desires. </p><p>I put my hand on her mouth, as a makeshift gag, but my aim was not to silence her. No, I realized that, even as I was pushing into her tightness, she was trying to hold her cries back. I hoped that the presence of my hand would give her an impression of silence and allow her to cry for more. </p><p>I let the temptation to abuse her tightness rule me by pushing it deeper. It was dangerous, but considering not only I was taming a spy, but also had the presence of the greatest healer of the Empire in the room — busy torturing her nipples — I had the luxury of taking risks. </p><p>I kept it inside, allowing her to get used to my raging presence as I drilled her mercilessly. She cried, moaned, and trembled, but overall, took it better than I expected. I decided to push for more, but not by getting even faster. No, brute force, however fun, had its limits. </p><p>Luckily, there were always mental aspects. “It’s the first time you’re taking it in the ass, right,” I whispered, and she stilled. I wondered if my words did so, or if my lips, brushed against her beautiful, pointy ear. The bottom part, to not to reveal I was aware of her true identity, but to tease her with the possibility of being caught. </p><p>The way she shivered against my slamming was beautiful as fear froze her. From the expression of pure dread, it wasn’t hard to deduct she was fearing being caught. Understandable, especially after all her sacrifices to stay concealed. </p><p>“Answer me,” I ordered even as I slapped her ass again, breaking her stillness. </p><p>“Yes,” she nodded, shaking. </p><p>“Yes, what? I want you to answer in a complete sentence. </p><p>“But—“ she started, only to be silenced by a spank to her ass. Her silence stretched for a minute — and several spanks — before she dared to speak again. “It’s my first time … taking it in the ass,” she admitted beautifully. </p><p>“See, was that too hard,” I whispered, once again brushing against her ear, tempted to tease her, the pleasure growing for me as well. Dangerous, but to an acceptable level. “Next question. Are you enjoying your treatment?” </p><p>Her silence stretched for a while more. She was too stressed, I decided. I brought my hand between her legs, and started teasing her core. The first cry that escaped her mouth was a pure surprise, but the following one was pure pleasure.</p><p>The double assault worked wonders. </p><p>“Answer me, or I stop,” I threatened her. </p><p>“Yes, I’m enjoying it,” she gasped even as I brought my head down, and started nibbling her neck, her sensitivity incredible. I was fascinated that, at this point, the threat of stopping was much more effective than all the alternatives. </p><p>A fascinating development indeed. Maybe taming her would be easier than I expected. </p><p>My assistance tightened her ass, allowing me to enjoy more as I pushed deep into her tightness mercilessly. </p><p>“Do you want me to fuck your ass even harder, whore,” I asked. A little crasser than I expected, but her reaction to rough treatment suggested that she might react that even more. </p><p>“Yes, sir, fuck me even harder,” she answered, this time the answer coming without a delay. I caught Aria’s gaze, smoldering with pleasure. I could see that she wanted to join, but since she was a sweetie, she didn’t do it without my express permission, limiting herself to enjoying the show. </p><p>I picked up speed, impaling puckered hole repeatedly as her cries rose unbidden, filling the room enough to be glad for our privacy. </p><p>I wished I could see her expression, but her blindfold was still on, blocking her sight. </p><p>“Your maid career is certainly a waste. Maybe you should have been a whore. With this ass—“ I said, stopping to spank her, “you would have made a true fortune.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she answered with a moan, her pride forgotten as she was lost in the pleasure.</p><p>“Well, maybe you should be my private whore,” I whispered even as my fingers slipped into her core. I was pushing a bit more, but the temptation to go was too hard to ignore. Especially with Aria with one hand between her legs, furiously playing with herself, her moans more than spectacular. “I’m sure I have enough to keep you satisfied.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she moaned, her voice pure pleasure as she tightened around me. It was enough to challenge the last scraps of my resistance, the need for a climax growing more intense in me. My ego didn’t allow me to be the one that got defeated, however, so my fingers started to play even more. </p><p>She started shuddering, her tightness enough to show her explosive climax even without her juices drenching my fingers. I let go, filling her tightness with my seed aggressively — my seed, which was filled with tantric energy to further intensify the pleasure she was getting from the moment, her shudders strong enough to make a weaker woman fade into sleep. </p><p>Still, she wasn’t unaffected. Her legs trembled badly, and she collapsed on the floor, to her knees. I went down with her, keeping my shaft inside as it throbbed, still enhancing her pleasure. </p><p>Soon, her moans turned masterful. Tempted, I leaned forward to tease her ears once more, happy with her sensitivity there. A little post-coital action. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t expect her to lean forward in panic, and suddenly, I found myself playfully biting the pointy part of her ear. She stiffened, much worse than I expected. She had just realized that her disguise was compromised</p><p>I fucked up. </p>",

    "content": "<p> The idea of pushing her down against the desk was tempting. Too tempting to ignore, especially since I had managed to awaken a very unhealthy incarnation of pride in my dear coach. I just needed a tiny excuse to push for more. </p><p>And until then, I did my best to look hesitant and fearful, like her half-naked state allowed Coach Juana to hold the advantage. A fascinating little dance. </p><p>“So, about this tactic,” I pointed to one of the papers which had one of the most complicated tactical schemes I had prepared for the current game. I had little hope of using that, and it was there to test the limits of Teaching traits rather than any expectation of usefulness. </p><p>However, as I pointed that, I stretched my arm, making sure I had revealed my muscular chest. Normally, that would have gone unnoticed, as Coach Juana was a conditioning coach and familiar with the visual aspects of my body, but that didn’t prevent her blush. </p><p>Context mattered, just like the difference between swimsuits and lingerie. Even if the latter covered more skin, it would still look sexier and more suggestive. The same went for my ‘accidental’ glimpse. </p><p>She tried to hide her attraction as she tried to look focused on the paper, but she asked me several questions that made me lean forward to get more glimpses. And, more importantly, to maintain the facade, she had to pay a lot of attention to the tactic itself — which was dangerously complicated — as well as her own tricks to convince me to keep giving her glimpses. As a consequence, she started to pay less attention to my hand that was still on her back, saying nothing as I slowly weakened the facade of a massage. </p><p>Instead, I caressed her back, which was greatly different than massaging, allowing me to tease her sensitive spots with much greater effectiveness than I might have otherwise achieved. Soon, her body was burning with pleasure, but, she hadn’t noticed until she let out a loud moan that did wonders for me. </p><p>“Is something wrong?” I asked, doing my best to look concerned, yet just as she was about to answer, I dragged my finger along her spine, even using a touch of Intent to give her some supernatural pleasure. She moaned even louder. </p><p>“N-no, just a cramp,” she muttered in a panic. </p><p>“Your thigh?” I asked just as I repeated the trick, forcing her to nod in answer. A mistake, she realized only when I moved in front of her and put my hands on her legs, and started working on her right leg. </p><p>“It’s not —“ she tried to say, only to be interrupted by another moan. </p><p>“It’s worse than I thought, let me remove your sweatpants, so I can access the skin,” I said to her, and before an answer could be given, pulled her sweatpants down. “You’re wearing shorts, right?” I asked as I did so, forcing her to nod again. </p><p>“Yes,” she found herself saying, too late to keep her shorts on. It took all I had not to celebrate as I had seen what was underneath. Technically, she was wearing shorts, though they were more like stretchy yoga pants that ended very high on her thighs. Combine that with their thinness and the lack of underwear — very noticeable — it was obvious that she had no intention of actually removing her outfit for exercise unless it was in the privacy of her home. </p><p>Her core was particularly striking, her wetness very noticeable. Yet, in an effort to avoid my gaze, she didn’t look down, missing the erotic sight she was providing for me. “Close your eyes and focus on the absence of pain,” I said as I pressed my fingers to the naked parts of her thigh, the soft sensation of her caramel skin incredible. </p><p>The pleasure was high, but still, I expected her to put some token protest. She did not, and just murmured obediently before closing her eyes. More importantly, her legs parted open, giving me an even better glimpse of her core. Things were getting naughtier, and she wasn’t doing anything to stop things. </p><p>I focused on her inner thighs to ‘destroy’ the cramp, each second making her arousal smell more intensely, her moans beautiful and soft. I expected her to try and stop, as even with the previous tricks, it was too early for someone as reticent as her to allow me to touch her body recklessly. Yet, she did nothing, which was why I was surprised. </p><p>It must be even more than I expected since she had visited someone’s bed to react this enthusiastically once things reached this stage, even with my tricks. After all, my tricks were merely optimized to distract, yet she was already losing her coherence. </p><p>I had no problem following her indirect invitation, doing my best to conceal my excitement. She shuffled in her seat to lean deeper in the chair, even pushing the back of the ergonomic seat so that she got a diagonal position. Combined with the way she raised her head, it hid her expression from me completely. Luckily, I didn’t need to see her face to read her mood. Her moans were already giving a real-time update on her situation, </p><p>As she started to react to the pleasure, I started to abandon the trickier aspect of our game and focused on her pleasure in a purer manner. Her body begged for more as I let my hands move upward slowly, each circling giving her more pleasure. She moaned once more. </p><p>“So, any more questions about that tactic,” I suddenly asked, and she stiffened under my hands, as she had just remembered where she was. Maybe she actually did. </p><p>“I need to study a bit more,” she said as she tried to move, but my hands landed on her thighs to prevent her from moving, which, with my strength, was extremely easy to achieve. She looked at me, shocked, and I caught her gaze, smirking. The widening of her eyes was beautiful, showing the realization that she had been played … again. </p><p>She could have asked me to stop, but it was hard to do with her body rocking with growing pleasure, the climax tantalizingly close. I could read the panic and confusion on her beautiful face, followed by a subtle surrender. </p><p>With a desire to avoid my gaze, she grabbed the paper and raised it in front of her face, creating a convenient concealment for herself. </p><p>I continued to caress her body as an obedient servant. Her body was tempting enough to make that ‘indignity’ easy to suffer, and the biggest question in my mind was about the speed of the massage before I reached my ultimate aim. </p><p>She kept her face hidden with the paper, but unfortunately for her, it wasn’t soundproof, and her moans reached my ear no matter how much she wanted to keep them suppressed. My fingers moved higher, invading the area that was covered with her slutty shorts, her wetness turning a dangerous area half-transparent in the process. And,, the material was thin enough to be non-existent as far as isolating my touch, her moans getting stronger the higher I moved. </p><p>At this point, I had no intention of wasting the beautiful opportunity I had. Yesterday evening had been the limit of my mercy. My only regret was I didn’t have any massage oil with me to spice up the situation. However, just because I intended to finish it didn’t mean I was in a hurry. I felt her tense as I approached the truly dangerous areas, so I reversed my path immediately, and after a quick journey, I was massaging the soles of her feet. </p><p>It helped me greatly. She was under the impression that my playing with her feet was safer than her inner thigh, which was incorrect. There were a lot of nerve points that responded to my fingers there. Yet, it worked to subvert some of her attention as she focused on the pleasure she was getting, enjoying my touch without conflict. After all, it was supposed to be a submissive position, and if the fleeting glare she threw at me while thinking she was hidden was any indicator,  she was more than ready to believe that as well. </p><p>Or at least, trying to convince herself to that, as the alternative would mean she had to stop the massage — which would leave her right on the edge. She hoped that the massage would soon allow her to topple to the other side. </p><p>A vain hope, as I was determined to keep her on the edge until she begged…</p>",

    "content": "<p>As Carly pushed forward, an unbelievable tightness wrapped around my shaft, one that was far superior to her earlier little flare, making me throb in excitement. </p><p>“Ohh,” she moaned as she continued to push after a brief pause, one that marked her graduation from virginity, the temptation overwhelming. Though, even that brief pause was the closest I got to actual torture, my mind filled with a desire to push forward, to complete the process spectacularly. </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t the only one dealing with an overwhelming wave of arousal, and despite the discomfort of the unfamiliar presence and her spectacular tightness, she didn’t waste any time before started rocking back and forth, her beautiful face giving me a range of expressions, each more beautiful than the last. </p><p>Accompanied by her moans, of course, loud enough to hurt my eardrums, but I was more than happy to listen to them. </p><p>Despite the explosive show she was putting on, she was barely able to take a fraction of my length inside her, though considering she was a virgin just a minute ago, I was willing to let that slide. </p><p>So, I suppressed the temptation to push forward recklessly and teach her the real meaning of fun, letting her get acquainted with the process first. </p><p>After all, that cursed storm was at least useful for something. </p><p>That didn’t mean I was entirely passive. I wanted to kiss her pouty lips, but not as much as I wanted to continue listening to her desperate moans. I compromised by leaning forward, and started raining kisses on her neck with an intensity that would rival the blizzard outside. </p><p>It made her moans get even more intense, though, amusingly, her eyes stayed closed. The movement of her hips, on the other hand, changed. </p><p>They were still steady and rhythmic, shockingly so considering her inexperience, but I assumed all the modeling experience gave her the ability to move steadily even under unfamiliar situations. </p><p>Such as lying under me, desperately trying to take more of my shift inside her. </p><p>Of course, steady didn’t mean monotone. As her familiarity increased, her movement started to change in two ways. One, her speed continued to increase, teasing me faster and faster. And two, her movements devoured more and more as she slowly got used to the sensation. </p><p>Luckily, our extended foreplay worked wonders to enhance her wetness to a spectacular degree, turning the process into a smooth adventure.  </p><p>I didn’t just enjoy her rocking passively for long. Soon, she parted her legs invitingly and raised her hips, wordlessly asking me to start moving. </p><p>Who was I to reject her beautiful demand, I thought as I pushed my hips forward, meeting with her movement, invading her wetness aggressively. Her response was to moan even louder, which made me quicken my beat. </p><p>I was still careful not to hurt her too much, letting her get used to the pace. She wrapped her arms around me, pulling me deeper inside with greater urgency. </p><p>“Are you sure, sweetie?” I said rather than following her wordless demand immediately. </p><p>“Yes,” she whispered, the contrast between her explosive moans and her barely audible whisper making me chuckle. It was funny watching how her selective shyness worked.  </p><p>“Can you speak louder, sweetie?” I asked, enjoying the way she avoided my gaze. “I can’t hear you.” </p><p>It took a moment for her to answer, and even then, it was barely louder than her first attempt. “Faster, please. Do it … faster.” </p><p>“Who am I to reject the request of a supermodel, I’m here to serve,” I said teasingly, but if she had any problems with my teasing, I didn’t hear because the moment I finished my words, I leaned forward, capturing her beautiful lips in a searing kiss. </p><p>As I did so, my hands landed on her shoulders, pinning her in place, and my hips started to move much harder. </p><p>She reacted by wrapping her legs around my waist, once again showing the extent of her surprising strength, imprisoning me inside her. I could have escaped if I wanted, but it wouldn’t be an easy challenge. </p><p>Fortunately, escaping was not something I wanted to do in the first place. </p><p>Her moans rose once more as my hands slid away from her shoulders to her breasts, once again exploring their great expanse. And, their great sensitivity hardly helped her to resist the pleasure. </p><p>Her tightening declared her climax, and her trembling showed the growing impact… </p><p>I pulled back from the kiss, mostly to listen to her gasps and moans without any interruption, her cries more beautiful than the greatest song.</p><p>Giving our next-door neighbor a lesson in singing… </p><p>Yet, her climax wasn’t a reason for me to stop, but intensify my rhythm. I slid my hands to her hips, raising them a bit more before I started drilling mercilessly, finally truly invading her depths. </p><p>It was a touch uncomfortable, adding a layer of pain to her cries, but her gaze showed that she had no problems with that addition — which wasn’t entirely surprising after her reaction to spanking and her internalized obedience.  </p><p>Maybe I should send a bouquet to her agent. She had managed to train Carly excellently — unaware that a freak accident would deliver her to a horny scientist. </p><p>And, the addition of pain worked wonders to keep her awake under the rush of pleasure. </p><p>Though, even with that, I was surprised by the first words she managed to utter after her explosive climax. “Harder,” she begged. </p><p>If I was in a different mood, her reaction might have surprised me, but as the pleasure invaded my brain, I just smirked in anticipation. “As you wish,” I said as I grabbed her hips, and started drilling her mercilessly. </p><p>The sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room, my grunts mixing with her moans as our fun turned into something explosive… Something overwhelming… </p><p>Yet, as I felt an awakening of my vigor, ready to turn into something physical, I didn’t slow down. We were well past the point of savoring the experience. It was time for a desperate rush toward the finish line. </p><p>“It feels … amazing!” Carly shouted recklessly, lucky that we were literally the most deserted part of the world, with only one person to hear our commotion. I had no problems with Maria listening to our show — though I had a feeling Carly had just forgotten about that part. </p><p>As I looked at her beautiful face, contorted with pleasure, I guessed even remembering her own name would require a monumental effort. </p><p>As Carly stretched her lungs to the limit to leverage the lack of civilization, I just moved faster and faster, trying to stretch the pleasure to the limit before the inevitable end arrived. </p><p>One that wasn’t particularly distant. </p><p>As that moment knocked, I straightened my posture, catching a sight of her beautiful figure, her skin flushed, her mouth wide with moans, her eyes filled with pleasure… </p><p>Her beautiful tits dangling freely with each push, stroking my desire even further…</p><p>And just like that, I wasn’t as angry as the ruined experiment. I doubted that I would share that opinion once the pleasure was replaced by exhaustion, but at that moment, it was impossible for anyone to choose science over the beautiful blonde busy climbing toward her second climax. </p><p>“I’m cumming,” I warned her despite my desire to fill inside her without a warning, giving her that choice. But, when her only response came in the form of her tightening legs, I didn’t try to change her mind as well. </p><p>She was a big girl, and she could make her own decisions. </p><p>Even if those decisions were extremely poor — not that I could blame her, as it was hardly a better decision from my end. </p><p>And just like that, I filled her to the brim, the invasion of the warmth enough to trigger an even more spectacular climax in her… </p><p>I tightened my grip on her hips to prevent myself from collapsing under the greatest pleasure I had ever felt, enjoying the desperate tightening of her walls, trying to milk the last drop off me. </p><p>“So, how well did you enjoy our services in the Antarctic hotel,” I whispered mockingly after a few desperate breaths as I collapsed next to her. </p><p>No answer came, which was rude. I looked at her, to see whether she deserved a little spanking after our little adventure… </p><p>Only to see her breathing softly, unconscious, overwhelmed by pleasure. </p><p>“Not bad for her first time,” I said as I pulled the cover on us before hugging her, closing my eyes, the sound of the storm raging outside just a lullaby to my ears… </p><p>Maybe I should continue the sleep that been interrupted rudely…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Carly’s agent followed her initial question with a detailed schedule, speaking without interruption. </p><p>And, I used the opportunity to move Carly to a more fun location. After I finished drying her, I wrapped the towel around her — but just to her waist, leaving her beautiful tits naked for my own gratification before I put my hands on the small of her back, gently leading her forward. </p><p>I wanted to give an intimate show if Maria was observing us, wanting to trigger her jealousy even more. Pity, she wasn’t around to see that. </p><p>Distracted by her agent’s explanation, Carly didn’t even notice I was leading her to my room rather than hers, even when I closed the door behind her. </p><p>I left her alone for a moment, because I wanted to deliver the next part of the prank on Maria. I remember her scared reaction as I mentioned the potential for the storm to get stronger. I quickly dashed to the storage room and dislodged the same noise-isolating piece that was unstable due to my old roommate’s intervention. </p><p>And just like that, the sound of wind intensified into an explosion, reminding me of the intensity of the storm outside, and just how scary nature could be in the middle of Antarctica. </p><p>The corridor wasn’t as loud, but still, the change was considerable. The constant background noise was annoying, certainly not something I would suffer for more than a day — or two at most — but considering it gave me a chance to mess with my forceful guest, I was willing to suffer it for a day. </p><p>When I returned to my room, Carly was already sitting on my bed, her full attention on the explanation of her agent. She was even taking notes in the notebook I kept on my bedside — in case inspiration hit in the middle of the night — which showed that she was treating her agent’s words very seriously. </p><p>“Why are you here?” she asked while her agent continued to speak, suggesting that she was focused enough that she was yet to notice it was my room. </p><p>“Because it’s my room,” I answered, more than happy to give her that information, amused by the way she looked around in shock. </p><p>Even more amused by the way she wrapped her arm around her chest, just realizing her state of undress. </p><p>A whimper escaped her mouth as I walked closer, her attention slipping away from her agent. “W-what are you doing,” she whispered. </p><p>“Making sure you’re properly dry, of course,” I said as I pulled her towel away, and replicated the trick I pulled on the bathroom, but this time without the towel to restrain my touch. </p><p>She opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, her agent helped me. “Are you listening,” she said. </p><p>“Y-yeah, of course. Continue,” Carly answered automatically as she pressed the button. I waited until her finger lifted to continue caressing her legs, teasing her inner thighs. Which proved to be a good choice, as she let out an explosive moan, proving that, while her amazing breasts were the most sensitive part of her body, they were hardly the only aspects of her body with spectacular sensitivity. </p><p>The poor girl was split between suppressing her moans — very unsuccessfully, I might add — and listening to her agent’s detailed directives, doing her best to note her directives between her moans. </p><p>Moans got stronger and stronger as I climbed higher up on her beautiful body. The only compromise I did was to bypass her core, and this time, it was not about fear, but leaving it to the proper time. Instead, I caressed her smooth belly, enjoying the contrast between her soft skin and surprisingly tight core underneath. </p><p>She let a relaxed sigh between her moans as I bypassed her core, so much that she failed that my inevitable target was her breasts, though she realized that the moment I teased her nipples, her beautiful body stiffened. </p><p>I stayed on her breasts, enjoying her growing arousal, treating her sensitivity as an easy mood. “Please,” she gasped as her agent continued to speak in the background. “I — I need to listen to her, or she’ll get angry.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I let my hands climb up, but her glee was short-lived as I grabbed her hips and flipped her. She found herself lying on my bed, her face buried in the bed. “Let me help you,” I said as I took the pen from her hand, and put the notebook on her back. </p><p>My right hand was busy taking note of her explanation while my left one focused on her ass, caressing its wide expanse, enjoying the way she trembled under my fingers. </p><p>“Don’t move,” I warned her, my tone once again stiff enough to freeze her, while my left hand delivered a loud spank on her ass, even harder than the previous punishment, echoing against the walls. </p><p>And, she just lay there obediently. </p><p>However, unlike the previous time, I didn’t bother concealing the next move of my fingers, caressing the area they had just landed before slipping into her wetness, and making her moan. </p><p>“That’s too—“ she started, only to receive another spank.</p><p>“Don’t move, you’re going to ruin the notes,” I warned. As far as excuses go, that was one of the more pointless and mercurial ones. But at this point, they didn’t have to be actually real. Just the tone was enough to keep her immobile, the constant rambling of her agent making her even more obedient than usual. </p><p>Even as my fingers explored her most sacred spot. </p><p>Pity my hand was still busy taking notes, limiting my actions, but luckily, it was something I could do without distracting myself too much from my real task. A life filled with education — high school, college, master's degree, and a five-year doctorate, not to mention the events and conferences I attended as a post-doc — made sure that note-taking was an activity as automatic as breathing… </p><p>Allowing me to give the proper focus on the trembling beauty under my fingers, each second pushing her closer to a climax. </p><p>Her moan gained an even more beautiful quality as I shifted my position, and put my weight over hers, but the panicked whisper that she let out didn’t surprise me the slightest. </p><p>“I’m a virgin,” she gasped. </p><p>After her reaction to my touch, it was rather unsurprising, but I didn’t tell her that, feeling she might find it insulting no matter how I phrase it. And the situation was simply too beautiful to ruin it. </p><p>“And, would you like to graduate from that status,” I whispered as I pressed my shaft against her entrance, but stayed at the entrance. “I promise it would be fun.”</p><p>“I can’t,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, finding her selection of words interesting, especially since I could feel the lack of conviction behind the answer. “Religious reasons?” I added. </p><p>“N-no,” she whispered. “Margaret says that as a model, my reputation of purity helps me to become globally famous.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said, not bothering to ask who Margaret was, as she had turned toward the walkie-talkie as she said that. Considering the extreme authority her agent was displaying over her life, not surprising either. “But you know that actual purity and illusion of purity are two different things. I’m sure a smart girl like you would be more than capable enough to fake that for the camera? Am I right?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered, her stammer getting even more as I changed my position, my shaft sliding between her thighs repeatedly rather than sliding inside. </p><p>No matter how tempting it was, I didn’t want to do it without her express permission. Of course, I didn’t stop either, as I actually wanted to convince her for that decision. “This should be alright, right?” I added. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she whispered before falling silent, enjoying my treatment, pushing her closer and closer to a climax. </p><p>But not letting her arrive, she realized after five minutes of torturous dance. Ironically, it was a point of pride for me that I didn’t stop taking notes — though I was impressed by just how long her agent could drone on without a response. “P-please,” she whispered. “I need to…” </p><p>I chuckled as she failed to ask for a climax explicitly, feeling too shy to do so even as she lay under me, wet and naked. </p><p>“Do you want me to take that last step,” I asked. </p><p>“I … can’t,” she whispered, but even the sliver of conviction she managed to infect earlier was one. She was begging me to convince her. “She will be … angry,” she added. There was no doubt about who she referred. </p><p>“What’s she going to do, visit us,” I said as I reached the walkie-talkie, and flipped it close. Since it was connected to the central system, no warning directly went to the other side. Only after she would ask another question, she would realize there would be no answer. </p><p>“Now, what’s your decision?” I asked.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, nor that she needed to. Not when she aligned herself and pushed back…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I stayed hidden in the camp as I watched the elven reinforcements split into the three groups  — the smallest escorting Seldanna and the biggest going toward the border — fascinated by just how quickly things could change in a few seconds. It wasn’t a lesson I was learning for the first time, but it didn’t make it any less fascinating. </p><p>Once again highlighting that, personal power was more important than any kind of fortified establishment. </p><p>My first aim, I followed Seldanna, communicating with her through our connection. “Go with them and act obedient. I promise I’ll save you. Also, ask the elves to establish a camp downstream and stay put for a few days. Promise them a solution, I’ll handle it,” I said. </p><p>I didn’t want random elves to ruin my observation. </p><p>Seldanna just nodded, not daring to use magic while surrounded by others. The arrival of the elves from the central tribes was actually not that problematic. It was annoying in the short term, sure. I didn’t want my defensive bastion that could be used to farm Divine Spark ruined, that was true…</p><p>But I wasn’t unaware of the advantages either. I wanted to learn more about the central elves, and trying to do was rather dangerous. And, even if they sent some reinforcements, they would have been reserved as a part of a larger group,, making it harder for me to detect anything. </p><p>Yet, they were kind enough to split into three groups, one to escort prisoners, one to defend a set location, and one to explore the camp where every inch of it was filled with defensive wards. </p><p>A perfect way for me to observe what was going on. </p><p>My first focus was following Seldanna. The wards allowed me to observe the camp from a distance, and the larger group could be temporarily dismissed. Undead might attack them, but defending them was not my responsibility. </p><p>I was glad for the recent improvement of Speed, allowing me to dash behind the group rapidly to make sure things weren’t problematic. I could try to use Seldanna as a beacon for an emergency, but it was not something I wanted to risk. </p><p>Still, chasing after a flying beast wasn’t exactly simple, especially since I was on unfamiliar ground, challenging me to the limit while forcing me to use a great number of spells to avoid occasional tribes. </p><p>Deeper into the territory, there wasn’t much undead presence. However, that didn’t mean none. An hour into our little adventure, just as they were flying over a mountain, a motion burst from the ground, followed by a familiar necrotic blast. </p><p>It hit the wing of the roc, forcing the beast into a freefall. </p><p>Elves reacted, but even with their rapid response, before they could shoot their arrows, another necrotic blast rose, along with some bone arrows. Just one lich, and a group of skeletons. Not a weak lich, as its aura suggested, but not a strong one either. </p><p>I watched as the Roc landed. One elf stayed with Seldanna, watching her carefully, while the rest attacked, making quick work of the skeletons and the lich. The lich tried to retreat, but the mage of the elves was strong enough to prevent that, showing that the lich was there to handle weaker targets of opportunity. </p><p>Altogether, it would have been a boring combat event, but I noticed that before the lich reached its unfortunate end, one of the warriors rushed forward, pulled some kind of large acorn, and pressed against the bones of the lich. </p><p>Absorbing the Divine Spark. </p><p>I frowned. I was too far away to get a true sense of what was going on, but from what I could have seen, it had been suspiciously familiar. There was no visual connection with what I saw, but that wasn’t enough to write off my suspicions. </p><p>Luckily, I had a chance to observe. While the elves were distracted by the combat, I circled their combat and approached from the other side, targeting the roc with a twisted healing spell, one that forced the beast into a coma while healing it at the same time. </p><p>I could have killed the beast directly, but keeping the beast unconscious had the potential to keep them there even longer. </p><p>Success, I thought as I watched them argue for a while before their caster started working on the roc — not a dedicated healer, I noted as I felt the clumsy nature of his spells, not to mention nature mana was not purely conducive to healing as my Proto-HP — and twenty minutes later, the rest started to set up a camp. </p><p>Excellent, I thought as I set up a teleportation beacon. Since the camp had been set up, I wanted to check the other hot spot. </p><p>I teleported toward the border. The largest group of elves had already arrived there, and a small forest had grown around it, though, unlike mine, their trees were more ordinary kind, filled just with mana rather than divine spark. </p><p>They were not just using the environmental mana, but some kind of liquidized version, pouring them for the trees which grew them rapidly. </p><p>The mages were busy with that, but the warriors patrolled the perimeter, dealing with the occasional undead attack. The undead incursions were weak, but clearly, they were meant to be, They were just using probing attacks, while the others were actually using the attacks of opportunity for the situation. </p><p>I watched the battle for a long while, which gave me a better sense of their combat capabilities — enough that I wouldn’t have wanted to tangle with them in my situation unless necessary — and the undead response — gathering at the horizon, but promising to be spectacular. </p><p>Yet, before I could make a move, a notification appeared in my vision. </p><p>{-5 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>It was enough of a reason for me to teleport immediately back to the main camp, expecting an undead attack. I neither wanted to lose the tribes Seldanna collected, nor did I want to lose my own defensive beacon. </p><p>Even as I did, however, I was frowning. I had enough detection wards there to make sure such a slip was impossible, and the fact that the undead somehow managed to arrive there was not good news. Not in the slightest. </p><p>Yet, when I appeared in my underground chamber and used the detection spells, I felt no undead presence. There was only one ward around the main tree, established by the elves and containing them, but with no undead presence. </p><p>Something was seriously wrong, and I didn’t have a lot of time to detect what exactly was that wrongness. </p><p>{-5 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>Something was still stealing my Divine Spark, something I had no intention of allowing, so I went above the ground. </p><p>Only to see all but one of the elves dead, and the mage currently using the same kind of acorn to drain the tree. Treason, how interesting. </p><p>Not all of them were dead, I realized a moment later when one of the warriors gasped. “W-why?” he whispered in his dying breath. </p><p>“Why? You dare to ask why. This world is doomed, brother, and I have no intention of letting that succeed. I want to escape this forest fire, and to do that, I need some leverage.” </p><p>As he said that, he kept the acorn connected. I ignored the emotional aspects of their little play, and instead focused on the acorn that he was using to steal Divine Spark, one that had functioned very similarly to the crystal that the undead used.</p><p>A mana sliver of mine was all I needed to follow the flow, and I started examining the internal structure. Despite the similarities in function, the outer layer of the two pieces of equipment couldn’t be any more different. The acorn was a living thing, while the crystals were inorganic. </p><p>Maybe, if I was a less suspicious man, I would have made a conclusion. Yet, the differences at the outer layers were too much to be coincidental, so I started examining. </p><p>A good decision, I realized quickly as I deciphered the outer layer, and found out that most of the outer layer was actually a very elaborate self-destruction mechanism, primed to go off at an intervention. </p><p>Luckily, my mana was pure enough to mix with Divine Spark and follow the source, and my stats were significant enough to allow me to keep a tight leash. </p><p>And then, I got a glimpse of what was inside, and a big frown appeared on my face. A crystal, not just similar but identical. Worse, as I examined that, I realized it wasn’t just the working principles that were the same. No, I could see several signs of habits that would belong to craftsmen that had been trained by the same master, working together, using the same equipment. </p><p>Elves and undead were using the same crystals to capture Divine Spark. More importantly, someone had gone through a significant amount of trouble to actually hide that fact. I only realized it, because I was a mage, an expert on Divine Spark, and a crafter at the same time… </p><p>Maybe I was being paranoid, but I smelled a conspiracy… </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 16</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 16</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 2392}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 4140}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 1799}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000] </p>",

    "content": "<p>As Hermione got out of the car, she carefully tugged her trench coat, trying to cover herself even more, despite knowing it wasn’t revealing anything. </p><p>She was still nervous as she looked at the huge stand-alone building at the edge of Vegas, trying to suppress her panic. Yet, she didn’t let her face to show any panic. </p><p>It had something to do with the redhead that had been driving the car. “I don’t know, Hermione. Maybe we shouldn’t bother with this and just go back. I have a bad feeling about this. Nothing good could come from this place.” </p><p>Hermione threw him an annoyed glance. She understood where he was coming from. She truly did. Unfortunately, after repeating the same fight for a week, she had precious little patience left. Her emotional problems with the upcoming challenge were making the situation even harder to handle. </p><p>“Ron, we have talked about it. Our options are limited. Our cover identities are already getting some suspicion. We can’t get caught by Americans, muggle or magical, or it’ll be a crisis.” </p><p>“It’s nonsense that they don’t allow us in  their country.”  </p><p>“With the war still going on, it makes sense, Ron. They can’t afford Death Eaters infiltrating their country. It’s merciless, but makes sense.” </p><p>“I know … but maybe we could reach the Order, and they could send—“ he tried to say, only for her to interrupt in annoyance. </p><p>“What, Ron, someone else from the Order, so that they could set up new cover identities, travel here, hide themselves… For what. Just for one day of the mission, because you’re feeling jealous.” </p><p>“But, Mione, it’s a strip club. What if—“ Ron tried to say, but Hermione interrupted again. </p><p>“Enough, Ron. I had been fighting in a war for half a decade. Don’t you think I can’t defend myself,  especially with my wand with me,” she said, patting her thigh-high leather boots comfortingly, which had been modified to conceal her wand. “And it’s not like I’m going to be a dancer. I’m going to be a waitress that’s taking the shift of a friend. Our contact assures us that a five-minute interview is all that’s needed before I could start my search. Just like how we planned.” </p><p>“Still—“ Ron started, but Hermione gestured for him to stay silent, her nerves fraying. Despite her assurances, she was not feeling confident enough to enter a strip club, especially as an employee, and Ron’s constant needling didn’t help. </p><p>“I don’t want to rehash it, Ron. We have been fighting about it for the last three days. I have my wand, and my necklace will allow me to send a signal in an emergency so you can apparate and save me. It’s our best chance to find Potter.” </p><p>Ron grumbled. “If he’s alive in the first place.” </p><p>“Ron!” Hermione gasped. “You know what Dumbledore had said before his death. He had confirmed through ancient magicks that he was alive, and Vegas is the place he spent the most time in, and every test we had done showed that he spends most of his time in that building, probably as a worker or something, undercover. Without the headmaster, we need someone to fight against Voldemort.”</p><p>Ron shook his head, which frustrated Hermione more than she wanted to admit. Usually, she had no problem debating, but spending the last three days throwing the same few arguments back and forth exhausted her. “Enough Ron, I need to go. We can’t afford to be late and ruin the mission. Unless you want to tell your family how you ruined our biggest opportunity due to jealousy.” Ron still grumbled. “Come on, Ron. It doesn’t matter if it’s a strip club. You have already seen the waitress uniform. The skirt is long enough to reach my knees, and the blouse barely has a cleavage. The owner clearly doesn’t want the dancers and waitresses mixed.” </p><p>“I guess so,” he mumbled. “Still, you’re my fiancee, and I don’t like them seeing you.” </p><p>“I understand, but I can’t be late,” Hermione said before she leaned forward for a quick peck, but Ron turned his head. Pouting as always, Hermione realized with a frown. “As you wish,” she growled in annoyance and grabbed the small bag she prepared, and stepped out of the car.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Ron gasped after she took a few steps. Hermione turned back, her annoyance bubbling to the surface. “No, Ron, stay in the car. You can’t leave the car. Windows are charmed to hide you, but the cameras might catch you if you leave the car,” she reminded him. </p><p>Despite already warning him a dozen times about that already. Sometimes, her fiancee could be really impulsive. </p><p>She started walking away, the heels of her boots clicking deafeningly. Despite her arguments, she was nowhere near comfortable with the mission, and her mode was hardly better — an unfortunate side effect of spending five years after graduation fighting an underground war, trying to keep Hogwarts safe, rather than building a career in magical experimentation. </p><p>A discount spy wasn’t the career she envisioned. </p><p>However, as she got closer, she started to lose her apprehension, replaced by more immediate concerns. </p><p>Particularly, the uniform she had to wear. </p><p>The uniform she had shown to Ron back in the motel they were using as a hideout was nothing problematic. Unfortunately, that was not uniform for the job, but the excuse Hermione came up with was to convince Ron. She didn’t like the necessity to lie to her fiancee, but the mission was too important. Ron had a streak of insecurity a mile deep, and if he knew the real uniform, there was no way he could stay in the car without ruining the mission. </p><p>The real uniform was waiting for her in the club — and also in her mind, as she had seen some examples of what they were wearing on the internet. </p><p>Luckily, Ron had no idea how to use a computer. </p><p>Otherwise, he would have never allowed it. Unless she started to cast Imperius, which was certainly out of question. Not just because it wasn’t ethical, but also because casting any kind of spell was much harder in America, with their own version of trace, but targeting every single spell and not just underage spells. </p><p>Hermione always found it ironic that a country that was so lax with its gun laws had such strict magical laws. </p><p>Maybe it was to compensate for it. She let her mind drift toward the contrast and its political implications — aware that it was just something to distract her from the upcoming humiliation.</p><p>A part of her hesitation about the amount of skin she was about to reveal. She was a bit of a prude even by the standards of the magical world, and even her fiancee didn’t see much more than a slightly mussed uniform revealed, the most intimate they had been his wandering hands under her shirt.</p><p>Though, at the age of twenty-two, she was ready to admit that, a small part — okay, not so small part — of that hesitation came from her lack of confidence in her own body. With her mess of bushy hair and her limited knowledge of makeup, she was hardly the sexiest witch in her class… She had never been the girl who had heads turn as she walked — well, unless she was patrolling as a prefect and raining detentions.  </p><p>Admittedly, her limited wardrobe, which could be defined by the words beige and gray, hardly helped. She didn’t know who to blame for her horrible wardrobe, her own hangups, or her jealous fiancee. </p><p>Either way, she was not prepared to find herself in a room filled with a plethora of women in various states of undress, each more beautiful than the last. Hermione knew they would be extremely beautiful, considering the place was the most expensive strip club in Vegas, opened just half a year ago, requiring a thousand dollars just to enter the place, named Marauder’s Den. </p><p>An aggressive name, one that implied a much lower class, which would have normally caused the club to collapse — or so Hermione assumed, she was hardly an expert. </p><p>The name, for some reason, sounded familiar, but Ron wasn’t able to pin that down either. Unfortunately, communicating secretly between continents was difficult to do in secret, so they couldn’t just ask the order about that. </p><p>Maybe it was just her hesitancy forcing her to make a connection that wasn’t there. </p><p>“Merlin, I wasn’t that nervous when I was fighting against Death Eaters one against four,” she murmured. Then, she shook her head, continuing to walk, doing her best not to stew on her latest argument with her fiancee, and what was about to come… </p><p>As she approached the door at the side of the building, which was clearly marked as staff, she almost turned and left. The reason, two men that was standing at the entrance. They were tall and muscular — and admittedly, classically handsome — but their physical appearance wasn’t the thing Hermione cared about. </p><p>No, it was their stance, which, to an inexperienced eye, looked loose and lazy, but Hermione had been in too many fights not to recognize the signs of alertness. Even before she got close, their attention was already on her, tracking her approach. </p><p>Maybe she should have listened to Ron, she decided, but her feet ignored it, and walked steadily. </p><p>To save their country, she needed to find Harry Potter.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Was trying to play with a revealed elven spy dangerous? Certainly, but as she trembled on my lap, I found the temptation to be stronger than fear. I didn’t want her to realize her concealment was gone, of course, so I decided to pull a little trick to make sure it was out of consideration. A pull was enough to rip a part of her uniform and wrapped around as a blindfold. </p><p>One risk was gone. </p><p>With that, I left her to tremble as I turned my attention to Aria, who was watching the display in shock … but also with immense arousal. I had seen the signs of that earlier, when we had played with Emma, but back then, I had assumed it was about her distaste toward Emma. The reckless expression on her face told a different story. </p><p>No, she enjoyed watching me dominating another woman, and if the sudden intensity of her expression was any indicator, the intensity of her arousal was linked to the power of the woman in question. Play around with a maid … nothing but some mild, controlled interest. </p><p>Dominate an elven spy … fascinating things. </p><p>“Feel free to get closer, my princess,” I said as I gestured to a nearby chair, and Aria started walking. Her steps were hesitant, fear and arousal working wonders to ruin her balance as she got closer, getting rid of the scraps she was still wearing. When she finally sat down, she was completely naked, her back arched to display her body, which was no less beautiful than the mythical spy on my lap. </p><p>“Don’t you feel honored that the princess walked this close to watch your punishment, you filthy maid?” I whispered into her ear, and she shuddered, which was different than the aftershocks of the climax she was experiencing. Which was why she was slow to react as I lay her prone on the couch and positioned her behind her. “Now, let’s give her a real show…” </p><p>She shuddered, the realization hitting her about what was the punishment when I rubbed my shaft against her her wetness was incredible. “T-that’s,” she shuddered, frozen in shock. </p><p>It took all I had to not push into her abruptly before her head could clear and teach her about the true risks of spying, but I held back, limiting myself to push her head down onto the couch. Though, the temptation to drive into her got even stronger when she screamed into the pillow with arousal.  She lay trembling and shaking as I considered the next step… </p><p>Maybe a real punishment, I suddenly hit with a desire, dragging my finger toward her puckered hole. A simple spell was enough to handle the messier implications, and I pushed my finger against her well-lubricated ass. “Too much,” she managed to muffle in shock, but I didn’t need to feel her arousal through her throbbing tantric aura to know that her complaint was just cursory. </p><p>For once, she didn’t use any magic to stop me, or even asked me to stop. For another, her ass pushed out, as if she was trying to take it deeper… She was even less experienced when it came to sexual matters than I expected, which meant, her recent orgasm was all that was needed to ruin her decision-making…</p><p>Well, even more than it had been already ruined under the circumstances. She squirmed, but as my finger disappeared into her ass, it was slow, ineffective. “I’m going to think you’re actually enjoying it if you squirm that much,” I whispered into her ear, which was all that was needed to arrest her movement, still too self-conscious to face her desire. </p><p>She said nothing, and I continued to molest her ass, soon adding a second finger to the first… </p><p>“I wonder if they knew they hired a whore as a maid,” I whispered as I continued to pump into her ass. Another whimper escaped her lips, but that was the extent of her resistance, the insult doing wonders to steal most of her willpower. She was clearly not used to people insulting her, adding even more to her confusion. </p><p>Which led to her passive state. </p><p>I turned my gaze to Aria, whose sexiness was spectacular, revealed by her legs, parted wide. More importantly, her expression was showing a dance of incredible arousal around them. One of her hands was already on her breasts, mauling almost absentmindedly as she watched me, her fingers sinking deep into her flesh. </p><p>“Do you want to help me, my princess, maybe hold this whore of a maid down,” I suggested, and she immediately reacted, her hands over her head, pressing down, not even bothering to answer. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as I brought my empty hand on her breasts to pay back, squeezing her nipples hard. Aria moaned. It was a risky move, as, technically, it was suspicious to treat a princess like that even by a lover, and would have warned a more experienced spy. But then, a more educated spy wouldn’t have found herself in her circumstances, so everything was normal. </p><p>“Yes,” Aria moaned as my fingers dug into her breasts. Our spy reacted in a more direct manner as my fingers slipped into her beautiful ass again and again, stretching her beautifully. </p><p>“Such a naughty maid,” I whispered. Once again, she failed to answer, but she hadn’t had to, the way she tightened was answer enough. I quickened the pace, tempted by her tightness. “I wonder what would happen if I take it a bit more.”</p><p>“M-more,” she stammered, which turned into a helpless whimper as I added another finger. But more importantly, I could feel her arousal rising, matching the jump in her fear. She was already shuddering, unable to handle unexpected pleasure, and her cries — muffled on the courtesy of the pillow — got even louder. </p><p>Her wetness was getting more and more tempting, but I just added another finger, turning her anal treatment into something even more. As she cried confusedly, I just shifted a bit, and captured Aria’s lips in a searing kiss, her enthusiastic tongue providing the correct spice to elevate the moment into the next stage. </p><p>It still didn’t help me to suppress the desire to take my spy in her tight hole — along with her anal virginity considering the signs. What helped to prevent that was Aria’s next move. She pulled back from the kiss, but only to shift her position and sat on the back of our spy, her pressure on the back enough to keep her in place. </p><p>One great advantage of her next position, she just needed to lean forward to capture my shaft between her lips.“So … so big,” she murmured before taking it between her lips, the ease she took half in one move more than enough to show her growing experience. </p><p>Even without my push, she managed to take enough to touch her throat, each push giving me another shiver. No complaints, just a few unintentional gags she couldn’t suppress. </p><p>The moment was made even more beautiful by the fact that I was fingering the spy anally for the last several minutes, the pleasure enough to make her lose any sense of current stakes. A great mistake, one that I enjoyed immensely. </p><p>I leaned forward, which not only pushed my shaft deeper into Aria’s throat and earned her moan of approval, but also brought me close to the breast of my lucky spy — although, ignoring Aria’s tits, swaying freely, hadn’t been exactly easy. The temptation they created was simply too great. </p><p>I split my focus between the two, though mostly on my spy. Aria was doing good by showing an incredible ability to swallow my shaft without the slightest complaint. And, even more incredible, she managed to keep her eyes open, her beautiful blue eyes pinning mine, making me burn with arousal. She didn’t need much attention. </p><p>My focus was on my spy, particularly, trying to keep her on the edge of pleasure. As much as making her cum again was a fun prospect, I wanted her to keep on the edge for a bit and beg for the next stage, which required a lot of attention with her immense sensitivity. </p><p>And, keeping her edge was a decision that was very easy to take with my beautiful princess constantly devouring my shaft. </p><p>The dance continued for a while, Aria picking up even more speed as she worked. She had to take occasional pauses, though, considering she used those opportunities to give me amazing titjobs, I didn’t ask her to push herself.  </p><p>She was my beautiful princess, and I was more than happy to play at her pace … especially since she had a squirming beautiful elven spy under her, helplessly on the edge. </p><p>As an added benefit, it gave me enough time to consider the next steps. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t rush forward to Coach Juana the moment I saw her. First, I had no intention of teasing her in the middle of the cafeteria and ruining her authority over the team, which I had a great use for. Instead, from the corner of my eyes, I took note of the way she was dressed. Unlike the day before, she was wearing exercise clothes in the color of our team. It was a good idea as it reinforced that she was a coach and not a bureaucrat. </p><p>More important was her hesitation. She did a good job hiding it, but  I could see her being skittish, ready to retreat the moment I pushed forward, which was why I ignored her. Trying to push forward just ruin the moment, and even with my tricks, I couldn’t forget that she was an older woman with better self-control, and with authority to make my life particularly harder. </p><p>I had enough enemies in the management. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean that I would be willing to let her go. No, I was just going to reel her in slowly. </p><p>I didn’t even interact with her as she visited the cafeteria, and when she joined the second half of the meeting, I did my best to look extremely professional while I had gone through the tactics. I treated her respectfully, even accepting her corrections as long as they didn’t ruin the tactical nature of it completely. </p><p>When it was finally time to dismiss the team, she was the one to dismiss them. “Good work, team, we’re going to take them down tomorrow,” she declared. “Now, go and rest early. We have a tough match tomorrow.” </p><p>“Go, team!” I exclaimed, and they cheered as they spilled out. </p><p>“Interesting pet,” Coach Juana commented once all students left the room, leaving us alone. The door was closed, but not locked — at least, not until I pushed with a little telekinesis push, which was more useful than just toppling down coffee. </p><p>I shrugged but ignored it. “We have a few more tactics that need to be approved, some last-minute inspirations,” I said, as I pushed the papers toward her. She reached toward them, doing her best to hide her nervousness. </p><p>She did her best to reflect confidence as she listened to my explanations, but she was still tense, ready to reject a massage offer. I didn’t present one, but I also didn’t prevent my fingers from accidentally touching her fingers, leaving a lingering sensation of arousal. </p><p>Hiding my smug smirk as she squirmed was a challenge. </p><p>“There are some valid concerns about our deeper defenses,” she murmured. </p><p>“Well, it looks like a windy day, and I’m betting their accuracy would suffer,” I answered. </p><p>“That’s a risky plan.” </p><p>“We’re not in a position to play safe,” I reminded her. “Instead, we’re going to play to our strengths and hope we’re not humiliated. I’m sorry that it’s stressful,” I said. </p><p>“I can handle stress, it’s the team I’m worried about.” </p><p>“Still, I can help you with your stress with a massage…” I said, then suddenly blushing and avoiding her gaze. “Sorry, it’s not something either of us could handle,” I  added, hesitant yet matter-of-fact. </p><p>And coated with just a perfect amount of Taunt. </p><p>“What do you mean!” she growled, quick to react when she was being questioned. It took a second for her thoughts to kick in as the blush hit, realizing the exact subject she had been challenging me with. She looked ready to take it back, but I didn’t give her the opportunity. </p><p>“Well, you know … it’s not easy to handle a … professional massage,” I whispered, acting shy, yet still pumping my tone with Taunt. Her reaction was interesting. I wondered whether she forgot my parting words of the challenge already, or she treated them as surface-level bluster. </p><p>Bluster that was currently melting away. </p><p>It wasn’t that important. What was important was that she wasn’t retreating in hesitation, but looking at me in internal conflict, her reluctance battling with her desire not to be the one retreating first. “I see, if you can’t handle it,” she said smugly before she could actually consider whether such a taunt was a useful thing to do. </p><p>“I - I didn’t mean it like that. It’s you that can’t handle it,” I answered, my tone high and hesitant, like a teenager that just found himself in class without pants, insecurity radiating off. Completely fake, of course, but another touch of Taunt was more than enough to make her ignore that little detail. </p><p>“Oh, why don’t you show it, then,” she declared, though, toward the end, I noticed a hitch in her tone. “What I mean —“ she tried to correct herself as the realization hit, but her words cut short as I stood up, giving her a smile that was still seductive despite my apparent hesitancy. </p><p>“W-well, if you’re challenging me,” I stammered badly, selling the idea that I would be the first one to retreat this time, and somehow, she believed it.  </p><p>I was starting to develop a strong suspicion that the last night’s spectacular climax played an important role in her quick admission, supported greatly by my taunting trick. </p><p>As usual, pride and pleasure were a devastating combination. </p><p>Before she could change her mind, I put my hands on her neck, and started rubbing with all the skill my fingers apply. She suddenly froze, which was a bigger reaction than I was expecting, giving me a sinking suspicion that, even before we started our little game, she was already aroused by my presence, and my taunts didn’t play as big of a role as I expected. </p><p>They just broke her hesitancy and allowed her to tap into the desire she was trying to ignore. </p><p>An excellent deal for me, I decided as I started caressing her neck, a supposedly innocent part of her body that worked as fuel to her pleasure, climbing up wildly. As much as I was tempted to remove her windbreaker immediately, I needed to be careful. I carefully targeted only her neck and shoulders, applying the full range of my supernatural tricks to tease her. </p><p>Which worked amazingly. Barely two minutes into the massage, she started squirming, showing just how badly she had been aroused before I even touched her. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one tempted by the forbidden nature of our little dance. </p><p>“Faster,” she found herself moaning, though froze immediately, the realization that things were getting a bit much clear on her body. </p><p>It was time for another trap. “W-well, I could remove your windbreaker, but I - I’m afraid that you can’t handle it,” I stammered, doing my best to sell my hesitancy. Not the most convincing acting, but like every lie, it worked very easily with the recipient doing her best to actually believe. </p><p>“Oh, little boy, believe me, I can handle it,” she answered. </p><p>“P-prove it,” I stammered, which made her raise her head enough to catch my gaze. I did my best impression of shyness as I avoided her gaze, the sound of her zipper was all I needed to believe my little ploy had worked. </p><p>I pulled my hands away, acting like it was a shy reaction. It worked well, as not only she discarded her windbreaker, but also her t-shirt, leaving her with her sports bra, this time a beautiful blue. </p><p>She smirked at me victoriously. “Don’t tell me you can’t handle it,” she chuckled, which convinced me that, not only she was aroused, but also she had worked a lot to misremember the events that happened in her new office. </p><p>I reacted to her taunt slowly, hesitant enough not to trigger a reversal, and put my hands on her back, rubbing softly. I was careful in my targeting even on her naked back, still avoiding more sensitive spots, but in her condition, even the safe spots were enough to keep her on the edge. </p><p>A spectacular dance to share with her.</p><p>Not without its own costs, of course, as playing slowly meant that I had ceded the pace to her reactions, treating her much slower than I would have otherwise preferred. Yet, her silent struggles to avoid moans made it worth it. </p><p>Her nipples were hard enough to reveal her arousal if her barely muffled moans hadn’t already done it. She was right at the edge, with her legs moving. The perfect time to strike. </p><p>“Maybe we should stop,” I whispered, this time my voice seductive rather than taunting. The sudden switch, combined with her arousal, worked wonders to extract the answer I needed. </p><p>“Don’t you dare!” she gasped. </p><p>“Well, you’re the boss,” I answered. </p><p>She was indeed. At least, for the next few seconds…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Are you ready for a full day of meetings, boys,” was my first words as I entered the meeting room, Full attendance, no exception. </p><p>“Yes, coach,” they answered. A few of them laughed, but that didn’t mean disrespect. It was a difficult balance, and someone like Coach Spencer would have failed to react appropriately, but it was different for me. I made fleeting yet sharp eye contact, acknowledging their attitude while subtly reminding them not to push too much. </p><p>A difficult thing to balance, especially since I was not only the same age, but also a player as well. Luckily, I had my Traits to help me. </p><p>I decided to test them a bit more. I reached the box I was carrying, and released my pet. “What’s that coach, are we changing mascots?” one of the players asked. </p><p>“Nope, I just decided to bring my pet with me,” I answered with a chuckle, though that was not my only intention. I was observing Arthur, to see if he would notice the extraordinary nature of my pet and its toy. He did not, though it might be about his tired expression. He didn’t look like he got any sleep. His irritation suggested that the loss of the book had something to do with it. </p><p>Their lack of follow-up was another sign of my presence. I chuckled as I pulled a whiteboard and started going through the strategies. As I did so, I reached for my Intent flow, this time empowering my Teaching Trait supernaturally. As I spread the effect softly, it increased their comprehension. And, even better, it was soft enough that Arthur didn’t give any sign of realizing what was going on. </p><p>  “Try to remember trickier aspects of our plan,” I said. “Our biggest reliance is going to be our trick plays, not to mention a dangerous number of blitzes. And, since I will be calling every play from the side with no last-minute audible, make sure you learn the hand signals correctly.” </p><p>“Coach, what if they pull some last-second adjustment. We won’t have time to read your hand signs,” asked one of the linebackers. </p><p>“I know, but that’s a risk we need to take,” I explained. “We simply don’t have the necessary time to build such coordination, so we’re going to take the risk. You just have to trust me that I will be better than their coaches and use tactics that factor in their formations and their last-minute adjustments.” </p><p>The cadence in my tone was enough to convince them, which was good, as my explanation was not exactly a good one. It wasn’t wrong, per se. I had designed most of the strategies in a way that would be hard to take advantage of with last-minute adjustments, but such tactical flexibility was the equivalent of driving twenty miles under capacity in a car race, sacrificing benefits for safety. </p><p>And, like a car race, such an approach could only succeed with significantly superior ability. </p><p>Luckily, I was not above cheating. The advantage of the constant Recovery I could provide was enough to tip the balance back to us. And, worst came to worst, I wasn’t above cheating a bit, when it came to some long passes with my newly acquired telekinesis. A bit risky, but considering some of my abilities were already revealed, low enough to be acceptable. </p><p>As long as I kept it limited to a few times.</p><p>I continued teaching them, pausing occasionally to feed small carrot sticks to my pet — and a lot of Intent, Strength, Endurance, and other Mental traits, to empower it along with the food. The players chuckled at the dichotomy, but I let that slide. At this point, with every objective I had, giving an eccentric impression with an unusual pet could only help me. </p><p>The rest of the meeting passed almost in a routine manner, enough that, even as I had gone through the tactics, my thoughts drifted back to the magic tricks I had read in the book. I had already memorized most of the translations. Unfortunately, memorizing them helped as much as trying to memorize some example equations — and, considering the state of the poor translations, badly written equations. I needed to understand the rules behind what I had read, not just blindly copy whatever ritual or rune they had. </p><p>Especially since I was planning to use the Pure intent from the System rather than blood and other clumsy magical tricks. As I thought that, I couldn’t feel a hint of pity toward Arthur, who was struggling to listen to the meeting in his exhausted state. </p><p>I decided to slip the book back into his bag in the locker room. After all, I had already made high-fidelity digital copies of every single page, and the possession of the original was just a risk. The lunch break was enough to pull that, especially since I had the control of every security camera in the stadium. </p><p>I arrived the lunch a few minutes late, and sat next to some of the newest and least confident players, my pet with me, munching on sliced oranges. “So, what do you guys feel about our chances of victory,” I said as I looked at them, chuckling as they flinched. </p><p>“O-of course we will win, coach,” they stammered, and I smiled at their expression. </p><p>“Very good, confidence is very important. I don’t want you guys faltering halfway,” I chuckled as I started eating, keeping the discussion light. Ten minutes into the discussion, I saw Arthur leave, and, after a while, return. </p><p>His expression was interesting. He was still exhausted, but mostly relieved. Too relieved, even, which made me think whether he actually reported about the disappearance of the book in the first place to his superiors. </p><p>The intensity of his emotions suggested he did not. As he walked, he looked at me suspiciously, but it was a fleeting one, giving me the impression that he didn’t really suspect me. </p><p>I had a feeling that he was underestimating me, still believing that his infiltration of the team hadn’t been caught since he was still on the team. That was not logical, of course, as keeping a known spy had significant advantages, but Arthur seemed to be missing those. </p><p>Not a notion I was desperate to disabuse him of at the moment. I was starting to realize that I couldn’t keep blundering blindly through this with occasional hints from my guide. As much as I had wanted to advance the System while keeping safe, I couldn’t simply ignore the danger posed by the situation. </p><p>The presence of a careless spy was an excellent way for me to reach around. For one, it allowed me to get information about magic. More importantly, it allowed me to identify other people of interest — not to mention, their discussions gave me a preliminary understanding of their organization, and which one of them was more likely to cooperate with me. </p><p>Hardly a small gain. If I could turn one of their members into an asset, it would allow me to achieve a lot more. </p><p>A rough plan was already forming in my head, though the time to act was still some distance away. I needed to find out more about the System. how it came to be, how it functioned, and how could I avoid the interested parties; and their organization, memberships, their relations, possible weaknesses, and their ultimate ambitions. </p><p>It wouldn’t be nice to connect with someone if their first inclination would be to sacrifice me or something. </p><p>I needed to have better control of Arthur. Maybe some kind of trojan to his phone would allow me to track him and his communications, but it was problematic. Phones were much harder to hack than computers due to their design, and I needed some serious preparation before achieving such a thing. </p><p>With a sigh, I let my wander back to that even as I chatted with the players. Work never ended. If only I had some way to feel entertained… </p><p>Then, I saw Coach Juana walk inside. Maybe I should have asked for something else, I thought, before dismissing that thought. </p><p>Coach Juana was an excellent reward. Especially with her blush growing wide. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I took a breath to deal with the aftermath of my explosion. Considering just how badly I was backed up, any release would have been spectacular. But, considering I had just been served by one of the greatest supermodels in the world, who was still sitting in the shower, her beautiful skin glistening… </p><p>Using the word monumental was not an exaggeration. </p><p>I didn’t bother to hide my smirk as I gazed down, as she was simply too dazed to pay attention to the particulars of my attention as she shuffled on the ceramic surface, trying to get a handle on her trembling. </p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment to see whether it would help, but she didn’t bother hiding her body. Which was well, as we were certainly well past the point that would be helpful after my unrestrained treatment. </p><p>I let her gather herself for a moment as I stepped out, and realized I didn’t bring a towel from my room — the bathroom lacked a locker to hold them — and went to my room to get a towel for myself. I walked naked, which was more of a habit than a deliberate choice. </p><p>Important, because halfway in, Maria stepped out of her room, only to freeze as she met with a naked me. </p><p>“Sorry about that, I’m not used to having guests,” I said, but considering the speed, her gaze dipped down to catch the sight of my shaft and stayed there, I wasn’t exactly filled with shame. </p><p>It was currently at half-mast after the latest explosion, but it didn’t take long for it to stir back into action. And Maria was to blame for that. </p><p>She was wearing one of the leftover pajamas of the old man — thoroughly washed and dried twice, of course — which was not at the top of the list of clothes I expected to look sexy. Yet, the view in front of me was more than enough to demolish that assumption. </p><p>There were two facts responsible for that. The first was the fabric of the pajamas, which was soft and elastic, feeding well into the second part. While the old man was almost the same height as Maria, he was a thin man. And, it meant that, not only those pajamas were stretched enough to look like they were painted on her, but also she had to keep a few of the buttons open. </p><p>Sexy, but not sexy as the implied alternative, her top bursting after one accidental breath. </p><p>With the sexiness of her legendary curves on display, even the ugliness of the pajamas was not enough to distract from her beauty. And, encouraged by her caramel beauty and her flattering attention, my shaft was growing back at an alarming rate. </p><p>Which, ironically, created one unwelcome detail. It put a smug expression back on her face, willing to take that reaction as compensation for the attention I was deliberately not giving her. </p><p>It was amusing just how attention-starved she could get in less than a day to find that fulfilling, though my amusement wasn’t enough reason for me to intervene. I could see that their instinctual need for attention as celebrities was my only hope to keep them under control — with some very fun implications — and I would loathe relinquishing my most useful tool. </p><p>“Is there anything I can help you with?” I said as I half-turned back to the bathroom. “Because I have the sexiest woman in the world waiting for me for the second half.” </p><p>The speed with her amused expression was slid away, replaced by jealousy, and was simply magical. I wasn’t delusional enough to think that it was about me, more about what I was representing. Maria was a spectacular singer — even I knew that despite it not being my favorite style — but that didn’t change the fact that her global fame was more about her physical traits. </p><p>And like any celebrity, she was clearly afraid that it would not work as she slowly breached into her thirties. </p><p>A glance at the beauty radiating even through the ugly pajamas she was wearing showed that it was not a justified concern, but she clearly felt that. I might have even done my best to tell her that — if her thoughtless arrival didn’t ruin my greatest personal project, one that could actually give me a potential shot at a Nobel prize assuming the outcome was as optimistic as I hoped. </p><p>“Oh,” she whispered a second later, the sound of her ego puncturing almost physically — once again, only possible as it was tapping on an existing fear. </p><p>“So, if there’s nothing,” I said as I tried to slide next to her. </p><p>“There’s one thing,” she murmured as she passed the walkie-talkie to me. “It’s … her agent, and she wants to talk with her star model,” she said. Yet, I didn’t miss the vindictive smirk on her face as she passed it to me, one that suggested the agent might not be easy to deal with. </p><p>“Thanks,” I said as I grabbed them and walked around her, not asking her about the details about the agent, which promised to be unpleasant. </p><p>It was better for her to think that I lacked the ability to read her expression accurately. I had a feeling that it would be useful.  </p><p>I left Maria behind to arrive at my room, picking a towel for myself, though my mind was already on this mysterious agent. </p><p>The way Carly reacted to my haphazard displays of authority — just based on expression and tone rather than promises and threats — suggested an excessively harsh man. Though, combined with her utter lack of experience in anything sexual implied extreme protection rather than seeing benefits. </p><p>Unlike me.</p><p>Still, as much as I appreciated that mysterious agent’s protective instincts as it allowed me to experience the most memorable sexual experience of my life, I had a feeling that the next part would be supremely unpleasant, especially if Carly would be as easy to read as I expected. </p><p>But, there was no point delaying the inevitable, so I grabbed a towel and dried myself quickly before wrapping it around my waist, and going back to the shower. </p><p>Carly was still on the ceramic floor, trying to catch her breath. I presented my hand to her, and she grabbed it, allowing me to pull her to her feet. As she hugged me for balance, I got wet once again, ruining my earlier drying. </p><p>Not that I was complaining to receive a hug from a naked supermodel. </p><p>“Your agent wants to talk to you,” I said as I passed the walkie-talkie to her. </p><p>“R-right now?” she asked. “B-but, I need to dry myself first,” she added, though I could see it was just an excuse to delay talking with him rather than an actual excuse. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, I’ll handle that,” I said as I grabbed her towel. </p><p>“N-no need,” she managed to stammer, but that was all she was able to say before I took a step forward and pinned her against the wall, her escape route blocked.</p><p>“I insist,” I said as I crouched down, and wrapped the towel around her ankles. “Please, go ahead, don’t keep your agent waiting,” I said even as I used the towel to dry her off. It was slow and measured, but it did little to limit her concerns about what I would use my access for. </p><p>After one last concerned glance, she pressed the walkie-talkie. “Hi, I’m here,” she whispered, though I didn’t miss the dread in her tone, one that was shouting her distress. </p><p>Maybe it was not a good idea to tease her, I thought. </p><p>Then, the answer came. “Finally, where were you?” Though, there were two interesting things about that answer. The first was the horrible crackling noise, suggesting that the storm was doing wonders to interfere with the radio waves. Not enough to make the sound unintelligible, but just enough to make it almost impossible to pick up emotions accurately. </p><p>The second part was more interesting. The voice on the other side was, unmistakably, female. And not only that, she didn’t sound particularly old. Late twenties, I would have guessed, but that guess wasn’t as unmistakable with all the cracks and buzzes in the background, interference of the storm working wonders to strip most of the nuances I could use to make a more accurate guess. </p><p>“I w-was taking a shower,” she said, stammering helplessly as the towel passed her waist, but not before my fingers caressed her core for a fleeting moment. I was planning to tease her more, but she already seemed overwhelmed enough by her need to talk with her agent, and I didn’t want to push her too much. </p><p>“Don’t take long showers there,” her agent answered. “We don’t know just how bad the water they have and it might damage your skin. Even more, be very careful about shampoo and shower gel. I have no idea what disgusting brand those people use, but I can’t imagine it’ll be good for your hair.” </p><p>I was glad that, unlike a phone call, one needed to press a button before the other party could hear, because it meant I didn’t have to suppress my chuckle at her attitude. Her tone was dismissive enough to imply that she was talking about a bunch of bugs, and not some of the smartest people on top of their field, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. </p><p>Though, I had to admit, she did have a point about the general quality of the equipment. Not that they had the right to complain about that. </p><p>As they were not exactly invited in the first place.  </p><p>While Carly took a breath to answer, I reached her breasts, my touch enough to make her gasp despite the towel limiting the sensation, delaying it a bit more. “I-it’s not too bad,” Carly, said. </p><p>“Nonsense,” came the answer immediately. “It takes a lot of science to get those right. Do what you are told,” she added, earning another chuckle from me at the usage of the word, unable to ignore the accidental irony. </p><p>“Yes,” Carly said, her head dipping down as acceptance radiated off her. “Now, let’s talk about your exercise routine. Is there any kind of half-decent equipment there you can use? They told me that they had some, but I don’t trust their selection.” </p><p>I could see where her obedience was coming from.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Okay,” Carly whispered, her tone split between fear and desire, which surprised me. </p><p>I expected her to resist that particular advance, maybe playing hard to get, but before I could cover the distance between our lips, she leaned forward, covering the rest of the distance. </p><p>Our lips touched, and before I could process her sudden speed, I felt an enthusiastic tongue probing my lips, asking for entrance. It was a shockingly clumsy move, though by no means it removed just how beautiful that move was, especially considering her identity. </p><p>I suppressed my desire to dominate her, enjoying her sudden initiative too much to ruin her enthusiasm. </p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth, one that I drowned with my lips enthusiastically, the rest handled by the noisy shower head. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I felt her hands on my shoulders, not even noticing the sudden absence of water as I worked on her beautiful lips. Her grasp on my shoulder slowly got stronger as the second passed, almost reaching a point I would classify as painful. </p><p>Almost, but not quite. </p><p>I decided to pay her back. But not directly by touching, remembering that just minutes earlier, my touch to her core was enough to trigger her escape. This time, I decided to use a different aspect. I pulled the shower head from its place, aiming at a certain part of her anatomy, which, without her panties to protect her, worked wonders to earn a moan. </p><p>She must have been even closer to the edge than I had assumed despite her earlier climax. The hot water blasted against her core, and a gasp escaped her mouth, though it was short-lived before my lips suppressed it. She didn’t climax, but her reaction showed that she wasn’t entirely too away from that point either. </p><p>Her tongue stilled in shock, so mine started to move faster to compensate, slowly invading her mouth, digging for moans. Under the blast of hot water, she was clearly getting closer and closer to a climax. </p><p>Since she had no complaint about the treatment, it was certainly tempting to continue until she experienced the second climax of the day, but sometimes, fortune favored the bold. I pulled back, just enough to pull my shaft away from her stomach. Her hands landed on my hips to pull me closer, clearly wanting that touch, but she lacked the power to make that work. </p><p>I bent my knees slightly before allowing her touch to succeed, a move that located my shaft between her legs. Unfortunately, not slipping inside her — as I felt it would be too exaggerated, especially if I was reading her lack of experience accurately — but pushing my shaft between her legs, rubbing the underside of her nether lips was still daring. </p><p>Daring enough to make her pull back from the kiss. I let her succeed, but caught her gaze, my expression sharp once more. “I’m just trying to make myself more comfortable,” I answered, my tone implying it was completely normal. </p><p>That was not normal, of course. Far from it, but the combination of the blast of hot water and the daze of our earlier kiss worked wonders to slow her decision-making. Though, arguably, it was actually normal compared to our earlier recreational room adventure. </p><p>“R-right—“ she muttered, which was all she was able to say before I leaned down and captured her lips once more. </p><p>Succeed bred success. It was a motto I believed in, so, even as one of my hands was busy holding her breasts, it still left my other hand free to work on her body, and it danced all around her body — except one particular part — hungrily. Caressing her waist, teasing her shoulders, digging into her breasts, ticking her neck… </p><p>All the while, my hips were rocking. Slowly at first, just giving a subtle teasing, almost unnoticeable compared to the blast of water, but my hips slowly picked up speed as my hunger started to grow and surpass my decision to play it slow — for a very loose definition of it. </p><p>Soon, I placed the shower head back in its place, giving my both hands-free reign on her body, my hips getting wilder and wilder, while my both hands focused on her extremely sensitive breasts. </p><p>Only when I let one of my hands drag down, invading the land her panties would have protected if she had been wearing any. She pulled back from the kiss, her eyes wide, but when I used the opportunity to slide down to her neck, she was helpless against a growing moan. </p><p>With the combined assault of my lips, my shaft, and my fingers, she lost herself in pleasure. Especially my left hand, caressing and teasing her clit repeatedly, circling around with an endless determination, teaching her a new meaning of pleasure turning her into a beautiful machine of gasps and moans. </p><p>Another climax was around the corner, so I was more than happy to silence her with a twist of her nipple when she tried to speak. “We need to —“ she started, only to fade into a moan. </p><p>“We need to, what?” I said, once again infecting that harsh tone to my voice, which took every single scrap of willpower I had to fake the great pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>“We—“ she said, which was all she was able to say before my fingers intervened, this time caressing her entrance aggressively. “That’s too much,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“So, do you want me to stop?” I asked, and actually paused every single activity I was doing. </p><p>Her answer was decisive as the pleasure disappeared, leaving her on the edge. “No!” came it loudly, giving me the excuse I needed to start the next phase. I silenced her with another kiss as my fingers started every single inch of her body, pushing her steadily toward another climax. </p><p>One that didn’t take long for her to reach, another loud moan declaring its glorious arrival. </p><p>I pulled back as the orgasm hit her, this time even harder, making her have trouble standing even as she leaned against the shower wall, trembling helplessly. Yet, she failed, sliding down beautifully, and she found herself sitting on the floor. </p><p>I couldn’t help as a satisfied smirk invaded my face as I turned my gaze down, watching the trembling global model, a part of my mind wondering just how much money I would have made if I recorded the earlier show. </p><p>Yet, as she looked up with her trembling gaze, I had no intention of letting her stop, not with my throbbing shaft begging for more. “It’s time for payback,” I said as I leaned forward. ”</p><p>“How?” Carly murmured dizzily, her tone challenging me to explode, a challenge I barely succeeded. </p><p>“Simple,” I said as I continued to push forward. “Just open your lips.” </p><p>“But, I never—“ she whispered, which was all she was able to say before my crown pushed into her lips. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m a good teacher,” I said as I pushed forward, enjoying the way she was confused with her desires, obediently accepting my invasion as her tits jiggled. </p><p>I couldn’t help but grunt as I pushed forward, enjoying the warmth of her mouth as she devoured my shaft. “Feel free to tap my leg to show you’re too weak to handle it,” I said as I pushed deeper and deeper, enjoying the shocked shine on her beautiful lips. </p><p>I wanted to tease her a bit more, but as her warmth wrapped around me, it pushed me dangerously close to the edge, and with the amount I was backed up, there was no hope for me to actually resist for any amount of time. </p><p>Not with the beauty of the pouty lips around my shaft, grunting and moaning while they allowed more and more of my shaft inside. </p><p>Far more than I expected without tapping my leg, especially with her clear inexperience, showing that she was even more submissive than I expected. “Let’s see how much you can handle,” I said as I grabbed her head to prevent a painful hit before pushing forward. </p><p>The resulting gags were simply spectacular. </p><p>She didn’t manage to take all of it at once, of course, but it was not a simple achievement. I focused on the speed instead. Even more spectacularly, as I rocked back and forth, she didn’t tap my leg even once, allowing me to invade her throat despite her endless gags and gasps. </p><p>More endurance than I expected of her. She just accepted it, her shyness temporarily shelved as I lashed into her throat. I wished that I wasn’t already on the edge and could enjoy the sensation forever — or at least enough, such as until the inevitable heat death of the universe — but my body finally surrendered... </p><p>Naturally, I exploded in her mouth, filling her mouth to the brim. I didn’t even need to think. </p><p>“Swallow,” I ordered as I continued to throb into her throat, watching her neck move, still obedient. Her achievement wasn’t flawless, of course, as more than one drop slipped out of her throat, only to be dragged away by the still-running water. </p><p>Yet, she earned full marks in obedience and enthusiasm. </p><p>Altogether, an excellent start. </p>",
