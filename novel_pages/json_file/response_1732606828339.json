    "content": "<p>Stealing might be wrong, but there was no doubting its usefulness. A brief detour later, I left the hospital, wearing a pair of old sneakers, and a jeans and a t-shirt combo, a baseball cap. I even had a few hundred dollars in my pocket. </p><p>A daunting prospect considering I probably had nothing in my bank accounts — I wasn’t exactly rich before the Disaster, and I had no doubt that whatever I had had been eaten by fees and other concerns. </p><p>Though, it was fascinating that there hadn’t been a wild inflation that turned money into nothing. I would have assumed that, for once, the government worked efficiently, but I had a feeling it had more to do with the spell that prevented people from panicking. </p><p>Once out, my first target was the public library, the baseball cap working well enough to keep my identity hidden even if my face had been plastered by the local papers. Once there, I started reading about the other heroes, this time not afraid of tripping any potential trap. </p><p>However, even as I started going, I couldn’t help but lament about the loss of social media. With it, it would have been so much easier to collect Intent. A few inflammatory sentences, maybe several controversial actions, all boosted by several thousands of bots, and I wouldn’t have been facing a lack of intent. </p><p>Instead, I had to work with the traditional media, which was far more challenging, and far less rewarding. </p><p>There was no point lamenting, so I focused on my research. Heroes, and how they act. Luckily, that was not a hard topic to find. Their exploits had filled the papers, their heroic rescues of fire victims, interviews, photoshoots, talk show appearances… There were very detailed pieces about their strongest moves — named like they were cartoon characters — their personal sense of justice, and even some interesting yet wholesome quirks. </p><p>Almost every single hero had them, and the competition for popularity was intense. </p><p>Too intense, like someone had decided to plagiarize my strategy of replacing worship with fame. Fascinating. </p><p>I continued to research, but every article I read confirmed that. And, the more I read, the more I understood the point of their aggressive public persona. </p><p>Without the System, they couldn’t just convert any type of Intent to power. I still remember the trick of Professor Argus while playing chess, or Arthur during the game, and how dangerous the process had been. The widespread application suggested that they now had a better method for it, but it was still not perfect. </p><p>And, with that, another detail clicked. The disappearance of the social media was not an accident. Social media was too chaotic and messy to maintain a curated image, unlike traditional media which could be controlled and censored. Without it, they could never create a consistent image for the heroes. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I thought, then decided to check something else. </p><p>Ex-heroes. </p><p>Finding them had been easier, as their digital presence hadn’t been much. I actually had to go downstairs to check the archives and check the old newspapers. I didn’t have time to browse all the news of the last four years, but a quick search had been enough to confirm one important thing. </p><p>Character assassination was deadly for heroes. All it took was several conflicting and inflammatory news, spread across a week or two, for them to stop. Luckily, I noticed a few of them trying to make some kind of comeback. They failed, but at least it proved the backlash was not deadly, which gave me a range to more freely. </p><p>It was still troublesome, of course. With the System, the controversies were very beneficial to me, but it was not something I wanted to reveal. I didn’t want to be targeted, especially not before I could truly understand the critical players in this new world. </p><p>Meaning, I had to act modestly. </p><p>Thanks to that news, my new career as a hero was inevitable. And, considering I had started it with a sex scandal, it needed to be a part of it. </p><p>As I left the library, my mind was already on it. I needed a hero theme, one that mixed with the idea of sex, but also with a clear identity and personality that could be conveyed. A troubling question…</p><p>Or not, I corrected myself as I passed through a kiosk and my gaze fell on a familiar headline.</p><p>-Ex-Quarterback Gives No Quarter-</p><p>Quarterback. It was a good, strong theme, one that conveyed itself in several moves. And, as far as heroic identities went, it wasn’t glorious like Lighting King or something else, which, hopefully, wouldn’t be too intimidating. Also, it would be a good homage to the destroyed college, hopefully giving me some sympathy points.  </p><p>Not to mention, it mashed well with the idea of sex scandals. </p><p>I visited a few pawn shops and vintage clothing stores, quickly gathering the necessary items. An old uniform of Sunset College, with number one on the back and no name. It was one of the gift store gimmicks that allowed people to put their own names. </p><p>I left the name field empty, and focused on collecting other accessories. </p><p>Luckily, I managed to find a decent helmet with a dark visor that hid my face. Naturally, I had no desire to actually hide my identity — that hope was long gone after the news — but I still wanted to give the impression of a secret identity. </p><p>I wanted to look like I was trying. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I checked myself on the motel room mirror, the best room I could afford with my finances. The uniform fit well enough after my adjustments — living in the streets as a kid, I had long learned to tailor, and my Divine Agility made it even easier — and the pads made me look even more intimidating. </p><p>I tested a few poses while holding the ball, aware that my debut was more about making an impressive show than actually being heroic. </p><p>I went through several poses, which brought me to the last time I posed. It was with Kim, playing in the basketball game. It had been only a few days for me, but for her, it had been three years. I wondered what she was doing … as well as the others. </p><p>However, no matter how tempting was the idea, I didn’t try to find them. I had too many things to focus on first. </p><p>Like, finding a decent debut opportunity … or how much power I would display.  </p><p>“Now, that’s a complicated question,” I muttered as I paused, wondering about the exact amount of power I needed to reveal to be impressive without being threatening. Naturally, I had no intention of actually revealing my full power. According to the news, there were several heroes who could actually punch trains off their tracks, which was not something I could achieve.</p><p>But it didn’t mean I was safe displaying all my power. </p><p>First of all, there was no guarantee that the news was accurate. They might have been exaggerations to generate more fame. </p><p>And, even assuming those achievements reflected the capabilities of the heroes — possibly considering the mysterious people that stepped out of the portal when I first awakened —  it still wouldn’t mean that I was safe displaying an equal level of competency. I had no idea which groups the strongest heroes belonged, to and what secrets were behind their exceptional performance. </p><p>No, I much rather start small, just enough to give me the Intent I needed to match the daily consumption of the System. </p><p>So, in the end, I decided to give a mixed performance, someone around the level of Heroic Trait III. That much, I had already revealed during my football games before the Disaster, and a combination of them should be just enough to give more. </p><p>And, I could always reveal something closer to Strength V when facing something truly dangerous, similar to what I had displayed against the people who tried to kidnap Megan before the Disaster. </p><p>With that decided, I moved on to the next step, and started playing with a walkie-talkie I had picked up from the pawn shop and started modifying it so it was able to easily tap into available police channels. Now that my hero costume was done, I was ready to take the next step. </p><p>I just needed an opportunity, one that I received a few minutes later. “Break-in at Fifth Street. Subjects are armed. All teams, please respond.” </p><p>It was just a couple streets away. “Excellent,” I thought as I jumped out of the window, at least trying to look like I had been trying to maintain a secret identity. Then, I climbed to the nearest rooftop with a simple parkour move, moving through the roofs, until I caught up with the lone gunman. </p><p>“Stop!” I shouted. He did not, even raising his gun toward me. “Bullet pass!” I shouted, and threw the ball, which hit him hard enough to send his gun careening. And, before he could react, I jumped down, landing down in a heroic pose before rushing. “Justice tackle!” I shouted as I slammed him, feeling the cringe invade my body. </p><p>It felt ridiculous, but I was already being recorded by two security cameras, and it would certainly show up in the evening news. </p><p>I needed to look good… </p>",

    "content": "<p>A break was in order, I decided as I walked toward the impromptu bath, feeling refreshed even as I walked closer. The reason was easy to understand. Finally, under the wards that were strong enough to isolate our magic, she was able to use her magic.  </p><p>And, for a sorceress specialized in healing, little physical exhaustion was nothing. </p><p>As I approached her, she was leaning against the side of the small pool she created, looking at the other side, her position inviting. I didn’t say anything as I slipped out of my own rags — the battle followed by a long swim ruined them thoroughly — and slipped into the bath. </p><p>“Isn’t it rude to barge in my bath uninvited,” she said, though her husky tone certainly disagreed with the sentiment.  </p><p>“Oh, really. What’s the problem?” I asked, enjoying her teasing tone. </p><p>“The bath is not big enough,” she said, which was objectively not true. There was a reason I called it a pool. A small one, but a pool nonetheless. </p><p>“Isn’t it easy to solve,” I said as I wrapped one arm around her waist and pulled her to my lap, my hand slipping down to grab her thighs as her ass wrapped around my naked — and ready-to-go —  shaft. “Here, now it’s big enough,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, it certainly is,” she said, purring with excitement, far less shy than our first time, though I didn’t miss her victorious gaze toward sleeping Theodora, showing her uncharacteristic forwardness was fueled by her sense of competition. I couldn’t help but chuckle as I remembered how smug Theodora had been when Xia admitted she wasn’t strong enough to power the wards. The princess pushed herself hard to power all the wards by herself until she fell asleep…</p><p>Leaving the night to Xia. </p><p>Naughty little minx. </p><p>She leaned against my chest, further pressing her lithe body against my form so I could feel every inch of her curves. She might lack the endowment of some of my other lovers, but that didn’t mean her body didn’t have its own beauty. </p><p>“Since you’re here, you can help wash my back,” she whispered as she slid forward. </p><p>“Only your back?” I whispered. </p><p>“Of course,” she answered, her tone even more smug, thinking that her little victory against Theodora extended to me. </p><p>I could have swiftly taught her differently, but I decided a slow lesson was in order. “As you wish,” I said as I put my hands on her shoulders, slowly caressing and massaging. I stayed focused on her shoulders, gently rubbing and teasing as I massaged her. </p><p>Soon, she started moaning as she tried to slide back, only for my hand to slip lower, preventing her from moving forward. “We need to maintain the appropriate distance so I can wash your back properly,” I whispered into her ear. “Unless, of course, you want to surrender.” </p><p>“No, definitely not,” she declared, trying to stay committed to her little game, but her tone didn’t convey the confidence her words indicated. </p><p>“And I respect your determination,” I said, though saying that seriously was even harder than controlling myself under the circumstances. I continued massaging her shoulders with one hand, the other around the small of her back, enjoying the way she squirmed in a way she thought to be discreet. </p><p>Though, my slow teasing wasn’t to just teach her a lesson. It was also about controlling my instincts. With my magic out of control, so were my instincts, begging me to teach her a lesson now that she started teasing me. </p><p>I needed to control my instincts better, and the situation I faced was an appropriate test. </p><p>Unfortunately, I soon realized that it wasn’t as efficient, not with Xia’s almost immediate signs of surrender. I rubbed and massaged her back for barely two minutes before her whimpers joined, and five minutes before her whimpers turned a needy gasp. This time, when she pushed back, I didn’t make a comment or prevent her from moving closer. </p><p>Even when she leaned against my chest too tightly for my hands to continue working on her back, ignoring my own body shouting for me to take her. I didn’t even continue with her front, but instead, I stopped. Even when she started rubbing her body against mine to tempt me. </p><p>“Why did you stop?” she whispered. </p><p>“Only following your explicit requests, miss sorceress,” I answered, enjoying her annoyed hiss. “So, unless you changed your mind—” I said, putting my tone perfectly. </p><p>“No, I did not,” she said, her voice sharp as she did her best to contain her dissatisfaction, but prideful enough to follow along with her plan as I egged her. </p><p>Well, in a way. She squirmed almost constantly, trying to disguise it as a way to settle down, but it was nowhere as subtle as she thought she was … especially with our nudity. Her innocence was cute. </p><p>She wiggled, making me grow harder and harder. Not a problem under ordinary circumstances, but with my instincts going haywire, it was very difficult to resist. Yet, I resisted for the sake of my self-appointed mission. </p><p>Which got harder once she started to abandon even a hint of control, and a growl escaped my mouth. That earned a chuckle as she realized I was having difficulty keeping myself back, changing her game completely. </p><p>“What a comfortable seat,” she commented, proving that she noticed my self-appointed challenge, and the sultry, knowing smile she sent my way as she looked back certainly confirmed it further. </p><p>With that, her attempts to keep it subtle disappeared, and she started moving in a purposeful way. Not particularly skilled, but that didn’t harm attractiveness anyway. She grinned up and down along my shaft, forcing me to grit my teeth. </p><p>Holding myself back was far more difficult than I expected. A fog of desire started to descend over me, ordering me to push forward, but I refused it. I wasn’t going to be the first to surrender, and I certainly wasn’t going to surrender myself to foreign instinct. </p><p>It got harder and harder to resist the urge to grab onto the beautiful, seductive woman on my lap to teach her a lesson, but I somehow succeeded. I resisted the invitation to grab her even as she rubbed desperately. </p><p>“How much longer,” she chuckled as she continued, enjoying her sudden sense of power too much. I let her, even when she left my lap momentarily. When she sat down, she was looking directly at me, her tits rubbing against my chest while the warmth of her core unmistakable against the underside of my shaft.</p><p>She rubbed up and down, occasionally teasing the head of my shaft, but not taking the plunge despite her clear arousal. “It’s only fair if I give you a rub as well,” she said as her chest rubbed against mine. “</p><p>“Well, that’s true,” I said, though it left was a desperate growl. </p><p>“Good,” she said. “Feel free to change things whenever it’s …” she said, letting it linger. I nodded, stiffer than I would have wanted. However, as much as my new instincts were pushing me, I refused them. </p><p>I had no intention of surrendering before her. </p><p>She didn’t give up, my growl not enough to warn her about her teasing antics. She continued to grind her body against mine, even taking things to another level. She leaned forward, and started kissing my neck and collarbones. Gently at first … but it soon turned into not-so-gentle bites that would have left a mark if it wasn’t for my immediate recovery. </p><p>A soft moan left her lips when her legs trembled in an untimely manner, taking me inside before she corrected that mistake, her intense expression of pleasure beautiful. She looked at me worriedly, to see whether I would use it to call an end to our little game. </p><p>I did not, no matter how much I wanted. </p><p>She smiled, glad for it … at first. Soon, the pleasure from her mistake disappeared, leaving her aching for more, her face an open book. The kisses and bites got more desperate, and her fingernails pressed against my shoulders desperately. </p><p>It was far harder to resist the desire after a proper taste. Admittedly, that was true for me as well, but her inexperience was far more detrimental than my new magical instincts, so I didn’t bother hiding my smirk when she had another ‘accident’ and slipped halfway to recreate the sensation. </p><p>It didn’t work well enough to keep the desire at bay, so she another accident followed. … then another. A grunt or two escaped my lips, but it was nothing compared to her needy growls. It was a desperate dance,  her body rocking harder and harder against mine…</p><p>Until she finally lost her own battle with desires and sank even deeper. “Oops, another accident,” she whispered, using the same excuse … which would have worked better if she actually tried to lift herself back. Instead, she stayed in place, extending the joy of the moment. </p><p>“I don’t think so, sweetie,” I said. “That was your loss.” </p><p>“But —” she started, which I cut with a short yet searing kiss that left her breathless. </p><p>“No,” I said as I grabbed her hips. “Now, it’s my turn.”  </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Can’t we cast some kind of spell to create a carriage,” Xia begged after half an hour of uninterrupted travel, getting more and more exhausted by the walk as we traveled inward. “You’re a sorcerer, it should be easy.” </p><p>“And you’re a sorceress, shouldn’t you be able to handle it even easier,” Theodora interrupted, not missing a chance to needle her. It wasn’t the first time.</p><p>“I’m a healer, which will be fun to remind you the next time you require me to heal you,” Xia responded. </p><p>Theodora looked ready to respond, but I silenced her with a gesture. “Enough, both of you. If you have the energy to dawdle, you have the energy to scout,” I answered. “And, with my magical control ruined once more, there’s no way for me to create something that intricate, certainly not without revealing our location to anyone within a hundred-mile radius.” </p><p>That was enough to silence both, which hadn’t been too surprising. Xia was already submissive before realizing that I was somehow linked to the ancient kingdom of Egypt, which just enhanced further. And, Theodora already had a strong case of hero-worship before I saved her from a terrible fate for the second time, just when she was convinced that all hope was lost. Unfortunately, even that wasn’t enough to keep their jealous sniping at bay. </p><p>Annoying, but not enough to truly be problematic. </p><p>We walked in silence, my attention still at our rear, afraid that our subterfuge would be discovered. But, at the edge of my perception, I could feel the ships battling, their spells explosive enough to keep the situation in control. </p><p>“Where are we walking exactly,” Xia asked, looking exhausted, showing that she wasn’t used to physical activities.</p><p>“Away from the reach of the ships,” I answered. “We need to make sure we won’t be caught by a foraging party or a shipwrecked crew and ruin the only advantage we have.” </p><p>“Can I at least heal myself,” she said.  </p><p>“No, magic use is too risky,” I said, trying not to sound annoying. </p><p>She looked ready to argue more, but a dismissive snort from Theodora was enough to cut it short. Her wordless challenge was clearly enough to cut her complaining short. </p><p>I couldn’t help but sigh at their pointless bickering, but I didn’t intervene. It at least keeps them distracted and motivated, allowing me to focus on more important issues. </p><p>Like, trying to find water. </p><p>I couldn’t cast anything delicate enough to help me map the environment — especially since using anything but the lightning was getting harder and harder after consuming even more Dragon Hearts — but that didn’t mean I was helpless. My enhanced senses allowed me to smell far more accurately. And, as we left the sea and its overwhelming saltiness behind, I finally detected a water source. </p><p>I changed our direction silently toward that direction. I wanted to take a rest. Xia was tired, and Theodora was not any better. More importantly, as the adrenaline of the battle faded away, it left behind a mental exhaustion that was difficult to beat. </p><p>However, as we walked, the rocky shore left its place to a sandy and dry interior, walking getting even more difficult as each step sank deeper into the sand. Xia, in particular, was getting even more exhausted. </p><p>I thought about carrying her, but decided against it. She needed some toughening. </p><p>“Should I cast a water-gathering spell,” Theodora asked a while later. “We’re getting thirsty.” </p><p>“Not yet,” I said. “There’s water nearby.” </p><p>“Really,” she said as she looked around, only to see a bunch of rocks and sand. “Are you sure?” </p><p>I just nodded, which seemed to mollify her, just because I was the one saying it. </p><p>Another turn around a hill, and we found ourselves in a little oasis with a beautiful, bubbling spring, surrounded by an inviting layer of thick grass, too comfortable to be resisted. “Finally,” Xia said as she rushed forward. </p><p>Showing her experience with the wilderness was absolutely nothing. </p><p>I sighed even as I swung my spear, which passed dangerously close to her face, and sank into a rock, which bled for a while before transforming into a lizard that was the size of the rock. “Never rush to a water source without checking it first,” I said. “Magical beasts love ambushing people there.” </p><p>“I … I see,” Xia stammered, shocked by how close she had come to a violent attack, which could have easily killed her before she could react. </p><p>“Well, at least we have our dinner while camping,” I said. </p><p>“We’re going to camp? Isn’t it better to travel at night,” Theodora said. </p><p>“Certainly more comfortable, especially since we lack proper clothing,” I agreed. “But, we’re too exhausted to avoid ambush, so I’m willing to waste half a day here rather than being ambushed,” I said. </p><p>Also, at this point, we were sufficiently far away from the sea, and staying behind the wards and creating a few equipment first was more critical than anything else. In particular, shoes and water skins, but thankfully, the giant lizard had more than enough skin for all the necessities. </p><p>Including making sheaths for all three weapons. After their reaction, it looked like walking around them in the open might not be the best idea. </p><p>“Why don’t you two set up a concealment ward while I handle our dinner,” I said as I grabbed the sword. Which earned double gasps. “What’s up with the reaction?” </p><p>“You … you’re going to use a Patrician weapon as a carving knife,” Theodora gasped. </p><p>“It’s sharp, clean, and the only blade we have, of course,” I said even as I started walking. They looked shocked at my decision, clearly expecting me to treat it with respect, but I shrugged that away. Ultimately, it was a weapon. </p><p>And, it certainly made it easier to go through it, the magic skin of the creature acting like paper as I cut forward, and even bones didn’t react anymore. “You look very proficient in that,” Theodora commented even as she drew a rune to create another ward stone. </p><p>“It’s important to know how to hunt,” I said, not bothering to mention exactly how I had been trained. My grandfather might have been merciless, but there was no arguing with the results. There was no way I could have survived my adventure in Rome without his torturous training. </p><p>That was enough to silence them, and I continued with my task, separating the skin first before cutting some meat from its back, which would be the safest part. Then, I carved a few runes on a large stone, and called Theodora. “Do you mind powering those runes,” I said. There was no way I could blow any rune that was weaker than a city defense array without blowing up with my magic once again out of whack. </p><p>“Are you sure, these fire runes look weak,” she said. “I can replace them with something stronger.” </p><p>“That’s because I want to cook the meat, princess, not turn it into charcoal. Have you ever tried cooking with something stronger?” I said, chuckling as she looked blushed. </p><p>“Do you think our princess ever cooked a meal?” Xia said, not missing a chance to needle her. </p><p>I chuckled as I caught Theodora’s gaze, the answer hidden in her self-conscious blush. I chucked. “Enough, put that ward on so we can have dinner,” I said. She put the runes on, and I started cooking the first set of meat, a heavenly smell filling the oasis. </p><p>I continued working on the rest of the meat, separating it into different parts, some to be cooked immediately, and some to be processed and dried for our travel. </p><p>As I worked, I noticed something interesting. A tendril of magic, spreading from the sword. I let it connect slowly, feeling like the sword was getting a part of me, as if it was trying to teach me how to use it. The connection was nowhere near as strong as I had with the Spear of Scipio, but nonetheless, it was efficient enough. </p><p>Unfortunately, stopping to have dinner was a luxury, so everyone just grabbed a piece of meat whenever it was ready, snacking as we continued working steadily. </p><p>I worked continuously, feeling the connection with the sword getting better and better, feeling that, even without knowing any unique powers, I would be able to use it in battle. </p><p>I couldn’t help but glance at the bow, thinking whether I should practice with it some to see if I could create the same kind of connection. On one hand, it was a pretty distinctive weapon that might alert others. On the other hand, it might help us as I dug around the secrets of Egypt. </p><p>With both sides of Rome inaccessible to us, it was my best hope. The evening arrived while I was thinking that. Theodora was already asleep, the act of powering the ward — and doing it alone to prove herself better than Xia despite her sorceress status — wiped her off. </p><p>However, as I watched Xia create a small lake next to the spring and create a connected pool that filled rapidly before slipping her dress off, I decided that testing the bow was not the priority. </p><p>Especially with the smoky gaze she threw to my way. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Erin was already having a bad day when she had been interrupted by an uninvited guest. </p><p>As a retired professional athlete — early due to injuries — she was supposed to be enjoying the true peak of her life. After all, she had made millions during her career. She had the ambition to create an even better career. </p><p>Unfortunately, it turned out that, all her experience in sports didn’t translate to a successful business. It wasn’t enough that she was penniless, but the business was losing money. So, she either needed to stop … or find an investor. </p><p>The client she had today, Fatima Shah, had the potential to be the latter. Erin had done her research, and learned that she was a multi-millionaire widow that had just moved around, and she paid for her most expensive package without blinking. </p><p>Now, Erin was hoping that she would invest so that she could inject some cash into the business. As for selling it completely, she didn’t even consider it. She was not a quitter. She was a champion. She just didn’t fail. </p><p>It was the reason why she was annoyed when a man she didn’t recognize entered the place, dressed in exercise clothes. The reception upstairs had strict orders not to let anyone in. </p><p>“Can I help you?” she started, doing her best not to start shouting at him for interrupting, and only because she didn’t want to scare Fatima. </p><p>Before she could answer, her prospective business partner spoke. “Darion, what are you doing here?” </p><p>“I promised to help you with your workout. Don’t you remember?” he said. </p><p>“So, you’re a private trainer,” Erin said. </p><p>“Oh, something like that,” he answered with a cocky smile. At first, Erin assumed it was the usual competitiveness of the athletes, especially against a woman. However, when she heard Fatima’s mortified cough she realized that it was something different. </p><p>That surprised Erin. Fatima looked far too shy to have a boy toy. She decided to tease her a bit. “Oh, my dear client. So you think I’m not enough for you.” </p><p>“O-of course not, it’s not like that,” she explained hurriedly, mortified. Erin knew that teasing her was wrong, but watching her flounder was just too entertaining. </p><p>“But it looks like that,” Erin said as she crouched down to hide her snicker — well, also, maybe, just a bit, to get a better view of Darion’s muscles as he started doing push-ups, as if he was trying to prove that he was a PT. </p><p>Maybe she had been distracted with the work too much and would have no fun if she reacted to his presence like that. </p><p>“Calm down, just kidding,” Erin said. “Tell you what. I’m going to have a quick lunch and return. Why don’t you check the place with your trainer, and make sure it’s as good as I promised.”</p><p>Of course, Erin had a better idea. Fatima might be shy, but Darion didn’t look like a man who would be afraid of a little public fun. Erin would disappear for a moment, then return … catching them in the act. </p><p>Fatima was too shy not to be unaffected by that during the negotiation. </p><p>She crouched down, peeking from the corner to get a glimpse. Not because she expected them to start quickly, but to get a better sense of when to return. She couldn’t return too early, which would be useless. But, she was afraid of being too late and catching them naked. </p><p>That would just send Fatima away running, which was not what she wanted. </p><p>She watched as Darion put his arm around her waist and dragged her. From the intensity of her whimper, Darion wasn’t particularly gentle either. Erin would be lying if she said she didn’t feel her blood flowing faster. </p><p>However, she was surprised by Darion’s next move. He pressed her against the leg raise machine, locking her in place. “Darion, she might come any moment,” she said.</p><p>Erin prepared to intervene. A minute should be enough to —</p><p>And, just like that, she lost her chance. Darion pulled Fatima’s shorts without warning, and before Erin could react, her legs were already around his shoulder. It was already too late. </p><p>She couldn’t just go and catch them. </p><p>At that moment, she should just leave … but then, Fatima started moaning as Darion ate her, showing that he wasn’t a slouch when it came to pleasuring a lady. No wonder a rich woman like Fatima kept him as a boy toy. </p><p>A man that looked like that, yet actually worked for her pleasure…</p><p>Erin could feel warmth pooling between her legs as she watched him eat her to a rapid climax. “Please, faster,” Fatima begged again and again as his tongue invaded her, her body rocking. </p><p>However, when she was hit with a climax, Erin assumed it would be the end. After all, Fatima was the boss, and he was the boy toy. She doubted Fatima would bother paying back. </p><p>Well, it turned out her read on their dynamic might have been inaccurate, and Fatima suddenly ended up on his lap, immobilized. “Darion, please, she can return any moment,” she whispered.</p><p>“Well, then you better pay back quickly, mistress,” he answered. Erin didn’t miss the sarcastic tone in the last word. Erin couldn’t help but pull her top slightly to the side. With her nipples getting hard, it was getting uncomfortable. </p><p>Darion was even more aggressive than she expected, pulling off Fatima’s top directly, leaving her wearing only shoes. It meant, that if someone walked in, Fatima wouldn’t have any chance to fix her clothing. </p><p>A spectacular show … getting even better. Erin bit her lips, and watched…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“I need to go. Don’t answer the door for anyone until I return, and rip this paper in case of an emergency,” I said as I rapidly drew another talisman. She looked fascinated by my glowing finger, enough to distract the urgency of my tone. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t have the time to tease her while explaining how it worked. Before she could even say anything, I was moving near my full speed. I hoped that the reason for it was because Sophie had managed to extract some important information that she wanted to share, but I had a feeling that it wasn’t the case. </p><p>I doubted Sophie ripped it for anything but a pure emergency.  </p><p>It was fortunate that Lana’s house was in the suburbs, near the outskirts of the town, meaning I didn’t need to be concerned with cameras for long before I started moving at full speed. </p><p>Mere minutes later, I was near the cave. The signs of fighting had been easy to discover, making me revisit the decision to leave her alone. I had been planning to return, but with the clandestine nature of our prisoner’s operation, I expected them not to notice his disappearance for a while more. And, considering the great distance between the car and the cave, I expected them to spend even more time to find the cave, confident that I would have returned soon. </p><p>A big mistake. </p><p>The cave had two bodies, our prisoner, dead with a jagged stab wound, the other downed with an impressive number of gunshots, still holding the jagged blade in question. I spent a second examining the second intruder.</p><p>I put my hand, examining his meridians and the remnants of the essence, ignoring the sense of disgust that rose in me. The disgusting state of their essence was the reason that the demonic cultivators were truly reviled even more than their preference toward mass murder. As much as it rankled to me, they weren’t the only group of cultivators that killed mortals … but demonic cultivators went a step forward, and devoured their essence, not only damaging the souls of their target — which was an unacceptable crime — but also driving themselves to madness in the process with their tainted essence. </p><p>A touch was enough to confirm that he had been a demonic cultivator, just like his garish weapon implied. He was merely at the first stage of the Essence Gathering, likely still toxicated with his power, explaining how he had been killed. </p><p>However, the footsteps suggested he wasn’t the only one, merely the first, so I left the cave, closed my eyes, and focused on discovering their location. It took a while for me to discover Sophie’s location, which was farther than I expected her to move since I had received the alert.</p><p>She didn’t alert me the moment she had been under attack. Stubborn and brave. </p><p>Also, quite stupid. </p><p>She was lucky that I had to deal with allies who had made much more spectacular and monumental displays of stupidity, so I didn’t care much about the situation before I started moving forward. Also, she was lucky that it looked like none of her pursuers were cultivators. It looked like they had only one demonic cultivator as a part of their group, who decided to move first, confident in his power. </p><p>Alerting Sophie just in time. </p><p>As I moved, I started to come across bodies. Four, I counted, two who had been dressed in the same dark suit that the agent had been wearing, the others wearing ordinary clothing. An interesting mixture, but I didn’t stop examining, it because I could see blood gathered in several spots where it didn’t make sense for the attackers to stop. </p><p>Sophie was wounded. </p><p>“Stubborn girl,” I lamented even as I moved forward. I could still feel her presence, which was quite distinct due to the special nature of her aura, but the closer I got, the more I could see her life fleeting. </p><p>Soon, I reached a hill. She was behind a cover, bleeding, while three gunmen surrounded her, attacking her position, two dressed in ordinary clothing, one wearing a suit. “Die for us,” one of them cried, the maddened edge impossible to miss. </p><p>A failed demonic cultivator, I realized. It wasn’t surprising to see them around the actual demonic cultivators, as while demonic techniques had a lower threshold for success, actually reaching the Essence Gathering stage was still the exception other than the rule unless the disciples were selected and raised carefully, particularly in a spiritually poor planet like Earth.  </p><p>Not that demonic cultivators cared about the low success rate. From their perspective, they had unlimited cultivation resources, and they cared more about the mentality of the candidates — sadism, violence, and a desire to do everything for immediate power — than their potential. </p><p>The madness of the gunmen was enough evidence. The third one, wearing the suit, looked put together, and didn’t display any sign of madness, but he also wasn’t surprised by the maddened actions of his allies, showing he was used to it. </p><p>I took it all at a glance before ignoring, it for one simple reason. Sophie has been already wounded and was barely able to hold on. I could have taken one of them prisoner, but their success in finding the cave suggested they had a method of discovering the location of their members. Either through some kind of blood resonance, or a technological method that I didn’t know. </p><p>Either way, I wasn’t in the mood to bother with prisoners, not when I had already discovered their likely locations. Instead, I raised the blade I had picked from the thrift shop, closed my eyes for a second, and focused on one of my favorite techniques. </p><p>Ethereal Blade of Air. </p><p>It was a simple technique, one that had been taught to the Outer Disciples, but it was when I had managed to learn it in Major Accomplishment stage in less than a year, that I had gained the right to compete for the Inner Disciple position. </p><p>Almost all Inner Disciples abandoned such techniques once they had access to better ones, but when I first rose, I lacked the resources to apply for a better technique, and I continued to use it longer, raising it to the Perfection stage before I could get a more powerful technique. </p><p>Still, despite having far stronger techniques, I continued to use Ethereal Blade of Air, because it was perfectly silent, delivering excellent sneak attacks. And, under the current circumstances, it had one more advantage. </p><p>It consumed almost no Essence, meaning it would leave no clue for the others to discover. </p><p>I let out my breath, right on the blade of my knife before I flicked it, and three near-invisible arcs left my weapon, killing all three of my targets at the same time.</p><p>“I-impossible,” Sophie stammered as she watched my attack, her eyes wide. </p><p>“Everything is possible, honey,” I said even as I stood in front of her. “But we have more important things to discuss, like the fact why you have waited too long to call.” </p><p>“I …” she said, her voice suddenly thick. “I don’t know. Arrogance, maybe. I didn’t expect them to come in such force, then panicked…”</p><p>“Well, we can talk about it later,” I said. </p><p>She chuckled as I said that, which I didn’t understand until her next words. “It’s a pretty bad lie,” she said. “I have been in enough firefights to know what a punctured artery wound looks like. Even if we were in a hospital, it’s too late,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said even as I put my hand on her shoulder, trying to focus on my Essence. I was even worse in healing than in formations, but it was just a clean wound, delivered by mortal weapons, with no pesky essence sticking to the wound and damaging the soul. </p><p>Making it much easier to heal. However, before I could start to heal her, she grabbed my hair, which surprised me. The kiss that followed, gentle and lingering, surprised me even more. “It’s good that you arrived,” she whispered. “I appreciate a goodbye kiss.” </p><p>I opened my mouth, ready to tell her that it was not the end, but her finger landed on my lips. </p><p>“You don’t have to say anything. It was my arrogance,” she whispered. “But, it’s a pity that I won’t be able to see if your magic abilities extend to the bedroom.” </p><p>“Oh, they do, but it’s not magic,” I corrected her, and she chuckled listlessly, her eyes already closed, preparing herself for darkness. Too bad for her that I had no intention of allowing it. I kept my hand on her wound as I carefully let a small part of my Essence enter and  enhance her body’s natural recovery, the wound wasclosing. </p><p>A few seconds passed, which was enough for the wound to start closing and the blood to regenerate. </p><p>“Warm…” she whispered. “I feel warm.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “I know. That’s how we know healing works.” </p><p>Her eyes popped open in shock, and she gazed down, only to see her wound recovering her real-time. The realization that she was alive hit her hard, and I could see tears gathering in her eyes. I decided to distract her. </p><p>“It looks like you’ll be able to test my supernatural skills in bed, after all,” I said. </p><p>Just like that, tears were gone, replaced by blush, followed by anger, the artificial kind that she forced herself to cover up her shy reaction. “Shut up. I didn’t say that!”  </p><p>“Understood,” I chuckled as I took a step back, my hands raised in surrender. </p><p>Teasing her was fun. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The person who opened the door was just as I expected … and yet surprising. </p><p>She was a brunette with glasses, her posture slouched, unable to make eye contact, and wearing clothes at least three sizes larger. She was only lacking thick eyeglasses and dirty hair to look like a nerd from the shows I had been watching when I was a child. </p><p>Yet, her aura was the complete opposite. It was an indescribable mixture of soft and sharp, the boundary shifting and shuffling, a confusing mess. Her aura felt like trying to decipher a complicated formation pattern. </p><p>No wonder Sophie trusted her to handle her work. “You must be Lana,” I said. She nodded but didn’t say anything immediately. </p><p>“P-phones,” she stammered after a lengthy silence, which didn’t surprise me, as Sophie had mentioned she had added a message as a part of the phone message. Interesting, but nothing particular. </p><p>“As you wish, beautiful,” I said as I passed the phones, enjoying the way she blushed at the simple compliment. The moment she grabbed the phones, she darted away, leaving me to watch her as she moved. </p><p>A chuckle escaped my mouth even as I closed the door. Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have been interested in someone as shy as her, but the contrast between her general attitude and her aura fascinated me. I followed her slowly, looking around the house, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. There was not even a computer. </p><p>The reason revealed itself the moment I arrived at the basement, one that was filled with screens, cables, and blinking lights. I didn’t exactly know their value or capabilities, but considering phones were small enough to act as computers, I assumed enough gear to fill a large basement suggested serious firepower. </p><p>And, I could also understand why there was nothing else in her apartment about computers. The basement entrance was some kind of metal trap door, but once it closed, the entrance was hidden completely. It was clear that her identity as a hacker was secret. </p><p>However, I was less interested in the computers that filled the room, and more interested in watching her work. Not the work itself, as it was nothing more than a lot of black screens with flowing text, she typed furiously. Her shy expression was gone, replaced by pure, intense concentration. And, suddenly, her incredible yet confusingly well-defined aura made far more sense. </p><p>This was her domain, and there was no place for shyness. </p><p>She worked without saying anything, and I sat, enjoying her pretty face while I waited for her to finish, ignoring my desire to tease her, no matter how much I wanted to see if she would react differently while she was concentrating on her work. I would have done it if we were dealing with anything less important, but demonic cultivators unfortunately took priority. </p><p>After a long, half an hour work, she stopped typing and stood up with a sigh. </p><p>Only to gasp in shock. It looked like she didn’t even notice my presence while she had been working. “Is it done?” I asked. </p><p>“N-not particularly, no,” she answered, her blush growing even as she avoided my gaze. </p><p>“Really?” I said. “I expected it to be faster since the phones were already unlocked.” </p><p>“T-there’s several layers of independent protection and encryption that don’t suddenly disappear when they unlock the phone, it’s not simple. Whoever designed the systems was very careful to keep their information hidden. We have to wait a while some of my programs rotate through the password fragments I managed to scrape. It takes time!” she answered, her voice suddenly more heated, reacting to a perceived insult to her work intensely. </p><p>“Sorry, beautiful. I know next to nothing about computers. I can’t understand what’s easy and what’s hard,” I answered. </p><p>“Oh, sorry,” she replied, the apology enough to suppress her anger, already pulling back. A pity. I liked her passion. </p><p>“No problem. Maybe, once this mess is over, you might explain things over dinner. I know a place with excellent burgers.” Her blush grew even more at the invitation. She might be shy, but she was not stupid, and she understood that it was an implied date. Yet, she was too shy to even answer. I decided to change the subject. “Why don’t you tell me how you two met?” </p><p>“It was three years ago when Sophie was still working for the FBI,” she said, happy to change the topic. “I have been … visiting databases that I wasn’t supposed to, leaving my hacker insignia just to prove that I was there. One day, I made a mistake and Sophie picked on it, tracking me in the real world.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said. “Then, what happened?” </p><p>“She had been dealing with a complicated case back then,” Lana continued with a sigh. “Some kind of complicated money laundering scheme using cross-border digital art purchase, but the FBI analysts failed to crack their exact method,” she added, the disdain she had for the analysts coming across clearly despite her general shy attitude. “It was easy to wrap up.” </p><p>“Then, what?” I asked. </p><p>“She convinced me that helping her in some of trickier digital crimes was a better use of my time than hacking for fun,” she said. “Until…” </p><p>“Until she had been kicked out of the FBI, and you decided to follow her,” I completed. She nodded. “It was brave of you, following her to the middle of nowhere, to help her discover a crime that the government is trying to cover up.” </p><p>She snorted at the mention of the government, but only for her blush to grow when I looked at her questioningly. “They are a bunch of selfish, corrupt people that care about nothing but their projects. I care nothing about the government,” she explained, showing that her shyness wasn’t about her radical approach, but her simple reaction. </p><p>Such an interesting bundle of conflicts, making me wonder just how different she might have been during the different parts of her life. Unfortunately, there was nothing I could do … even if I seduced her, we would barely have time for a fun quickie, and she was too interesting to be neglected like that. </p><p>“Unfortunately, it looks like how the world works,” I said, letting silence fill the room for a moment. </p><p>“I have a question,” she said. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said. </p><p>“I have researched you, but for some reason, I couldn’t to find anything,” she said. “How did you manage to live off the grid like that?” </p><p>“I have been living in a secret enclave since my childhood. I didn’t have much opportunity to walk around,” I said, which was true as far as Earth was concerned. </p><p>“A big sacrifice… even for magic,” she said, trying to sound casual, but it was an attempt to probe me about my abilities. Not entirely shocking, as it was her system that allowed her to discover me. However, her lack of information was made obvious by the terms she used. </p><p>It was the weakest attempt at subtle questioning I had ever seen, and I couldn’t help but answer her question. “Well, sometimes, I wonder the same thing,” I said honestly, but since I didn’t want to go deeper into that topic with someone I had just met, even if she was very interesting, I changed the topic. “Also, magic is not the correct term for it,” I said. </p><p>“Really, what is it?” she replied, enthusiastic about my actual answer. </p><p>“That …” I started, and her enthusiasm grew. “That’s something we can discuss during the dinner, maybe with some drinks,” I said, her enthusiasm being replaced with another blush, but she was unable to answer. </p><p>I was planning to tease her more, but a beeping noise distracted her. “I managed to uncouple the GPS module,” she said, enthusiastic to turn her attention back to the problems she could understand. </p><p>“A translation for someone that has no idea about how it works,” I said. </p><p>“There’s a design problem in these phones. GPS module was supposed to erase the data, but it only erases the pointers without the proper rewrite procedures —” she started, but soon noticed that her explanation wasn’t any better. “I can check the locations he had visited during last week. I don’t have the matching time record, but we can see any location where he had spent significant time.” </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said. </p><p>“Do you want me to send it to you?” she said. </p><p>“How? I don’t have a phone,” I said, which earned a shocked glance from her as I had just admitted that I was an alien. However, even as she reached for a drawer, I realized that, technically, I had spent more than half of my life away from my home planet. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder whether that qualified me as an alien. </p><p>“These are burner phones,” she said as she passed two phones to me, ones that looked much simpler than the others. Still, that didn’t fully explain it to me. “They are disposable ones,” she corrected. “Only I have the numbers. One for you, and one for Sophie, but only use them in emergencies. They are not completely secure.” </p><p>I nodded. “Okay, now, why don’t you show me the map,” I said. </p><p>“Are you sure? I can print it out,” she offered. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have a good memory,” I said as she turned, and I quickly memorized the details of the area where he had spent most time. A private house in the more affluent parts of the city, some kind of warehouse on the outskirts, and a certain location in the middle of the forest. “Interesting —” I started, but before I could complete my sentence, I felt a certain piece of paper warming in my pocket. </p><p>Someone needed help.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was glad that I had made a new friend — even though I had ulterior motives — because the second night at the bar was much emptier. </p><p>That didn’t surprise me. The last night, every nearby gang sent an agent to check whether the rumors about an out-of-town villain were real. Now that it was resolved, they didn’t want to suddenly crowd the place, not wanting to give the impression that they were my allies. Especially not before they could get an understanding of my particulars. </p><p>Also, with a thousand charged for each glass, my place was … not exactly cheap. </p><p>I still had a few customers, ones that belonged to the larger organizations, willing to pay that money to keep an eye on things, but I only had one or two customers at the bar. </p><p>It was why I was happy about having Emily’s number. I couldn’t interact with Tara while we had customers, not without breaking the mystique around her powers and personality — the only thing that was keeping me safe under the circumstances — so texting Emily turned out to be a good way to kill time. </p><p>And, not just because I managed to convince her to share several photos with me. </p><p>The more I teased her, the more I started to realize she was a secret exhibitionist, though, ironically, she was too shy to actually indulge that in her own. I might not even realized that detail if it wasn’t for my power-feeding details of the pictures she repeatedly shared from the special app that deleted the photos immediately. </p><p>Without my power, I wouldn’t even realize that she was completely naked, let alone the extent of her arousal. </p><p>I was glad to discover her secret for another reason as well. Reveling in a desire that she had been suppressing for a long while was a euphoric feeling, one that awakened a lot of positive impressions. And, all the while, I continued messaging, making sure to link her crush with me … the constant photos allowed me to maintain control over her mood. </p><p>I didn’t message constantly, but deliberately paced it in a way that kept her mood up … but just with a hint of insecurity maintained. </p><p>No need to make her feel too secure in our budding, warped relationship. </p><p>Only when I managed to establish a sense of dependency, I admitted that my real job was being a bartender in a shady bar. Did I want to admit that, no, but the risk of her discovering that on her own was much higher? </p><p>So, I mentioned my job, and talked a bit about it, just enough to give the impression that I had to work on it without going into so much detail, creating a nice excuse that I could explain in different ways in the future, as the situation required. </p><p>And, she was too hyped on her own personal discovery to question it for long, too distracted by the thrill of sharing her sexy photos.</p><p>Occasionally, I could see an even more intense blush in some of the photos she shared, along with a hint of defeat. It was subtle, but my power was enough to catch it easily, suggesting that there were several, far naughtier photos she had taken in the process, but she lacked the courage to send them to me. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until she broke that. </p><p>I had been expecting it to be the end, but then, the door opened, and a man walked in, one that raised my hackles just by looking at him. He was … dangerous. He was giving out very little. I was about to use my power in overdrive, but at the last second, I decided to put an alternative trick first. </p><p>‘Hey, you’re good with tech, right?’ I asked. </p><p>‘Well, you can say that,’ she wrote back quickly, and I could easily imagine her chuckling in amusement, considering her power. </p><p>‘Can I ask you a favor?’ I wrote. </p><p>‘Do you need me to repair your computer?’ she wrote, followed by a bunch of emojis. </p><p>’No, I have a tough customer in the bar that the boss wants me to impress. Can you help me by doing a quick social media check and give me an idea about him. Knowing about his likes and dislikes might help a lot,’ I said, and sent his picture. I didn’t take the photo directly but used one from the security feed. </p><p>What I had been asking wasn’t exactly hard. Anyone could do a search … given they had several minutes. </p><p>But, Emily’s response came almost instantly. ’Sure,’ she said, and twenty seconds later, a small file arrived on my phone. Too fast, suggesting that she had forgotten to hide her capabilities. </p><p>‘Wow, you must have some kind of program on your computer for social media research. Is it job-related, or should I be afraid?’ I wrote, followed by several emojis to convey I had been teasing her. </p><p>I didn’t want her to even suspect that I knew about her power, not yet. </p><p>‘Job-related,’ she wrote back immediately, happy to jump into the opportunity. </p><p>‘Why don’t you share a few photos wearing your work shirt then … and maybe nothing else,’ I wrote, pushing the discussion away from her tech achievement for two reasons. For one, I didn’t want us to focus on that. More importantly, she didn’t want me focusing on her blunder either, meaning she was incentivized to distract me…</p><p>Excellent. </p><p>While she disappeared for a moment, no doubt to change her outfit, I quickly went through the dossier she put together … my eyes widening with each page. I didn’t expect much. Maybe a name and a little about his past, but instead, I had a full breakdown, education history, favorite restaurants, childhood pet, and even his online gaming account, most of it under nicknames, not easily connected. </p><p>Emily really went the distance. </p><p>The information was amazing … though, even more incredibly, there was no scrap of private information. Every account, every photo, every little detail was perfectly legal to have. I didn’t even want to imagine what Emily might have collected if she had a few more minutes. </p><p>And, the guild was using her as a mere receptionist. </p><p>It was criminal. </p><p>Of course, I might understand why they didn’t care much about her achievement, as most of the information she had collected was rough, some wrong, some outdated. Sifting through such information was not easy … well, wouldn’t have been easy if it wasn’t for my power. </p><p>What she had sent me was the literal perfect feed for my power, giving me a lot of hints to follow and confirm through his physical appearance. </p><p>Emily had limited the information to public, safe topics, probably unaware that, even information like places of employment gave me a dangerous line of bread to follow, one that might allow me to identify which organization he was working for by digging deeper by his favorite cafe and his place of employment…</p><p>Maybe even asking Emily to help … once she trusted me more. </p><p>For now, I focused on mixing the perfect drink for my drink, a surprisingly sweet martini variant that would have been thrown out by any other customer. Yet, his eyes widened the moment he sipped it, first by delight … soon turning into panic, his mind no doubt questioning just how much I knew about him to afford to show off like this. </p><p>A bluff that still worked … but I had no doubt that, sooner or later, it would stop working. I needed a backup plan. </p><p>Luckily, that backup plan had arrived at me in the form of a busty blonde with an exhibitionist streak. When I returned to the bar, her photo was waiting for me. A full-length photo, taken from high up to hide her ass — a modest choice considering she followed my order and wore nothing but her shirt. </p><p>The real show was her cleavage. She had kept only the top two buttons open, which might have looked modest in another woman, with more modest proportions. However, without a bra, her bust was straining her shirt excellently, and the high angle enhanced the cleavage even more. </p><p>Enough to make my mouth water in excitement. </p><p>I wrote back several compliments, but I didn’t ask for more pictures, aware that I was already pushing my luck even with the assistance of my power. It was just the first night of our meeting, after all, and I didn’t want her panicking. </p><p>Half an hour later, I sent her the picture of two hundred dollars, which surprised her until I explained to her that, it was the amazing ‘tip’ I received, because the information she provided was very helpful, which followed a flurry of discussion until I managed to convince her that she should take a hundred as payment for her services, that she deserved it. </p><p>Of course, that was far less than her work deserved, but I couldn’t reasonably give her more without explaining the truth of my business. She ultimately accepted it … and promised to research other ‘customers’ for the same fee. </p><p>Just like that, I had a researcher. </p><p>An unexpected development, and a risky one as well considering her place of employment. </p><p>But certainly useful. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I left the guild headquarters and walked away, I had a big smile on my face, surprised by the welcome benefit. The initial trip was just supposed to help me better understand the layout of the guild to see if I could poke around.</p><p>I certainly didn’t expect to find, let alone seduce, a superpowered but neglected receptionist. A win for me, even if her superpower was possibly just as useless as it looked. I could see several ways it could be combined with my power, with the potential to give me the edge I desperately needed. </p><p>Enough of a potential to make me ignore my growing headache. </p><p>I didn’t immediately start dreaming about the future and the potential combinations. To properly test the synergies, I first needed to convince her that the guild wasn’t the best place for her to work … and I doubted it would be easy. If the message from the puzzle was even halfway accurate, it showed that the Guild was willing to do a lot to keep the people working for them.</p><p>Assuming Emily could resign easily just because her power was not remarkable would have been a dangerous assumption. </p><p>Of course, that was a future concern. I first needed to make sure her initial attraction grew into something more fascinating. </p><p>A quick check of the cameras showed that there was nothing going on around my bar that needed my immediate concern, giving me the time to swing by the store and buy a new phone. I had no idea how her power worked, but I rather be safe than sorry. </p><p>I started texting, and Emily responded immediately … too quickly to be just about her enthusiasm. She was clearly using her power. </p><p>I was tempted to just talk her through the phone for hours, but instead, I chose to text a few minutes, take a long break, and take another break. No need to overwhelm her immediately. </p><p>I had to be careful, because there was precious little my power could feed through text messages. </p><p>While I texted her, I went back to the bar at first, getting rid of the disguise. Tara was at the bar, cleaning the bottles from the dust her digging had created. “Everything alright, sir?” </p><p>“Yes, everything is perfect,” I answered as I grabbed her from behind, enjoying the whimper that she let out, tempting me to pull her down for some fun. Unfortunately, I needed to go around and be visible. </p><p>The more visible I was, the fewer questions the villains would ask about what I was doing outside their notice. I got rid of my disguise and changed into thick jeans and a leather jacket, looking like a classic biker. “Be careful, and don’t leave the bar,” I ordered Tara. “I’ll pick up dinner on my way back.” </p><p>My plan was to drive all around the city, both as a chance to get a lot of general observations to put my power to use, and to give the villains something to pay attention to. </p><p>I soon decided to add another benefit. I started taking occasional photos with my new phone and sharing them with Emily. I was not exactly a professional photographer, but my power allowed me to catch some interesting stuff that I would have missed without my power helping me to catch them. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t suddenly start captured by a desire to reflect the world or such nonsense. No, I was sharing those photos with Emily, acting like moving around was a part of my job … all for one aim. </p><p>‘How about you send one back to me,’ I wrote. </p><p>‘I’m just sitting on a desk for a whole day. I don’t have anything beautiful to share,’ she wrote back, followed by a frown. </p><p>‘How about your beautiful face,’ I wrote back. Which was not flirting, despite how it looked.  No, I needed a picture from her, because I was having trouble reading her messages. A picture was not enough to replace real interaction, which gave me much more from her micro-expressions to the way her breathing patterns. </p><p>It was much better than a few lines of text. </p><p>She didn’t send one immediately, but I didn’t panic. I might have not read her with my power, but the speed and content of her messages were still enough to confirm that it was enough. </p><p>I still sent another message. ‘I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you such a thing. I understand if you want me to stop texting,’ it read, giving one that worked well to highlight to her that she could accidentally hurt me emotionally if she didn’t react to my messages in time.  </p><p>A touch manipulative, maybe, but very effective. My phone buzzed with a message, one that shared a cute, blushing selfie. </p><p>Success. </p><p>‘You look beautiful,’ I wrote, feeling far more confident now that I could see her blushing face and her shy smile. She sent another picture, and I complimented her. Ten minutes later, another arrived, their difference stark. </p><p>The first picture was shy yet panicked, one that she sent to assure me that she was still thinking of me and didn’t want to stop messaging. The second one had a surprising quality … but the third one showed an almost enthusiastic quality. </p><p>She enjoyed my compliments … probably because she wasn’t receiving many with her body hidden behind her unnecessarily loose boring pantsuits.</p><p>Fascinating, I thought, making sure to give a lot of praise and compliments back. I didn’t even need to ask for another picture. Just a few compliments were enough to get another photo. </p><p>While that was going on, I continued to move around the city in a random pattern even as the evening slowly started to draw near. </p><p>‘I’m back at home,’ she wrote even as I was driving back. </p><p>‘How about another picture,’ I wrote back. </p><p>‘Give me a few minutes first. I’m about to change,’ she wrote. </p><p>I sent back a winky face. I didn’t need to see her face to know that she was blushing hard. </p><p>‘I … I can’t,’ she wrote back. </p><p>‘Just your face and shoulders, honey,’ I wrote back, pushing a bit hard. ‘Nothing naughty, I promise,’ I sent another. </p><p>She didn’t send back an answer for a while, which would have scared me quite a bit if it wasn’t for my power showing the depths of her shyness and self-doubt when I overcharged it. </p><p>‘I … I can’t take the risk of it leaking,’ she sent a message, which put a frown on my face. Not because I didn’t get the suggestive photo I had been hoping for, but because I made a mistake reading her. I was confident that I read her correctly. </p><p>What else I made such a monumental mistake…</p><p>Luckily, before I could lose myself in a sprawl of panic, she sent a link. Link of a public app … one that erased the pictures five seconds after opening. ‘It’s not that I don’t trust you, but there’s a lot of hackers,’ she said in a message, then sent several more explaining about the security of it. </p><p>I installed it, glad that I got a disposable phone for that purpose and wasn’t running the risk of some kind of hacking. </p><p>The fact that the app was a public one made it even safer. </p><p>She sent a response back. A wordless one, one that showed only her face and shoulders as I asked, but her blush was considerably more intense than I was expecting. The picture disappeared five seconds later … and, if it wasn’t for my power, I would have never caught the reason for her intense blush, and would assume that it was just about the jitters. </p><p>But, with my power, I was able to catch a distorted reflection of her body on a small ornament. It wasn’t much … just enough to tell me that she was completely nude. </p><p>What a nice surprise. </p><p>I wrote back a lengthy list of compliments as I parked my bike in front of the bar, which worked well to earn a few more pictures, all while she was in her room. None of those pictures showed anything more than her face and shoulders, and none of them had conveniently located small reflective surfaces for me to catch what was going on — the bigger mirrors, she clearly avoided deliberately. </p><p>Yet, her blush told me all I needed about her state of nudity, making me feel very aroused. </p><p>I walked in. Tara was at the bar, going through the prep list I had given to her, dicing lemons, crushing ice, and washing the cocktail implements. </p><p>She heard my approach, but didn’t turn, just raised her ass invitingly. Naughty minx. I said nothing as I approached, kissing her neck, enjoying the way she shivered against my body, tempting me to bend her down and take her against the bar. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was already evening, and on the security cameras, I could already see several bodyguards checking the area, to make sure there was no danger for their bosses.</p><p>Meaning, I would have customers soon. </p><p>“Why don’t you go and change. We’ll have visitors soon,” I said as I slapped her ass, enjoying her shiver, ignoring the temptation of a quickie by pushing her against the bar. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said, disappointed. </p><p>“Work hard, and I’ll make your reward memorable,” I added, which made her skip a step in anticipation… </p><p>Fascinating, I said as I started waiting for my customers. Though, unlike the previous evening, I didn’t expect a crowd.  </p><p>Luckily, I had my texting partner to keep me occupied. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, that was not what I expected,” I murmured as I lay on my hospital bed, unfortunately, but inevitably alone. </p><p>The responsible party, the papers in front of me. </p><p>It was after midnight since I arrived at the hospital, and my initial plan was to spend a lot of time with my sexy nurse. That was interrupted by the arrival of several reporters, which was more than I expected even with my little ploy. </p><p>Meaning,  my ‘caring’ nurse had to leave early, leaving her place to a bunch of nosy reporters. My doctor didn’t seem to care about my life that much, letting them inside, bragging about his genius intervention saving my life for a long while. </p><p>Followed by a long session with the reporters, in which they shamelessly revealed how the world changed while I was asleep, testing my reaction. In response, I put an exaggerated acting. Not to annoy the reporters; though that was definitely a bonus as they failed to get their shocked poor coma patient routine despite their most aggressive questioning. </p><p>It had other objectives. The biggest was the intent generation. I had long realized that Intent was not just attention, and required strong emotions to empower it. Hate, anger, joy, and desire worked. Pity did not, so showing up in the local news as the poor soul who had just lost three years wouldn’t help me. </p><p>Another benefit was to reinforce my secondary excuse. While the coma excuse would be enough for the legal issues — I hoped — the same didn’t apply to the secret organizations that would be looking for my case. The poorer I acted, the easier it would be for them to assume that my trick wasn’t an important one. </p><p>And, convincing them that I was a bad actor would only help in the future. </p><p>So, as reporters pushed me, I played my own game. </p><p>However, none was the reason I looked at the papers in surprise. No, I was looking at it, because of the title of one of the tabloids. </p><p>-Ex-Quarterback Gives No Quarter-</p><p>It was an aggressive title, but not as aggressive as the pictures underneath. All taken while I was having fun with my sexy nurse. Someone had managed to take my pictures while I was not paying attention to my surroundings because I was trying to control my own reaction. </p><p>“At least they used good pictures,” I said as I examined the pictures, which showed quite a few of my tense muscles as I had been drilling into my sexy nurse. Luckily, none of the photos actually showed her discarded uniform or her face, leaving her identity a mystery. </p><p>Since the same courtesy hadn’t been extended to me, I guessed it was more about the newspaper not wanting to anger the hospital than their general journalistic integrity. Because the article that followed was interesting in more than one way. </p><p>It had cast quite a bit of aspersions on my character, reckless Playboy being the softest one. Yet, those direct insults were nothing compared to the other point the article was making. The article spent quite a bit of time questioning how a man who had just woken up from a coma could exert himself that much. </p><p>From there, I would have expected them to follow up and accuse me of being a fraud. </p><p>They chose a different path. </p><p>The article repeated several times just how exceptional my recovery had been, using words like miracle, incredible, and unbelievable very liberally, until it became obvious even to a child that they were accusing me of having superpowers without openly saying it. </p><p>An incredible violation of privacy, and borderline illegal. During my research, I noticed that the government had laws about revealing the identity of people with superpowers, but from the way the newspaper wrote the article, it was clear that it was not a law that was enforced with great tenacity. </p><p>Being exposed — both physically, and in terms of power — without my permission wasn’t a good feeling, but I felt myself in a forgiving state. </p><p>The reason lay in front of me. </p><p>[System Damage — 2.1%]</p><p>Now that I was awake after my long nap — which I had fallen once the reporters left — I could feel several lines of Intent connecting to me, mostly jealousy and lust, all coming from all around the city. Benefits of a sex scandal. </p><p>Naturally, despite it being a part of the flashy title, I wasn’t naive enough to think that people actually cared about a quarterback who only played a few games before the disaster. </p><p>What excited people was a sex scandal about a potential hero? </p><p>“It looks like my path is set,” I thought. In some ways, the unexpected scandal was inconvenient, as it had prevented me from exactly how to reveal myself. And, leading with my potential hero identity, even though their existence was more or less common at this point — ensured by the weird magical effect that made people more accepting of the strange — was not my first choice. </p><p>At least, it wasn’t my last choice either. Because, at this point, whether I wanted or not, the die was cast. </p><p>I decided to enjoy the advantages. One of them being expedited bureaucratic response. Next to the papers, there was a new driver’s license, already waiting for me, showing that at least one government office took my potential as a hero seriously. </p><p>A useful detail, as I wasn’t looking forward to going through hoops to prove I still existed. Also, it showed the government’s general attitude since I woke up with a small courtesy gift rather than being taken away by a bunch of people in suits. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured as I stood up. While my stay had been fun and beneficial, I had no intention of staying in the hospital. Not after my unintentional reveal removed any need to pretend weakness. And, I even had my ID, which would make it possible to mix back. </p><p>The sooner I did so, the sooner I could start collecting Intent. The accidental sex scandal had been beneficial, but it wasn’t even enough to repair the System, let alone help me collect the next day’s reward. </p><p>I needed more. </p><p>It was time for the Sunset town to have its full-time hero. </p><p>But first, find some clothes. </p><p>I didn’t have any clothes, which was a problem, so I put on a hospital gown before I left my room. The moment I stepped out of the door, a lot of people started gossiping, wondering about whether I was a hero, the Intent flow getting more Intense. </p><p>The Intensity didn’t even match the way people reacted during my brief stint as a celebrity, giving me a good idea of where the heroes fell. Currently, I am a local celebrity, and not a particularly popular one. </p><p>Highlighting that whatever fame was triggered by the sex scandal wouldn’t last long. </p><p>“Sir, you can’t be up,” one of the nurses said immediately as she rushed to me, worried. But, I wasn’t bad when it came to reading people. She wasn’t worried for my health, but for herself, and it was a low-level fear. So I ignored her while I walked toward the counter. </p><p>“I want to leave the hospital,” I said. The receptionist was equally worried. </p><p>“Sir, we advise you to —” she started, but I waved my hand. “Nonsense, just process me, and find me some clothes,” I said, a little louder than I would have normally said, understanding exactly why they were trying to delay me. </p><p>Before she could find an answer, my doctor came dashing. “Terry, please wait. We still have a lot of tests to make sure you can leave the hospital safely —” he started. </p><p>“If I’m healthy enough to deal with a dozen reporters, I’m healthy enough to leave the hospital,” I said. “Unless the laws changed when I was in a coma, of course.” </p><p>I might have applied just a dash of Intent to scare him further. Not enough to be suspicious — they already knew I had some kind of rapid recovery, and super strength looked common enough, but I would have preferred if they didn’t realize I had other abilities — but enough to truly scare him. </p><p>It might have worked to my benefit, but when he called the dozens of reporters to ambush me about the changes the world had experienced, he lost any hint of mercy I might have felt toward him. </p><p>“What about the hospital bill. You have collected quite a hefty hospital bill. What if you stay for a few days, and we forgive the bill,” he said, showing that he was rather enthusiastic about experimenting on a hero. </p><p>“Oh, I won’t be paying any bills,” I said with a big smile. </p><p>“That’s—” he started. </p><p>“First, I don’t have any assets, so even if you sue, I won’t pay. Second, if you even dare to send me one, I’ll sue you for emotional damages for letting all those reporters in.” </p><p>“Y-you don’t look damaged,” he started, but I could see that he was reaching. </p><p>“It’ll be the judge’s call, right?” I said. He collapsed, defeated. </p><p>And I walked away. </p><p>Dealing with assholes was always fun. </p>",

    "content": "<p>She froze underneath me, trying to catch up with the sudden change. Her burning arousal left no doubt about her answer. “A-alright,” she muttered. “It’s only fair, right?” </p><p>“Exactly, it’s only fair,” I said. She seemed to have forgotten I had just woken up from a very long coma in her desire, which, under different circumstances, might have been problematic, but was a boon in my case. </p><p>The System for the win. </p><p>Of course, once she stopped, she would realize I didn’t act like someone who had just woken up from a coma, but it was not a problem. Since I had no hope of hiding my powers since everyone that mattered already knew about it. </p><p>And, not bothering to play the role had another underrated advantage. I had no doubt that, once someone really dug into my medical reports, they would eventually realize that they were fake. But, by acting vigorously, I would be giving the impression that I didn’t fear their discovery. </p><p>Which, hopefully, would make them act even more cautious. </p><p>I already had a plan to escape if that didn’t work. </p><p>Then, the sexy nurse under me whimpered, pulling my attention back to the present. There was no point wasting my time revisiting the plans I had already committed, not when I had a sexy beauty wiggling under me, excited about the service she would receive. </p><p>“So, let’s start,” I said even as I gently grabbed her chin, enjoying the way she trembled as I caressed her skin. And, suddenly, my own body was raging to go, as if to remind me, for years, I had not enjoyed the touch of a woman. For my consciousness, it was just a blink. </p><p>But, it looked like my body had other ideas, begging me to just rip off her uniform and enjoy her body. That, I forcibly clamped on. No matter how much my body raged for it, I wanted to savor the moment. </p><p>“W-where’s the sponge,” she whispered. </p><p>“It looks like I had lost it,” I answered even as I dipped my finger into the water, and dragged down her neck, leaving a beautiful water drop on her collarbone, pushing down her uniform in the process. “You don’t mind if I find an alternative way, do you?” </p><p>“Y-your fingers,” she stammered, her eyes wide with desire. She might have not expected the escalation, but that didn’t mean was unhappy about it. </p><p>“Well, not just them,” I whispered even as I let my fingers slide to her side, then leaned down to kiss her collarbone, her shiver beautiful. As I did so, I could feel her Intent flowing back to me, stronger than I expected … even under the circumstances. </p><p>I wondered if it was about the System upgrade, the changes in the world, or a combination. Then, she moaned, bringing me back to the moment. </p><p>“Delicious,” I whispered as I climbed up to her neck along with a blush, enjoying her subtle shiver. At the same time, my fingers were not staying lazy. I dragged a  finger over her lips, cluing her about what might follow. A sexy but innocent move. </p><p>My other hand was busy with things that were considerably less innocent. I had already slipped under her top, caressing her belly while moving forward steadily. </p><p>She didn’t have any complaints. She opened her mouth, her expression making it clear that she wanted me to go faster. I didn’t even let her say that before complying, and started kissing her. She responded immediately, her mouth open, allowing me to access it. A considerate lover as always, I slipped my tongue, enjoying her response as she wiggled underneath. </p><p>A few seconds into the kiss, her wiggling was already getting desperate. “Please,” she begged when I shifted to her neck, but I stayed teasing. </p><p>Though, I was surprised by her grabbing her uniform, ready to pull it open. That would not do. I was still in control. “Naughty,” I said as I grabbed her wrists, pinning them to the side. </p><p>“Please,” she whispered again. “I need it.” </p><p>“You’re the patient now,” I said. “You have to listen to your sexy doctor,” I said, amused by a flash of annoyance that passed over her face the moment I mentioned being a doctor. Someone was not a fan of them. </p><p>I chuckled and covered the awkwardness by leaning down, unbuttoning her uniform one by one … with my teeth. I could have grabbed her wrists with one hand and used my other hand, but this way was much more fun. And, my breath dancing over her growing cleavage was a good way to make her forget my earlier misstep. </p><p>However, as her cleavage grew, my body was getting harder and harder to control. It might have been easier to control myself if, what I had seen the moment I parted her shirt was her bra, which was a boring functional piece perfect for a workday. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had already removed that during my earlier ‘magic trick’, and as I slowly undressed her, what greeted me was the inviting pink of her areolas.</p><p>An invitation I failed to refuse as I delved down, capturing her nipple between my lips, earning a beautiful moan from her, one that tempted me to push even more. I desire that took all of my power to resist as I enjoyed her body. </p><p>Just because I was horny didn’t mean I had to push aggressively, no matter what my partner desired for it either. She was surprisingly submissive, her every move begging for me to dominate her, increasing the difficulty of refusing my own desire even more. </p><p>However, after three years, I was really afraid of letting loose, so I focused on slowly undressing her like a valuable present. Her moans, begging me to go faster, didn’t make it any easier to refuse the call. It took everything I had to keep back, and I had to kiss her whenever her moans got too much. </p><p>Not exactly a huge sacrifice. </p><p>Undressing her took ten minutes, each second delicious and torturous at the same time, her determined attitude to rub her body against mine not making it any easier. </p><p>“It’s time for the main course,” I whispered. </p><p>“Finally—” she gasped as her legs wrapped around my waist and pulled me inside. She had used that trick several times, but previous times, I refused. This time, I followed her pace, disappearing inside her sopping wetness. </p><p>Under my invasion, she just moaned, her legs tight around my body. It was a tame pose, basic missionary, but there was nothing tame about my determined drilling, nor in her desperate moans. I kissed her again to silence her, preventing her moans from bringing half of the hospital to us. </p><p>Though, it was a close call. After all that time, my body was burning with a desire I never had to deal with before, forcing me to focus fully on controlling my actions, avoiding the risk of injuring her with my strength.  </p><p>A mission that took all my focus even as I pushed into her steadily, giving her the orgasm she desperately needed. “That was amazing,” she murmured, the orgasm hitting her hard enough to turn her dazed. I was not in the mood to stop, so I grabbed some of the Intent she had been generating, stopped the System from absorbing it, transformed it into healing energy, and fed it back to her. “Now, the next turn,” she growled passionately. </p><p>Too passionately, making me realize that the impact of my abilities was also empowered somewhat. It didn’t just work to dispel her sudden exhaustion, but worked as an adrenaline injection — without the terrible jolting sensation. </p><p>“It’s my turn to ride,” she said, giddy as she flipped me and perched on my lap, rocking her hips, the sudden rush of energy making her forget her submissive tendencies. A surprising reaction, but as her hips started to rock back and forth with an impressive speed, I wasn’t exactly complaining. </p><p>Instead, I crossed my hands on the back of my head, fixed the pillow, and enjoyed her desperate ride, her beautiful tits dancing with each push. Altogether, it was a fascinating dance as she did her best to reach her next orgasm.  </p><p>And, letting her control the pace let me focus on controlling my own reactions, letting pleasure infuse me without letting it drive me crazy. It was a difficult call, but my willpower was no joke either. </p><p>She didn’t care about my stance as her hands landed on my chest, feeling my muscles. “Oh, my!” she gasped as she felt my chiseled muscles, once again enjoying their texture, this time with my heartbeat out of control.</p><p>Lost in pleasure, she had long forgotten the fact that I was supposed to be a coma patient. Maybe I would remind her … several hours later. </p><p>I needed to compensate for a dry spell that lasted years. I doubted a night would be enough, but it was a start.  </p><p>I exploded in her.  </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>“The royal family will pay for their betrayal!” I shouted repeatedly as I moved toward the castle, doing my absolute best to look like a reckless man hellbent on revenge, overestimating himself after an intense power-up. </p><p>Also, I wanted them to have no doubt about my intentions. I didn’t want the princes trying to take my allegiance. It might have been useful under different circumstances. Now, I wanted to make a show. </p><p>My repeated, magically enhanced shouts worked just as I wished. “Attack, for the name of the prince,” The shouts exploded as I moved over the hill, and I saw a significant part of the army stop the siege and line against me. </p><p>It was a chance for the forces at the castle to break the siege, but they didn’t take the opportunity, and just watched. What I intended. </p><p>As the army attacked, I repeated the trick I had used against the earlier squad, exclusively targeting the nobles and commanders among them, and attacking the commoners only when they got too close. “I have no problem with the common people. Retreat, and I won’t harm you,” I shouted even as I continued to pick off the nobles. </p><p>Morale was an interesting thing. Extremely useful, but fragile. Especially when the nobles were not just morally superior, but also physically. Not only they were better armored and had magical protections, but also they simply had higher stats and HP. </p><p>And, seeing their vaunted leaders disappearing with just one hit, their morale shattered, and they started running away. However, I could also see a lot of minor nobles mixed in the wave. Just like that, the army had stopped being a threat, while the prince and the bodyguards retreated into the city. </p><p>It looked like the prince didn’t care about the crown as much as his life.</p><p>I didn’t really care about him while I positioned myself in front of the capital, and started attacking the walls steadily, creating a show. The magical defenses of the capital were no joke. After all, it was a reason the second prince didn’t assault the capital, and was trying to break the morale instead. </p><p>Even against the constant barrage of light mana, the wards stood strong. Even with the intense assault that my new toy couldn’t sustain for long, it would take weeks, maybe even months to take down the wards. </p><p>Which was why it was good that all was just to make the Eternals take the bait. Not only did my near-endless usage of light mana suggest I had an external source for it, which they would assume to be Mariel,  but also it would help them to assume Mariel was still wounded or unconscious, making it a perfect time to catch her. </p><p>After all, if that hadn’t been the case, why would she not stop my extremely showy siege. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t betting only that. Attacking the capital in such a visible manner was showy, showy enough to be noticed by all Eternals, and not just the group that had been doing their best to be sneaky, forcing their hands further. </p><p>And, just like what I expected, they reacted by the most obvious tactic. They took Oeyne prisoner. Well, they took the mana clone I had left in her place prisoner. She was happily forging and experimenting in the secret base while the clone was already ambushed and captured by the Agents they had placed in the forge.  </p><p>To my surprise, they didn’t bring the clone to the walls to threaten me, but instead, brought her away, before a magical message was delivered to me, saying that they had imprisoned Oeyne, and I had to come to them if I didn’t want her to die. </p><p>It was a simple threat, but an effective one. After all, they knew I had gone a a lot of trouble just to send her a message, making her a good hostage. I was glad for it, because it gave me an excuse to pull back. “How dare you threaten her, you cowards,” I shouted as I sent another salvo of attacks before I started to retreat, acting like I blamed the royal family for it.  </p><p>Soon, I was at the ruins of the mansion, where I had been invited. A good location, I have to admit. The number of new wards — subtle enough to avoid the notice of a blacksmith — showed that they were prepared for it. </p><p>I could see about fifty people, but I could count another two hundred, hidden. It looked like they had pulled all the eternal agents forward. However, what I really wanted, that corrupted angel, was not there. “Let her go, or I’ll kill all of you,” I said as I moved forward in my walking fortress without attacking. </p><p>They didn’t do anything even though it brought them in range, and confident in their wards. “Surrender if you don’t want her to die,” one of them shouted. I recognized him as the one who had been trying to create a rebellion back in the forge. </p><p>He must be a ranking one. An amusing coincidence. “You’re angering me,” I said, but I didn’t attack them. After all, they were keeping Oeyne prisoner. “You don’t want to see me when I’m angry.” </p><p>“Really, what would you do,” he said. </p><p>“Let me show what I can really do, and maybe, we can have a talk,” I said even as I started firing all of my ballistas to empty locations. Presumably, to intimidate them. However, one of those attacks, in a display of complete coincidence and nothing more, hit a critical node, creating a malfunction in the hidden wards. </p><p>I could sense their mages reacting immediately to repair, but they weren’t too alarmed. After all, from their perspective, it was nothing more than a lucky shot. Actually calculating in real time would require a true genius. And repeating it while it was being repaired would require even more. </p><p>A goddess of knowledge. </p><p>I sent a mental note of thanks to Helga as she shared the exact three nodes I needed to hit to create a catastrophic failure in the wards. I followed it, and their hidden wards exploded, the backlash killing their mages.</p><p>The best part, it didn’t have any visible impact, allowing me to act unaware even as their amazing preparations were wasted, taking down a lot of their mages in the process. “Scared now?” I asked as I continued to move, like I assumed their sudden panic was about the explosiveness of my attack. “Leave my love alone, and I’ll not even bother killing you as you deserve for touching her!” I shouted, one that gave an excuse for my recklessness. </p><p>“We can still talk,” he offered. “We’re not here to hurt any of you, but to offer a membership to the true protectors of the land,” he said. </p><p>“Oh, the Eternals. The ones that had been arranging the deaths of the millions for their power,” I said, enjoying their sudden shift of expression. “Oh, yes. I know all about the true face of your gutless organization,” I said. </p><p>I noticed them setting a subtle teleportation array around Oeyne-clone, clearly prioritizing her safety over their other agents. Understandable, as she was a valuable hostage, and pulling her away would give them a chance to extend those talks. </p><p>“You can’t trust the words of a jealous prince, pouting just because we denied him the chance to join our glorious organization,” he said, though the way his mocking was exaggerated was clearly intentional. They were trying to probe the source of my information. </p><p>I was more than happy to give him one that would hopefully give me what I truly wanted. “A prince?” I scoffed loudly. “Like I would care about his words. No, I had been chosen by the true divinity. A beautiful angel had spoken to me, telling the truth about your cursed organization. I would die before joining an organization consorting with the monsters and the dead.” </p><p>He paused a moment, though it was obvious that he had been magically communicating with his leader. Excellent. “And, what if I tell you that we’re the chosen of the true divinity, and you are the one that had been lied to.” </p><p>“Unless you have another angel that will come and tell me that I’m lying, it won’t work,” I said. </p><p>“Well,” he said, and suddenly, a glow appeared at their center. It was a mere teleportation spell, but there were a lot of spells cast by other mages to turn into a show. Admittedly, a good show. Then, a familiar angel appeared. </p><p>“I’m here to tell you the truth, my son —” he started, only to be interrupted by a barrage of light bolts. The reason was simple. I could have allied with him, but the first thing he would ask would be to bring me to Mariel … and faking a goddess wasn’t as simple. </p><p>And, I still needed to pay him back. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 124</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>When I left the city, the general lines of a plan were already formed in my mind. The plan was more aggressive than I would have liked, but what I had learned from Oeyne, particularly about Titania’s capture, hastened my plans. </p><p>I needed to find a way to reach the base of the Eternals as soon as possible. </p><p>An intimidating target, but luckily, not particularly impossible. The city was already teeming with the Eternal agents, unaware that they had been discovered, which gave me a lot of targets to follow once things started to heat up … and the civil war made it far easier to trigger the chaos. </p><p>A civil war that my fake identity was already involved, thanks to the annoying habit of the princes trying to turn everything into a resource for their battle for the throne. </p><p>All I needed was to decide the size of the chaos I wanted to trigger. I could act tame, sneak into the capital, and start making small and suspicious moves from my base. It was not a bad plan. </p><p>It would have been one I would have picked if it wasn’t for the latest power-up I had received thanks to the necrotic god I had dealt with, more than doubling all my stats in the process. With the security blanket it provided, I had the option to be more daring. </p><p>Especially since I had already removed Oeyne from her room and moved her down the base I had created under the base, trying to get familiar with her new Divine Domain. It didn’t take her to decide to set up a base under the Capital, finding the tradeoff of limited movement underground a fair trade for improvement. </p><p>And, now, she was happily forging me an army of intricate armors that I could animate with magic, far more intricate and effective than I had used to trick the Necrotic god. </p><p>As she established her domain, I received my own rewards. A burst of new forging insights through our connection … and Stats.  </p><p>[+9 Precision]</p><p>Eternals were not aware of that strategic development, as I created a fake body to stay at the surface and trick the Eternals. </p><p>I even allowed that fake body to level up to make sure the trickery would hold against some basic magical probes. Now that I had access to Darkness mana through my connection with Mariel, I could put the fake body trick of the Princess to good strategic use. </p><p>Oeyne was safe … but they still thought that they had leverage against me after all the trouble I had gone to communicate with her secretly. </p><p>It was time for the civil war to have a third competitor, one that would put the Eternals on high alert. </p><p>For that, I moved to the hill, one that had the ruins of the fourth prince’s residence, where I had joined for a party. It was deserted, and already in ruins, but I didn’t care about the quality. What I cared about was it gave me an excuse to appear after such a long absence … and close enough to be visible. </p><p>“I AM FREE! NOW, THE ROYAL FAMILY WILL PAY FOR THEIR BETRAYAL!” </p><p>What I let out was a magically enhanced shout, one that was the inferior version of the trick I had used when I was trying to summon elves back into the capital. A shout that echoed Divine Spark slightly. </p><p>Naturally, the Divine Spark I chose to use was light. </p><p>They wanted Mariel. And I wanted to give them a clue about her, one that would be enough for them to focus on. I let a surge of mana follow that initial burst, made of pure light, turning into a sky beam that would be enough to get the attention of everyone in the capital. </p><p>And, while my enemies could start deciding what to do, I decided to start working. </p><p>Experimenting was fun, I decided even as I raised a hammer made of solid light … and used it to rapidly forge a large sheet of metal … then another, until I had replaced the ruins of the mansion with a castle made of light-infused metal. </p><p>Then moved on to forge a series of ballistas, each forged from metal, and required no ammo, working on Light Mana. </p><p>It was a devastating combination. Supplying enough mana was the only challenge … and since I was trying to convince the Eternals that Mariel was with me, it was even an advantage. The design was intricate and complicated, and if it wasn’t for my connections, which allowed both Helga and Oeyne to help me, it would have taken weeks to come up with a design. </p><p>With Helga solving the magical challenges and Oeyne dealing with the forging aspects, it took only minutes. As for the light projectiles, I didn’t even need Mariel’s help. They were rather simplistic. </p><p>But very effective. </p><p>I had been forging my independent weapons, very visibly, right on top of the forge, as I wanted to make a point about both my skills and my Divine Spark, like an arrogant Demigod drunk in his own power. </p><p>That was not accidental. I was doing everything to convince the Eternals that I was a rash, direct individual, driven by revenge despite my recent power-up. </p><p>While I had planned if they suddenly decided to attack me with their full might, I would prefer if they tried to manipulate me for a while, which would finally allow me to get an invitation. </p><p>I still didn’t dare to follow them back to their base directly, afraid of the possible magical defenses they had in place. </p><p>I might not agree with their political aspirations … or basic human decency; but there was no arguing about their incredible magical capabilities. Even with my capabilities, trying to sneak into their base directly was the last option. </p><p>Letting them bring me in was the better option. As a guest. </p><p>Or as a prisoner. </p><p>I had already finished forging all the ballistas, and was currently forging a huge leg, when I saw the first movement. A large group of mounted soldiers, rushed toward me. “Stop, in the name of the Empire. You’re under arrest —” the commander started. </p><p>Which was all he was able to say as I triggered one of the ballistas remotely, and he disappeared under a bolt of brightness. </p><p>Light mana was spectacular when it came to destructiveness. </p><p>“Attack him, before he can recharge his weapon,” one of the soldiers shouted. Not a ranking one, and more importantly, he was retreating even as he declared that. An interesting choice … one that turned even more interesting once I caught the fact that he was both too fast and too smooth to be an ordinary soldier. </p><p>I suspected that he was an Eternal spy, and decided to check … in a different way than I used. Instead of checking his soul space, I attacked him with another ballista. He dodged. </p><p>I attacked him two at the same time. He dodged one, but another hit.  </p><p>He survived. </p><p>I attacked with three more. This time, already wounded, he failed to dodge any of them. And, three bolts were enough to slay him. But, his incredible performance was telling enough. With his performance, he deserved to be a bodyguard for the prince. There was no way he could be just an ordinary soldier. </p><p>A spy. </p><p>It was an excellent way to catch one. </p><p>Ironically, the fact that it took so long to kill him encouraged the other soldiers to attack me. From their perspective, I had to struggle to kill a low-level soldier, which gave them confidence for victory.  Not something I intended, but also not something I was complaining about. </p><p>The large squad attacked me, confident in their victory, which only lasted until I took down their commander and the other three ranking officers. “Run, he’s too strong!” the soldiers shouted and dispersed. I let them go. I didn’t want to kill ordinary soldiers.</p><p>And, as they escaped, they would spread the news of my arrival, which also worked to my benefit. I wanted a commotion. I chuckled as I finished forging the other legs, and soon, I had a walking fortress, steadily moving closer to the capital. Enough to truly scare the princes, but it was just a side effect. </p><p>I wanted the Eternals, particularly that angel with the corrupted divine spark, to come for me, and my fortress gave me an excuse to fight against ordinary Eternal agents even if they suppressed the System once again, but it wasn’t strong enough to actually take an angelic demigod, certainly not one with two Divine Sparks. </p><p>Hopefully, that fact would be enough for him to come down. </p><p>I had a revenge to complete. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 124</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>With the secret tunnel in place, I just needed to put on a good disguise before I went to visit the New Giant Force Guild’s headquarters.</p><p>But, not before I set up all the temporary cameras I had purchased to make sure no one could sneak into the bar. With the tunnel in place, it was even more important for no one to get a glimpse of my office, and I couldn’t rely on Tara to make sure of that. </p><p>She was not exactly the most observant. </p><p>Once I finished setting up the cameras and assigned some miscellaneous tasks to Tara, I went in front of my bathroom mirror and started to put up a disguise. It was not an area I was an expert or even experienced in… </p><p>But, my power proved useful there. </p><p>It was not like Tara’s superpower made her a surprisingly effective construction worker. It was more indirect. I watched a few simple tutorial videos, my power allowing me to catch the critical details. More importantly, as I put on the changes, my power constantly provided me feedback, allowing me to catch some of the more obvious mistakes an amateur wouldn’t have realized. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I examined my small fake pimple on my chin and my baseball cap. Of course, the real change came from my posture change —  under the coaching of my power. My slouched shoulders and other stuff. </p><p>I looked like a perfect delivery person, giving me an excuse to approach the headquarters, at least enough to give a delivery to them.  </p><p>As I used the tunnel to leave the bar, I called a bakery and flower shop, asking for two deliveries. I asked for two deliveries, because I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to go into the guild headquarters, even for a delivery. </p><p>Instead, I decided to drop the basket of muffins to the building across, and use the opportunity to observe them and get a note of the general visitor rules. Naturally, I didn’t do something stupid like trying to slip a camera in or something as silly as that. </p><p>Underestimating the security protocols of the biggest guild of the city didn’t seem like a smart idea. </p><p>First, I visited the building across, and dropped the flowers at the reception, addressed to a random employee I picked from their website, with a vogue message of admiration. As I did so, I examined the headquarters entrance, taking note of the number of visitors going in and out … including a bunch of school children. </p><p>Just crowded enough to make the risk of visiting palatable. </p><p>I could see several high-tech detection devices, all tastefully hidden by the decoration. I just moved forward, not giving a sign that I noticed them, or tried to hide from them. There were no blind spots in the camera setup, and even if there were, using it would signal that I would be making a mistake. </p><p>My objective was to just drop the basket of baked goods — a gift from the appreciative citizens, with a sufficiently ego-stroking message attached. The best way to get in and out: not to make anyone question my presence.  </p><p>“I have a delivery,” I said as I approached one of the bored-looking receptionists, ready to just drop it and leave, happy with what I managed to glimpse out of my short visit. </p><p>However, when the bored receptionist — a beautiful blonde — raised her head, I suddenly decided to make a little change in my plan. </p><p>The reason … the way her phone worked as she kept her finger on,  but made no move, the message writing automatically. </p><p>She had a superpower, a conclusion that I reached quickly, and confirmed by my own superpower. Nothing fancier than the ability to interact with the tech directly, probably, considering she was a receptionist. </p><p>Well, her power might not be fancy enough for the guild, but for me, it was different. </p><p>“Can I help you?” she said, her tone clearly bored. I could read her name from her name tag. Emily. </p><p>“Certainly,” I said with a wide smile that I did my best to look charming. “I have a delivery from an appreciative citizen, thanking the heroes of the guild for saving them,” I explained, overcharging my power at that moment. </p><p>Getting a snapshot of her reaction, her boredom spiked with a flare of annoyance. Like the fact that the basket was a personal insult to her, but an insult she was used to. The flare disappeared, replaced by the boredom once again as she pulled a small detection device, and checked the baked goods. </p><p>I could see the device working in overdrive in her hands.  </p><p>Putting the pieces wasn’t particularly hard. Once upon a time, she was excited to have superpowers, but unlike me, she didn’t question how her powers would fit into an existing organization before joining the guild. She was probably hoping for a power armor to be used in her tech ability. </p><p>Probably, her power revealed some limits that prevented that path, and she ended up as a receptionist. </p><p>I could easily imagine myself sitting next to her, using my power to assess the level of suspiciousness in every visitor. A lifetime of boredom and insignificance… </p><p>Suddenly, despite all the risks, I found myself glad for my own situation. “I thank you on behalf of the New Giant Force, and we reiterate our promise to serve the city,” she said, her voice too mechanical not to be a memorized line. </p><p>Then, she stood up to grab the basket. She was wearing a conservative set of pantsuit, loose enough to hide her body … but that didn’t matter against my power. A glimpse was enough to confirm that, under those loose, conservative clothes, she was hiding a treasure. And, considering her makeup was deliberately understated and her blonde hair was gathered into a boring ponytail, it was clearly deliberate. </p><p>However, if it wasn’t for my power, I would have just assumed that she dressed like this to maintain her professionalism in the workplace. </p><p>Luckily, my power was still in overdrive, allowing me to read her micro-expressions easily as my gaze dipped down, realizing that it was insecurity that drove her. </p><p>Why, I didn’t know. My power was useful, but not omnipotent. Maybe it was her childhood traumas, maybe it was the impact of her imagined heroic career being derailed. Maybe it was just an ill-timed catcall, shattering her confidence completely. </p><p>Curious, but it shouldn’t have mattered. The smart thing was to thank her and leave the reception. After all, she was still a super, and still an employee of the guild. </p><p>But also, despite all the risks, she was in a perfect position to help me with one thing I was woefully lacking. </p><p>Information. </p><p>I didn’t know the limits of her power, but even if it turned out to be completely useless, she still had access to the guild. Nothing classified, of course, but with my power, I didn’t need anything classified. Just a few comments, maybe a couple workplace pictures … and my power would do the rest. </p><p>Meaning, I had to earn her friendship … maybe a touch more. </p><p>Luckily, she was a convenient mixture of boredom and self-doubt to leave her vulnerable to even the weakest reach, and she was beautiful enough to make the work worthwhile even without all the advantages. </p><p>While I might not be the most handsome man imaginable, I was still charming enough to distract her with a smile, enough to distract her from her monotony. “Thank you for being kind, by the way,” I said, suddenly acting vulnerable while she was dealing with that smile. “Usually, beautiful girls like you ignore me.” </p><p>“Ahh, not a problem,” she said, suddenly blushing, the compliment distracting her properly to make her question whether she even acted kindly in the first place. The compliment itself was simple … the trick was to time it perfectly with that smile, building on that flare of attraction. </p><p>“I still appreciate it…” I said, following it with a quick, two-minute chat, which was surprisingly difficult for me as I kept my power in overdrive every second, allowing me to react to every single small detail perfectly, timing my smiles and jokes perfectly, crowning it with a brush or two of our fingers to anchor the crush she was rapidly developing. </p><p>“Talking to you was nice. A bright spot in my otherwise bleak day,” I said, enjoying her blush. While she enjoyed that, I turned and walked away without a warning … giving her a taste of sudden despair before I returned. </p><p>“You know what, I know it’s inappropriate, but do you mind sharing your number with me,” I said even as I grabbed a pen pushed it to her fingers, and raised my palm. </p><p>Too shocked by the whiplash, she didn’t even question whether sharing her number with a man she met a few minutes ago was the right thing. She was too busy trying to suppress the way her fingers trembled. </p><p>“I’ll text you the moment I drop the work phone and take my personal phone,” I said with a big smile, bringing her finger to my lips for a fleeting kiss. </p><p>Then, I left. </p><p>An excellent start. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I need to go shopping. I want you to stay here in your costume, and be ready to take my calls, while you dig that tunnel I asked of you, alright?” I asked. “And, don’t throw the dirt until we can find a way to get rid of it, alright?” </p><p>I only received a muffled response, no words, which might have been annoying, if the reason wasn’t the way her lips wrapped around my girth, giving me a beautiful morning blowjob in the shower. </p><p>It was already morning, and after a nice sleep, I was rested. So was my power, ready to face the new day. </p><p>I said nothing else as I let her finish her task, enjoying the warm water dancing over my body, trying — and failing — to compile my shopping list. Only after I exploded into her mouth, and left her alone in the shower after a gentle kiss to her temple I gathered enough of my mental faculties to do so. </p><p>The first objective was the renovation, but I wanted to hide it as long as possible, meaning the tunnel needed to be completed before we could start that part. </p><p>The second objective was the temporary security devices of better quality, which I needed to visit various shops to purchase directly while leaving Tara behind, using the cameras to keep observing the area. But, for that, I could visit later. </p><p>The last, and the most important, objective was the message I had just received. Thanks to my power, I knew that whoever wrote the message believed the truth of the situation … but that didn’t mean that it was actually the truth. It might just be the ploy of a villain to trigger someone to target the guild. </p><p>And, even if that was the truth — while I didn’t expect the guilds to actually kidnap and imprison people, I didn’t trust them enough to categorically reject it — that didn’t mean there was only one message. She might have dropped several such messages. </p><p>And, some of them might have been intercepted by the guild, meaning that the so-called stash might be already emptied. </p><p>Or worse, under observation. </p><p>I had no intention of visiting that particular junkyard to poke around a potential trap. I had enough problems already. </p><p>However, there was one important problem. I couldn’t say the same for the guild headquarters itself. Oh, I wanted to do so, intensely, but after somehow introducing myself as a trusted agent of a mysterious villain, I couldn’t just assume I would always fly out of their control. </p><p>No, I needed to at least get a glimpse of the place from a distance, to see if my power could provide me with some kind of advantage. </p><p>Then, I left the bar, realizing I needed to make one more purchase, a vehicle. I went and used a bus, acting like I didn’t notice several people that were following me, some amateur, some with a decent amount of skill … one even using a distant drone. </p><p>None was able to avoid my attention. I let them follow me as I went and purchased a bike, a racing one with a decent engine. It was a conscious choice, and, ironically, more secure for my circumstances. An accident was riskier on a bike, but a bike was far more responsive to adjustments than a car. </p><p>It worked better with my power. With that, I drove downtown, going around and handling the other shopping requirements — while also making sure to check the security cameras around the bar constantly so as not to let Tara down. </p><p>The purchase of security equipment and other necessities went quickly, especially since they were not the real set of equipment, but a temporary set. </p><p>No harm in adding some extra security, especially since I wasn’t hurting for money and could easily repurpose the equipment. I didn’t bother hiding those purchases, and acted like I didn’t notice the presence of all but most incompetent tails. </p><p>Yet, even when I noticed them, I deliberately acted fearless, as if I was daring them to act. It seemed to be enough to keep them scared. </p><p>I hoped it would be the status as usual. </p><p>I just didn’t believe it. </p><p>When I arrived back at the bar, Tara was in the corridor, patting herself down to clean her hero costume — which she wore to make sure she would be ready for an incursion — to greet me. From her expression, it was clear that she had good news for me. </p><p>“How’s the tunnel going?” I asked instead of directly inquiring about it, not wanting to ruin her enthusiasm. It would have been a jerk move, especially against someone as naive and eager as her.</p><p>“I made great progress, sir,” she said, her smile bigger than I had ever seen outside the bedroom — well, any sexual situation, really. </p><p>“Really, show me,” I said as I followed her. First, the location of the tunnel was nice. Hidden at the back of my office, behind a bulky wardrobe. The tunnel itself was both large and well-designed, even with some handles for me to grab. </p><p>And, after I climbed down, I found a basement, one that wasn’t supposed to be in place according to the plans. “Oh, interesting,” I said as I looked around. The walls looked strong as well, but there were no doors. The original owner probably designed it as a personal shelter — a reasonable precaution — but covered it up while selling as it wasn’t in the original plans. </p><p>Digging underneath a building without official permission and creating the risk of a collapse probably had more fines attached to it than the building was worth at this point, so, altogether, a smart idea. </p><p>Also, while the basement was nothing more than empty concrete walls — except the small pile of fresh dirt and rubble, and another tunnel, this time moving straight out —it was clean. Too clean, like an industrial operation had just gone through. </p><p>Super cleaning for the win. </p><p>Yet, as I watched her expression, I could see that this was not her surprise. Interesting. “Lead the way,” I ordered. She went into the tunnel, a flashlight in hand as she moved deeper into the tunnel. Thirty meters, and a slight slope downward, we met another concrete wall. </p><p>Much thicker. </p><p>“It looks like some kind of sever, sir. I didn’t breach it, but we could use it to move around safely.” </p><p>“And you waited to see to return before breaching?” I asked. She nodded, though a slight hesitance entered to her expression as she didn’t realize whether I was praising or giving her problems. “Good girl,” I said, and her smile was back, even bigger. </p><p>I certainly didn’t want to punish her for being cautious. That was how bad habits developed. </p><p>“Good, dig around a bit more, and let’s see if we have a way to peek into what was going on without breaching. </p><p>She grabbed a large metal sheet that she had been using as a shovel — which looked unwieldy but worked excellently with her strength, allowing her to move almost fifty pounds of dirt with every swipe … which would take at least an hour for an experienced worker without modern machinery. </p><p>I found what I had been looking for after ten meters, a large crack, enough to give us a view of what was going on. </p><p>Her assumption was correct. It was sever, but the lack of water — and thankfully smell — suggested that it hadn’t been used for a long time. However, when I peered inside, I saw a soft artificial light rather than the expected darkness. </p><p>Meaning, we weren’t the only ones to discover. “Don’t make any noise,” I said as I put one of the new cameras to the crack and covered it, over with a thin layer of dirt, enough to cut the light, extending the wire. </p><p>I was glad that it was wired, as wireless cameras were much easier to detect, especially underground, where there was supposed to be no signal. “Good girl, you earned a reward for tonight,” I said, which made her smile like I promised her a car. </p><p>However, rather than taking that into place, I stayed underground, directing her to create another tunnel that ran in the opposite direction, one that led to another abandoned building — my power allowing me to measure and track our exact locations so I wouldn’t just appear in the middle of a street. </p><p>Even better, it had a basement, but not a hidden one, but with actual stairs. </p><p>“Try to pull that pile closer, and spread out a bit of rubble here…” I said, ordering Tara around as she moved a lot of items to make sure the exit was concealed, piling most of the dirt to the basement in a dedicated pattern shoo that, unless someone was trying their best</p><p>Then, I set up another camera, this time wireless, to make sure I could watch the main entrance. </p><p>And, just like that, we had a little secret entrance that could be used to move around secretly. “Excellent work, my beautiful,” I said as I kissed her on the lips, ignoring the dust that covered her skin. Even with powers, construction was not clean work. </p><p>I went back to my room, and a quick shower later, I was looking for my wardrobe, trying to come up with a disguise that would keep me hidden. </p><p>I had no intention of letting the villains notice I was observing the strongest guild of the city. That felt like a recipe for disaster.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Oeyne moaned into my mouth as I kissed her aggressively, giving her exactly what she needed. I was tempted to quicken her bonding process with her Divine Spark, but after a momentary consideration, I decided against it. </p><p>I wasn’t entirely sure about the full range of methods the Eternals possessed, and I wasn’t ready to reveal my hand to improve Oeyne’s merging while she was holding a position where she could be easily caught. </p><p>So, instead of staying focused on the magical side of things, I focused on the physical aspects of our fun. Another flare of mana, and her hands were bound behind her. She tried to break them … but even with her increased strength, they didn’t budge. </p><p>There were benefits to near-infinite mana. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me great Oeyne is afraid of a little magic,” I teased her between kisses, knowing she enjoyed the mocking just as much as her helpless position. </p><p>“Coward. Why don’t you show me exactly what you’re capable of,” she answered, already getting in the mood. </p><p>“As long as you can handle a little pain,” I said with a chuckle as I tightened the hold even more even as I grabbed her leather apron, ripping it as easily as it was paper, leaving her only wearing her shirt … a shirt she had already unbuttoned, revealing her beautiful breasts. </p><p>“Bring it on—” she moaned, which was interrupted by a slap to her beautiful breasts, making her moan desperately. </p><p>“Oh, that’s it? A little pain, and you’re not even able to finish your sentence,” I mocked, even though I was very much aware it was not the pain that made her pain … well, at least not directly. </p><p>“Arrogant bastard —” she moaned, once again interrupted by another moan, this time by a twist of her nipple leaving her equally helpless. Fascinatingly beautiful, almost as beautiful as the pained gasp that followed when I forced her off the couch and onto her knees without a warning, her magical chains extending to her legs to make sure she couldn’t get free.</p><p>She tried to free herself, but no matter how strong her new Divine Spark-enhanced body was, it wasn’t enough to break through my magical restraints with physical force. </p><p>I let her struggle as I conjured a blade, carefully cutting every piece of clothing she wore while she struggled against the bindings, each helpless moment making her turn even more desperate and aroused.  </p><p>“Feel free to beg for help if you’re feeling distressed. I’m sure someone will bother to save you,” I teased. </p><p>“Never,” she whispered back throatily. “If I’m defeated, I deserve my punishment.” </p><p>I chuckled as I grabbed her chin, and raised her head. “You deserve it indeed,” I said as I kissed her once again, enjoying the way her tongue danced … getting more and more desperate each second, clearly wanting me to continue. “Maybe I should leave you like this and leave. A day or two like this should be an excellent punishment.” </p><p>“N-no,” she said, shivering in real fear, clearly not ready for it. Certainly not after such a long time apart. “Please.” </p><p>Luckily for her, I had no intention of doing that either. It would simply be mean. “Why don’t you show me exactly what are you willing to do to get away from it, then,” I said as I pushed down my pants, revealing my erection. </p><p>“Whatever you want—” she started, only to be interrupted again, this time physically as I pushed forward hard enough to invade her throat. Happy with the sudden interruption, her tongue danced even as I  grabbed her head, assisting her with the movement of her head, each push bringing her closer to a climax with a shocking rapid speed. </p><p>Her happiness with the rough treatment was obvious from the way her tongue danced despite the challenging situation, swirling around my girth repeatedly. It earned a grunt from me even as my hand tightened around her hair. She hadn’t bothered to shape it up while forging, keeping it in a simple ponytail, which allowed me to pull it easily to use it as a handle. </p><p>Her beautiful bosom heaved repeatedly as I invaded her throat mercilessly, going deeper and deeper into her throat. “Divinity suits you,” I said even as I felt our connection getting stronger once more … and this time without an external System as a bridge. </p><p>Though, I could feel that there was a difference between her connection and the others, it was merely a flicker compared to the bonfire of the others. </p><p>The reason wasn’t hard to discover. Her power. She didn’t even properly complete the first step to Godhood, let alone actually establish her domain … and the difference from it was incredibly different. </p><p>Even as I enjoyed her throat, I wondered what would be the better choice for her. A domain that was similar to Helga's, where she could just focus on her craft with little responsibility or a full domain. </p><p>However, as I looked down, watching her enthusiastic expression, and compared it to earlier where I discussed the potential strategies against the Eternals, the answer was clear. </p><p>A small domain was the best for her … and even then, I was afraid that I would still be the one to truly manage the other blacksmiths. Luckily, unlike Helga, whose Spark was very difficult conceptually, Oeyne’s Spark of Forging was … for the lack of a better term, straightforward. </p><p>With that small challenge resolved, I decided to turn my attention to the next stage. I continued to push forward, invading her throat as she choked and gagged, enjoying her punishment.</p><p>She was magnificent. </p><p>“That’s enough playing,” I suddenly said as I lifted her and threw her on the couch, her face burying against the soft surface, her plump ass ready for my attention. And, since her arms were still bound behind her, I had a perfect leverage to hold.  </p><p>“Yes, fuck me,” she moaned immediately ... once again pushing her luck. She was lucky that I missed her after such an extended forced separation. </p><p>I grabbed her bound hands with one hand, and put the other on her hips, enjoying her excited shivers. It was good to see I wasn’t the only one that missed her.</p><p>I sank down slowly, enjoying her naked wetness as she clamped around. “Oh, I missed you,” I whispered as I disappeared halfway inside. With her face buried, I wasn’t able to see her face, but I didn’t need that to read her reaction … particularly her charged moan. </p><p>“I missed you as well—” she tried to respond, but I chose that moment to bury myself even deeper. I rather have her moans showing me just how much she missed me. They were far more honest. She just moaned, her voice thick with desire.</p><p>My own grunts mixed with her moans, and soon, another instrument joined the mix. My hand, landing on her ass, spanking repeatedly… </p><p>It was a good feeling, to ping her down to let our bodies get familiar once more, impaling like a steady warrior. She didn’t say anything, already too far gone in pleasure, her moans trembling, her breathing uneven. </p><p>A few more seconds, and she climaxed. </p><p>However, that didn’t make me stop. On the contrary, I was able to push even more. Her expression twisted with pleasure, but despite her overwhelming pleasure, she was able to handle it easily. </p><p>Understandable, as forging was traditionally connected with long hours of work, which came with the advantage of endurance. Not as much as the other benefits, but still enough to allow her to resist the overwhelming pleasure. </p><p>“Oeyne, are you sure you don’t need rest. You look exhausted,” I said, teasing her even as I drilled her aggressively. </p><p>“N-not at all. Feel free to continue,” she said, unable to keep her voice from trembling. After all, enduring the endless pleasure was one thing, but hiding the impact of it was something else. </p><p>“Good, then you don’t mind discussing our plans for the future,” I said, not even slowing down as I pushed her toward another climax. </p><p>“O-of course not,” she answered. Her answer didn’t surprise me, as she had always been stubborn. </p><p>“Good…” I said, and started giving her a very lengthy explanation about Divine Domains and how they could be established. Not exactly a simple topic to understand even under the best of circumstances … but the fact I continued to drill her without a pause all the while made it even more challenging. “You understood that, right?” I said. </p><p>“O-of course,” she whispered, her voice more certain than I expected … but then I realized that I might have been mistaken about the improvement from her status, somewhere between Demigod and a Goddess, and unlike Mariel that had been fighting to contain it, she had no problem. </p><p>Helga had problems as well, but considering her irregular type of spark, it was easier to guess exactly what had gone wrong. </p><p>It gave me hope about Cornelia, Marianne, and Titania, as all three had standard skill load-outs, similar to Oeyne. </p><p>“Since you understand the choice you have in front of you, I can leave and start on the other parts of the plan. I hope it’s alright,” I said. </p><p>Only for her legs to wrap around me. “Not before you finish what you started,” she said, wrapping her legs around me. </p><p>“As you wish,” I chuckled. </p><p>After all, I still had several minutes … or hours, I corrected as I looked at her expression, as determined as it was euphoric.</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>I decided to greet Oeyne in a fun way. A wave of my hand, and the mana gathered around her, which rushed into the metal lying around her, turning into chains to clamp around her arms and legs. </p><p>I was ready to stop if she actually panicked, but her response surprised me. “Finally, you’re here,” she simply said, showing that she was very quick to recognize me. </p><p>“Wow, what was quick recognition,” I said as I chuckled, approaching even as I made the chains turn her toward me, enjoying her beautiful face. She said nothing, just opened her mouth happily as I kissed her, her arms still immobile. </p><p>“I recognize that shoddy technique to bypass the need for proper forging everywhere,” she said, her smile cheeky. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said as my hands slipped to her hips, enjoying the way her expression shifted as she caressed her ass through her leather pants. “Someone is looking for another reason to be punished.” </p><p>“A-another,” she stammered, surprised at the statement. “What do you mean, another reason?” </p><p>“Well, you didn’t realize the Eternals are using you as bait for their trap. I think that deserves proper punishment, don’t you think?” </p><p>At first, a flash of panic went through her face, but the moment I tightened the chains around her body, the flash disappeared just as quickly. She recognized that, if I could feel free to tease her, it couldn’t be too serious. “Yes, punish me,” she whispered. “I deserve it.”  </p><p>“Whatever I want?” I asked. </p><p>“Whatever you want…” she responded, her voice begging for it. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I waved my hand, and suddenly, her chains melted, and she ended up on her knees … a great loss, considering her physical abilities were much greater compared to the amount she had when she still had the System. </p><p>Her own form of spark seemed to be improving her physical capabilities far more than I expected. </p><p>“W-what,” she stammered, shocked. </p><p>“Since you’re happy with any punishment, you don’t mind waiting until we deal with the Eternals, do we,” I said as I presented my hand to help her stand up. </p><p>She slapped it away. “You’re a right bastard, you know that, right?” she grumbled, her frustration only made me chuckle more. It was amusing to see Oeyne focus more on her pleasure than the danger … but hardly surprising. </p><p>Oeyne was an excellent, passionate blacksmith, but apart from that, she only had her pleasures. Those pleasures were only gambling and alcohol before we met, and sex was added after — no doubt because she never had someone who could properly dominate her as she enjoyed.  </p><p>Ultimately, however, she had very little concerns about the strategic aspects of the world … so, even the mention of an Eternal trap didn’t faze her. She was clearly happy to take clues from me without even questioning the exact status. </p><p>A dangerous combination of trust and carelessness. </p><p>No wonder the Eternals were able to find her. </p><p>“So, tell me everything that happened,” I said, happy that, finally, I had a choice to question someone about the events of the attack. Helga and Mariel were unable to answer that question since both had been unconscious due to the situation. </p><p>“Should I start from the battle,” she asked. I nodded, and she started giving an extended breakdown of the battle itself. Apparently,, Mariel had displayed a very effective battle performance before she had been taken down by a mysterious artifact and disappeared … which was probably used by the crown prince. </p><p>Helga had fallen about the same time, while she was trying to build a ward to defend them. </p><p>“Then, the princess dragged her away, but I wasn’t able to pay much attention, because it was when I felt some kind of energy flooding me. It felt weird, like the satisfaction of completing a very complicated set of armor … but at the same time, flames of a volcano.” </p><p>“The technical term is Divine Spark,” I cut in. </p><p>“Sounds fancy,” she answered. “Anyway, as that hit me, I felt distracted for a moment and lost connection with the System, but for some reason, I got even stronger.” </p><p>“I’m guessing it wasn’t enough,” I suggested. </p><p>“No, not even close. The enemy was simply too crowded. I was near the walls, and I managed to get away, but it was a close call,” she said. </p><p>“Any idea about the rest?” I asked. </p><p>“Some of them,” she said. “I saw the librarian getting captured by a few robed figures, but before I could go help her, they teleported. I don’t have a clue who they are, though.” </p><p>“Most likely the Eternals,” I answered. “And, even if they are not responsible, I’m sure they know who. The other?” </p><p>“I remember seeing the princess on top of an emerald dragon, but when the same robed figures appeared them, they disappeared through a multicolored gate…” Oeyne explained. </p><p>Not exactly bad news, as it implied they were able to avoid being captured. The problem, I had absolutely no idea where they might have been. </p><p>The princess had the ability to conceal herself with Darkness Spark, and Janelor was a dragon with the ability to travel through the Primordial Aether unaided. </p><p>They might be anywhere, and I had no clue. </p><p>“How about Cornelia and Marianne,” I asked, knowing that she was familiar with them thanks to Helga keeping everyone connected after my disappearance. </p><p>“They, I have no idea,” Oeyne answered. “Marianne, I don’t have the slightest clue … but I remember seeing some kind of battle where one side had been using a lot of flame attacks.  However, before I could go there, it had been gone, leaving behind a scorched waste. </p><p>I asked several follow-up questions about the situations, but unfortunately, Oeyne was not a mage, and the information she could provide was extremely limited in this context, even with all the follow-up questions that we asked. </p><p>“I think this is the best we could get,” I finally admitted as I stepped asking questions and waved my hand, creating a large couch to sit on. There was no point pushing Oeyne with too many questions and ruining our reunion. Ultimately, she confirmed that Janelor and the princess were likely in good condition, and gave a clue about the potential location of Titania. Combined with her own safety, it was far better than I could have hoped. </p><p>It was frustrating not to have any clue about my lovely healer and angry fire mage, but at least, even with our connection diminished, I could feel that they were alive … just like I could feel Aviada was still alive. </p><p>Not ideal, but still far better than some of my fears. </p><p>I sat down on the couch I conjured, and Oeyne followed, hugging me tightly. “So, what’s the plan now?” she asked.  </p><p>“We need to stay here a while and understand the plans of the agents around us. For now, they seem to be happy to stay in the background while searching.” </p><p>“But why?” Oeyne asked. “They are so strong already. What exactly could force such a strong organization to stay on the defensive?” </p><p>“The other members of the same organization, of course,” I answered. “It’s clear that not all of them are willing to support whatever experiment that was going on with Mariel. It can be to our advantage.” </p><p>“How exactly?” Oeyne asked as she hugged me even tighter, showing that she was less concerned about my answer, and more about enjoying our closeness … a bit too much, even, her body rubbing against mine subtly yet steadily. </p><p>I acted like I didn’t notice her ‘subtle’ trick. </p><p>“We’re going to force their hand,” I said. “I’m going to leave —” I started, and her arms immediately tightened, and returned to the town officially, acting like I had managed to get away from the hands of the fourth prince. Since one of their agents is already talking about going to the side of the second prince, it’ll give me an excuse to deal with them.” </p><p>“Interesting,” Oeyne answered, which was hardly a compliment, considering her expression was already getting glazed, and one of her hands sneaked down her shirt under her leather apron, unbuttoning her shirt. </p><p>Somehow I thought that she was being subtle. No wonder the Eternals easily found her after her escape. </p><p>“I know. Challenging them directly has some dangers, but it’ll work. Though, maybe I should just go and challenge them one by one to show them my power,” I followed up, deliberately giving a nonsense answer. </p><p>“Whatever you think is the best,” she said as she pulled her hand under her apron, her dusky caramel cleavage looking far more alluring. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I would have punished her even worse … but after such a long separation, I decided to be merciful. </p><p>“You’re really pushing your luck,” I said as I grabbed her hair, pulling hard. </p><p>She just moaned enthusiastically, and I sealed her lips with another kiss… </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“You’re awake,” my unnamed nurse gasped in shock as she looked at my face. </p><p>“Of course, beautiful,” I said as I made a show of stretching, which displayed my naked shoulders — courtesy of my gown gathering around my waist during the sponge bath. “And, since you’re here, dressed like this, it should mean that the game went well,” I said. </p><p>“The game?” she asked, questioningly. </p><p>I frowned. “Of course, the game. Why else you’re here wearing a costume…” I said before stopping. “Wait a minute, you’re wearing a real nurse's outfit, and not a sexy one. So, unless you’re a cheerleader that’s very dedicated to roleplaying…” I muttered, and she shook her head. I looked around. “I’m in the hospital, aren’t I?” I asked. </p><p>“Unfortunately, yes,” she said. </p><p>“What happened,” I said, and she suddenly froze, remembering the strict instructions of the doctor. I was tempted to start deducing stuff as I looked around to mess with her. If she was any less beautiful, I might have actually done that … but I had a better way. “Let me guess. You can’t tell anything to me. Doctor’s orders,” I said. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she stammered. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. I can guess. The last thing I remember was that we were at the football practice. I’m guessing that I had received a nasty hit, triggering a concussion, maybe some short-term memory loss, and the doctor is afraid of questions creating some kind of strain.” </p><p>“Something like that,” she said, her relaxed expression extremely obvious. </p><p>“Good,” I said, then looked at the sponge in her hand. “You were giving me a sponge bath,” I said as I shifted to a standing position. “Let’s continue.” </p><p>“I …” she said as she took a step forward, before freezing in her place. “I don’t think it’s necessary since you are awake,” she said, clearly working hard to hold herself back. </p><p>It was good to see four years of living underground didn’t take anything from my attractiveness. “Well, if you rather start me questioning just how long I was in the hospital to need a sponge bath instead,” I flirted, giving her my best smile. </p><p>Her blush was spectacular. “Well, you drive a hard bargain,” she said, trying to sound somewhat reluctant … and failing spectacularly. The speed of her steps gave her away. </p><p>“I’m in your hands, my nurse,” I said with a big smile, which earned a nice giggle as she put her sponge on my shoulder, and started dragging it slowly. Her touch was gentle and flirty, echoing through me. </p><p>“Why don’t you climb on the bed. It’s hard for you to reach from there,” I suggested. A forward request, but it worked excellently with her clear attraction. </p><p>“Well, we need to be quick,” she murmured as she followed my request and put her knee on the bed. </p><p>“Oh, really. Why do we need to be quick?” I said. </p><p>“N-nothing,” she rapidly corrected, realizing that she had made a blunder. I could have pushed the issue to tease a bit more, but instead, I grabbed her waist to pull her up. “Naughty,” she gasped, but she clearly preferred that to me pushing her about her latest blunder. </p><p>“I’m just being a gentleman and helping you,” I answered even as I helped her up, and she knelt at my side, slowly washing my back. </p><p>“Oh, really,” she said as she continued to caress my back. “Then, why are you still holding your hands there.” </p><p>“Because I don’t want you to fall off. It would be a sin to allow an angel like you to get hurt,” I said, flirting more rather than mentioning the unnecessary way she leaned against my arm, her large breasts squashing against my arm. </p><p>Why ruin such a beautiful moment like that. </p><p>Instead, I kept my fingers on her waist, slowly moving up and down very occasionally, caressing her in a way that could be excused as an accident, aware that, even with her attraction, pushing too much would ruin the fun. </p><p>I didn’t have my fame anymore. I might have been a local hero back then, but even without the disaster, four years was too long of a time period for people to remember about minor celebrities. </p><p>So, I kept my hands on her waist, right in the compressed part of her beautiful hourglass figure, not daring to explore the true peaks of her anatomy for now. </p><p>Luckily, while my fame might have gone, the same wasn’t true for my skills. With my ability to read her reactions, I didn’t need to move away from her waist to turn her budding attraction into arousal. Soon, my hand moved to her back, caressing along her spine. </p><p>“You’re too naughty, stay still,” she said, but her tone implied something else. Moreover, she started moving up and down, rubbing her breasts along my arm. </p><p>“Well, I need to entertain you somehow,” I said. “I can show you a magic trick instead,” I said. </p><p>“Magic, sure,” she answered with a deadpan voice, and I felt her attraction dwindling almost instantly. I smirked as I dragged my finger up slightly more, using the meager amount of Intent I possessed to give a small push to her bra to untie its straps … allowing me to free it in one pull. </p><p>And, just like that, the arousal was back. She pulled back in surprise while she wrapped her arms around her chest reflexively. “How?” she gasped. </p><p>“Oh, a magician never reveals his secrets,” I said. “But I can do it again if you want. To see if you can catch it.” </p><p>She looked indecisive but still reached her bra. I had a different plan in mind. I slipped my fingers under her top, my finger slipping to the side of her pants, caressing her panties. “Not that, perv,” she gasped as she made a move to grab her bra. I pulled it away.</p><p>She tried to reach again, this time giggling. “Give it back,” she said, but since she was still keeping an arm around her chest, there was no hope of her doing so. </p><p>I just kept holding her waist to prevent her, which soon turned into tickling. “S-stop it,” she said, giggling even louder, seemingly forgotten that she was supposed to be tending to a patient who had just woken up from a coma. </p><p>I tickled her again and lost in the moment, she let her other hand drift away from her chest. The way her breasts danced, as she laughed, showed the reason she wore scrubs two sizes too large very well. Unfortunately for her, our current position tugged her top, making it stick to her body, and ruining the whole point of loose top. </p><p>I chuckled as she continued her ‘struggle’ still trying to reach for her bra while my fingers danced on her naked belly. </p><p>That laughter suddenly gained a heated quality as my fingers climbed up slightly, touching her ribs. Her eyes widened as my naked touch climbed up, but she did her best to hide that expression, happy to play the part of innocence like she didn’t realize the way things had been developing. </p><p>She wasn’t very successful in that, but I wasn’t a moron, so I didn’t point that out. “It looks like I have a stubborn patient,” she growled playfully as she stopped making a move for her bra and grabbed the sponge. I put her bra in the drawer, and started enjoying my treatment. </p><p>However, even as I stopped tickling her, I let my hand rest on her naked side, the presence enough to ride her scrub up quite a bit, showing far too much skin to be appropriate. She dragged her sponge on my body. </p><p>As she let her sponge dance over my body, my fingers started to get restless once more. Slowly, they started to climb higher, discovering sensitive spots along her body, even earning a moan in the process. </p><p>She tried to hide it as a cough, but once again, she wasn’t particularly successful. </p><p>My fingers climbed even higher, caressing the underside of her breast. She didn’t say anything, but I could feel the way my Lust Domain echoing off her, the intensity of the Intent she provided growing. </p><p>Rather than letting the System devour that bit, I created a small storage, ready to use on the reporters to generate some kind of advantage. I continued teasing her, feeling her attention firmly focused on me. Her emotions were intense, but no matter the intensity, the amount of Intent one person could generate was limited. </p><p>It was a meager amount, even when I compared it to the amount I had collected from my first fateful chess tournament. </p><p>Not that I let it dissuade me. It wasn’t like I had a better alternative to collect Intent while I waited for the reporters to arrive… </p><p>More importantly, it wasn’t like teasing my sexy blonde nurse with an hourglass figure that would make any model jealous was a great hardship. </p><p>“I think that’s enough with that sponge,” I said. </p><p>“Right—” she said, her tone disappointed, which was suddenly cut off as I suddenly flipped her, and she ended up on her back, while I grabbed the sponge. </p><p>“Now, it’s my turn to give you a bath,” I said. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t have to wait for long before a doctor arrived for the daily check-up because it was one of the things I had prepared for. I had already left a note on my chart to require one. </p><p>It was important for him to come and diagnose me, and not just because of the requirements of the System, or the possible boredom of lying on my bed for days without doing anything. No, I needed it, because I had already sent several emails to the local tabloids from the account of one of the doctors, alluding to some interesting scoop that would pay out. </p><p>I wasn’t ready to reveal some kind of superhero ability, but I was hoping that, the sudden awakening of a local hero after four years should earn me a middle-page story at least, hopefully with some references to my ‘incredible’ football victories. </p><p>Though, it wasn’t just the potential Intent that mobilized me. The more visibility I had, the more suspicious for me to suddenly disappear in a government facility. Not impossible, of course, so even now, I was prepared for a bunch of men wearing dark suits…</p><p>But there was no harm in making their jobs harder. </p><p>Fifteen minutes after the previous visit, a grumbling doctor arrived, mumbling about useless nurses and wrong measurements. “Like a coma patient is going to just wake up suddenly,” he said as he put his hand on my pulse, then suddenly shouted. “Nurse!” </p><p>A nurse arrived, one that made me wish that I was not faking unconsciousness. Even in scrubs, she looked amazing, though she was busy looking scared. “Yes, doctor,” she called. </p><p>“What’s going on here,” the doctor shouted angrily. “There’s something wrong with his pulse. No coma patient should have such a wild heartbeat. Which idiot decided to give him unauthorized drugs.” </p><p>“I … I don’t know, sir. He’s a new transfer. Maybe he’s waking up?” </p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous, after four years, right after he was transferred. Go check the ambulance records and see if those morons had given —” he continued. </p><p>I decided it was a good time, so I let out a soft but audible groan. The nurse froze while the doctor took a step forward, already lifting one of his pens while he pulled back my eyelid. I didn’t try to suppress my reaction. “I’ll be damned. He’s actually waking up,” he said. </p><p>“It’s fascinating,” the nurse said.  </p><p>She might find that fascinating, but not as much as I found her beautiful blonde hair framing her face, or her incredible hourglass figure that showed itself even with her scrubs that were two sizes too big. </p><p>Just like that, I felt a trickle of Intent flowing to me. Not much from the doctor, his shock momentary, but there was a stronger flow from the nurse. I immediately grabbed that flow before the System could devour it, and pushed it toward the Doctor, one that I tried to turn into a suggestion while channeling my Tactics ability.</p><p>It wasn’t much to work with, but I still achieved some. </p><p>Fascinatingly, it worked. “Arrange a private room for him,. Also, make sure he’s presentable for visitors, I’m sure his family would love to see him,” he said. </p><p>The nurse left the room, unaware the doctor had a different idea. The moment the nurse left, he pulled his phone and called someone from the press. A friend from a local TV channel, it seemed, considering the ease with the doctor offered a delicious meal in exchange for a news story about his incredible medical skills. </p><p>Better. I had only reached out to tabloids, because I didn’t think even the local channels would send a crew to the hospital. But, since the doctor clearly knew the reporter, it worked much better. </p><p>The ease the discussion progressed suggested that it wasn’t the first time.  The reporter questioned several times whether it was true that I had been in a coma since the event. That made me tense for a moment, but I lost that fear once he clarified the details. </p><p>Apparently, he wanted to make an interview while he delivered the changes, to record my shock and dismay about the changes, hoping to get some screen time in the evening news. I could hear the excitement of the reporter, suggesting that it was not a cover story but something real. </p><p>It was truly gutter-level reporting. Jostling a coma patient who had just woken up in such an emotional way was a very dangerous thing. Luckily, </p><p>For a moment, I considered whether TV news was a step too much, but then I decided to let it go just like that. Anyone that I feared about alerting would learn my awakening even if I tried to keep it local, so there wasn’t any point in keeping things low. </p><p>And, if things devolved into a dangerous chase, I rather have more Intent to keep my System fed … and weaponize if necessary. </p><p>Only after a long talk, the doctor continued to check my results. “Miracle doctor cures coma patient immediately,” he murmured, followed by some medical terms as he continued to check me, practicing for an interview, to the point of ignoring some critical steps even I knew. </p><p>Which was certainly not justifiable by the little push I managed to push to his head. It looked like I got a true glory hound. </p><p>Lucky. </p><p>He continued to make my cheeks, and I gave him some more signs of waking up. The nurse returned with two orderlies that helped me to move to a stretcher and brought me to the private room. </p><p>“Stay with him, and make sure not to tell him anything if he wakes up —” he started, before a security guard arrived. “What, newspapers, already?” he said, looking alarmed. ”Don’t let them in,” he ordered as he called his friend. “You need to come quickly. Someone else leaked the story to the papers already. I’ll keep them away but…” he started. </p><p>Excellent. Nothing like a friendly competition to blow up the news unnecessarily. </p><p>Just to be sure, I used the scraps of Intent my small audience generated to give him another push,, making him panic slightly so that it would be obvious he was trying to hide something while he talked with the press. </p><p>The nurse didn’t look happy about the attitude of the doctor, but she followed the stretcher as the orderlies moved me to a private room, which was nice enough for a hospital, but certainly not a VIP one. </p><p>I remembered the last room I occupied in a hospital. It was much better, especially when the two nurses decided to give me an amazing show wearing my jerseys. Of course, at that time, I was a local hero that finally brought them a long-sought victory. </p><p>Pity. </p><p>As I lost myself in my memories, the orderlies put me on the bed and left, leaving me alone with the nurse, who closed and locked the door. “Now, let’s give you a sponge bath,” she said as she approached with the necessary equipment. </p><p>However, the moment she pulled my gown down to my waist, she gasped. I didn’t need to hear her voice to know the source of her shock, the particular tinge of her Intent was quite familiar. </p><p>Lust. </p><p>Pity even with that intensity, it wasn’t enough to move the needle in the Intent counter, showing that even the smallest unit was not small. Still, I let the System devour it. Even the smallest touch mattered. </p><p>“Wow, how do you still have muscles,” she murmured as she dragged her fingers over my chest, though her voice was more filled with fascination than suspicion. Which was a bit absurd, as it was something that a nurse should pay more attention to. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder whether she was that terrible as a nurse … or it was that weird mental flicker that I had felt when I arrived at the city, one that suggested people ignore anything too extreme. </p><p>Maybe my suspiciously stable muscles after four years were a part of it. </p><p>Either way, I was happy that I didn’t need to spend an hour while they tried to understand that particular detail. As for the public … I rather look good and suspicious than damaged and sincere. </p><p>I had long learned that pity was a terrible way to generate Intent. </p><p>The nurse continued to use the sponge to wash my body, but I didn’t miss the fact that her sponge had been dragging over my chest more times than it was necessary, and lingering for longer and longer, feeling the echo of her lust growing. </p><p>I stayed unconscious for a while more, curious whether she would do something … naughtier, but she decided to stay in a controlled manner instead, showing that her lingering lust wasn’t enough for her to violate her medical ethics. </p><p>I would have left her alone, but time she reached the other side, her scrubs rode up, showing her beautiful and toned legs. If it wasn’t for the control granted to me by the Divine Body, I would have been sporting a huge mast. Even now, it was a challenge to keep it suppressed. </p><p>I had been planning to fake unconsciousness for a while more, timing it better for the arrival of the news crews, but she was beautiful enough to make an exception. </p><p>I made a show of groaning as I opened my eyes, curious whether her medical ethics would still hold her back while I flirted back. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Finding a nice cave away from the car crash site had been easy. I put them down, and while she kept herself busy with it. “Are you sure you want me to bring your phone with me as well?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she said. “I don’t know how long they expect him to be away, but once they realize it, its location is the first thing they will check.” </p><p>I shrugged. I didn’t know how much the phones changed in my absence, but the idea that they could be followed was not exactly a surprising concept. “Do you have a piece of paper?” I asked. </p><p>She looked surprised, but she pulled a small notebook from the pocket of her jacket. “I always bring one with me. Why?” she said. </p><p>I ripped two pages, then dragged my finger over it, leaving a glowing line behind. Several repeats, and I was looking at a pair of talismans, however I had no doubt my teachers that would have called it anything other than garbage.</p><p>It was a simple talisman, the kind that the beginners draw to practice. </p><p>“What’s this,” she said as I passed one to her, even as the glow subsided. </p><p>“A simple message talisman,” I said. “Just rip it if you’re in danger, and mine will be triggered as well.” </p><p>“I don’t need it,” she said, not enjoying the concept of being protected. “We’re hidden in a cave, and there’s nothing that will show my location,” she said. </p><p>“Not exactly true,” I said. “I can imagine a dozen methods that they might have access to find you,” I said. I could also imagine a few dozen ways to thwart such methods if I had any materials. I was terrible at arrays and talismans, but sealed or not, I was still a Foundation Establishment cultivator. “Just keep it with you, and rip it if you’re discovered.” </p><p>She looked reluctant, but she still put it in her pocket, which I counted as a win. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. I would have loved to leave something that she could use to defend herself with, but without better materials, a one-time communication talisman was the best I could do. The ordinary paper couldn’t handle the power of anything more intense. </p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want to stay for the interrogation,” she asked. </p><p>“No. You already mentioned that they could deactivate the phones remotely, and bringing them on time is more important,” I said. “I trust you to get the information much easier than me. Though, a suggestion, try to make him spill about just how many people are a part of their little group.” </p><p>“Good, and try not to scare Lana too much, she has trouble speaking to strangers,” she said. </p><p>“An interesting choice for an accomplice,” I commented.</p><p>“She might be shy, but she’s a wizard when it comes to anything computer-related. It’s her program that caught your pictures.” </p><p>“Not bad,” I said. I didn’t know exactly how it worked, but it seemed like a useful ability. “Then, I should be careful about the cameras,” I said. It was one thing if they had to check through them one by one, but the ability to automate suggested that any extraordinary display might have been identified.</p><p>Maybe it was how they even found me when I was a child in the first place. </p><p>“Yes, that would be smart,” she admitted. “Now, wake him up, leave.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I put my hand on his neck. “He’ll wake up in a minute. He’ll feel confused for a while. Try to ask your questions then,” I said. </p><p>“Good, leave,” she said. “The faster we act, the more information we can gather.  </p><p>I followed her suggestion. Whatever information was in his phone was more valuable than anything we could extract from talking to him. </p><p>Especially since we didn’t have any leverage to make him speak. A confused state would help, but only marginally. The other tactics were even less useful. Even if I was willing to rely on pain to make him speak over the inevitable objections of my only ally, nothing useful would come out. </p><p>I might have a different perspective if we were trying to extract a critical piece of information, but considering we knew absolutely nothing about the situation, interrogation wouldn’t be too useful. </p><p>With our strategy decided, I went back to the town, but not before stopping near the fake accident first, turned on Sophie’s phone, clicked one of the programs — or apps, as she called them — typed two numbers there, and threw it to a ditch. </p><p>Apparently, she had been aware of the risk and arranged some kind of failsafe with her expert friend. According to what she explained, the first code was to inform her friend about my impending arrival, and the second code was to destroy any sensitive information she might have on her phone without looking suspicious. </p><p>I didn’t know how it worked, however the vagueness of her explanation suggested that Sophie didn’t understand it particularly well either. </p><p>With a shrug, I left the forest behind, but instead of going directly to her house, I chose to swing by the motel. However, instead of approaching from the front, I followed the smooth gravel path at the back, getting close enough to see what was going on while avoiding any observer. </p><p>EIM vehicles were already gone, but that didn’t matter much. Not when I had something else to keep me distracted. </p><p>Another containment formation. And, this time, it was not an amateurish one. It wasn’t a strong one. It had no actual defensive features, just another containment area to hide the corruption triggered by the demonic murder, which would linger for a while more. However, it had a well-designed trap that would send an alert once it was broken. </p><p>It wasn’t any more difficult to destroy than the earlier one, but unlike the previous one, its destruction couldn’t be blamed for its natural degradation, which would reveal to them that there was someone who could dispel their formations moving around. </p><p>Not exactly ideal. </p><p>I had nothing I truly wanted to check in the room, so, instead of playing around, I turned and left, and moved toward the address Sophie had given to me. I didn’t know what exactly I expected from a hacker, as my understanding was limited to the TV shows I had watched as a child. If they had been accurate, I would have found myself in a basement in a rundown apartment, or some kind of high-tech apartment. </p><p>In the end, the destination turned out to be none of them. It was a nice suburban house, larger than normal, with a pool in the garden. It had two floors, and the whole place gave me a cosy feeling.</p><p>The place had walls, but the front gate was open, so I just passed it, and stepped into the garden, taking a second to enjoy the flowers. They were beautiful, but not well cared for. I was tempted to stop for a while and fix some of the issues. </p><p>I had always enjoyed gardening, even before my recruitment. And, it turned out that I had the skill for it. Nowhere near the skill I had for the Path of the Sword, but enough that I had been able to make a living while I was an outer disciple. </p><p>Then, my skill for the sword manifested itself, earning me a promotion, much to the chagrin of many sect-born that was unable to make the same jump. Once I had been promoted, any money I could earn from gardening turned inconsequential — the resources that an inner disciple could access far outstripped anything that could be earned by my effort — but many times, I couldn’t help but wonder how life would have been if my skill had been reversed. </p><p>However, as I walked, I ignored those thoughts behind. With my supposed holiday slowly turning into another mission, I didn’t have the luxury of wasting my time fixing someone else’s garden. Instead, I went to the door without skipping a step and pressed the doorbell. </p><p>Then, I took a deep breath, and let my posture relax. </p><p>First impressions were important, especially with the urgency of the issue. I never liked going on a mission, and Sophie’s hacker friend was the only option that was available in the short term that could be used to compensate for the lack of it. </p><p>Once I pressed the doorbell, I didn’t press again despite the lack of an answer. I could sense the movement inside the house, so I knew that the owner was aware of my presence. Sophie had mentioned that her friend was shy, but it seemed that the situation was more serious than I had first assumed. </p><p>I stayed in place, feeling the presence inside moving back and forth, ignoring the desire to just unlock the door by using my Essence as a lock pick. If anything, Sophie seemed to undersell her friend’s shyness, and I doubted breaking would help her to calm down. </p><p>However, after a minute without an answer, I rang the doorbell again. “Please, Miss Lana. We need your help urgently,” I said. “Sophie is in trouble, and we need your help.” </p><p>It worked, and I heard the footsteps toward the door. A second later, the door opened… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The car drove into the forest, and I followed, ignoring the temptation to intervene immediately. </p><p>I was good at many things, but the interrogation was not one of them, not even when targeting the mortals. Watching them to see exactly what they wanted to do was the better idea. </p><p>I did not doubt his ultimate goal. The immediacy of the bloodlust that was tainting his aura left no doubt about that. Not only he was planning to kill Sophie, but he was looking forward to it. What I didn’t know was whether his bloodlust was a coincidence, or linked to the presence of the demonic cultivators.  </p><p>I leaned toward the second option. A man like that, responsible for maintaining some kind of order between the ordinary citizens and the shadow world — as the locals called it — right where a nest of demonic cultivators seemed to grow. </p><p>No, it was not a coincidence. </p><p>I followed the car with the hopes that he was directly linked to them, and would drive me to their nest. Those hopes were dashed when he suddenly stopped when he arrived at a particularly thick part of the forest. It was a beautiful little corner, untouched by any kind of human presence, the trees tall and majestic, the ground covered with thick foliage. </p><p>I had a feeling that they weren’t here to admire the view. </p><p>The engine stopped, and I was finally able to hear them once more. </p><p>“… you should have learned your lesson when you were in the FBI and stay put, you stupid bitch. That way, you would have stayed alive,” he said as he opened the door.  </p><p>“What, let serial killers do as they wish? How many people had to die because you’re too much of a coward to do your job? Twenty, thirty? How many lives are more important than your convenience?” </p><p>“Thirty,” he replied even as he reached inside the car, but he hadn’t reached his gun yet, so I stayed away, hoping that he would spill more. “You think we would be bothered with just thirty. Try thousands —” he continued. </p><p>His words were cut short when a combat boot slammed right into his nose, breaking it loudly. “Bitch!” he shouted as he tumbled back, and Sophie darted out of the car, trying to follow up for her advantage. Unfortunately, with her arms cuffed behind her back, there was little she could do. </p><p>She managed to kick him again before he swept her legs, and reached for his gun. </p><p>I moved forward. I wasn’t faster than a bullet which meantI  still had a ways to go before I could match to my favorite childhood character, but I was still faster than an annoyed secret agent more interested in cursing than pulling his gun, confident in his victory. </p><p>He froze when I appeared behind him, my grip tight around his arm. “Not so fast, buddy,” I said. </p><p>“Blake,” Sophie gasped in shock, her eyes wide. Unsurprising, considering she was able to see my approach from her position, and saw my speed. Not the fastest I could move, not even with the seal in place, but enough to impress a mortal. </p><p>“Hello, beautiful. Long time no see,” I said even as I put my hand on the neck of the agent, and put him to sleep. </p><p>I rather have a plan to interrogate him.  </p><p>“I-is he dead?” she asked, with less compassion and fear, and more curiosity. It seemed her sense of justice wasn’t as linked to mercy as I expected. That, or she wasn’t feeling particularly charitable after he had declared he was planning to execute him just to cover up for demonic cultivators. </p><p>“No, we still need to interrogate him. But I rather not do it without a plan,” I said. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she shifted to a sitting position, and I reached for her cuffs, breaking them easily without hurting her, displaying another aspect of my power to her. It was calculated, and not to impress her — which was just a side benefit — but to make sure she treated me as a reliable ally rather than a potential hindrance. </p><p>The absentminded words of the agent had been illuminating, particularly the casual mention of thousands of deaths. It was far from what someone could do alone, meaning the organization itself was corrupt. And, as much as I was tempted to go in the usual manner of sect-born and kill everyone in a corrupt organization, it wasn’t just the desire not to kill innocents that kept me back.</p><p>I didn’t want to alert the sect to what was going on, not before I could truly assess what was going on, and it wasn’t just to maintain my exile. </p><p>I didn’t want to alert the sect, because what was going on here was a clear failure for whoever was responsible for Earth … the kind of failure that a cultivator might destroy a whole town to keep it covered. I had seen it many times during my missions. Never from my sect, and I always punished the responsible party. </p><p>But, I wasn’t naive. Just because I never seen a cultivator of Heavenly Sword Sect doing such a thing didn’t mean it never happened. I might be an unpopular, marginalized inner disciple, but I was still an inner disciple. Anyone guilty of such crimes would hide from me.  </p><p>I didn’t have a method to communicate with the sect, but even if I had, I wouldn’t have dared to use it before understanding both the true extent of the demonic incursion and the identity — and the connections — of the outer disciple responsible for Earth. </p><p>A troubling situation. I needed Sophie. </p><p>Sophie stayed silent for a while as she rubbed her wrists, her gaze settled on me instead of the man who was about to execute her. “You are stronger than you have led me to believe,” she finally said. </p><p>“Really?” I said, curling my arms to display my muscles. “You think so?” </p><p>My sense of humor didn’t work as well as I hoped. “Yes,” she said, her tone flat. “Explain.” </p><p>“Short version. I had been taken to a secret enclave to be trained because I had the potential for their particular brand of power, lived there for a while, had an argument, and now I’m temporarily kicked out while they decide what to do with me,” I said. </p><p>She paused for a moment, trying to process the dense pile of information I had just dumped on her. I didn’t say anything, letting her process it calmly. “Where’s this enclave?” she asked. </p><p>“Not in America,” I answered, not wanting to go too deep into the issue. </p><p>She caught the message in my tone. I expected the next question to be about my powers. To my surprise, she skipped it. “Why do you care about what’s going on?” </p><p>“Let’s just say those people are not supposed to be here, and I take their presence around my childhood home offensive,” I said, not willing to explain to her what cultivation was, and the kind of danger the demonic variants had created. </p><p>She sighed, no doubt with many questions in mind, but she was a practical woman. With a sigh, she looked down at the unconscious man under us. “What are we going to do with him?” she asked. </p><p>I responded with a sigh of my own. “That, I have no idea,” I said, which earned a surprised expression. “I told you I have been in an enclave for a long while. I don’t know enough about the situation. I don’t even know what to ask.” </p><p>“Can’t you do something with your powers?” </p><p>“Unfortunately, that’s not my particular expertise,” I said. “I can help you if you want, but I’m reluctant to show myself unless you plan to just kill him,” I said. </p><p>Her warning glare was enough to show exactly what she thought about it. “That would be wrong,” she declared, her aura bright as she declared it. </p><p>“As you wish?” I said. I wasn’t particularly torn up about the idea of killing him. He didn’t know anything about me — I approached from his blind spot to make sure — to make his survival sensitive. And I wasn’t in a particular hurry to administer his punishment. “What do you plan to do with him, then? We can try to question him, but it wouldn’t work.” </p><p>“I have a better idea,” she said as she pulled two phones from his pocket, and pressed his finger to the screen to activate both. “How long it would take you to return to the town?” she asked. </p><p>“If I push myself, a few minutes, half an hour if I need to avoid attention,” I said. </p><p>“Good, make sure it doesn’t lock down, and bring it to my friend,” she said, then gave me an address and a description. “Tell her that it’s about the case, and it’s far bigger than we thought. She can extract far more information than we can from interrogating him,” she said. </p><p>“Do you want me to carry you as well?” I said. </p><p>“No, I’m going to stay here and see if I can get anything from him,” she said, then looked at his car. “I doubt that they expect him to return quickly considering…” she said, leaving her words lingering instead of mentioning her potential assassination.</p><p>“Do you want me to fake a car crash? It might give you some more time?” I offered. </p><p>“I don’t want you to risk your life any more than —” she started before she stopped, remembering that I was not exactly normal. “A car crash wouldn’t threaten you, would it?” she asked. </p><p>”Certainly not, but it’s irrelevant for this case anyway,” I said as I moved behind the car. A stiff push later, it slammed against the nearby tree, its front wrecked. “Here. It should keep them from understanding what’s going on even more,” I said. “Now, do you want me to bring you to a nice hidden spot before they discover your presence?” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, that was fun,” I said as I removed my helmet once the bike came to a stop in front of a motel. The speed itself wasn’t particularly impressive after some of the flying sword chases I had to go through during my missions, but being this close to the ground had been fun. </p><p>Her annoyed expression as she removed her helmet, showing her annoyance at my lack of fear, made it even more entertaining. </p><p>“It was just a ride,” she said, acting like she hadn’t deliberately taken several sharp turns just to scare me. It was a petty trick, but I liked it. “Now, the work. This is our next destination.” </p><p>She gestured toward the motel. I looked at it, trying to see something through the auras, but noticed nothing in particular. The place was reeked with despair, but it wasn’t an intense feeling, more of a leftover from the thousands that visited the place, each leaving a scrap of their emotion. </p><p>“What exactly is this?” I said. </p><p>“A test,” she said. I raised an eyebrow. “You can’t think that I’m going to trust you can help me just because you can heal from a bruise,” she said. </p><p>Oh, I was being underestimated, how fun. </p><p>“I’m assuming that the test is not to throw me to their den and see how well I can handle them.” </p><p>She scoffed. “I wouldn’t send an unarmed civilian to challenge a serial killer.” </p><p>“Hey, I’m not unarmed,” I said pointing out my pocket, where I had a blade. </p><p>“Yes, I noticed it,” she said with disdain. “I meant a real weapon,” she said, no doubt talking about her guns. Amusing.</p><p>“Well, let’s agree to disagree,” I said as I chuckled, taking no insult from her words. After all, I couldn’t shock and awe her without a little underestimation on her part, could I? “So, this is my test?” I said. </p><p>“Yes, we just—” she started, but I raised my hand to silence her. </p><p>“Stop. If it’s a test, it will be more impressive if you don’t tell me what I’m looking for,” I said. </p><p>She looked unhappy at my interruption. “Go ahead,” she said, her challenge clear. </p><p>I turned my attention to the motel once more, this time focusing on each room one by one, taking note of their aura. Then, I came to one without an aura. </p><p>Not even a hint. </p><p>Suspicious, especially with the state of the other rooms. Either that room hadn’t been used since the day it had started the service, or there was another reason for the absence of aura. </p><p>I touched my essence, enhancing my gaze slightly to allow me to see another way. What I saw didn’t surprise me in the slightest. A little cage made of glowing lines of Essence. A containment formation. </p><p>A rudimentary, poorly made one, but a formation nonetheless. Whoever did it, they weren’t good, so I didn’t even need to break the formation to see whatever was inside, but since it was not linked to any kind of alarm, I just waved my hand and dispersed it from a distance. </p><p>With my vision still enhanced, I took a glimpse of what was inside. Remains of a body, drained of its energy. </p><p>“A murder scene. A surprising first test,” I said, surprised. It wasn’t particularly shocking for me. I had seen far worse than that, but I had expected a more pointless test from her. </p><p>Then, I noticed her expression of shock. “What are you talking about?” she said, her tone doubtful, but she already reached to her waist, ready to pull her gun. </p><p>“There’s a body in room fifteen, on the second floor,” I said, realizing that she wasn’t aware of that fact. </p><p>“If this is a joke—” she started, but I shook my head, telling her that it wasn’t the case. She charged forward, leaving me behind. I let her. I could sense no presence other than the body. I rather not test the strength of her stomach from a close distance. </p><p>She broke the door with a kick, and a gasp of shock reached my ear. She immediately reached for her phone. “Cut the nonsense, George. I have just found another body. Inform the captain,” she said. </p><p>“You’re suspended—” a voice from the other side said. </p><p>“I don’t care. This is more important,” she replied, which devolved into a fight, with several mentions of EIM going back and forth. </p><p>While she was dealing with it, I walked through the door and took the first glimpse of the room. “That’s a crime scene, don’t walk in,” she warned. </p><p>I stayed at the door, not wanting to annoy my only guide any more than necessary. After all, I didn’t need to walk inside, and I didn’t need to walk inside to see what was going on. I wasn’t a spiritualist, and there was little I could do. </p><p>I could confirm the victim’s cause of death as easily. His life force had been drained, probably a week ago. He looked stiff and decomposed, the smell hitting us strongly. Though, I noted the way he was sitting. Before he was killed, he had been panicking, but there was no sign of fighting back. </p><p>The attacker gave him enough time to panic, but he knew his death was inevitable. Interesting. </p><p>“What’s going on here?” she asked. “How can a body remain undiscovered for so long?” </p><p>“It’s about the reason you asked for my help. Supernatural shenanigans,” I answered. </p><p>“Magic?” she asked. </p><p>“Not exactly, but similar,” I said, not really in a mood to give a detailed explanation about the difference between the mages and the cultivators, particularly to someone who didn’t even know what a cultivator was. </p><p>She made a move to step in, but I held her shoulder. “Are you sure you want to enter the room considering you’re suspended,” I said. I didn’t know much about how they worked, but the intense fight she had on the phone suggested the consequences would have been even worse. </p><p>“This is more important. I can’t trust them with the case. I need to go over the details before the EIM takes over.” </p><p>I let her enter. I might not have known much about what was going on, but I could see that it would likely cost her the job she loved. She was an adult, and she could make her decision herself. Especially with her expression telling me that she had no illusions about her decision.</p><p>“A question,” I said. “What’s EIM?” </p><p>“Exceptional Incident Management,” she said even as she pulled a pair of plastic gloves from her pocket. “They are a federal bureau, but not as active as the others, and much less known. They are the ones that take over cases like this,” she said. </p><p>“Supernatural ones?” I asked.</p><p>“It looks that way,” she answered. </p><p>Once she entered, she pulled out her phone — I had eavesdropped enough to realize they were calling it a phone despite the fact its camera and computer functions being used far more frequently — and took several photos of the body and the room, including going through the wallet and taking the picture of the driving license. </p><p>I quickly memorized the address on the driver’s license, just in case she had been detained. The idea of being locked in a room with her was tempting, but not at the cost of leaving a bunch of demonic cultivators behind. </p><p>I could always visit her later. </p><p>While she went through the details of the scene and recorded it with pictures, I paid more attention to the body itself. The life had been drained from him, and a jagged wound from his side showed it was made of a rough implement. </p><p>A spike with rough edges, but knowing demonic cultivators, the roughness of the weapon was intentional. The wound expanded outward, but there was next to no blood around. Which didn’t surprise me the slightest, as blood was a valuable commodity for a demonic cultivator, especially a weak one. </p><p>Another life snuffed to fuel the deranged sense of the progress of the monsters. </p><p>A pity. </p><p>I looked around the room, but I didn’t know about the daily life of the people to have a reasonable guess about what was out of order. It seemed a trip to the address was in order. </p><p>Then, a soft siren reached my ear. “I think it’s time to go,” I said. </p><p>“I can’t go and leave a crime scene alone,” she said. “But you should leave.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said with a shrug. As much as I was tempted to stay with her, the threat was too big to ignore. </p><p>“Do you have a vehicle to go around—” she started before she froze. “Sirens, it’s EIM,” she said. “Go, quickly, before they see you here too,” she said. “I don’t know what they do to people like you, and I don’t want to test it.” Then, she paused before she threw me her keys. “Take my bike once you leave, and wait for me at my apartment,” she said, then rattled her address. </p><p>“Thanks,” I said, grabbing her keys before I walked away. I decided to wait until they left. Using her bike to go around was tempting. I was faster on foot, but a vehicle was less noticeable than a man running faster than a car. </p><p>I still walked away quite a bit, not wanting to tangle with EIM. I wasn’t afraid of them. Since they were tasked with handling the supernatural, they were inevitably connected with the sect, probably reporting to the outer-sect disciple responsible for the whole land, making them several ranks lower than me. </p><p>However, interacting with them would reveal my presence. </p><p>Initially, I just wanted to stay away so as not to ruin my holiday … but the presence of demonic cultivators, even weak ones, showed a different picture. It meant that they were being lazy. </p><p>However, my decision not to tangle with them was challenged when I saw Sophie being arrested, particularly when saw the aura of the one that arrested her. Bloody, and eager for more. Alarming…</p><p>Especially since the car started to drive from the town, and toward a nearby forest.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, officer,” I said. “How can I help you?” </p><p>She blinked at me as I spoke, her determination floundering a bit. “Oh. Um, I’m suspended. You don’t need to call me officer.” </p><p>“Sophie, then,” I said, unable to keep a flirtatious smile off my face despite the upcoming potential fight against the demonic cultivators. They were important, but they could wait for a moment. </p><p>Especially since Sophie managed to identify as a cultivator. Being equated with a demonic cultivator was annoying, but in her case, I didn’t take any offense. She had no idea what a cultivator was. If she had, trying to arrest one would have been the last thing she would try. </p><p>Most of the cultivators had fragile egos and didn’t react well to disrespect, even perceived ones. </p><p>Of course, that led back to the question. How the hell did she manage to identify me without even knowing what a cultivator was? </p><p>Under my smile, she looked flustered for a moment, even blushing slightly. Interesting. Earlier, the same smile earned me nothing but a sharp glare. It didn’t last long, however. “You can help me by telling me how exactly you recognized the men in the pictures,” she said. “You don’t look like one of those murder groupies, so don’t tell me that you recognize their attitude. And, not all of them had been revealed to the public in the first place.  </p><p>“Let’s just say I know a killer when I see one,” I said, not willing to go a deep explanation about cultivation. Technically, I wasn’t supposed to, but I never let that stop me. However, I doubted her explanation that not only humans were living on other planets, but also there were wizards with swords that ruled everything. </p><p>Well, nowhere near everything, just thousands of planets, with equally strong enemies, but that didn’t make the explanation any easier to believe. </p><p>“That’s not an answer,” she said with a frustrated growl. </p><p>“That’s the only one you will accept, especially from a man that you don’t even know his name,” I said even as I offered her my hand. “It’s Blake.” </p><p>She took my hand, but only after a tiny pause, and kept her eyes firmly locked to mine. She even tried to squeeze it, which only made my smile even bigger. “Sophie,” she said.  </p><p>“A pleasure,” I said, letting my smirk widen as she squeezed my hand even harder. </p><p>“That’s a stretch,” she answered as she ripped her hand away from me. “Now, tell me. How did you recognize them?” </p><p>I sighed. I didn’t want to just ignore her, especially since she was the one who alerted me to the presence of the demonic cultivators, accidental or not. “I can answer, but I’m not sure you’ll accept it, or even find it believable.” </p><p>She didn’t say anything, but just pulled two pictures, both grainy. However, both of them belonged to me, and they were taken moments of each other, right as I was leaving the alley. One had my lip still bleeding, the other, it already recovered. “Try me,” she said. </p><p>“So, you know the existence of the …” I said, then stopped, trying to find a way to describe the situation. </p><p>“The shadow world, yes. I’m aware,” she said. </p><p>“A good name as any. Yes, shadow world,” I said, nevertheless, it was clear that her knowledge was extremely limited. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have just come out and arrested me. “I have some minor abilities, and one of them is to recognize ... let’s just call them murderers for now.” </p><p>That didn’t help her frown. “Are you claiming that they are not murderers,” she said, her aura of justice flaring sharply, fed by her anger. It was good to see the effects of her suspension disappearing quickly.</p><p>“No, I’m claiming they are even worse than murderers,” I replied, but when she opened her mouth, I shook my head and interrupted her. “I recommend you not ask. It’s not a nice discussion to have.” </p><p>“What if I insist,” she said, stubborn. </p><p>“Then, I would say we need to find a better location for that talk. An alley in front of your station is not exactly ideal,” I said. “And, in the meanwhile, you can bring me one of the locations that they had been seen, to see if I can pick anything about their Essence that I could use to find them.” </p><p>“You can do that?” she said. </p><p>I nodded. </p><p>“I still insist that you explain what’s going on first. I can’t just bring a civilian to a crime scene, not when the criminals were still loose.” </p><p>Her concern was amusing considering my abilities, but I let that slide. After all, as much as I enjoyed her presence, I wouldn’t drag her along for an extermination mission, so she had no reason to know about my capabilities. </p><p>“How about a bargain? You bring me to a location that you think safe, and after, I’ll give you the explanation,” I said. </p><p>She looked reluctant, and I could see that she didn’t trust me. “First, we need to make a stop on the way,” she said. </p><p>“I’m guessing we’re going to walk,” I said, which earned a terse nod. She didn’t appreciate the fact that she didn’t have her official vehicle. </p><p>“It’s not far,” she said, and we started to walk. She stayed silent during the walk, no doubt using the walk as an opportunity to calm down. I could have used the opportunity to tease her, but after some consideration, I decided against it. The combination of finally having a clue about the case that she was determined to solve and her suspension was a nasty combination. </p><p>Especially for her, who was driven by her sense of justice, enough to turn her aura into an incarnation of it. </p><p>I followed her from a slow distance, examining my surroundings, amused by all the glares my outfit had been receiving. I needed to pick something better. </p><p>Something that didn’t make me stick out like a sore thumb. </p><p>“Wait here for me,” she said. </p><p>“How about I wait for you there?” I said as I pointed to a nearby thrift shop. </p><p>“As long as you pick something less blinding,” she snarked, which earned a chuckle from me. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I know how to avoid attention if the situation calls for it,” I said. However, if the issue was anything but the presence of demonic cultivators, I would have picked the most blinding combination just to annoy her. </p><p>She walked away, though I noticed that she made an extra turn before she returned, thinking that she was hidden. She watched me for a while, trying to make sure I was going for the shop and not making a run in her absence. Then, she started climbing the stairs of a nearby apartment, unaware that I could still feel her presence. </p><p>She didn’t want me to know where she lived. </p><p>Well, I was a mysterious man she had just met. It was a reasonable precaution. The fact that she took the risk showed just how deeply she cared about justice. </p><p>Beautiful, aggressive, and determined. </p><p>My holiday was getting better and better. </p><p>The thrift shop was empty other than an old man sitting on the desk, positioned in a way that could see everything around. As I dug around the piles of second-hand clothing, I found several interesting pieces. I settled for a decent pair of boots, a simple black T-shirt, and a pair of jeans that fit me even better. </p><p>However, before I paid, I noticed a rusty old combat knife, one with an aura of despair and blood covering it. “Interesting,” I muttered even as I grabbed it for a swing. It was not the first time I saw a weapon with an aura, even a mortal one with no hint of the essence, but any weapon with enough history would have been on display rather than lying in a bargain bin. </p><p>I doubted that it could handle even a fraction of my power, but such a weapon deserved a better end than rusting in a bargain bin. </p><p>“Do you mind if I change here,” I said once I paid for them and earned a grunt in response. Not a particularly enthusiastic merchant, I thought even as I went and changed, dropping my old clothing to the bin nearby marked old clothes. It looked like I wasn’t the only one that did so. </p><p>When I stepped out of the shop, Sophie was walking toward me, her expression relaxed. I couldn’t help but look at her clothing. Combat boots, jeans, a simple white T-shirt, and a jacket. The weather wasn’t cold enough to require one, but I could see two guns holstered underneath, one on her waist, the other on some kind of shoulder holster. </p><p>However, I couldn’t help but enjoy the slight stumble she had experienced the the moment she saw me, followed by a subtle blush. It was good to see that I was making an impact. </p><p>“Good, you don’t look bad enough to gouge my eyes,” she said, her voice unnecessarily aggressive, trying to cover up her reaction.</p><p>“You don’t look half bad, Sophie,” I said, not bothering to hide my smile, but I didn’t say anything about noticing her reaction. “Shall we go?” </p><p>“Are you afraid of motorcycles?” she said. </p><p>“Not at any speed you can reach,” I answered. And, just like that, her expression shifted, showing that she accepted the challenge. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Janet was far happier than she expected herself to be when she responded to Darion’s summons earlier. When he bent her over Mia’s desk, Janet was afraid of the consequences. Unlike the last time they used Mia’s office for illicit purposes, Mia could have arrived any moment. </p><p>Darion had dismissed the risk as nothing, leading her to believe that he knew Mia would be late or something. She might have questioned him further, but two things stopped her. First, she assumed that the situation was just as risky for Darion, making her accept his judgment call.</p><p>The second reason was simpler. It was right then he pushed his considerable length into her throat, preventing her from speaking. As far as distractions went, that had been a very effective one. </p><p>Then, right before she climaxed, the door opened, and Mia darted in, angrier than Janet had ever seen her. At that point, Janet was absolutely sure that her career was over, and she would end up blacklisted … Mia wasn’t famous for her mercy. </p><p>Ten minutes after that, Janet realized that Mia was supposed to be famous for something else. “Damn, boss. Your tongue is amazing. I would have done my best to actually seduce you if I knew that,” she said, though she had to pause a few times. </p><p>It was hard to deliver long sentences as Darion invaded her from behind. </p><p>Underneath, she could feel Mia shiver in anger. “I’ll make you pay,” she growled. </p><p>Janet chuckled. “Only if Darion lets you, boss.” She knew that it was risky to tease her like that. Whatever reason that was making her follow Darion’s order, it wasn’t exactly a golden bullet that would protect her forever. </p><p>Yet, as she got licked while she got penetrated from behind, it was significantly more difficult to actually care about the risks. </p><p>“You’re talking too much,” Darion said as he flipped her, allowing Mia to crawl away. Janet was sure that Mia would use the opportunity to retreat, but to her shock, Mia just adjusted her position before starting to lick again, this time aiming his balls. </p><p>And, Darion didn’t even need to order. It looked like his control over their boss was even stronger than she had first assumed. A fascinating detail. “You’re doing amazing, boss—“ she mocked again, unable to resist the temptation, only to receive another spank. </p><p>“You pushed your luck too much, let’s change the pose,” he said, and Janet once again found herself being lifted while her boss changed her position. This time, she ended up on all fours, right in front of her boss. </p><p>“Lick,” he ordered. Helpless, Janet followed, the taste of her boss filling her mouth. Not exactly a great hardship, considering he continued to drill from behind. “Now, apologize.” </p><p>Janet whimpered. </p><p>“I … I’m sorry, boss. I was just … I lost myself,“ she whispered. </p><p>“Not bad,” Darion said as they changed position once again. “Now, start working.” </p><p>“Yes, Janet, start working,” Mia teased as she adjusted his shaft under her. “Not that you like to do very much…” Janet couldn’t help but blush at the snide voice. She had never seen Mia being subtly snide, as she was usually far more aggressive. It seemed that she was equally effective in that as well. “You like this, don’t you?” she followed. </p><p>Janet shivered. “I …” she started, which was all she was able to say before Darion interrupted her with another flip, and she landed on her side, her head leaning against Mia’s naked tits … which was perfect enough to be annoying. It was certainly not the way she expected the day to go, but as Darion invaded her wetness again and again, she didn’t feel like complaining. </p><p>“Very good, Janet. It’s good that you can do at least one job properly,” Mia said, her voice domineering once more. </p><p>Janet whimpered as she looked at Darion, hoping that, at least, he would try to teach Mia a lesson. “Well, I would intervene, but from the way you tightened around me, it’s clear you are loving it when she mocks you,” he said. </p><p>“No I don’t,” Janet said, but unfortunately, she didn’t sound convincing even to herself. </p><p>“Sure you don’t,” Mia mocked her, and Janet tightened even more. “Now, put your lying mouth to a better use.” </p><p>Janet followed her order, lost in pleasure. It had been fun to be superior to Mia even for a fleeting moment. </p><p>She abandoned herself to pleasure.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I had to wait for long for Tara’s arrival for a while, but I wasn’t concerned about that. Today, we had purchased quite a number of outfits for her, and it would take her a while to dress properly. </p><p>I didn’t waste that break, but instead started exploring the ways to spend the sudden riches I found myself owning. </p><p>Renovating the bar itself was not an option. I didn’t want people starting to ask questions about the sudden renovation, and whether it was about our earlier lack of money. There would be several good explanations for such a question. </p><p>My situation was like a magic trick, the fewer questions asked, the better. </p><p>Luckily, I had no visitors in my apartment upstairs, and I was free to change that however I wanted. </p><p>As long as we did it with no outside help. </p><p>With our display, every single low and medium-tier villain would be watching us, meaning there was absolutely no chance we could trust a contractor. Not to keep their mouth shut, and not to refrain from dropping a few bugs in the foundation. </p><p>No, I rather do all the necessary renovation myself, especially since Tara’s super strength was revealed, and had no problem being used. </p><p>Renovation was easy … security, not so much. Better cameras, alarms, and motion sensors were a must, maybe lasers and some more exotic detection tools in case I had to deal with a super thief. Luckily, my power helped me to make such design choices easily. I had made several purchase orders on one of the national companies, with an expedited delivery order to a different name and location.</p><p>I didn’t expect our local villains to have any sway on a company of that size enough to make them send faulty products, but it was better safe than sorry.  </p><p>The last thing I did was to write the owner and purchase the building … only to receive an answer, receiving the place as a gift in less than five minutes. Just like that, I was the owner of my bar and my house. </p><p>My reputation helped … and I did my best to ignore how it would bounce the other way.</p><p>All those took an hour, which would have been enough to worry if I couldn’t hear Tara moving upstairs, no doubt trying to pick the perfect outfit. I could have gone and interrupted, but I chose to let it slide. She had just got her wardrobe changed significantly, and. It was better for her to feel confident about it. </p><p>And, it wasn’t like I didn’t have anything else to do. </p><p>I was going through the city plans and wondering if we could dig a tunnel through the office, one that could be used both as a way to smuggle stuff in, and a way to smuggle stuff in. We might even add a basement, both only viable strategies due to Tara’s powers. </p><p>It made sense. </p><p>Once I put the finishing touches on the plan, I had nothing to do. I pulled on the puzzle, and started to play with it once more, once again failing to understand why I was so fascinated by it. Since the night was over, I decided to overcharge my power again. </p><p>As I overpowered my ability, several details I had only caught on a subconscious level became apparent. “No wonder I’m so fascinated with this puzzle,” I murmured as I took in the details, which were ten times more intricate than I had realized before. </p><p>No wonder my power caught it among all the other toys. </p><p>I twisted and manipulated until the puzzle parted. Inside, there was only a paper. </p><p>‘I’m a hero, and I’m being kept prisoner. Please help,’ the message read, which was the only handwritten part. The rest of it was two parts. First, it detailed the location of a small safe house hidden in a junkyard on the opposite side of the town, with a list of inventory showing weapons and other devices, that could be used to free her.</p><p>I knew she was a woman, because, I could somehow detect that from her handwriting. My power might not be incredibly powerful, but it had its perks. </p><p>However, the second part of the message sent chills through me and I wanted to burn it. It was her current location, which was right under a well-known building in the city. </p><p>Famous, even. </p><p>The headquarters of the New Giant Force. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured. I wanted to believe that it was a joke, but overcharging my power — despite the headache — allowed me to confirm that whoever wrote the message was in genuine distress. I didn’t trust the guilds, that much was certain, but I didn’t expect them to be keeping people captive illegally. </p><p>There were a lot of questions, like how and why … but then I heard a knock on my door, I just folded the message back and put it in my drawer with the solved mechanical puzzle. I had a horrible headache from overusing my power, and I didn’t want to think about the implications of such an illegal action coming from the premier guild of the city. </p><p>No, I just wanted to be distracted from my pain. </p><p>“Come in,” I said. </p><p>“S-sir… I’m here for our … scheduled meeting,” Tara said, her face glowing red, suggesting that it was her attempt to roleplaying. </p><p>Distraction was a success. </p><p>She looked fascinating, her innocent expression contrasting greatly with the huge cleavage she displayed thanks to her mostly unbuttoned shirt, and the red bra she had underneath made the contrast even more incredible. </p><p>Her skirt was even better. She wore the shortest one we purchased, already small enough to be scandalous, and the slit on the side made it even sexier while also showing off her stockings and garter belt, also red.</p><p>The black stilettos were high enough to make me doubt whether she could have walked on them if it wasn’t for her powers, but considering the way they enhanced her ass, I wasn’t complaining. </p><p>When taken together, her outfit left no doubt about exactly what was about to happen.  </p><p>I was so glad about that shopping trip, especially since all the money we spent there suddenly turned into a pittance. </p><p>“You’re late,” I said, the headache making my voice harder than I intended. She opened her mouth, but I gestured her to be silent, which worked excellently. She looked confused, trying to understand whether it was part of the role or genuine. “Come here, you need to be punished,” I ordered. </p><p>She was still hesitant as she approached, which was a funny expression on the face of the super who had just scared a lot of villain organizations around us. </p><p> “I’m sorry, sir. I was just-” she started, delivering no doubt a prepared explanation, which died the moment I pushed her against the desk, her skirt riding up with the motion … showing that she didn’t wear panties.</p><p>“No talking,” I said as I pulled my belt and wrapped it around her neck, using it to pull her back while I freed my shaft. It was hurried, but I didn’t want to waste any time with the foreplay. Not only I had a horrible headache I wanted to distract myself from, but also I could see just how wet she was. </p><p>She didn’t need any foreplay either. </p><p>I pulled my belt, forcing her to a difficult position that had the risk of being painful if it wasn’t for her powers, and slid inside. </p><p>Her eyes widened at the sudden invasion, followed by a moan that the belt around her neck was unable to prevent — once again her powers interfering — as I enjoyed her unique beauty, giving me an excellent boost of pleasure in the process. </p><p>She said nothing, too overwhelmed by the sudden invasion as I invaded her aggressively. At this moment, she was nothing more than a secretary, here only to serve my most immediate needs. </p><p>And, her cries made it clear just how much she loved it. </p><p>As I climbed toward an explosion, she wasn’t too far behind. Her voice turned strained in barely a minute, the aggressive impaling she received working wonders. </p><p>I could have slowed down to make sure she climaxed, but with my headache, that was not an option. I just invaded her aggressively, for once prioritizing my own pleasure before hers. Of course, after overusing it, my power didn’t give me constant small inputs — it might have, but I actively suppressed it to keep it from happening, hoping it would help me to recover faster. </p><p>Luckily, Tara wasn’t particularly hard to read even without my power. Our short yet fruitful partnership gave me a lot of practice in knowing just how she reacted to an impending climax. </p><p>I impaled her for another quick yet intense minute, finally marking that with an explosion. </p><p>“Yes, sir. Fill me,” she moaned, orgasming as I filled her, which was faster than I expected … showing that I wasn’t as good as I hoped to read her without my power. </p><p>Well, we had a lot of time to practice… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When the night arrived, I was once again playing with the mysterious puzzle, wondering whether we would have any customers. Initially, I had no such expectations, but the earlier changed my expectations. </p><p>After my visitors left — and we had some fun —  I started digging on the internet, trying to find anything about them. The old man had no presence, but luckily, the same didn’t apply to the people that surrounded the bar. </p><p>It took quite a while to dig through the news, but soon, I managed to discover their group. Elite Syndicate. </p><p>Not a happy realization. </p><p>Villains didn’t exactly have guilds, but some of them had alliances that functioned in a similar manner, with some non-aggression pacts and promises to defend each other if the guilds started targeting them. </p><p>Elite Syndicate wasn’t the strongest villain alliance in the city … but they weren’t the weakest either, which meant that the only thing that protected men from them was my wild bluff. Not exactly a happy situation. </p><p>Still, bluff or not, I had the implicit acceptance of the villain group, meaning I didn’t have the luxury of anonymity. I expected many people to visit, likely the henchmen of villains nearby, each trying to get a sense of what was going on. </p><p>Either that, or the henchmen of the Slasher, ready to make trouble. </p><p>As I waited, for their arrival, I played with the puzzle, twisting and turning as I tried — and failed — to solve it, ignoring the temptation to overcharge my power to unlock it. </p><p>My headache was gone after an hour, but I wanted to be ready for another surprise customer just in case. I wanted to be prepared for a visitor … watching the screen under the bar — a new addition — to keep an eye on the surrounding streets. </p><p>That screen was the reason I was confident there would be several visitors soon. More than one group of henchmen arrived, each belonging to a different group as they checked the environment, making sure there was no threat. </p><p>Tara was sitting on a table near the bar, in the shadows, a nice spot I arranged for her so that she could defend me or intervene in a fight if necessary. There were no bouncers on the door, which could be a problem … but it was not. </p><p>“Are you sure this is the place? It looks like a dump —” I heard a male voice start before being interrupted, likely by an elbow to the ribs. He wasn’t speaking too loudly, but while my powers didn’t make my hearing supernatural, it still enhanced somewhat. More importantly, it helped me to distinguish their voices from background noise, helping me to catch words I would have missed otherwise. </p><p>“Are you mad? You know about the gossip,” answered another. Just from their accents, I could guess that they did not exactly live around these parts. Their tone suggested higher education. </p><p>“It’s obviously a dump,” answered the boy. “What kind of villain uses that to set up shop.”</p><p>“The kind that wants to stay hidden, moron,” said the other voice. “We have our orders. Go in, have a drink, observe, and leave.” </p><p>I checked the screen to get a better sense of them. Two men, one tall and the other stocky, both dressed expensively, but their clothes suggested more money than fashion sense, and one of them gave me a pretentious sense. </p><p>I watched the other details, and a little overcharge of my power later — far shorter than what I had done for the old man — I decided on two cocktails for them, a whiskey mixture with some sharp spices for the tall one that gave me the sense of pretentiousness, and a sweet gin cocktail for the stocky one, whose taste for desserts clear from the chocolate marks on his fingers. </p><p>The way they knocked on the door was very respectful. “Come in,” I called. </p><p>“It’s open, right?” the tall one said, looking a touch surprised as his gaze examined the place. His surprised look was understandable, because, after Tara’s super-strength cleaning spree, the place looked half-decent. Add in the contrast of the expensive liquor that filled the bar, and the complicated and expensive cocktail-making equipment, all brand new — bought by the money they had been delivered as an apology. </p><p>Pity renovating the bar would be too suspicious, so I had to be satisfied by the old and clean look the bar displayed. </p><p>“Yes,” I said, then pointed at the box at the entrance. “Drop your guns and phones there.” </p><p>“I don’t think—” the tall one started, but the stocky one poked him on the side. “Of course, sir,” he said as he took his weapon out and put it on the box. </p><p>“Good, keep the rules in mind,” I said as I pointed to a small board. </p><p>No weapons. </p><p>No phones. </p><p>No fighting. </p><p>No complaining about the bill.</p><p>It was a small list, and not exactly a set of numbers that could trigger a successful business, but I knew the mystery would draw them in. </p><p>“Of course,” he said, and sent a pointed glare at his friend, warning him about making trouble. </p><p>“Excellent. Now, your drink,” I said as I pushed the glass forward. He took it silently and walked to a table, and his friend followed his request. Soon, they sat down, drinking silently, their shocked expression confirming the accuracy of my guess about their general preference. </p><p>I had prided myself on being a good bartender, and using my power to turn myself into some kind of super bartender was certainly fun. </p><p>They said nothing, just observing the situation as they consumed their drinks, soon asking for seconds. They said nothing, and I made no point of acting out. </p><p>Soon, other people started to arrive, their expressions similar to the first two, silent and tense … and finding their favorite cocktails waiting for them didn’t exactly feel comforting for them, especially when I made a point of delivering them with a knowing smirk. </p><p>I felt like a fake physic, conning my customers. It felt amazing. </p><p>None of them dared to ignore the rules for the moment, Tara’s intimidating presence enough to dissuade them. Her powerset was scary for a reason, and it wasn’t made any better by the fact that no one knew about her limits. </p><p>“Nice place,” one of the new arrivals said, not bothering to sound sincere, his pasture combative. “What’s the name?”  </p><p>“It doesn’t have a name,” I said with a completely straight face, which made his sneer widen. Combative, but it wasn’t an act. Probably they had asked him to do so. </p><p>“Of course, a barn doesn’t need to have a name,” he said as he reached the glass, his posture showing that he was about to break it. Yet, even as he did so, he was arrogant, clearly thinking that he was invincible because he worked for a villain.  </p><p>Moron. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t particularly torn up by his basic disrespect, but the role I had created left no doubt about what was about to happen. I said nothing else, and just gave a sign to Tara. She dashed forward, her speed fascinating, and before he could even reach the glass, he found himself flying. </p><p>The distinct crack as he landed suggested that he broke his arm in the process. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>Tara was back to her seat before they could properly process what had just happened, allowing them to register that the gossip about the place was more than accurate. </p><p>The silence stretched for a while, only interrupted by the soft music. “I hope there’s no problem,” I said softly. </p><p>“Of course not, sir,” several answered together, looking at each other in shock before they started discussing once again. After all, a bodyguard with her powers allowed them to reach a lot of unsettling implications. </p><p>All of those conclusions were inaccurate, of course, but they did their job and confirmed the news that there was a mysterious player in town. </p><p>After that show, one by one, they left the bar, no doubt ready to inform their bosses about the news. The only reason they didn’t run was to maintain the illusion that they were here for drinks rather than information. They were aware that I knew exactly why they were here, but living in a society meant respect for such polite truths. </p><p>Amusingly, none of them complained about the price, even though I charged a thousand dollars for every glass. </p><p>Well, except one. </p><p>“A hundred thousand,” one of them gasped in shock. “T-that’s absurd.” </p><p>“It’s worth it for a gift,” I said as I reached under the table, and pulled the listening device he had placed there earlier. “I was being kind and giving you a discount … but I could visit directly and discuss it with your boss,” I added. </p><p>I had no idea who his boss was, but clearly, he was scary enough that the suggestion was enough to make him lose all color. </p><p>“A hundred thousand, not a problem, sir,” he immediately corrected. “May I drop it tomorrow.” </p><p>“You can drop it whenever you want, as long as you remember there’s a twenty percent interest with every day it delays,” I said, not missing the chance to push for more. “And, of course, you’re always free to dispute,” I added, my smile enough to confirm just how bad of an idea it would have been. </p><p>“No, sir, not at all,” he said as he dashed out, while the other customers snickered at his misfortune. Slowly, all left. </p><p>Leaving me with a shocking profit. </p><p>“Not a bad night,” I said and looked at Tara.</p><p>“No sir,, it was not,” she said as she raised the visor, showing her beautiful face. </p><p>“A celebration, then,” I suggested, enjoying her blush. “Why don’t you go and summon my secretary to my office…”</p><p>The speed she disappeared upstairs was fascinating. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Carol felt encouraged by Amy’s challenging gaze and stuffed her panties into her mouth, but she was too distracted by the action itself to realize the helpless shiver Amy let out was one of pure desire. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I leaned forward, picking a perfect angle to put both of their bodies on display. “Now, why don’t you give me a smug smile. After all, you have just captured your enemy,” I said. </p><p>Carol followed that order easily, her smile bright, unaware of the expression of desire Amy wore behind her, her reaction making it obvious that she had a kink for being tied up. Interestingly, she was not a pure submissive like Nicole, which was very easy to pick up. </p><p>My guess, it was the way her desire for Carol reflected through her poor self-perception. </p><p>“Now, grab her arms and force them behind her,” I ordered Carol, and she did so enthusiastically, somehow still missing the sexual context of the moment. Amy whimpered, which was suppressed by the panties in her mouth, while I took another amazing picture. </p><p>“Sorry about it. Was I too hard,” Carol asked, panicked, but Amy was quick to shake her head in protest. Amy shook her head rapidly, desperate to convince Carol to continue. </p><p>At that moment, I was a little disappointed that I had asked them to undress that much. They would have generated an amazing set of pictures, worth of an art gallery. Unfortunately, their nudity made that impossible. </p><p>And, since these photos were destined for my private vault, there was no harm escalating it even further. First, I reached and pulled off my belt, which made Carol look excited, and Amy disappointed … and their expressions shifted once I passed it to Carol with an order. “Tie her hands behind her.”</p><p>“I don’t know … isn’t a bit much,” Carol murmured. </p><p>I could have handled her concern in a lot of different ways. I could have slowly explained to her that it was just a part of the game, talked about our business potential, or pointed out that Amy clearly enjoyed it. </p><p>I chose a more direct route. “Do it,” I ordered, using my best command voice that I saved exclusively for my most disobedient models. Carol’s hands immediately moved, wrapping the belt around Amy’s wrists, immobilizing her. </p><p>However, despite the amazing vision, I focused on Amy’s expression. Her sudden frustration was simply too beautiful. She clearly hated the fact that I ordered Carol around … but not enough to actually spit out her primitive gag and speak out. Not when it would mean her dream scenario would be over. </p><p>I stayed focused on her face as I took several masterful photos. That expression needed to be immortalized. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I looked at Carol, who shivered under the sudden sharpness of my tone, not mentally ready to lose the playful competition. I realized she wouldn’t react to that tone too much. </p><p>Luckily, I had a better lever. I returned my fun tone. “Why don’t you come here and we can see just how long your brave roommate can resist the temptation,” I suggested before I looked at Amy. “The signal is nod, shake, nod. Do it, and we’ll stop,” I said. </p><p>Amy’s eyes widened as Carol reached to my side and pushed my pants down, realizing exactly what her next challenge would be. Her expression was beautiful, wistfulness, frustration, desire, loss… I took another picture of her expression, confident that it would earn me at least one reward if I could convince Amy to sign the release. </p><p>What an unexpected benefit. </p><p>“Now, start the show,” I whispered to Carol. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she whispered excitedly as she fell onto her knees, her fingers already around my shaft, and her lips not too far behind. Her eyes stayed closed, but that didn’t hide the expression of bliss as she finally started. </p><p>After taking a few photos of Carol — which was definitely not destined for any competition — before I took two more photos of Amy, both focused on her face to catch her emotional conflict. The realization that her precious roommate had feelings for giving a man an excellent blowjob, and the pain of her thinking that would be the closest she could get. </p><p>I would have pitied her, if it was anything but her personal hang-ups that were keeping her back. Carol loved her as a friend, and was comfortable enough to get undressed once her buttons pressed — as I was seeing the second time in the same day.  </p><p>All she needed was to take a modest risk, and I wouldn’t have been in the picture. And, now, she had to limit herself to watching her crush blow me while she stayed on the couch, immobilized. </p><p>“Deeper,” I ordered, and Carol gripped my thighs tighter. Her sexy obedience was already enough to put a smile on my face without Amy’s frustrated wiggle, her gaze locked to the view. She was focused on watching it enough not to pay attention to anything else, which included where my camera was pointing. </p><p>As Carol picked up speed, Amy was starting to look frustrated and horny. With her complicated expression of despair gone, along with my hope of getting award-bait photos. Luckily, that didn’t mean she suddenly became boring.</p><p>No, picturing her horny state as she absentmindedly forced her restraints looked amazing on the camera — though, once again, destined for my private vault. </p><p>I decided that she deserved a better view. “On all fours,” I ordered Carol, and she followed it immediately. She was about to look away from Amy, but I corrected her position, not only making her look toward her, but also pushing her closer enough that her face almost touched Amy’s knees. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit…” Carol whispered, not completing her sentence. </p><p>“Well, if you don’t want to win…” I said, deliberately responding with another fragment, but my amusement was the desperate way Amy kept her legs closed. Not due to a sudden modesty, but because she didn’t want to show just how wet she had gotten to her crush. </p><p>“I didn’t say that—” Carol said, which was all she was able to say before I moved forward, invading her wetness aggressively.  </p><p>Amy whimpered desperately as she watched the show in front of her, so close to what she dreamed, yet so far. I decided to take pity on her. I was not a mean person. </p><p>I was actually a nice man … well, for a given value. </p><p>“Carol, why don’t you help your friend a bit,” I said between pushes. “It’s rude to keep her from participating just because her hands are bound.” </p><p>“No,” Carol gasped immediately, which put a sad expression on Amy’s face, which she took as a sign of rejection. </p><p>“Why not?” I asked even as I slapped her ass, enjoying the way she tightened around me. </p><p>“It’s getting too much. I don’t want to push her to something she isn’t comfortable with,” Carol answered. “Not when she can’t even speak.” </p><p>“Well, there’s an easy way for that,” I responded. “Miss contractor, why don’t you open your beautiful thighs if you’re feeling frustrated and want Carol to help you a bit,” I said. </p><p>Her expression of hope and desire was beautiful enough to make me glad I kept my camera hanging on my chest. A few more photos as Amy tried to ascertain whether I was teasing her … then, her legs parted open, revealing her sopping wetness. </p><p>“Enough as an answer?”  I asked. </p><p>“Well, you’re right,” Carol said, ready to reach with her fingers. I had a better idea. I easily lifted Carol and put her closer. “Maybe that’s too much—” Carol said, which was all she was able to say before I pushed her head down. </p><p>“Lick,” I ordered. She did.</p><p>I looked at Amy, catching her expression of desire. Suddenly, she didn’t seem to mind me ordering Carol around. </p><p>What a complicated girl. </p><p>I said nothing as I reached forward and grabbed her breasts. Her eyes jolted open, showing that she didn’t expect that to happen, but she made no move to stop me either. Which didn’t surprise me, as while she had deep feelings for Carol, she was clearly not a lesbian. </p><p>Oh, she wasn’t exactly a fan of mine, and if the situation was different, she would have kicked me out to stay alone with Carol. Amusingly, if she actually tried to do that by having an honest conversation, she probably would have succeeded. </p><p>Pity that, for all her trappings of strength, she was too cowardly where it counted. She rather be a reluctant participant in a threesome than have an honest conversation with Carol. </p><p>Well, not so much pity, I corrected as I twisted her nipple, watching the way her back arched. She might have been unhappy about my general presence, but the same clearly didn’t apply to my touch. </p><p>We continued a little while more … with Carol working hard on both sides, before she started shivering. Amy followed that despite her late inclusion, the emotional involvement was enough to trigger her orgasm as well. </p><p>“I … I think I need to catch my breath a bit,” Carol whispered as she pulled back. </p><p>“Why don’t you go get a quick shower before we start having real fun,” I suggested. She was too dazed to question the reason. </p><p>Leaving me alone with her bound roommate. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Now, Carol, I want you to remember it’s a practice session. The aim is to teach you how to move in front of the camera.” </p><p>Carol blushed as she grabbed her dressing gown, but she didn’t pull it close, her desire to teach her roommate a lesson after her overreach winning over her sense of propriety. </p><p>However, from the way she acted, I could see that she was more uncomfortable about my presence than her roommate’s, suggesting it wasn’t the first time Amy had seen her in her underwear — which further suggested Carol was completely blind to the crush Amy was nursing for her, and not just ignoring it for utility’s sake. </p><p>How amusing. </p><p>“I didn’t realize you were going to be taking photos,” Amy interrupted even as I raised my camera, clearly conflicted about what was going on, her desire to protect her roommate battling with her arousal. </p><p>How entertaining. </p><p>I looked at her, deliberately keeping my expression calm and apologetic. “We can always move to the bedroom if you need to watch TV or something,” I said, not giving any outward sign that I was playing her. </p><p>She deserved it after calling me here with false pretenses. I wasn’t unhappy that I was here … but it was the principle of the matter. Her expression flickered a moment, before she leaned against the kitchen counter. “Don’t worry about it. It looks fun to watch,” she said, keeping her voice even enough that I would have missed the hitch if I wasn’t looking for it. </p><p>“As long as it’s okay with you,” I said as I looked at Carol. </p><p>“Of course not. She’s my roomie, she has seen me in less,” Carol said, clearly more concerned about what would happen once I inevitably made a move on her … not even realizing how much her roommate cared about her lingerie-clad body. </p><p>Making the moment right out of a sitcom … well, a raunchy sitcom that could be only shown after midnight. </p><p>I felt a little cruel as I caught Amy’s conflicted look, but only a little. She could always leave if it got too much, after all. </p><p>“Now, how about we start small,” I said as I approached. Close your dressing gown,” I said, enjoying Amy’s disappointed gaze. One that twisted the moment I slipped my hand down the closed down, and pulled Carol’s bra free. </p><p>“Oh, daring,” Amy commented from the side, her tone forced as she tried to sound raunchy rather than shocked. “So, you’re that kind of photographer.” </p><p>“I’m all kinds of photographer, sweetie,” I said without not even catching her gaze, and caught Carol’s gaze. “Now, let’s start with something simple. Try to act like it’s Sunday, and you’re relaxing after a decadent breakfast.” </p><p>Amy snorted in amusement, marking that as something Carol was in the habit of doing. Which was well, as it allowed Carol to act casual, relaxing under the camera. I still gave her some orders to fix her pose. Just because I was taking those photos for fun didn’t mean it was acceptable for them to be bad. </p><p>I still had my professional pride. </p><p>I didn’t expect much from Carol before I started pushing, but Amy continued to heckle from the side — a transparent attempt to hide the attraction she was feeling, which Carol somehow missed. </p><p>Carol responded by giving more and more daring poses, her dressing gown parting open to reveal a deep cleavage, her absence of a bra showing in a very good way.  </p><p>Amusingly, for a woman who had no intention of becoming a model — she was far more interested in getting the architecture contract — she was very quick to reveal herself in front of the camera out of pure spite. First, her ridiculous competition with Nicole, and now, as a response to her roommate’s heckling. </p><p>“Well, why don’t you get rid of that gown completely if you’re as brave as you try to act,” Amy commented. </p><p>“Oh, talk is cheap,” Carol answered. “Why don’t you show me your courage first. I don’t see you here with me on the couch —” she continued, only to freeze in shock. </p><p>Since I was still looking at Carol, I didn’t see what stole her words, but the distinct and familiar sound of fabric hitting the floor was too familiar to miss. Then, it was followed by a softer sound … so, when Amy entered the limited view I had through my camera topless, I wasn’t surprised. </p><p>“How about now, roomie, courageous enough,” Amy said as she pushed her chest proudly. I had to admit, she had a reason to feel proud. Her breasts looked good, and the tattoos on her arms only highlighted the perfection of her untouched breasts further. </p><p>Not marring their beauty with a piercing was the correct call. </p><p>It took a while for Carol to answer, frozen in shock, showing that she didn’t expect her roommate to answer her directly. “B-barely,” Carol said, her competitive nature unable to suppress her stammer, but regardless, she removed her gown in one smooth move, revealing her breasts — with some temporary red spots that lingered after our earlier adventure. “Still, it looks like I’m the one that’s winning,” she added, pointing at her panties, which were the only clothing she was wearing. </p><p>It was not a bad comeback. It highlighted her ‘superior’ position, which she was reasonably confident that couldn’t be matched by her roommate, who Carol expected to be far more self-aware about the professional camera in the room. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, she missed exactly where Amy was looking while she declared that challenge. Amy looked thunderstruck as she looked at Carol’s naked breasts, suggesting that, while she was clearly familiar with the way she looked in her underwear, the same didn’t apply to her half-naked state. </p><p>Carol looked at me, her smirk one of pure victory, like she had just won a tennis match. I caught her gaze, with a smirk of my own. She probably misread it, assuming it was one that shared her sense of victory rather than one that was teasing her. </p><p>Which also gave Amy a moment to gather her senses. I did my best not to look at her, giving her a chance to gather her thoughts so that she could make a choice. To pull back with grace, or push forward for more. It took only a few seconds for her to come to a decision.  </p><p>She chose the latter. </p><p>And did so directly. She said nothing as she raised her legs, and pushed down everything she was wearing in one smooth move, leaving herself completely naked. I limited myself to enjoying her toned thighs and arms — being a contractor wasn’t a light job, but she was still curvy enough to maintain a delicious dollop of traditional femininity. </p><p>“You were saying,” Amy said while Carol looked at her, shocked. Confronting her crush in such a visible manner had all the hallmarks of a horrible decision, but luckily for her, Carol was just competitive enough, and the events earlier did a nice job of warping her sense of what was appropriate. </p><p>Enough to make her decide having a game of naked dare in front of the camera of a man she had just met today was a good idea. </p><p>“Well, if you want to play it like this,” Carol said with a tense smirk as she pushed her panties down, matching Amy in her nudity. I paused a moment, enjoying the contrast between them. While life clearly threw her a nasty curveball, there was no hiding the mark of a soft and privileged life from Carol. It was clear on everything, from posture to the flawlessness of her skin — the kind that could be only achieved by a combination of genetic lottery and very expensive creams. </p><p> Similarly, no matter her natural beauty and other advantages, I could never mistake Amy for a rich girl going through a rebellious streak. Her curves were amazing but the muscles underneath were not the kind that was crafted under the careful guidance of a personal trainer. Her tattoos were creative, but the difference between the work of a skilled amateur and a consummate professional was easy to distinguish. </p><p>Yet, for all their differences, as they shared a couch, both naked, there was a nice pattern between them, one that came across the camera very well. </p><p>While they looked at each other, trading insults, I moved around a bit, checking the light, and found it good enough. Not perfect, but sometimes, catching the moment required some technical sacrifices. </p><p>“So, girls. How about if we turn this into a cooperative shoot,” I offered.  They both flinched, showing that, somehow, they managed to forget the presence of a man with the camera. </p><p>My photographer inside me loved it, as such a reaction with the models was very helpful. It was the kind that would create truly masterful products. </p><p>My male side, however, hated it. And, unluckily for them — particularly Amy —  that side was feeling much stronger at this moment. “Now, Carol. Amy is talking a lot, why don’t you stuff her mouth so she stays silent while you come to a decision,” I suggested, pointing at her panties, which were still in her hand.</p><p>“I … maybe that’s too much,” Carol whispered while Amy shivered with far more excitement than I had been expecting. It looked like I had just touched one of her kinks, one that made her come to a decision very rapidly. </p><p>“Go ahead, sweetie, unless you don’t think you can handle it,” Amy challenged Carol, and my smirk widened. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment I arrived at the capital — teleporting nearby and then flying several miles rather than teleporting directly to make sure I stayed unnoticed — I understood why Helga asked me to hurry up. The city was surrounded by a large army, all carrying the personal flags of the second Prince, while the capital sported the flags of the third Prince. </p><p>No sign of the crown prince and the fourth prince. </p><p>Interesting, I thought even as I mixed into the surrounding army, curious about the exact situation. </p><p>A few questions were enough for me to get a general sense of what was going on. Apparently, the crown prince attacked the estate of the fourth prince, triggering a fight that cost the life of the fourth prince. There was some gossip about a lost artifact with no further explanation. </p><p>More interestingly, before the crown prince could even return to the capital, he mysteriously disappeared, with the second and third princes blaming each other for assassinating him.</p><p>I had a better idea about his fate … especially since I could detect several Eternal agents moving around in the army, all disguised as ordinary soldiers and servants, though nowhere near as hidden as they believed themselves to be. </p><p>There were too many of them to actually be about the capital … and their role didn’t justify them. Giving me a better idea. </p><p>The Eternals — at least the group that was using Mariel as an experiment — finally realized the crown prince lost her. I wondered if they killed him. </p><p>I hoped not. I preferred to take revenge directly. </p><p>A twenty-minute walk around the military camp was enough for me to notice almost thirty Eternal agents, even the weakest above level forty, with decent stats. </p><p>It was fascinating just how little I felt threatened by them. </p><p>Of course, that was not the only change. Such an opportunity was a chance for the nobles to throw their support behind the winner. The number of the flags showed that the most believed it would be the second prince that would be victorious despite the fact that the third Prince held the capital. </p><p>Ultimately, however, I ignored most political nonsense. I didn’t care much about who would be the Emperor. Why would I, when I could easily destroy them if they really pushed me. </p><p>No, I cared about exactly what the Eternals were doing, and just how many agents they had in the city itself. I needed to sneak in. </p><p>I could have easily teleported, but it was almost certain there was a stronger mage that could catch the fluctuations. Teleporting was not exactly subtle, especially since the capital activated its magical protections. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t need to wait for long. There had been a sudden magical attack from the army to the city, followed by a regiment attacking to the walls. It was more of a threat than something that could actually work, but it was enough for me to mix with them … then, change into the colors of the defending army. </p><p>Things were much easier with my improved stats. </p><p>The capital was a mess. People looked shocked, angry, and hungry. And, while I pitied them, I couldn’t do anything. </p><p>Not with the number of Eternal agents I could count, their numbers increasing as I got closer to my blacksmith. Not exactly good news, especially since the increase was too significant to be coincidental. </p><p>Once I arrived, I found a dozen of them surrounding the blacksmith, along with a regiment from the royal army. The wards were activated. </p><p>More importantly, from such a close range, I could finally feel a presence, one that was familiar despite all the differences, reminding me of flames, forges … and chains. </p><p>Oeyne was here. </p><p>I used one of the secret entrances I prepared to sneak inside, soon arriving at the garden. Not too far away from me, there was a group of higher-ranking apprentices I talked was speaking. “Enough of this nonsense. I beg your leave to depart from our usual agenda and for once, think clearly. We have an opportunity here. Let’s use it.”</p><p>There were fifteen of them. Some of them nodded at the declaration. A few muttered things under their breath. The speaker ignored them, clearly treating this as an opportunity. </p><p>“What, support the second prince. After he betrayed our master. No, we need to take down the wards and join the third prince. With all the weapons we have in storage, they have a chance to change the tides of war. We will be heroes, and not betray our master.” </p><p>“Why do we care about a dead man,” the speaker responded, clearly comfortable before crowds. Yet, I would have ignored it if it wasn’t for one thing. </p><p>He was another Eternal agent, his soul space making it clear, making me wonder exactly what his plan was. Not the siege, certainly. </p><p>Probably Oeyne’s presence. </p><p>Well, it was in vain to hope that Oeyne could actually sneak in without being noticed. She was hardly the subtlest person imaginable. I had been hoping that she was someone else with her that could guide her somewhat, but that turned out to be not the case. </p><p>At least, it wasn’t as bad as it could be. I would have been far more afraid before my latest trip … but now, not only do I have the necessary stats to be confident in escaping, but also the Twilight Spark to generate darkness mana as necessary — at least its hiding function. </p><p>However, I still walked around, them, disguised as an ordinary servant, keeping an eye on their discussion. Just because I could escape didn’t mean I wanted a chase. I rather disappear easily. Or at least, understand what was going on. </p><p>So, I watched as he continued to unroll his speech, talking about the direness of their situation and how it was important to allow the second prince to the capital. However, as he spoke, I could see exactly where he was looking. </p><p>Inside the main building, where Oeyne was.</p><p>Their plan wasn’t particularly complicated. They were either aware of Oeyne from the beginning, or noticed her once she started moving toward the capital. However, rather than capturing her, they followed, hoping clearly that she would lead them to Mariel. </p><p>And, since no one tried to contact her, they started acting in a way that hoped to force our hand without revealing their presence. </p><p>A good plan. Too bad they relied on a bunch of wildly inaccurate assumptions.  </p><p>I cast a detection spell, targeting Oeyne’s surroundings. The first thing I noticed was several detection wards around her, ready to catch any kind of magical communication to alert her minders, but they missed one thing. </p><p>They linked their spells to the main ward. It would have been a good idea if they could decipher the tricks buried in it … but with their reliance on the skills, there was no chance for them to understand even a fraction of the structure I had developed together with Helga. </p><p>Just like that, their web of detection fell into my hands, giving me all the information I needed while depriving of them the same. </p><p>While the spy continued to give his speech, I examined Oeyne. She was healthy and moving. She was currently in one of the private forges, crafting an exquisite dagger, far better than anything she could earlier, magic and metal shaping under her will. </p><p>She was utterly relaxed, clearly unaware that she had four Eternal assassins ready to intervene, and a team of twenty not too far away. </p><p>Clearly, after losing Mariel due to their desire to maintain deniability, they were determined not to repeat that mistake. </p><p>I almost pitied them. Their numbers might have represented a challenge before. But right now, on my home turf. </p><p>The speech went on, but I left it behind and moved forward, easily keeping myself hidden both from the curious eyes, and their magical detection methods. Soon, I was in the same room as Oeyne, the sight of her dusky skin covered with sweat as her hammer danced rapidly. </p><p>I wanted to hug her immediately, but before, there were things that needed to be done. </p><p>First, I created a new ward for the room, one that would not only block any curious magical detection spells, but also fake the result to show Oeyne was still alone and forging. I didn’t want to be interrupted. </p><p>Second, I cast a diagnosis spell on her, checking her soul space. Just like I expected, her System was gone, replaced by a new Divine Spark, one that could easily be defined as Forging. She was in the process of bonding with it, but she was still somewhere between the demigod and goddess stages.</p><p>Still, her status was stable, there was no danger … and our privacy was assured. </p><p>A perfect reunion. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“I can’t believe you’re going already, you bastard,” Mariel said. </p><p>“Oh, a month wasn’t enough. A month that we spent wrapped around each other, I might add,” I answered with a chuckle as I kissed her, enjoying her blush.</p><p>“That doesn’t count, it was just to repair the plane and seed it with twilight beings,” she answered with a beautiful blush. </p><p>“Oh, there was seeding alright,” I said, enjoying the crass joke mostly because of her scandalized expression. She was willing to experiment in some really fascinating positions during the month we spent together, but a little low-brow humor was enough to dismiss and unbalance her successfully. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she said even as she blushed. </p><p>“Why don’t you make me,” I said, and she did so by slamming her lips against mine, extending another kiss. One that I had to pull back soon, because it was almost time for the beacons to flare, and I wanted to start traveling as soon as possible. “So, a month wasn’t enough,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Not even close,” she answered. “Not with all the times that you disappeared to visit your elf whore …”</p><p>“Hey, get along well. You need each other to defend yourself successfully in case the wards I set up get breached,” I warned. It wasn’t too much of a surprise that they didn’t get along well, especially since I couldn’t just arrange a threesome to make things fun. They were bound to their own planes, and avatars were poor substitutes for a threesome. </p><p>Luckily, the month wasn’t just a waste. Other than helping the two bond with their planes even stronger, I was also able to break down the artifact the Eternals used to bond the two planes together, enough to replicate its function with a ward before it broke down … though it did cost me quite a bit of purified spark to constantly replenish the mana.  </p><p>As a result, the planes ended up getting locked together, which meant they could support each other in case of an attack. Hopefully, it would be enough, especially since they were well-matched against the undead, and I hoped that they would be able to resist any other attack together.</p><p>More importantly, Mariel was able to build another darkness ward that somehow hid the planes. It was expensive in terms of mana … but considering I had integrated a conversion ward to both planes and given them far more mana than they could otherwise use, that didn’t matter much. </p><p>Of course, leaving some Purified Spark with them was risky. If the Eternals attacked successfully, there was a chance they would be able to acquire some, taking away my strongest advantage. </p><p>All things considered, it was a risk I was willing to take. </p><p>“Now, one last kiss before I leave,” I said, sharing another heated kiss while her naked body rubbed against mine, her wings a blanket around me. </p><p>With that, I teleported, once again into the Primordial Aether. And, since I had already said my goodbyes to Seldanna, I moved away from the shadows of it, waiting for the signal from the beacons. </p><p>As I waited, I looked around, realizing Primordial Aether didn’t feel as chaotic and in comprehensive. It wasn’t exactly like the normal world, still a mixture of a haze and a maze, but this time, trying to find my way felt like trying to remember something while drunk. </p><p>Out of reach, maybe, but along with the realization that, once the mist of alcohol faded, everything would be clear. </p><p>My latest stat increase was certainly convenient. </p><p>With that increased capability, the moment I felt the signal of the beacons, I started moving in that direction … far faster than I had hoped. More importantly, as I traveled, I was able to sense the location of the main material plane. Nothing concrete, just a giant shadow in the mist. </p><p>Enough for me to travel the rest of the way even without the beacons, allowing me to complete the rest of the travel in just two days. </p><p>I was getting more and more comfortable in Primordial Aether … which was enough to give me hope. </p><p>Once I arrived at my destination, I found it surrounded by Elementals once again, each desperate to invade. I was almost sure that their desperation was about the System … but exactly how, I had no idea. </p><p>I wanted to poke that particular point, but unfortunately, I didn’t have too much time. </p><p>With my path familiar, sneaking back into the plane and teleporting across had been easy. My first destination was Silver Spires. From a distance, I could see that Silver Spires had gotten far bigger than I expected. </p><p>With almost ten times people living directly, and nearby, I could see a few new towns under construction. The change was interesting. </p><p>Just not as interesting enough to delay my meeting with Helga. I teleported again…</p><p>“Hello, love,” I said as I appeared behind Helga, hugging her. I didn’t surprise her — I couldn’t, not in her domain — but I still managed to hug her from behind. </p><p>She twisted in my arms until we were face to face, kissing me aggressively. “I missed you, you bastard,” she murmured as she clamped against my lips, not asking a single question as her legs wrapped around my waist. </p><p>And, she was supposed to be the Goddess of Knowledge. </p><p>How amusing. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t make that joke to her, not with her lips doing her best to steal all my attention … and succeeding. I slammed her against the nearest shelf, the books raining on the floor even as I ripped her dress hungrily. </p><p>She didn’t seem to have any problem with that, considering she was repeating the same action on my dress. As she pulled, I absentmindedly noted that she was stronger physically … nowhere near me, but enough to match a mediocre fighter. </p><p>It was good to see that even a conceptual Spark like Knowledge gave her some improvements. It might help her in a dangerous situation. </p><p>More importantly, it would help her be even more active in our private fun times … a fact she realized as well if the way she crouched down in front of me with great enthusiasm was any indicator. </p><p>“Wow, someone is in a hurry,” I commented as I watched her kneel down. </p><p>“Yes, because I can’t keep you for long while there’s a civil war going on,” Helga said. “Five minutes, then you’re going to go to the capital and make sure everything is in order,” she ordered. </p><p>“Oh, I love it when you start ordering. Being a goddess suits you,” I said, enjoying her blush … especially that shy reaction didn’t prevent her from leaning forward to capture my girth between her pouty lips and started giving a blowjob that shocked me with its aggressiveness. </p><p>She pulled back once my shaft hit the entrance of her throat and looked up. “What, I missed you,” she said, somehow still shy enough to be cute even as she returned to the task at hand.</p><p>Her hands planted behind my thighs as she pulled me forward, giving me the best blowjob I had ever got. Passionate and wild, yet still with a pattern. Almost like a dance. </p><p>Suddenly, I smirked. “You used your spark to design everything, like a dance, right?” I declared. </p><p>She said nothing, but the sudden pause and the glowing blush showed that I was very accurate. I didn’t say anything else, just enjoying her aggressive yet elegant blowjob in silence, not ruining her beautiful surprise any further. </p><p>I just looked down, enjoying her beautiful nude body while she did her best to make my shaft disappear completely in her throat, ignoring the temptation to grab her beautiful blonde locks. </p><p>It was her gift. It would be rude to ruin it like that. </p><p>I just stayed in place, enjoying as her head bobbed up and down around my hardness. Her eyes stayed open, locked with mine to give me a treat of their blue depths … depths that shone with supernatural intelligence. </p><p>She soon picked up the pace, taking me even deeper down her throat a few times before she stayed there, wrapping my legs … and gulped, the sudden tightening enough to trigger me. As she choked around my dick, I moaned, filling her throat. </p><p>“So, how was it?” she murmured after she swallowed every last drop and pulled back, then proceeded to trace with her finger to catch any of my seed that may have slipped while she was distracted. </p><p>“You’re a goddess, indeed,” I murmured as I lifted her up, and pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek. “Pity that I have to go to the capital immediately.” </p><p>“Yes, a pity,” she answered while she caressed my chest, then turned and walked away with a very deliberate sway on her hips. </p><p>Even as I fixed my clothes and teleported away, I couldn’t help but imagine just how else she was going to use her spark in the bedroom. Too bad I had a civil war to navigate before I could get that answer. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel}</p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing even as she checked my expression carefully, trying to find something. Exactly what, I had no idea, but I was doing my best to identify that. </p><p>I watched her while she maintained her silence. It was easy to see she was trying to use the interrogation room and the silence to intimidate me. Unfortunately, it didn’t have any chance of working in the first place. </p><p>But, the way her coworker undermined her would have ruined any chance she might had in the first place. It was hard to be scared of someone not respected by their allies, whether it was justified or not. </p><p>“Tell me, why are you here?” was her first question. </p><p>“I’m here to visit my hometown—” I started, but she interrupted. </p><p>“Don’t lie to me. I know you’re one of them. I’m not going to allow you to do however you want,” she said. I couldn’t help but smile as she exploded. She was really beautiful when angry. Her beautiful green eyes were wide, burning with anger and passion, her dangerous expression enough to give me a sense of danger despite everything. </p><p>That change was supported by her aura, her sense of justice burning brightly as she declared it. Whatever she was trying to question, she was genuine. </p><p>“Look, officer. I’m always happy to help a beautiful woman such as you. Why don’t you tell me exactly what are you looking for, and we can see if I can help you?” I said as I put on my most innocent and friendly smile.</p><p>Ultimately, it was more friendly than innocent, but I wasn’t an innocent man. A strong one, maybe even a good one. But definitely not an innocent one in any measure. </p><p>“You think you can trick me. You’re one of them,” she said. Seeing that she reached into her pocket, I said nothing, waiting for her to show me exactly who I was. She pulled a small stack of photos and put them on the table. I couldn’t help but growl in anger as I noticed exactly what the photos were showing. “Are they your friends?” she said. </p><p>“No, they are not,” I said, my voice sharp. She flinched, no doubt surprised by the sudden declaration. I took a deep breath, trying to suppress my anger, but it was difficult. </p><p>I had trouble containing my anger when looking at demonic cultivators. A glimpse of the pictures was enough to see that. They weren’t strong, merely earlier parts of the Essence Gathering stage — or they would have been hiding their features better — but even with that, their presence was enough to give me a crawling sensation. </p><p>They needed to be destroyed.   </p><p>The sect always treated it as a weakness. After all, there was peace going on, and no one wanted to break it, not willing to throw away the lives of the cultivators. Who cared if a few, or several mortal planets had been drained of life. </p><p>My teachers claimed that it was a weakness, a remnant of my mortality that I had yet to abandon. </p><p>I disagreed, especially since the first time I had seen the aftermath of a demonic disciple’s ascension ritual. I took a deep breath, trying to suppress my anger, but it was difficult. </p><p>The fact that they were somehow at my home made me furious. And, when I said home, I wasn’t thinking about just Earth. Some of those photos were from bigger cities — I might not identify which city it was easily, but the skyscrapers in the background were distinct enough — but three of them, I recognized. </p><p>They were at Little Oak … my hometown. </p><p>“Really, they are not your friends? But you recognized them immediately,” she said. </p><p>“Immaterial,” I said, suddenly not in the mood to tease her. Maybe I would deal with her once I found exactly where they were. I picked the lock of the handcuffs, and put it in place. “Do you have any valid reason to arrest me, or am I free to go.” </p><p>“A valid reason. How about recognizing more than two dozen serial killers and mass kidnappers at a glance —” she started, only to freeze. </p><p>It was likely about the footsteps approaching rapidly. She barely stuffed the pictures back into her pocket, her hurry enough to show the importance of her speed.  </p><p>A second later, the cracked door was pushed open, and a man in his fifties stepped inside. He was a tall man, with a large belly, strong for a mortal, with a sharp gaze, which was currently pointed at my arresting officer. “What’s this about, Sophie,” he said. “Don’t tell me that it’s about your crackpot theories. EAM already went through it and confirmed that your methodology was nonsense,” he said, barely paying me a glance. </p><p>“Captain,” she said coldly, too angry to actually give a proper answer, which didn’t surprise me much. Earlier, I had seen just how terrible of a liar she was, and that was when she was looking away from her target, and prepared to lie. With her anger flared, there was no way she could even think of one. </p><p>I decided to help her. After all, she was kind enough to me to alert the presence of demonic cultivators. “I’m sorry, sir. But when I can leave. I had told her that I had no idea who took the wallet, but it wasn’t me.” </p><p>“Wallet, really?” the captain said. “What wallet?” he added as he looked at Sophie, no doubt aware just how poor of a liar she was. </p><p>“The one that she has in her side bag,” I said as I pointed at it. Hopefully, it would help the situation. </p><p>Her eyes widened when she opened the bag, only to find the wallet in question inside. The money was already in my pocket of course, but everything else was there, including the ID. “I had just found a discarded wallet, and I was planning to bring it to the station,” I continued to explain, holding the attention of her captain on me, giving her the time to suppress her shock. </p><p>“I see,” he said, looking convinced. He turned back to her, his expression gleeful. “Really, Sophie. You had evidence in your bag. Where’s your precious chain of custody that you’re always blabbering about,” he said, his tone enough to show just how happy he was to finally have an opportunity to put her down. Then, he continued to chew her right in front of me. </p><p>A calculated disrespect. </p><p>It reminded me of the attitudes of some of my trainers back in the sect, always happier when I failed. After all, it was not right for a disciple to show off their precious pure ones. I looked at her, wondering if she was angry at me for the excuse. </p><p>But, when I caught her gaze, she actually gave me a small nod of appreciation — one that her captain missed, too enthusiastic about his opportunity to make her pay — confirming that she preferred the wrongful chewing over the real reason she dragged me here. </p><p>“Do I need to stay here? Or may I leave?” I interrupted, feeling bored. </p><p>“My apologies, sir,” the captain said, then looked at her. “Have you processed him?” </p><p>“No, sir,” she said. </p><p>“Another sign of your incompetence, but at least this time it’s helpful,” he said before he turned to me. “You are free to leave, sir. And, once again, I apologize for the incompetence of one of my officers. Normally, we run a tighter ship here, but we all have a few bad apples,” he explained. “And, she had been in a spiral since EIM took her precious case.” </p><p>I had a feeling that it was not the kind of information that should have been divulged to a random citizen, but he didn’t seem to mind that part. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I walked away, though I could still able to hear the chewing she was receiving. To my surprise, before I could even leave the station, she started retaliating, with some select insults about his weight, his professionalism, and his general attitude about life. </p><p>I wondered what brought that sudden shift. When I left, she looked determined to accept her chewing and use the wallet thing as an excuse. I shrugged and left the situation. It wasn’t really important. I needed a rat infestation to clear. </p><p>I had no idea how demonic cultivators could be on Earth, but there was no mistaking the subtle signs of damage left by the demonic essence. Though, once I was on the street, I started looking around for something sharp. </p><p>My cultivation wasn’t enough to reach the point of treating everything as a sword, but I wouldn’t need a proper one against a bunch of early-stage Essence Gathering cultivators either. A discarded knife would be enough. </p><p>Once I found that, I had my next challenge. Finding the demonic cultivators. Unfortunately, for that, I had no plan but to walk around until I could sense their presence. </p><p>A formation would have been better, but I was always terrible at building them. Apparently, I lacked the patience required, and the amount of calculations that went into even the simplest of the formations didn’t help. </p><p>However, before I could pick a direction, a familiar voice called for me. “Wait for me!” </p><p>It was my sexy officer … but without her badge and gun. Also, her aura was wavering a bit, which made me feel a sense of loss. Her aura was too fascinating to be left floundering like this. </p><p>I waited for her.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing as the nameless policewoman dragged me away in handcuffs, wondering about my situation. Particularly, how did someone managed to see me stealing the wallet. I had always been a smooth pickpocket — a critical survival skill for a teen with an alcoholic father — and my cultivation only made it easier. </p><p>Yet, somehow, someone managed to see me and called the police. </p><p>I sighed even as the policewoman pushed me out of the pub, wishing that she waited just five more minutes. Leaving that burger actually hurt. </p><p>There were several ways I could have escaped. I could have picked the lock of my handcuffs, broken them, and run. Technically, I could even act like a sect-born and kill everyone in the town for daring to make eye contact … but then, there was a reason that they don’t get any mission for mortal planets. </p><p>Naturally, if I were on a real mission, I would have a contact assigned to me for the sole purpose of handling such events. </p><p>I followed her obediently. I had already gotten rid of the wallet before we left the bar, and I did it the fun way. I was not exactly an expert on fire essence, but burning a small leather wallet wouldn’t have been particularly difficult. </p><p>Instead, I slipped it into the small bag she had on her waist, confident that she wouldn’t check it soon. </p><p>I had no doubt that she would get angry once she discovered it back home, but it would be too late. A decent punishment for ruining my lunch.  </p><p>Before that, without any evidence, she would have no choice but to let me go … and I wouldn’t trigger any kind of man-hunt. Or worse, triggering a red flag that would alert the sect agents to my presence. They would either be servant disciples or outer disciples and, therefore wouldn’t disrespect me. </p><p>But, I didn’t want their attention, period. </p><p>They might be under the impression that they were punishing me, but despite the unexpected hitch I had just hit, it was still my first real holiday. </p><p>I wanted to enjoy it fully. </p><p>Starting from the way her hips moved. </p><p>I would be lying if I said the beauty of the police officer who arrested me played no role in my perfect obedience. She was a good-looking woman, probably in her mid-twenties. Her soft blonde hair contrasted with her sharp demeanor. The reason she had wrapped it in a tight bun was probably the same as her extremely understated makeup, in an effort to look more serious. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, it wasn’t very effective in hiding her beauty. </p><p>“Get in the car,” she said, her voice sharp and threatening, which enhanced her most beautiful feature even further. </p><p>The aura of justice around her. </p><p>For all my weakness to the fairer sex, I was rather selective. Physical beauty was one aspect, but it wasn’t as important as the beauty of the soul. Mortal-style sex was fun, but it was much better when I could open my soul and mingle with them. </p><p>True dual cultivation. </p><p>Of course, it was hard to truly see the soul of someone at a glance. Even for mortals, the soul was a guarded, hidden aspect, impossible to see through at a glance even for the old monsters at the Nascent Soul stage, no matter how much they claimed otherwise. </p><p>Luckily for me, I had a rare ability. I could see auras. </p><p>Aura, at least in its untouched form, was one of the best ways to assess someone’s soul. It was not exactly a pure mirror that reflected the soul, or even a complete representation. It was more of a representation of someone’s dedication and thoughts. Most people had a gray, meandering mess that showed neither effort nor passion, showing that the way they lived wasn’t too different than a leaf in the wind. </p><p>Unfortunately, while seeing auras was a rare ability, it was mostly useless. </p><p>Of course, cultivators, even when they were in the Essence Gathering realm, had the ability to easily disguise and shape their visible presence. A favorite trick for all cultivators, which, unfortunately, also distorted their auras.  </p><p>Cultivators often radiated a sense of purity and ethereal sense, while some preferred more aggressive concepts like bloodlust, sharpness, or harmony. I had a few painful experiences until I learned cultivator auras were not to be trusted. </p><p>It was different for the mortals, particularly ones that weren’t even aware of the existence of auras, making their auras far more trustworthy … though, often far more boring and gray.  </p><p>The sexy police lady who was leading me toward her squad car was one of the rare exceptions. Her aura was rigid and sharp at the same time, tinged with a thick sense of protection and justice. A glance was enough to confirm that being a policewoman was not just a job for her, but a calling. </p><p>I found herself fascinating … enough to forgive her for dragging me away from a burger I had been dreaming for years. </p><p>“Come on, officer, no need to be so rough,” I said, unable to feel amused as she pushed me to the back of the car. She didn’t react to my flirty tone slightest. “Ouch, no reaction. It hurts, officer,” I added. </p><p>To my surprise, it earned an angry glare. Not the kind that indicated I had annoyed her … but the kind that indicated it was only her morals that were holding her back from killing me — a difference I had a lot of practice distinguishing considering my habits. </p><p>I was starting to think that I wasn’t arrested for stealing the wallet of that annoying windbag. </p><p>Curious, I didn’t say anything else as we drove toward the police station. </p><p>When we arrived at the police station, I was surprised by the reaction. Every single police looked toward us with an interesting mixture of disdain and hostility, one that they didn’t even bother concealing. If it wasn’t for my sharp senses, I might have assumed that it was the usual attitude cops showed to a criminal, but I could easily see that I wasn’t the target. </p><p>My escort was. </p><p>“Another arrest, Sophie. Good work. You’re about to break a record. What’s it this time? A traffic violation, or loitering,” another officer said, his disdain thick. “It’s good that you’re keeping busy without your precious case.” </p><p>She didn’t even deign to answer properly, just sent him an angry glare as we passed near. The man flinched, the sharpness of his movement suggesting that there had been a time when his disdain had been punished physically. </p><p>I was starting to like her even more. </p><p>“Why so angry?” he continued, though only when he was out of reach. “It’s not my fault you weren’t good enough to solve your precious case all this time and the captain transferred it to your betters.” She didn’t answer, but from the way she subtly stiffened, it was clear that the insult had been effective.  </p><p>We continued moving, while the man continued to mumble, too soft for her to hear, but not enough for me to miss his mumbling. “Stupid bitch. It’s this attitude that got you kicked out of the FBI. Let’s see how long you will be able to stay around.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought. While the intricacies of American Law Enforcement were not exactly something I was aware of considering I was barely a teenager when I was taken away by the sect, I remembered enough to know that the FBI was far superior to the local police of a small town. </p><p>If it wasn’t for her sharp aura, I might have assumed it was just incompetence, but there was clearly more to the story, one that was tempting to dig deeper. Especially since I had nothing to do.</p><p>Well, one thing. As fascinating as she was, I was still annoyed about not being able to taste that delicious burger. </p><p>Though, there were perks to it as well. Maybe I could convince her to share one with me. </p><p>Before we could take a turn, he suddenly shouted. “Hey, he’s not a part of your stupid case, is it. EIM already took it over, with warnings not to work.” </p><p>I wondered exactly what EIM was that even the mention of them made her shudder in disgust. Unlike the FBI, I didn’t recognize the acronym. But I didn’t ask. </p><p>“No, it’s just a possession case,” she answered, keeping her answer short. Which was good, as she was clearly a terrible liar. The other officer didn’t suspect anything, but only because he was busy muttering about uppity bitches with no respect for their betters. </p><p>Which was an exaggeration at best, but I didn’t care much about it. I was interested in the way her aura flickered when she lied. Her aura, infused thickly with her unique sense of justice, flickered at first, showing just how abhorrent she found the act of lying, followed by solidifying even further. </p><p>Even changing its nature. The change was slight, only noticeable due to my talent, but it was still interesting. I wouldn’t have found it interesting if her sense of justice had weakened … but it just changed slightly. </p><p>Unaware of her coworker’s latest insults … or my intense observation, she continued to drag me toward an interrogation room. “Sit down,” she said. </p><p>“As you wish, officer,” I said, not bothering to hide my smirk as I sat on the chair that she pointed. Interestingly, the one chair she pointed at made it so that she was the one who was looking at the one-way mirror — an interesting little construct, but not enough to prevent me from seeing the other side. The barest of flicker of essence into my eye, and that little mortal illusion was easily bypassed.  </p><p>Not that I actually needed to see through the glass to know that room was empty. Even without focusing, I could feel the presence of every single person in the station. </p><p>Perks of my Foundation Establishment cultivation. My power might have been sealed, but my senses were still sharp. </p><p>I wouldn’t have cared about the seating plan, if it wasn’t for an interesting choice she made. She had left the door of the interrogation room slightly cracked and shifted her own chair slightly. </p><p>Which meant, she could see anyone that could actually enter through the corridor. An interesting choice … though I couldn’t help but wonder why she bothered to drag me to the station rather than interrogating me in her car. </p><p>Though, I couldn’t wait to find out. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but take note of all the changes I could see around me. Things had changed since the late nineties, certainly. For once, everyone was looking at the screens in their hands, which, at first glance, looked like a mixture of a miniature TV and some kind of text-based communication device. </p><p>And, considering the sudden lack of phone boxes around, I guessed that those mini-TVs could also used as a phone. </p><p>Certainly convenient. Not as convenient as the communication crystal that every disciple was assigned — with me being a temporary exception. </p><p>Officially to ensure that I could blend, which was absurd. Even with my cultivation partially sealed, I could still cut a car into two with a kitchen knife —  which I had to, as I didn’t have a sword with me — if I was determined. A little stone that was keyed to my essence would hardly make me easier to detect. </p><p>Especially in a world that was already under complete control of Heavenly Sword Sect. </p><p>Naturally, there would be very few people who would actually know that fact, a small list that I doubted even included the President. </p><p>However, I only doubted rather than knowing, as no one actually bothered to inform me about those details. Of course, if I was here for a real mission, it would have been different. I would have already received a detailed explanation about exactly which groups and organizations were aware of the existence of the supernatural … and more. </p><p>The lack of information or the absence of a communication crystal didn’t bother me. </p><p>The absence of my sword was … a different question. </p><p>Since I had been recruited eighteen years ago, I had never been without my sword. Not in the sect, and not outside the sect. Even when I was in bed … well, entertaining a female guest — or a few, if I was particularly lucky — I never let it drift farther than I could call it with a flick of my wrist. </p><p>A few times I had lapsed, my teachers had admonished me aggressively, repeating many different sayings that could be summarized as my sword was my life, and letting it go was a disgrace. </p><p>It was why I didn’t have one with me. Using the excuse of repairing it after a mission, the sect blacksmiths took it … and Protector Ashira had forgotten to give me a temporary blade. </p><p>Completely accidental, I was certain. </p><p>Yet, I was glad for their so-called punishment. Every single moment of my life, since I had been recruited, was filled with either sword training or cultivation. Well, except for the occasional missions, but considering I still had to destroy demonic cultivators, creatures of the void, heretics, and many other enemies with my sword during these missions, they were a poor substitute for a holiday.  </p><p>Without a sword, in a world where nothing could truly threaten me, I felt free. </p><p>No money, no residence, no proof of education, and no friend … with no idea how long I had to stay before the council finally decided to forgive me. </p><p>If they forgave me at all. Admittedly, I wasn’t sure if I wouldn’t prefer for them to forget my presence and let me enjoy the rest of my life — which, I had about two hundred years thanks to my cultivation. </p><p>What a dilemma. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I walked, ignoring the suspicious gazes of the people around me. Understandable, as I had been wearing a horrible mismatch of a bright-colored Hawaiian shirt, ripped jeans, and shiny leather shoes. </p><p>Add in my long black hair that reached to my waist, and the suspicious gazes made sense. </p><p>I might have been away from Earth for two decades, but that didn’t mean I lost my senses enough to know just how absurd I looked. But with the urgency of my ‘mission’, I didn’t have time to work with a tailor, leaving me to pick the best from the storage. It was either that, or some kind of weird white suit from the seventies. </p><p>As for cutting my hair to blend better … that was not even a question. </p><p>I wanted to go to a thrift store and buy some clothes, but that was for the latter. First, I needed to find a burger. </p><p>I might be back in my hometown, but it had been almost two decades, and Little Oak was unrecognizable other than some general lines. It was hard to expect anything to stay the same. Even with the memory of a cultivator, I had trouble seeing anything familiar. </p><p>That didn’t stop me from taking a turn toward the more familiar parts of the town, where my childhood home was. It was gone, replaced by a garish motel, though it didn’t bother me much. It had stopped being a home before my recruitment. Once my mother was dead, and my father lost himself in the bottle completely, it stopped being home and turned into some kind of dormitory. </p><p>The supermarket that had been built on the empty yard where we often played as children hurt was far more devastating. It was one of the few places that remembered fondly, without pain — well, metaphorical kind, as I had broken my bones on four different occasions while playing there. </p><p>The only other place I could remember fondly was the Single Barrel Pub, which was ironic considering my father’s habits, but the old man who owned the pub had been banned from the place for some reason, making it a beautiful haven for me. </p><p>Especially since we had a nice little deal. I washed the dishes, and he allowed me to do my homework in the corner as I enjoyed one of his famous burgers. I </p><p>Oh, how I wished for it. I could almost smell it before I even turned the corner. But, I felt my feet turn to lead even as I approached, knowing that once I took that turn, I would find it gone, replaced with some kind of ugly franchise. </p><p>It was scarier than facing a twenty-feet demon with more teeth than skin. </p><p>Yet, once I turned, I met with a welcome surprise. A faded green door, with a little board with a faded name. </p><p>Single Barrel Pub. </p><p>I couldn’t help but walk toward it with quick steps. I didn’t have any money, but it was easily resolved. As I approached toward the door, I passed near a man in a suit who was busy catcalling a passing woman. One accidental collision later, I was a wallet richer. </p><p>Cosmic justice. </p><p>Then, I stepped into the pub. </p><p>It was a blast from the past … or it would have been, if I saw the old man on the counter rather than a man in his fifties. There were no TVs inside, just several old barrels that were used as tables, following the theme. The old jukebox was still in the corner, and considering the song that was playing, it hadn’t been updated since my childhood. </p><p>I continued examining the place, turning my attention to the walls, bare except for a single violin that the old man occasionally played whenever the mood struck him. </p><p>I walked to one of the tables, not asking whether the old man played it whenever the mood struck still  … afraid of the answer it would lead to. For the moment, I was happy to relive one untainted memory of my childhood. </p><p>Before I could even take a seat, the bartender gestured toward me. “How can I help you?” </p><p>“A double bacon burger, extra fries, and the biggest chocolate milkshake you have,” I asked. </p><p>He didn’t say anything, but looked at me with a careful gaze. “That would be thirty-six dollars,” he said, his tone reluctant.  </p><p>I would have been angry, but considering the way I dressed, I couldn’t exactly blame him for having doubts. Luckily, I came prepared. I pulled a hundred from the wallet and passed it to him. “Keep the change.  Just make it quick,” I said as I passed the bill to him. </p><p>He didn’t look as excited as I had been expecting at the prospect of the tip, though he was enough to keep his swearing to an inaudible whisper. </p><p>Well, what he thought to be inaudible. I still heard him, but it was hardly fair for him to predict my enhanced hearing. </p><p>Instead, I found myself wondering what a hipster was, and why the bartender was afraid of an infection of them… I didn’t bother with it much, but closed my eyes, enjoying the crackling voice of the jukebox as it played a familiar song. </p><p>For this moment, I was a child, with no concern other than homework. No demons, no cultivation, no other planets, no annoying council. </p><p>Certainly no swords. </p><p>I kept my eyes closed even as I heard footsteps getting closer. A woman, I recognized from the sound, wearing short heels, thought the strength of her steps betrayed some kind of martial training. Ranged, based on the subtle hint of fleeting movement I could pick.  </p><p>I suspected a crossbow, but it could also be a longbow. It was definitely not guns.  </p><p>I could have discerned the exact weapon if I paid more attention to it even without opening my eyes, but I did not. I was far more occupied by the delicious smell of the burger. Somehow, it smelt even better than my memories suggested. </p><p>“Enjoy,” the waitress said as she dropped the plate in front of me. Her voice felt familiar, but I was too occupied with the impending feast to think about it. I opened my eyes, and feasted upon the familiar shape. A thick slab of meat oily enough to clog my arteries, enough condiment to create a mess no matter the familiarity, and a tall glass of milkshake made of real ice cream. </p><p>Just like I remembered. </p><p>Lost in the anticipation, I didn’t care about the footsteps approaching from behind, even if they belonged to someone who was carrying two guns. Someone that felt self-assured, but not cocky. Add in the subtle aura of justice I could feel, I easily guessed law enforcement. </p><p>I was determined not to care other than a general passive register, but she stopped next to me. </p><p>“You’re under arrest. Raise your hands and come with me,” she called. </p><p>I was tempted to do something I disapproved of intensely, but I still remembered the rules of the pub, one of them never starting a fight inside. </p><p>I doubted the old man would appreciate it if I started a fight against a policewoman. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As a sword cultivator who was barely thirty years old, I had a simple perspective in life, as one happened to develop when they had been trained non-stop since childhood — except the few rare times I managed to slip away despite the punishment — just because I was fated with the Path of the Sword — with capital letters. </p><p>I liked beautiful ladies, I didn’t enjoy fighting … and I hated when people pointed any kind of weapon at me. </p><p>This was why I had mixed feelings as one of the most beautiful women I had ever laid my eyes upon pointed her sword at me, especially since her angry expression was making her even more beautiful. Too bad she was wearing a shapeless, loose robe rather than anything more form-fitting. </p><p>Which was a pity, as, with the portal of light glowing behind her to alight her purple hair, she would have looked amazing in a skirt and blouse. </p><p>I needed therapy. </p><p>Too bad cultivation sects didn’t believe in such things. Admittedly, I only knew such a thing existed because of a few jokes. It wasn’t like the people who raised me believed in therapy anymore. </p><p>“You’re lucky that young mistress had vouched for you, dog, or I would have cut you in pieces. But it’s a fitting fate for you to rot in this mortal world.” </p><p>“I thought my mission was to guard the dimension in case of a demonic incursion, Protector Ashira,” I said as I stood up, not bothering to hide my sarcasm even as I patted my mismatched outfit. Was teasing her like this smart? </p><p>Considering she was far stronger than me even at my best, certainly not. </p><p>I was a mere inner disciple, and she was one of the Protectors of Heavenly Sword Sect, one of the rare martial cultivators of the Golden Core realm that was tasked to follow the orders of the council. Mocking her was a terrible idea even under the best of circumstances. Let alone now, the first day of my ‘mission’ — which was exile all but in name. </p><p>Well, it wouldn’t be the first time my tongue put me in trouble.</p><p>I was lucky that my exile was a compromise, and she couldn’t punish me for a bit of teasing.  </p><p>Still, my sentiment about my tongue was shared by my escort, if her next move was any indicator. She raised her blade and pressed it against my throat. “Maybe I should cut your tongue. Imagine how good of a cultivator you would be if your tongue didn’t constantly put you in trouble.” </p><p>That was a warning to stop talking. A good warning, even. Unfortunately, after the last few days I had, I was too frustrated to take that very reasonable advice. “It’s not like that’s the body part that puts me in the most trouble,” I said, only for her sword to dip into my midsection. </p><p>“That would have been even easier to get rid of,” she said angrily. </p><p>Another warning to stop talking. This time, an even better one. I should have stayed silent. I really did. “What would your young mistress say if you remove her favorite toy —” I quipped instead … one that was interrupted by a backhanded slap as I found myself flying backward.  </p><p>I hit against a wall … and shattered it, pain hitting me hard. Still, this was her holding back. If she used her full power, even without the seal, I would have ended up dead. </p><p>Even for a genius, the difference between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core was no joke. </p><p>I forced myself to stand up, which was hard. It had been a while since I had felt such intense pain, which was the inconvenience of being sealed. The seal had pushed my Foundation Establishment cultivation back to the Essence Gathering stage. </p><p>One of the rules of the council, limiting the displays of powers in the mortal world. </p><p>I took a deep breath, doing my best to ignore my anger. It was one of the skills I had to develop back when I was still an outer disciple, though my track record was spotty at best. For all the rules the sect had, the implicit rule had always been the dominion of the strong. They might not just come out and kill a young disciple for disrespect … but they had hundreds of methods to take revenge. </p><p>Thanks to my tongue, I had experienced, and continued to experience, quite a bit of them. </p><p>My exile came from another mistake … this time, not even my fault. I had joined a fun mission to destroy a void-caller base, and during the mission, I flirted with a beautiful but mysterious disciple I never met before. She responded, and we had some fun times together on the way back. </p><p>Only when I returned to the sect, and one of my rivals gleefully announced to the sect that I had defiled the granddaughter of a council elder, I learned exactly why I was unfamiliar with her. </p><p>I felt resentful … but also glad. I had heard that she had to threaten her grandparents to take the execution of the table. I still ended up with a mission that was even disdained by servant disciples, ending up effectively exiled, officially assigned to a secret mission that was directly assigned by the council, bypassing all the official channels.</p><p>My idiot rival who decided to reveal the event to the rest of the sect as a method to attack me wasn’t that lucky. Some cultivators, especially the sect-born ones — the pure ones, they called themselves — were stupid enough to shock me. </p><p>How did he expect, I had no idea. </p><p>“Maybe you should learn to keep your mouth, Blake. Or you might end up squashed under one of these metal carts. I heard it’s a common way to die,” she said as she threw a small linen bag at me. I caught it. My little care package.</p><p>“I wouldn’t do that and leave you bereft of the satisfaction of beheading me, Protector Ashira,” I said, unable to resist throwing one last quip. </p><p>I had a problem. </p><p>However, this time, it didn’t work as I intended. “I take that as a promise, disciple. See that you don’t,” she said, her big smile genuine as she clearly imagined doing exactly that. “When you get bored of living, just break the seal. I’ll happily make the trip through the void again just for the pleasure.” </p><p>With that, she turned and left, leaving me alone with my exile, disguised as a mission. </p><p>Yet, despite the pain and the frustration, I couldn’t help but smile even as I looked around. “Home sweet home,” I said as I examined my immediate surroundings. A dirty, abandoned alley that was already a mess before the Protector used me as a projectile weapon to shatter a wall, housing a smelly metal dumpster. </p><p>Not the most pleasant locations. Probably an intentional slight, the greatest insult she could deliver without angering her young mistress. That, and deliberately leaving me alone without arranging any kind of safe house. </p><p>A quick check showed that the linen bag only included a birth certificate and a driver’s license, and nothing else. No prearranged residence, no money, no contacts and addresses for emergencies. Just some official identity documents, and nothing more, showing they were petty enough to make my so-called mission as problematic as possible. </p><p>Still, it didn’t matter. </p><p>I was back on Earth. </p><p>And, not just a random place, but Little Oak, a random town in the middle of America. </p><p>My hometown, the place I hadn’t seen since I had been ‘recruited’ almost two decades ago, never to step back again due to the strict sect rules… </p><p>“It’s good to be back,” I murmured as I stepped out of the alley. </p><p>I had a lot of things to do … starting from eating the cheapest, the most disgusting burger, maybe even a milkshake. </p><p>Despite everything, I was in a mood to celebrate. They might think that leaving me Earth, where the spiritual essence thin enough that it might not exist, with my cultivation partially sealed, was a punishment… </p><p>For me, it was a holiday. </p><p>First real holiday since I was twelve.</p>",

    "title": "Darion's Office 38",
    "content": "<p>Mia wasn’t feeling well as she rushed to her office first thing in the morning, having already sent a message to Darion, informing him that they needed to have a meeting. </p><p>The reason, was a message from a friend, sending a picture of Darion walking into Gina’s club the last night … which was a big problem.  </p><p>Mia had no intention of losing him to her rival … and not just because he was critical of the deal. Of course, the long voicemail she had left for him early in the morning didn’t say that, but instead threatened him with a lot of things if he dared to betray her for Gina. </p><p>Admittedly, not her finest hour … but, to her defense, she did get a touch competitive whenever that whore Gina was involved. She regretted the personal insults quickly, which was why she followed with another message, one that promised to make it up for him … as long as he hadn’t actually sold him to Gina, of course. </p><p>It was why she was currently wearing a tiny skirt. Not the usual way she dressed, as she always thought skirts harmed the authority she could radiate during a business encounter, but under the circumstances, she decided that a little weakness wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>Then, she opened the door … and all those thoughts flew away. She was unable to believe what was going on. Her secretary was on Darion’s lap, her lack of underwear as distinctive as her hair, jumping up and down. </p><p>“What’s going on here!” she gasped in shock as she dashed forward, unable to contain her anger. </p><p>She noticed Jenny freezing as she shouted, which was nice. She had always believed that fear was the best motivator. </p><p>“Calm down, sweetie. I know for a fact I don’t need to explain what’s going on here.” </p><p>Mia couldn’t help but freeze at the lazy response, especially when he continued to bounce Jenny on his lap. She expected a lot of things as she rushed in with her anger on display, but a careless dismissal was not one of them. “Really, that’s all you have to say,” Mia said, doing her best to sound disapproving … but even as she said that, she knew it wouldn’t work. </p><p>Darion looked at her with amusement, showing that her words were even less effective than she expected. “Really, boss. That’s the best you can come up with,” he chuckled. Worse, she could hear Jenny chuckling with him as well. </p><p>She tried to come up with something better … but she failed it. She couldn’t threaten him with breaking up, as they were not dating. She couldn’t threaten to fire him, as he could just go to Gina and get a new job…</p><p>She was not used to being on the back foot, but she realized it was starting to become a pattern with Darion. First the deal, then the way he handled Paisley … and now this. </p><p>She didn’t know what to say. </p><p>Even worse, Darion didn’t wait for her to come up with anything. He just stood up, lifting Jenny like she weighed nothing — Mia did her best to ignore the way she shivered at his display of strength, even as he walked around, giving her a better view. </p><p>However, while she tried to suppress her own reaction, she did nothing else, and ended up right next to them. “Come on, Jenny. You don’t have to keep your moans low. Show your boss just how much you like it.” </p><p>“She wouldn’t dare—“ Mia started. </p><p>“Yes, Darion, fuck me harder!” Jenny interrupted Mia. A rebellion, Mia realized, but she was too confused to know exactly how to react, and ended up watching them as Jenny started shivering.  </p><p>It was not how she envisioned the morning to go. </p><p>Darion took a step toward her once he deposited Jenny against her desk. Jenny wasn’t naked … but considering the only thing she wore was a jacket with its front fully open, she took a shockingly provocative pose — even considering what they had been doing when she caught them — which didn’t help any. </p><p>“So, Mia. You asked for a meeting, what was that about.” </p><p>“Really, that’s what you want to talk about. After I caught you defiling my office. I can’t believe you. We can have the meeting once I calm down.” </p><p>“Good, let me help,” he said, and Mia didn’t have any time to react before he took a step forward … and, just like that, she was silenced. She wanted to push him away out of pure spite, but as his tongue invaded her mouth, she felt that determination to drain quickly. </p><p>After all, she still needed to keep him happy, and it wasn’t like a threesome with him was boring. On the contrary. </p><p>She let her body relax, abandoning herself to the pleasure. From the corner of her eye, she could see Jenny getting rid of her jacket. Mia wanted to admonish her for making assumptions, but she didn’t do so. Not only her lips were still occupied, but also she was rather happy to let Darion get rid of her jacket. Hardy the time to take a stance. </p><p>“Much better,” Darion said as he flipped her to the other side, and his fingers landed on her chest, playing with her nipples slowly but efficiently. She couldn’t help but shiver. </p><p>“Do you need help, boss,” Janet interrupted, which was frustrating. The threesome was fun, but not when it started giving her employees ideas. </p><p>“No—“ she tried to say, but Darion interrupted her by twisting her nipples. </p><p>“Go ahead. She needs it,” Darion commented, making Mia freeze. </p><p>“If you think I’m going to let my slut of an employee treat herself as an equal —“ Mia started, only to be interrupted once more. </p><p>“Janet, just like we talked, sweetie. You need to learn how to stand up for yourself…” </p><p>And, before she could even understand what was going on, Mia found herself on the floor, trapped by Janet’s legs. She was unable to say anything when Janet pulled her hair, making it hurt. </p><p>Just like that, Mia realized what was going on. It was just like the night with Paisley … but this time, she was the evil boss. </p><p>Darion’s smile showed that he was very much aware of the comparison, and enjoyed it immensely. </p><p>“Excellent. Now, the next step,” he said. “If you don’t mind, of course,” he added, looking at her. </p><p>Mia couldn’t help but shiver, but she still nodded … and Janet dragged her to lick her while pulling her hair. </p><p>She was already planning how to make both of them pay once the deal with Paisley was over. And, until then, she could always enjoy it.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I know that, recently, you're a bit fed up with the constant changes I had been making on my Patreon, which is understandable.</p><p>However, this time, it's a nice one. I promise.</p><p>First, the polls. Since there's no 2$ tier anymore, the preference poll is no more.</p><p>Instead, I will have three polls, with guaranteed updates based on scores.</p><p><strong>Focus poll - 5$ tier: </strong>3 guaranteed chapters for the winner, 1 chapters for the runner up.</p><p><strong>Spotlight poll - 10$ tier: </strong>3 guaranteed chapters for the winner, 1 chapters for the runner up,</p><p><strong>Super poll - 25$ tier: </strong>3 guaranteed chapters for the winner, 1 chapters for the runner up, and 1 guaranteed chapter for the third.</p><p><strong>(Ties are determined by me, and the poll numbers are for the stories available for all patrons. For the moment, the visual stories and Villainous perks are not a part of it. )</strong></p><p>Additionally, I have decided to make some changes to my posting content. First of all, my current commitment (4 chapters for all Patrons, 2 chapters extra for 10$ tier, and 2 visual-supported stories for 10$ - with early access to 25$ tier) is going to stay. <em>I will even try to post 5 public stories and 3 chapters for some weeks, but that will be a bonus if I can manage it, but absolutely no promises about that yet. I need to try and see if I can handle it.</em></p><p><strong>In addition to that, i had started writing an a harem cultivation story that I enjoying quite a bit. I will be publishing a SFW wersion of that story on Royalroad. In Patreon, I will have advance chapters for that story (probably something like 10 chapters) + some NSFW chapters. However, please note that this story wouldn't be as dense in erotic content.</strong></p><p><strong>I will be aiming for three chapters each week for that story, and more importantly, I WON'T BE COUNTING ITS CHAPTERS TO MY GENERAL COMMMITTMENT. SO, ASSUMING i DON'T SCREW IT UP, WE'LL HAVE 10+ CHAPTERS EVERY WEEK.</strong></p><p><strong>I hope you guys are happy with those changes.</strong></p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite my fatalistic perspective, I examined the briefcase for a moment while I overcharged my power for a second — at the cost of that stabbing headache returning — to make sure there was no bomb or listening device. </p><p>Not that I expected either. They looked too professional to make such an amateurish move, especially when they were convinced that I was working for a mysterious villain that gave me enough confidence to threaten their organization without fear. </p><p>After making sure, I grabbed the briefcase and walked in. “Come to my office,” I ordered her. “I need my secretary.” She stood up, but rather than following me, she started walking upstairs. “Where are you going, follow me,” I ordered. </p><p>“To wear my uniform,” she whispered confused, but I could also hear a hint of disappointment in her tone. </p><p>“No need. You’re already overdressed for a private meeting,” I said. I walked, and she followed, her disappointment replaced by another dose of excitement. I said nothing else until I sat behind my desk — making a note to replace the furniture at the first possible opportunity — while Tara stayed on her feet, her hands crossed. </p><p>She looked more like a misbehaving student who received a detention than a secretary, but that didn’t matter much. She would learn. </p><p>“Now, let’s see what our new friends sent me as an apology to me,” I said, wanting to use the opportunity to impress Tara a bit. After all, the higher they paid to apologize to me, the more it would underline my power. </p><p>And I didn’t want to miss such an easy opportunity to score a victory on Tara. Not that it was needed, but there was no harm in adding some extra. </p><p>As for fearing whether they actually didn’t send enough to be impressive, it wasn’t even a concern. I recognized the brand of the briefcase — and my power confirmed it as a genuine one rather than a counterfeit.  </p><p>The briefcase alone could probably buy my bar outright.  </p><p>I finally opened the briefcase, and Tara gasped in shock. I wanted to admonish her for reacting excessively, but that would be unfair considering how much my eyes widened as I took in the contents. </p><p>Two million in cash, a glance enough to confirm it as genuine, and a small line at the side with a line of gold bullion that was probably worth half a million. </p><p>Hell of an apology. </p><p>I still managed to maintain a presence of mind to examine the inside of the briefcase for anything out of order — not that I expected any, as it would ruin the whole point of an apology, and if they wanted to test me, they would have done so in a different manner — like listening devices or other bugs, my power once again a lifesaver in removing such concerns. </p><p>Slowly, I was warming up to my power. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said loudly to Tara. “Now, why don’t you put them in the safe,” I said as I pointed to the small, rundown box that came with the office. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Tara said, excited, but it wasn’t the money that excited her, but the trust I showed her by letting her handle the money. </p><p>I barely held back a chuckle. Like that mattered. If she actually decided to take the money, there was not a thing I could do to actually stop her. She circled around the desk, grabbed the briefcase, and bent forward, letting me enjoy the view of her plump ass straining her panties to the limit as she filled the safe. </p><p>I appreciated that. It made a nice contrast to all the other worrying thoughts, thoughts like just how rich and strong was this organization I didn’t even recognize to send such an amount as an apology.</p><p>Not just an apology, I suddenly realized. It was also a warning, reminding me that they were rich enough to throw around this much as an apology, and could spend much more for a fight. </p><p>Worse, I couldn’t even adjust my attitude toward them based on their signals, as the whole sense of power I managed to establish over them was based on the bluff that I knew everything about them … including the favorite cocktail of their negotiator. </p><p>And, I could hardly change my attitude just because their power seemed to be much higher than an organization that should be caring about the abandoned outskirts of the town.  </p><p>As Tara wiggled her ass, I decided to abandon those thoughts and focus on what was in front of me. I had made a decision, and it was too late to change it. I had to live with it. </p><p>“You’re overdressed, let’s fix it,” I said to Tara as I pushed down her panties. She stopped her work as she braced herself for some fun, but received a spank instead. Well, not something she hated, considering her moan. “Did I tell you to stop working?” I still said, my voice was sharp and domineering, working wonders on her already growing arousal. </p><p>“I’m sorry, s-sir,” she answered, her voice trembling as my fingers brushed against her wetness. </p><p>“Do better next time,” I ordered even as my fingers slipped inside her, making her fingers slip and one of the gold bullions fall on the floor. “Careful,” I said as I spanked her ass. Not that the fall mattered, I just used it as an excuse. </p><p>A delicious whimper escaped her mouth, showing she enjoyed it just as much. But still, the pleasure was not enough to make her fail intentionally. She carefully placed another bullion in the safe, stacking them carefully.</p><p>I pushed down my pants once again, my raging boner too uncomfortable as it hardened with her whimpers and moans. And, I would be lying if the fact that she was handling more money than I had ever seen in my life in my orders didn’t do a lot for me. </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said as I patted her ass again, but this time, I pulled away my fingers and replaced them with something thicker. </p><p>She let out a guttural moan that echoed in the room, one that was enough to erase every single concern I had, from the risks I was facing to the ways I could use my newfound wealth. </p><p>I just focused on invading her beautiful wetness once more, enjoying the way she tightened around me as much as I enjoyed her determination to continue with her task. I pushed deeper inside even as I cupped her tight ass aggressively, using her cheeks as the perfect hold as I let loose. </p><p>I didn’t play around with playful tricks like usual, instead invading her mercilessly as I ravished her. The sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room as I sank inside her mercilessly. She struggled to stay in her place, making it a challenging pose to maintain. </p><p>I shifted my hands slightly, invading her deeper and deeper into her core, enjoying her beautiful moans rising in the process. “So … big,” she moaned as I went more than halfway, enjoying the tremor that rose in response. </p><p>In response, I sank even deeper, the wave of pleasure forcing her to hold against the desk, the wood crackling under her pressure. She lost her ability to hold back her moans, making me glad that we had no customers to care about. </p><p>Allowing me to abandon everything and focus on my pleasure. I impaled her again and again, enjoying the strains of her moans as I drilled her. She did her best to continue to work as I invaded her, but her fingers trembled worse as her moans got louder, her beautiful face twisting to signal her upcoming orgasm. </p><p>In a different situation, I might have slowed down, keeping her on the edge to play, but under the circumstances, I did nothing else. I was still feeling unbalanced after the tense encounter, and I rather focus on our pure pleasure than anything else. </p><p>I grabbed her hips and lifted her, her immense supernatural power not making her any heavier, allowing me to use her like she was a toy. </p><p>Her moans showed just how much she enjoyed that dismissive treatment. As I raised her, she lost her ability to reach the safe that was on the side of the desk, which left her with two bundles of money in hand.  </p><p>I impaled her even harder, her moans rose unbidden, echoing in my office. I filled her just as she climaxed, momentarily losing control of her hands … and a twitch sent the money in her hand flying around, their fragile bonds snapping in the process. </p><p>I might have admonished her, but as her moans exploded, I found it difficult to do. Especially since, the sight of my floor covered in hundreds looked nice. Garish and boorish, but certainly nice, especially when combined with her moans. </p><p>For all the trouble it brought along, it was hard to ignore that success had brought a unique kind of allure with it. Rich, strong, virile, and currently filling the insides of a beautiful heroine that was slowly being corrupted. </p><p>Altogether, for all the challenges it brought with it, it was hard to argue that the life I had accidentally stumbled on was amazing. </p><p>Dangerous, but amazing. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I took a deep breath after my uninvited guest left, and finally loosened my desperate trembling. </p><p>I had just bluffed a man who was so far above me that it wasn’t even funny. One mistake, and even with Tara’s powers, we were dead. The stress was unimaginable, and the horrible headache that followed my power overcharging didn’t help. </p><p>I wished that I discovered it before. That way, maybe I could have discovered that the warehouse didn’t belong to the Slasher, but he was just the cover for it. </p><p>If I knew that, I would have definitely moved away and chosen to fight Slasher directly. Fighting a minor villain was troubling, but nowhere as troubling as suddenly having the attention of a major one. </p><p>I had no problem believing that they would dig my past … but that, I didn’t fear too much. If there was one good thing about the constant hero and villain battle, it was the constant destruction of government property. No record was entirely complete, and it was too easy to fake information. </p><p>Especially for forces at the scale I had implied to be working. I watched him on the cameras around the street, walking away calmly, accompanied by his bodyguards, but only truly lost my immediate concerns when I saw the other team pulling with him. </p><p>One problem, gone. </p><p>Just hundreds left. </p><p>I sighed as I turned toward the shelf, and pulled my most expensive gin, pouring myself some before mixing it with some tonic. Three pieces of ice, and I had myself a perfect drink to enjoy, which had the added benefit of hiding my expression from Tara. </p><p>I didn’t want her to see my pained wince. </p><p>Overcharging my power was useful, but not free. </p><p>The drink worked against the pain as I drained it quickly, but I didn’t reach for another. As a bartender, I have seen many people from different walks of life ruining their future once they leaned on alcohol to combat stress or pain. </p><p>Two affliction I had been suffering right now. I didn’t want to add alcoholism to the mix to complicate my life even further. </p><p>Luckily, drinking wasn’t the only way to fight against headaches. </p><p>“Lock the door and come here,” I ordered Tara, who was more than happy to stand up — clear even with her outfit — and do so, doing her best to walk rather than run to hide it, and failing spectacularly. </p><p>“Get rid of that annoying outfit,” I ordered, and she did so, happy to get rid of her costume even more than me. Helmet and gloves went first, showing her pretty face. She was calmer than I expected, which surprised me for a moment…</p><p>Then it clicked. For Tara, the only challenge in the event was the presence of the bodyguards, which had been removed quickly. She saw no risk in the discussion itself, unaware just how many times we had flirted with annihilation. </p><p>I thought about explaining, but then I decided against it. It would make her more paranoid, but wouldn’t help. Actually, it might even be more problematic if she tried to act on her limited knowledge. No, it was far better to not bother with such concerns. </p><p>Instead of bothering with the past, I focused on the present, watching her as she tried to control her rising excitement as she removed her shirt, her deep breaths doing wonderful things to her bosom … her bosom that was finally clad in a bra that was worthy of their perfection. White, lacy, and just low enough to give a hint of her areolas.</p><p>Almost as beautiful as her matching panties, revealed as she kicked off her pants and boots, removing any signs of her drab and boring costume — intentionally so — to reveal her incredible beauty instead. </p><p>She paused for a moment as she leaned against the bar, her pose begging me to run around the bar and take her there. Instead, I gave her an order, sharp and measured. “Come here!” </p><p>The order hit her like a whip, and her body reacted. Her breathing finally got out of control, her pupils dilated, and her nipples got erect enough to threaten her new bra. She tensed, ready to jump over the bar. </p><p>“Walk around, slowly, just like I taught you,” I said, deliberately extending the show. I might have changed my mind about making her a waitress, but there was no harm in her practicing her sexy walk nonetheless. </p><p>After all, it was an important skill for a secretary as well. </p><p>“Y-yes, sir,” she whispered, her voice trembling as she followed my request, her hips swaying with each step as she pushed forward, earning my attention, struggling to control her rush of arousal, the order working to awaken her submissive tendencies even further.  </p><p>Beautiful. </p><p>She walked slowly, almost lingering, her hips moving with a pace that would rival a model — her power helping her to learn faster. I ignored the strategic implications for once as I focused on the erotic dance of her hips, each slow step tempting me to change that order.  </p><p>I did not. Not just because constantly giving contradictory orders would develop a habit of second-guessing in her, but also because I didn’t want to ruin the mood. Her approach was like a delicious wine, and hurrying her up would ruin the taste a bit. </p><p>Her arousal needed to climb up a bit more, just like a wine needed to breathe after opening. </p><p>She was trembling with anticipation as she stood in front of me, her hands to the side, making no moves to hide her beauty. I raised my finger, caressing her cheek, and she whimpered. “You did good during the mission,” I said. </p><p>She whimpered again, this time even louder. “T-thank you, sir—” she said, which died halfway by yet another helpless sound as I caressed her neck, her arousal already near the edge, making me wonder whether I could make her cum without touching. </p><p>But, my pants were already raging. “On your knees,” I ordered. </p><p>In her excitement, she hit hard enough to actually crack the floor, her own powers protecting her knees. I thought about warning her, but I decided to let it go for once. </p><p>“Now, the belt,” I ordered, and she reached with her trembling fingers, unbuckling it slowly and carefully, afraid of ripping, showing she also realized her earlier mistake. She was learning to better control her power every day … but I was still happy with my power warning me about the dangers of approaching her from a bad angle or anything else. </p><p>Her lips parted open widely the moment my shaft was revealed, not even waiting for my order as she took half of it into her mouth, her arousal enough to make her commit minor disobedience. </p><p>I didn’t comment on that, letting her enjoy the rewards of her excellent work. Even though she didn’t do anything more than kick an arrogant man out — which was an insult to her powers to actually say that was a challenge — her silent presence was the key to my victory, earning her some leeway. </p><p>As she pushed herself forward, taking more of my length despite her struggle, I wrapped my hands around her hair, but didn’t push, instead enjoying the moment. I was honest with myself to admit that, my pleasure was only partially about her beautiful lips doing their best to milk me and the incredible heat of her lips. </p><p>It wasn’t that they were boring, as they were spectacular, but the mental pleasure I got from the fact that she had the power to destroy me completely yet responded to my orders immediately was equally fun. With everything going on in my life — before opening the bar, and certainly after opening it —  I felt weak, and out of control. </p><p>The ability to order her around finally gave me a sense of control, elevating my pleasure to the next level. And, control, I had, even as she moved back and forth with all her boundless passion, her hair getting as messy as her makeup. </p><p>“Take it all,” I ordered, and she pushed immediately. I grabbed her head, changing the pace as I invaded her throat aggressively, her power not giving her immunity to gagging while I did my best to push for more. </p><p>The reason, is another movement on the cameras. A man wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase. He wasn’t a super, and he wasn’t tense like a man that carrying a bomb, implying that he was carrying the last-minute money I had demanded from my visitor. </p><p>I didn’t want to deal with it while sporting a raging boner, so I quickened my invasion, her gags doing wonders to bring me to an explosion until I painted her throat with my seed. </p><p>Just in time, the courier knocked on the door once before he left the briefcase there and walked away. </p><p>“Just wait here,” I said as I walked, not fearing an ambush or a trap. I trusted what my power told me about the old man and his intentions … if that was wrong, I would have bigger problems than a bomb hidden in a briefcase.</p><p>The new life I found myself in was … troubling. </p>",

    "title": "Dominating the Boss 47",
    "content": "<p>While Dorothy did her best to act like a sleazy boss doing her best to molest her employees, Destiny decided that being neglected was not acceptable. “No need to make a girl feel neglected,” she said as she pulled me into her bosom once more. </p><p>An amazing hug, one that I considered riding until the song ended, giving Dorothy a chance to feel shy once more. I was sure that she had been encouraged by her success of getting me alone — well, discounting Destiny, but it was far easier to ignore a professional naked dancer — and I wanted her to give me a chance to calm down. </p><p>Maybe even reawaken her shyness in the process. I brought my hand along Destiny’s side, one that she ignored as a casual touch for a moment. Maybe even cowardly, considering her state of nudity, but whatever she thought, it didn’t last for long. </p><p>It was the benefit of having an escort as a great friend — along with all the benefits she gave in a professional role. Elena had taught me a lot about how the perception of the professionals differed when it came to bodily pleasure. The more obvious locations had always been overstimulated, at the cost of neglecting some abandoned spots. </p><p>So, while Destiny continued to keep my head in her bosom while she gave me a very dedicated lap dance,  my fingers danced across her back and sides, occasionally dipping down to her thighs, exploring the undiscovered secrets of her body. </p><p>And, before the song even reached the end, the nature of Destiny’s lap dance changed. Her steady, practiced movements started to fade, replaced by what could be defined as more of a squirming. She finally let me pull my head from her bosom, and caught my gaze with her shocked eyes. </p><p>“You’re not as shy as the little girl thinks, aren’t you,” she said as she leaned to my ear. </p><p>I pulled back, giving her a confident smirk even as I dragged my hand along her back, earning a suppressed moan. I had to admit, as I saw the hint of panic — not fear, just the panic of losing control where she had to be the one on the lead — on Destiny’s eyes to match her growing wetness, I felt satisfied. </p><p>As much as I appreciated the irony of being chased in a dubious power balance situation — and Dorothy was far from being unpleasant to the eye — I didn’t enjoy the sense of powerlessness even a bit. With Destiny busy controlling her reaction, she wouldn’t be able to play the distraction, and hopefully, I would be able to handle the night without any further incidents — </p><p>My thoughts were interrupted by the distinct sound of cloth hitting the floor, one that was somehow noticeable despite the music filling the room. </p><p>Mostly because it felt far more substantial than anything a stripper would be wearing. </p><p>Even without looking, I knew exactly what hit the floor, along with my hopes of keeping the night safe and sanitized. </p><p>I said nothing as I turned toward the private stage, my fingers still dancing on Destiny’s body to tease her — a possible career crisis was not enough to stop me — while took in the view. </p><p>Dorothy was currently holding the pole, leaning to the side as she took a glimpse of her body, blushing badly.  Understandable, as she was wearing something rather fascinating under her outfit. A set of red underwear, one that was too thin and lacy to be actually worn casually. </p><p>She was definitely looking for an adventure. The bra was mostly transparent, with just a line to cover her nipples in a failed attempt to look tasteful. Her panties would have been more tasteful, but unfortunately, it had been ruined by the other aspects. </p><p>Such as, the wetness of her panties.</p><p>She wasn’t much of a dancer, I thought as I watched her do her best to move wearing her heels, but she didn’t need to be. Her clumsiness, when combined with her busty body, was just enough to speak to the wolf within. </p><p>I was tempted to push Destiny off my lap, go to the stage, and show Miss Rich Girl what happened to the amateurs who entered the sector unprepared when they met their first wolf, but I still cared too much about my career to not worry about the aftermath and the consequences that would follow me. </p><p>However, it was a close call. As Dorothy looked at the mirror, still trying to process her own ‘courage’ I turned my attention on Destiny, watching her dance. </p><p>“She doesn’t really know what she’s trying to do, does she?” Destiny muttered, one that was interrupted by a moan as I tightened my hold on her inner thigh. </p><p>“No idea at all. She’s lucky that she’s the daughter of the big boss,” I said, not really bothering to go into detail. As I focused on Destiny’s breasts once more, the shoe didn’t either. At this point, there was no stopping halfway, and I could only hope that Dorothy would lose her courage before I ‘saw’ her. </p><p>I stayed focused on Destiny, trying to avoid accidental eye contact … but when I felt a hand on my leg once again, I realized it was in vain. Inevitably, I had to turn my gaze, and saw Dorothy leaning over us, the angle giving a perfect view of her breasts, her hands on her hips to highlight her other beautiful features. </p><p>She flushed as I caught her gaze, but instead of retreating as I hoped, she stood straight and started swaying with the music, ironically, her inaptitude under the circumstances made her even more desirable to my —  admittedly warped — preferences. </p><p>It took all of my willpower, and the constant repeating of the consequences, to avoid pushing Destiny off my lap and focus on Dorothy. It wasn’t that Destiny was some undesirable ugly duckling, but ultimately, she was a professional. There was no thrill in seducing her, just the joys of the physical aspects. </p><p>As Dorothy turned her back and bent over, the view promised so much more than the physical release. Her alluring ass danced, begging for my attention — and more — while Destiny moaned under my fingers. </p><p>When she stood up, she walked away without looking at me, hurriedly. I didn’t let myself hope that it was her limit, which turned out to be the case. She stopped by the drinks table, and poured herself a large drink from one of the premade cocktail bottles. </p><p>One that would have been enough to make me worry about her blacking out if the drinks had any alcohol in them. </p><p>Yet, as I watched her drain the glass, her eyes brightening as she did so, it finally clicked me what I missed. By not allowing any alcohol in the mix, I tried to keep her from getting too wild … but looking at her underwear choice, I could see that it was a mistake. </p><p>She had already made that decision, and required just a bit of help to push for more. One that she could easily take from the placebo effect as well. </p><p>I should have just let her drink herself to unconsciousness while Natalie was still here. But, there was no changing it. </p><p>Instead, I watched as she poured the last bit of drink on herself, just enough to wet her cleavage. “Oops,” she gasped, loud enough to be heard by anyone despite the music. “I had a little accident.” </p><p>She used a towel to clean it up, using it to give me a few glimpses of her erect nipples, though I made sure to be looking at Destiny whenever she tried to check. She frowned when her ‘trick’ failed, but she only chose to push her luck further. </p><p>She sauntered toward me despite her growing flush, and stood next to me. She made a gesture to Destiny, who started unbuttoning my shirt. I let her, aware that any hope of somehow containing the night was gone. Of course, allowing a customer to undress would have been risky … but there were some benefits to having a private room. </p><p>I didn’t say anything, just raised my hands and allowed Destiny to remove my shirt. Dorothy gasped as she finally got a sight of my muscles. </p><p>I wasn’t half-bad for a man in his late forties. </p><p> “S-so, Nathan,” Dorothy said, trying to sound casual even as her eyes were locked on my chest, showing just how much she enjoyed the view. “Maybe you should let me have a turn with Destiny. It’s not nice for you to hog her all night.” </p><p>I was willing to bet everything that she was trying to replicate a scene from a movie. The line felt too practiced and unnatural. </p><p>Destiny, who long realized who was in control, asked for my permission to stand up. I nodded even as I reached to my pocket and subtly slipped several bills to her hand, before subtly gesturing toward the door. </p><p>Enough playing. </p><p>As Destiny stood up, Dorothy made a move to sit down; right next to me once again despite all the empty spots, clearly planning to use it as another step in her plan. </p><p>I decided it was not needed, grabbed her waist, and pulled her onto my lap instead. The way her eyes widened was beautiful. “Well, boss, how about if we try a different combination?” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“She was really amazing … wasn’t she,” Dorothy commented as another dancer left the room without a stitch on her body while she took another non-alcoholic shot, doing her best to look excited. </p><p>“Yes, she was,” I said even as I turned my attention to the one that replaced it, careful not to meet her gaze. </p><p>It took everything I had not to start laughing at Dorothy’s attitude. As the dancers came and left, her blush turned spectacular, clearly not ready to confront their weaponized nudity … certainly not when others were in the room if the hesitant glares she sent both to me and the others were any indicator. </p><p>But, she was under the impression that she kept that a secret. Admittedly, she was partially right. Once I signaled Natalie and Jenny to enjoy themselves, they turned their attention to the dancer, occasionally enjoying a lap dance or two between them. I had the feeling that if it wasn’t for Dorothy, they would have been pushing the envelope a bit more, but with her present, they kept themselves back. </p><p>Meaning, they didn’t care much about Dorothy’s occasional glances toward them before she bounced back to me. I did my best not to feed her attitude, and without anything to hold on to, she was too hesitant to push. </p><p>I was once again glad for my decision not to allow alcohol in the room. I doubted things would have been simple if Dorothy had some liquid courage in her veins. </p><p>Luckily, when the next dancer arrived, a curvy brunette dressed in hot pants that barely kept her hips contained and a police top, keeping my gaze away from Dorothy wasn’t particularly difficult. Not that Dorothy wasn’t pretty, but it was hard to compete against a sexy dancer while she was sitting in her seat, sending hesitant glares around. </p><p>At that moment, I relaxed, thinking that we would be able to handle everything perfectly. </p><p>Then, Dorothy decided to escalate. “You haven’t had a lap dance yet,” Dorothy said to me. </p><p>“Well, I’m not exactly —” I started, only for Dorothy to cut me off. </p><p>“N-nonsense. It wouldn’t be fair if you’re not entertained,” Dorothy said as she gestured for the dancer to walk toward me. Her tone was the farthest thing away from domineering … but there was something about having a multi-billion net worth that inevitably enhanced her power, especially when I worked for her business. </p><p>“Thanks, boss,” I said, hoping that it would remind her of the power differential between us, and it wasn’t right to abuse it.</p><p>Though I was glad I didn’t have to say that out loud. Even thinking about it, I barely managed to keep back my laughter. I was probably the last one who should be saying something like this. </p><p>The dancer moved toward me enthusiastically — real enthusiasm, though it was probably about the other girls gossiping about the tips they received. We weren’t exactly throwing around money to a young athlete who had just received his professional career, but the amount we threw around was still respectable enough to make the girls very excited. </p><p>Especially since it was still early. Making a lot of money was good. </p><p>Making a lot of money when they were working on a shift that was supposed to be mostly empty was even better. </p><p>Driven by those factors, the brunette simply shook her top as she moved toward me, revealing her shockingly large and shapely breasts  — shockingly perfect considering they were natural — before she plopped down onto my lap. </p><p>“Hello, handsome, I’m Destiny,” she said huskily as she grabbed my head and pulled me into her bosom, surprising me. </p><p>Another miscalculation. I didn’t expect her to start this aggressively, which was my mistake. I expected her to start slower, taking note of my attitude before finding the right balance to make sure I didn’t get too hard to handle. </p><p>Unfortunately, I ignored several facts. I was in the room with three women, which automatically gave me a sense of security. She knew we weren’t drunk — expecting waitresses and dancers not to talk was the height of idiocy — so she didn’t need to fear a drunken overreach. I had been sitting without requesting anything, which gave the impression that I was shy and well-behaved. </p><p>And, I threw around a lot of money to make sure they knew Dorothy was to be kept happy. And, since she was the one who ordered the dance … I received the best one. </p><p>Now, in general, I had no problem being suffocated by a pair of spectacular breasts. I would go as far as to say that it was one of my favorite activities. </p><p>Unfortunately, under the circumstances, it might be the single worst move, as it meant I couldn’t see anything in the room, ruining the control I had. I shuffled a bit, hoping that it would stop the lady, but before that could work, Dorothy reached to whisper something into her ear. </p><p>One that I couldn’t hear properly because of that damnable music, but whatever it was, it meant that Miss Destiny had just shuffled to perch on top of my erection rather than pulling away as I expected, rocking her hips aggressively. </p><p>I could have extracted myself forcefully, but I ignored that option. It would look absurd for the boss lady. And, more importantly…</p><p>I didn’t want to. </p><p>As much as maintaining my vigilance was important considering the identity of Dorothy, I had been just watching the best dancers in this upscale club giving their best to seduce us … and the shows they had put on Natalie’s lap while Jenny nibbled their exposed breasts was particularly arousing, tempting me to join. </p><p>Only Dorothy’s presence kept me back. Even my resistance had its limits, particularly when there was an enthusiastic brunette doing her best to dry-hump me into oblivion. </p><p>Though, I soon found myself questioning whether it was the correct choice, as Destiny raised her hips for a moment, and when they landed back, her hotpants were not in place. Somehow, they were removed. The speed wasn’t a problem as those hot pants, along with everything else, were designed to be removed easily. </p><p>The problem: they still needed at least one hand to untie laces. And, with Destiny’s arms around my neck, there had to be another contributor responsible for it. </p><p>And I doubted Natalie or Jenny decided to join me under the circumstances. </p><p>Then, another pair of hands landed on the legs, caressing hesitantly as they moved higher, confirming that guess. The pants were thick enough that I couldn’t immediately recognize the touch, but I knew neither Natalie nor Jenny would touch me this hesitantly. </p><p>It was a surprise, a big one. I didn’t expect Dorothy to suddenly get daring when I was occupied with a dancer. Now, I understood her hesitancy much better. </p><p>I could have stopped it, but not without being forceful. Instead, I stayed focused on Destiny’s breasts, hoping that Dorothy would get hesitant soon. For all her excitement — and the crush she seemed to be developing toward me — I didn’t expect her to really push anything while Natalie and Jenny were still in the room. </p><p>I kept my attention on Destiny, wondering what I could do to hasten her retreat. First, I moved my head slightly, capturing Destiny’s nipple between my teeth, gently playing with it. It was a trick that was supposed to be enough to make Destiny pull back. </p><p>But, it seemed that I underestimated her, as she just leaned further, implicitly allowing me to play with her tits as much as I wanted. Curious, I moved slightly up, and delivered a rough kiss that would, without a doubt, leave a hickey. </p><p>She kept her position. </p><p>Whatever Dorothy had promised her, it must be incredible. </p><p>Still, I felt Dorothy’s hands pull back, which counted as a win. Now, I just needed to scare off Destiny … a fun way. I shifted my hands to her hips, mauling them wildly even as my finger rubbed her wetness. Surely, even in the premium room, that must be enough to tell her that she was in dangerous waters and pull back, right. </p><p>It did not. Instead, she moaned loudly as she started rocking her hips even more aggressively. </p><p>Well, I thought as I abandoned myself to the pleasure. At least, with Dorothy properly scared, in a situation that she triggered, meaning that the danger was over. </p><p>Or, at least, that was what I thought until I heard Natalie’s distinctive heels hitting the floor. This time, when I pushed Destiny away a bit, she responded. </p><p>Natalie and Jenny were already up, looking toward me hesitantly while Dorothy pinned Natalie under her gaze. “I think we’ll call it an early night. You know, pregnancy,” Natalie said as she looked at me. I knew her expression enough to read she was following orders. </p><p>“Do you want me to accompany you,” I asked despite knowing the answer. </p><p>“No need. Someone needs to accompany our boss, right,” Natalie said, her tone resigned as she turned to join Jenny, and they left. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I could see Dorothy watching them depart with a smug expression. One that suggested that she was smart enough to pull an incredible trick. </p><p>Unaware that only with her identity protecting her from me that she even had a chance to play. And, as she pushed her luck, the protection from that detail was getting weaker and weaker… </p><p>She was pushing her luck. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I did nothing as Mariel sealed my lips with her searing kiss. I could have taken back control immediately, but after all the harrowing experiences she had gone through, she deserved to get a sense of control. </p><p>And, to be honest, the way her wings wrapped around my body was too comfortable to change, even when her fingers grabbed my hair painfully, squeezing helplessly as she ravaged my mouth with her tongue, the two sensations contrasting greatly. </p><p>I liked it. </p><p>As she continued to drink my lips with the desperation of a traveler lost in a desert, I let my Tantric mana infuse her body, mixing with her mana, finally helping her to quicken the bonding process. Now that I wasn’t dancing on the blade’s edge, that was much easier. </p><p>At the same time, I felt our bond getting stronger, her domain linking with my domains, enhancing the efficiency of my power just as what I had been experiencing with Intelligence and Endurance.  </p><p>[+1 Wisdom]</p><p>[+1 Manipulation]</p><p>The double notification was a surprise. Wisdom, I understood more, as, despite all the sharp edges, Light was still tightly linked to life and healing, which linked to Wisdom. </p><p>Manipulation was a surprise, mostly because I didn’t expect a double boost, but considering that, Darkness and Manipulation weren’t exactly a difficult connection to make. </p><p>It was surprising, but ultimately, very helpful. Wisdom helped quite a bit when converting Mana natures, particularly when I was fighting against undead or mass healing … and manipulation was even more useful as it allowed me to shape the mana much more finely. </p><p>A combination that would help me greatly … but rather than thinking about those benefits, I focused on Mariel’s hands, which were busy pushing my pants down. </p><p>“Someone is impatient,” I murmured, fascinated by the expression of desire on her face as lowered herself. </p><p>“Shut up. It has been months,” she grumbled shyly as she stood up, while her white robe followed the opposite direction, and pooled around her legs. “Just let me do this … I have been dreaming it for a while.” </p><p>With that, she jumped to my waist, her legs wrapping around my body tightly, just not as tightly as her walls clamping around my girth, enough to make me thankful for my high Endurance. </p><p>As she lowered herself … I had to say, I was a bit disappointed. She was still amazing and beautiful, but the way she said that implied that she had a more interesting idea in mind than a simple position… </p><p>Then, her wings rose and fell once, making me swallow those words. She started flying, and since her legs were safely clamped around me, I was dragged along. “I … I missed flying,” she admitted shyly as we rose to the skies, her hips dancing aggressively in contrast to her wistful tone. </p><p>Clearly, flying wasn’t the only thing that she missed, but I didn’t say anything. I looked at her eyes, enjoying that captivating brightness before I leaned forward to capture her lips, enjoying her taste. </p><p>She let out a chain of gasp as she repeatedly impaled herself with my length, while her wings picked up more and more speed. Our flight wasn’t exactly comfortable, which was a choice. She could have easily used magic to fly a dozen different ways, but she clearly wanted to rely on her wings, each swing radiating mana as she bonded with her Domain even better. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. The jerkiness of our movement made her hip movements even more unpredictable, making our carnal dance more pleasurable as a result. She closed her eyes to enjoy her double sensation, the freedom to finally fly without being hunted mixing with her carnal joy. </p><p>And, as her joy rose, her defenses fell, which would have been devastating if I had any ill intent. Luckily for her, I just used the opportunity to hasten her bonding with the plane even more. </p><p>[+3 Wisdom]</p><p>[+3 Manipulation]</p><p>Her eyes stayed closed, her hips rocking wildly as the last scraps of hesitation disappeared. I might have assumed that it was about her new Domain … but I knew for a fact it was not. Even before, she had shown just how wild she could get once she got going. </p><p>“My beautiful goddess,” I whispered. </p><p>“B-blasphemy—” she started before freezing. “No, this is not blasphemy, is it?” she muttered, as if she was just realizing the true implication of her transformation. </p><p>“No, it is not,” I answered. “With your domain complete, you’re an actual goddess. We just need to find you some worshippers. How do you feel about elves,” I said, enjoying her expression of shock. The following thoughtful expression, less so.  </p><p>“What elves,” she said. </p><p>“Later. I have something more important to do first,” I chuckled as I grabbed her body and twisted until I was behind her, hugging her from behind.</p><p>“W-what are you doing,” she gasped, which was all she was able to say as I grabbed her wings, stalling her flight as I started fucking her from behind. </p><p>“Riding you properly, of course,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“I’ll — kill — you,” she gasped, though not at once with her moans ruining her voice as I repeatedly invaded her. I wondered if it was the indignity implied in the act of riding that angered her more, or the fact that I was preventing her flying. </p><p>Teasing her like this changed the nature of our earlier romantic mood. However, I didn’t want to stop the fun halfway just because she wanted to stop to think about the unimportant aspects … like her Divinity. </p><p>She would have a lot of time to ponder on that once I left. </p><p>I kept holding her wings, using them as leverage to invade her wetness even more aggressively, each moan spectacular even as we fell, the ground coming close with a dangerous speed … well, calling it dangerous was a touch excessive, as we had a lot of magical methods to slow us down … and a collusion was hardly dangerous. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t change the feeling of danger that we drove from the sensation of diving, mixing incredibly with the carnal side of the pleasure. Just as we were about the hit the ground, I exploded in her and shifted my hand, forcing her to pull before we hit. </p><p>Challenging with every inch of her body, including her wings, trembling with pleasure. She slowed down and landed us on a hill, though with a little adjustment so that I was on my back. “Now, it’s my turn to ride,” she said with a raspy tone while her hips started to dance. </p><p>The movement of her hips was amazing, as were her moans that echoed off the empty landscape.  </p><p>The landscape itself wasn’t as beautiful. Other than the Divine Trees with their silver glow, there wasn’t a lot to look good on the landscape. </p><p>While she was busy riding me, I pulled the Twilight Mana around us, creating an emptiness for a moment before I flooded the same area with Nature Mana, triggering the growth, replicating the same trick I had done with the trees. </p><p>Without the necessity of carefully balancing it with Mariel’s condition, it was much easier. Just like that, the bare hills turned into beautiful meadows. Mariel might be passionate enough to ignore the ugliness of her domain … but she certainly appreciated the change. </p><p>Showing it by her hips getting even faster, my grunts of pleasure mixing with her moans, her tits dangling beautifully in the prison of my palms with every shake, her silky wetness enveloping my presence deeper and deeper. </p><p>“Truly a divine experience,” I said as a chuckle escaped my mouth. She sped up even more, fast enough to kill a man who couldn’t comfortably fight against gods.</p><p>“Shut up and fuck me,” she said as she leaned down and kissed me, her hips not skipping even a single beat as she showed her appreciation with her body. </p><p>It was the best way to be silenced, her tongue burying itself into my mouth once more as her hips gyrated, her tightness increasing even more while putting every single part of my body on high alert. Her nibbling drove my pleasure even higher. </p><p>Soon, her tightness turned into an inescapable prison as she started to shiver, her wings glowing beautifully as she orgasmed, which triggered one of my own as she collapsed against my chest, moaning and gasping. </p><p>Her connection with her domain got stronger. </p><p>[+3 Wisdom]</p><p>[+3 Manipulation]</p><p>“I … I missed you, bastard,” Mariel whispered. </p><p>“I missed you too, my sexy angel,” I answered, responding with a kiss, letting her recover.</p><p>After all, we still had a plane to repair, and a domain to bond completely … the fun way. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“W-where am I … the war … this feeling,” Mariel murmured, the chain of questions fading as she felt herself dealing with the situation. Understandable, considering not only did she wake up in a completely unfamiliar location after a long pause, but also she woke up very slowly. </p><p>I didn’t say anything for a moment, letting her process the moment. After all, she was a bonafide goddess, with all the additional power it brought along. Their transformation didn’t exactly come with a full range of stats, more limited based on the conceptual basis of their transformation, but there was still a certain base increase in question. </p><p>“To answer your questions in sequence,” I said only when her confusion faded. “We’re in a planar fragment that you’re currently turning into your divine domain to somehow allow you to bond with two different Divine Sparks. The war was months ago, and it’s already behind us, with serious interesting consequences. And, that feeling is probably the Divine Tool I had created for you, a forest that not only seed life across the plane, but also works entirely on Twilight Mana.” </p><p>“Twilight mana? What’s that,” she asked, focusing on the question with the most immediate answer. </p><p>“I have no idea. It’s what I have been calling the form of your new Divine Spark once Light and Darkness mana melded. How did that happen, by the way?” </p><p>“I … I don’t remember much,” she admitted reluctantly. “I remember defending the school against the beast wave, but then an undead horde appeared on the horizon. I decided to go and handle them before they could join the war, but when I went there, I saw nothing but weak zombies.” </p><p>“And, let me guess, that was when they hit you with a mysterious weapon, and you lost consciousness,” I guessed. It explained how the crown prince somehow managed to capture her … and it also explained how she was still alive. It confirmed something that I had been suspecting for a while.</p><p>She was an experiment. </p><p>Not for the Eternals in general, as if that had been the case, they would have just captured her rather than relying on what they clearly thought to be their lessers. It was much more likely to be one of the high-ranking members, trying to hide things from the rest. </p><p>My guess. Either the angel with two types of mana that was responsible for the ambush, or his boss. </p><p>Either way, it explained the way they decided to get rid of me. They wanted to make sure I didn’t ruin their experiment.  </p><p>Too bad it backfired on them spectacularly. </p><p>It also explained everything that was going on with the undead. Everything was to make sure Mariel left the defenses of the Silver Spires so that they could bring their experimentation to the next stage. </p><p>It felt good for things to finally make sense. </p><p>“Well, yes,” Mariel admitted, pausing a moment as she looked at me. Suddenly, she was angry. “You have been lying to me!” </p><p>It felt weird to be focused on the anger of a goddess. It felt like a pressure, suffocating and overwhelming … or, it would have been if it wasn’t for my recent experience, of taking down a god. After that, it was more of an interesting glimpse that allowed me to understand the difference between her spark and the necrotic one. </p><p>For one, the weight of it felt different. Not heavier, but more shapely, almost theatric, with the components of the light overbearing, while shadows danced … though even as I thought that, I could sense that it was not the Twilight Spark, but the impressions from the previous form. </p><p>It would take a while for the true merger to stabilize. Decades without my help, but even with that, months would be an ambitious target. </p><p>I chuckled as I created my own pressure against hers. “Well, I didn’t exactly lie. I just didn’t mention that I wasn’t the leader. Or, are you going to say that my organization hadn’t been as strong as I promised? And, I did save your school several times.” </p><p>“Well …” Mariel stopped, realizing that, technically it wasn’t a lie. I might have implied the existence of a bigger organization, but what I presented wasn’t any weaker. It was even stronger. “You lied about your abilities,” she said, but the moment she said that I could feel the shift. With her righteous fury robbed, what was left behind was the cute, socially incompetent angel that I was familiar with. </p><p>“So did you, unless I missed a long explanation about how you were using two opposing Divine Sparks in a very delicate balance that could destroy a nice chunk of the plane if you made a mistake.” </p><p>“Well, you knew about it,” she said, but her argument lost quite a bit of weight. “And, your secrets were bigger.” However, as she wilted, I could see that her brand-new Divinity wasn’t enough to cure her social ineptitude. </p><p>Just like before, where her supposed tough exterior crumbled the moment her true self was revealed. Not to mention, this time, I had the advantage of the memories of last time. She blushed badly, which I took as permission to escalate the satiation into its fun portion. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said as I took a step forward without a warning, hugging her. All the critical questions were already answered, and the rest, she was smart enough to deduce. “Now, why don’t we skip a step and you admit the reason you’re acting cranky is you missed me.” </p><p>“Never! I could never miss a liar and a cheater like you,” Mariel answered, but her lack of conviction wasn’t hard to see. </p><p>She tried to push me away, but considering I didn’t even move an inch despite all her new Divine Might, it was difficult for her to claim that it was a determined push. I chuckled as I watched her move and shuffle, doing her best to create a bigger and more efficient outlook, giving me a chance to push things forward without escalating things any further. </p><p>It was a beautiful moment. </p><p>“Bastard. Let me go. All that time, no even knowing whether you’re dead or alive… “ she muttered, her already feeble pushes weakening even more. </p><p>I could have pushed her, but I waited, her hands slowly settling on my shoulders. “I … I missed you,” she admitted. </p><p>“And I missed you as well, my sexy angel,” I answered, enjoying the suddenness of the blush that crept up her neck. It was good to see her sudden divinity didn’t cure her almost-crippling shyness. Her hands settled on my waist, while mine crossed her body a bit lower, and her wings wrapped around me. </p><p>And, whatever else that Twilight Spark triggered, I could say that the impact of it on her wings was beautiful. Her wings had always been soft and warm, but no matter what, there was a sense of sharpness that came from her mana nature. </p><p>The light was not exactly forgiving. </p><p>Twilight mana, on the other hand, didn’t have those edges, making her hug even more comfortable. I could have stayed in this hug forever, but there was only one problem. I had more visceral plans for our meeting. </p><p> “Damn, this is comfortable,” I murmured, deliberately acting soft, almost lazy. “I would have fallen asleep … but I’m afraid that you’ll molest me in my sleep again.” </p><p>Just like that, the tenderness of the moment was gone. “J-jerk,” she gasped, pushing me back once again, this time much harder, with hands safely on her hips, that didn’t work. </p><p>“Why, am I lying,” I said as I grabbed her hips tighter, squeezing hard enough to earn a moan. One that tempted me for more, so I leaned forward to steal a kiss from her elegant neck. She moaned again. “I distinctly remember your hands getting very adventurous, your hands exploring every part of my body.” </p><p>“S-stop,” she whispered, her blush intense enough to make me worry if it wasn’t for her recent rise to Divinity. </p><p>“Why, I even remember the spell you cast on me to make sure I stayed asleep, and climbed on top of me with those hips…” I said as I let my hands dance on her ass, enjoying their firmness while she closed her eyes, shame dancing with arousal. </p><p>“Then, for some reason, I remember examining your wings, do you remember why,” I said, teasing her about the position that followed. Admittedly, even now, I still cherished the memory of her back, her glowing silver wings spread wide as she hesitantly lowered herself and took me inside her for the first time. </p><p>“S-stop, please,” she gasped shyly. “Please.”</p><p>“Well, why don’t you make me—” I teased her, which was all the goading she needed before she leaned forward, her lips sealing mine. </p><p>I liked her method of choice to silence me… </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 115</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 115}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

She knew she should probably just retreat, but under his smirk, she wasn’t willing to. </p><p>She hadn’t once folded against Mia, and she wasn’t going to do so against her even weaker boyfriend. Oh, he looked strong and dominant, but Gina was familiar with the stories of exactly what Madam Paisley did with the boyfriends and husbands abandoned to her grasp. </p><p>He couldn’t be as strong as he looked if he was willing to accept such a treatment, which was enough to suppress any concern Gina might have otherwise felt as she watched him play with her employee. </p><p>Typical man, only able to act out against the weak. Gina lost count of the number of the men she had to dump just because they were uncomfortable with her wealth and power. </p><p>“Let’s make sure you get a better view,” he said mockingly as he pulled his shirt, showing his muscles … admittedly sexy enough to impress Gina. Too bad she knew that, despite everything, he was a weakling, which did a lot to reduce her attraction. </p><p>Still, at least it was a pleasant show, she thought as she watched Aisha’s top of head bobbing back and forth. Pity the piano was on the way, blocking the show. Gina thought about asking them to get a better position so she could enjoy the show, but after a momentary consideration, she decided against it. </p><p>Her pride was more important than a show… </p><p>Though, as Aisha’s apron flew, Gina found herself asking just how much of her pride it would have hurt if she had just taken a little peek. She owned the club, after all. </p><p>However, before she could even take a decision, he chuckled. “Let’s not deprive your boss of our show,” he said, his tone enough to send shivers through her. Too bad his voice was just fake, and had nothing to do with his true strength of personality. </p><p>He could never be anything more than an arm candy, and Gina didn’t feel low enough to take Mia’s discards … especially not after Madam Paisley had her turn and ruined him already. </p><p>Still, as he lifted Aisha like she weighed nothing looked good, the light glowing on them to highlight his serious yet handsome face. Then, he started walking, and Aisha already moving like a toy. </p><p>Gina never realized just how weak she had been. Maybe she should fire her once this debacle was over. What use was to have a loyal employee if she was manipulated that easily by anyone. </p><p>“Oh, I thought you were going to let me watch,” Gina mocked them as they moved behind her. </p><p>“Then, I had a better idea,” Darion answered, and Gina felt Aisha’s hands over her shoulders, the moan she let out showing exactly what was going on behind her. Gina couldn’t help but whimper as Aisha moaned, glad that Aisha was loud enough to cover her voice. </p><p>She couldn’t help. Darion’s domineering attitude might be paper thin, but she didn’t have the luxury of pressing him until that facade crumbled … and the more that facade stayed up, the more aroused she was getting. </p><p>Aisha’s whorish moans didn’t help. “Try to keep your voice down. Are you trying to deafen me,” she ordered, hoping that it would cover her voice.</p><p>“S-sorry, mistress,” Aisha answered, but her voice wasn’t her usual respectful tone. She decided not to blame her, as the sound of the wetness and flesh clapping showed her exactly what was going on behind her. </p><p>And, what Darion was packing wasn’t easy to handle. </p><p>Gina ignored the temptation to turn and watch Aisha being slammed even as she felt their position shift. It was a silent challenge, and she had no intention of letting that win over her. </p><p>She thought that things were over when she felt Aisha’s hand pulled away … but another hand landed on her body. A rougher, stronger hand, immediately followed by pulling her tunic up. She could have easily prevented it … but she realized it was a fair chance. He would get a glimpse of her naked body. </p><p>And she would have an excuse to turn toward them. </p><p>She let him pull the tunic up, acting like she was surprised by the move. “You’re a naughty man, aren’t you. Never satisfied,” she said as she stood up, acting like she was surprised … but not bothering to cover up her body. </p><p>“Of course not,” he said, teasing. “But, can you help me? I’m having trouble lifting the fat ass of this slut.” </p><p>Gina chuckled as Aisha shivered. He didn’t even look like he was lifting something let alone struggling, but she was feeling too horny to actually reject the chance to enjoy herself a bit. Not fully, of course, but a little preview wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>She took a step forward, wrapping her arm around Aisha’s smooth leg, enjoying the way her body shook with every push. Enjoyed too much, maybe, she realized. </p><p>She needed to stop before she did something she would regret. “Let’s put her down,” Gina commented as she led Aisha down, parting her legs open as Darion slipped inside … the way he parted Aisha tempted her even more. </p><p>She needed to stop indeed. </p><p>“Have fun,” Gina said as she stood up, glad that she was too good of an actor to show just how much the show affected her. </p><p>“Really, boss. You’re leaving just as things are getting fun,” Darion said. </p><p>“Unfortunately, I have a meeting,” Gina answered automatically, before even asking whether she actually respected him enough to bother coming up with an excuse. A mistake … but it was too late. </p><p>Somehow, she felt defeated. </p><p>No matter. </p><p>She would teach him a lesson the next time…</p>",

I plan to increase the regular chapters by at least <strong>one, maybe two</strong> (maybe even replicating Multiversal Adventures with a different one).</p><p>However, that doesn't mean I'm going to stop writing it completely.  I'm still committed to finishing Tainted Desire and Dark Discoveries. It's just that they will continue in the usual other platforms, including AO3, and I'll try to write at least two chapters a week, maybe more on them.</p><p>Once again, I apologize. I know it'll anger a lot of you, and you're rightful to feel such anger, but it's not something I can control.</p><p>Have a nice day, and take care.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The door opened, and the first man strutted in, which, to my surprise, was the henchmen of the Slasher rather than the old man, and the bodyguards surrounding him. </p><p>It surprised me, but only for a moment, and only because it was too simple. It was a test. </p><p>I decided to counter it in a way they didn’t expect. “No weapons in my bar, either leave them out, or stay at the door,” I said, deliberately not looking at any one of them as I carefully carved a grapefruit to put the finishing touches to my cocktail. Not the usual recipe, but the twist would allow further highlighting of the qualities I had prepared. </p><p>The bodyguards looked surprised at that statement, but they didn’t do anything, waiting for the signal from the old man, whose index finder rose slightly before tapping his middle finger twice. An order, and a very subtle one. </p><p>Still, the bodyguards waited until the henchmen spoke. “You can leave, we don’t need you,” he said, and the bodyguards left, trying to give the impression that he was the one in control. From his sudden smug expression, I guessed I wasn’t the only one they were playing. </p><p>The henchmen walked forward smugly and leaned against the bar. “So. I heard that there was a misunderstanding between our forces, but I’m sure we can discuss it like adults, right?” he started. His words were peaceful, but his attitude was smug. </p><p>A good disposable pawn to test my attitude. </p><p>“I’m guessing you have trouble hearing,” I commented casually. </p><p>He looked surprised. “What do you mean?” </p><p>“I told you that no weapons are allowed,” I said, pointing at the large blade that he carried proudly, one that marked as one of the leaders of the Slasher’s gang. “That pathetic bread cutter counts as one.” </p><p>“You —” he said, too shocked to say anything, clearly not expecting me to point that out, and certainly not for me to mix with an insult. </p><p>While he was too shocked to say anything, he wasn’t too shocked to act. He reached for his knife, while I kept my gaze on him, confident that he wasn’t going to attack me. He was afraid. Not from me. </p><p>Not from Tara; though that was because he was too focused on me to even pay attention to the figure in the corner, showing he wasn’t exactly the sharpest knife in the kitchen drawer. </p><p>No, he was clearly scared of the old man, showing that, unlike his delusion of thinking he was superior to the bodyguards that followed him, he had a much clearer idea of where he stood compared to the old man. </p><p>I didn’t do anything until he pulled it completely, tempted to ignore it even more. But, I could see Tara tensing in the corner. Subtle enough to be missed — only because her clothing covered every inch of her skin including her fingers — but I didn’t have any illusion that she would be able to maintain that while I was seemingly under immediate danger. </p><p>So, I raised my fingers and tapped against the bar, one of the codes we had agreed on, one that ordered her to throw the offender out without harming him. I didn’t bother acting subtle as I gave the order, instead smiled smugly. </p><p>The old man raised an eyebrow, but before the henchman could even react, Tara used her super speed to appear next to him, dragging him toward the door like a trash can. </p><p>Though, before throwing him out, she pulled his blade from his hand, and snapped it in four with incredible ease like the blade was made of paper and not high-quality metal. He flew out of the door, and his scrapped blade followed. </p><p>She looked at the old man, but I gave her another signal to take her seat back. </p><p>She walked back calmly while I turned my attention to the old man. “Please,” I said, gesturing him to take the seat. </p><p>He smiled softly as he started walking, but his attitude showed me that he wasn’t particularly impressed by the show until now, clearly treating it as amateurish theatrics. The ease he displayed toward Tara’s display of super strength was not good news … nor was the ease the bodyguards had been displaying at the move. </p><p>I expected them to look alarmed at least. But they did not, meaning they were absolutely confident in the safety of their charge. </p><p>I carefully glanced at my phone, which was under the bar to prevent him from seeing the security feed. </p><p>And saw a small team of three waiting at a corner, each wearing suits as well, but only two of them had weapons. One of them didn’t have any guns, but the other two didn’t position like they were protecting him. </p><p>Another super. </p><p>I immediately adjusted my expectations about the visitor. I had already expected him to work for one of the major players … but for one that was strong enough to have another villain as a subordinate, not so much. </p><p>The stakes got even higher. A mistake and everything would be ruined. </p><p>The old man said nothing as he sat down, and I pushed the drink toward him. He reached toward it confidently, showing he had no fear of a poison. </p><p>Despite my headache, I tapped my power once more as he took his first sip, watching the shift of his emotions. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was pleasure mixed with pleasant surprise, the kind someone might have when they take a bite out of a bruised strawberry, only to realize it was just perfect. Enjoyment followed soon. </p><p>Then it went away, leaving its place in a deep suspicion. And, for the first time, actual alarm. </p><p>It was glorious. </p><p>My bluff worked. </p><p>“Amazing cocktail. Perfect for me,” he said, his tone forcefully calm. </p><p>“I take my hobbies as seriously as I take my job,” I answered, my tone calm, yet just the right amount of smug for a young man who knew he was in perfect control — my ability to observe working well to boost my acting as well. </p><p>I deliberately threw out that statement, leaving him to wonder what was my hobby, and what was my job. </p><p>“I see,” he said. He stayed silent for a while, enjoying the sharp yet delicious cocktail. If it wasn’t for my powers, I would have been getting worried, wondering whether he bought my trick or not. But now, even without overcharging it, I could easily read that he was using the silence to try to unbalance me.</p><p>For all the trouble they created, my powers could be really useful in the right circumstances. </p><p>He spoke only when he finished his cocktail. “Truly a fascinating drink. Just this is enough to make the trip worth it.” </p><p>“Good to hear,” I said even as I decided to push my luck a bit. It felt reckless, but staying passive and letting him control the discussion wouldn’t work well to my benefit. “It’s always good to see my hobby and passion being appreciated. It gives me a break from … tasteless monotony of my day job.” </p><p>“I see. It’s good that a young man like you has found his passion. But this is an interesting place to open a bar. Your skills deserve a better place.” </p><p>“Needs of my day job, I’m afraid,” I said. </p><p>“So close to our business,” he countered, confirming something I had been suspecting since he arrived. That warehouse didn’t belong to the Slasher, but he was defending it for a bigger villain. </p><p>“I’m afraid it’s the opposite,” I said, and he quirked his eyebrow. “You’re the one that opened a business near our establishment.” He said nothing. “You’re lucky that my … friend is the understanding sort.” </p><p>“Your friend. And should I assume you have a friend that picked the location,” he said. </p><p>I smirked, but said nothing, letting him feel frustrated a bit, but not too much. I was trying to look intimidating enough to make sure they wouldn’t target us blindly, not trying to anger them to attack us. </p><p>A difficult balance to maintain, especially since I had no idea who he was working for yet, blindly working on my cold read. </p><p>“That would be a reasonable assumption,” I said, which wasn’t exactly a confirmation. A deliberate double-speak. </p><p>“And, how about if I assume that your friend is interested in the sudden change in the supply lines after the most recent conflict, and wants to take an active hand,” he added, his tone sharp. </p><p>“That would be…” I said, deliberately adding a lingering silence to test his attitude, his tenseness suggesting it was the real question he wanted to ask. “Mostly inaccurate,” I completed. “Our presence had nothing to do with such labor-intensive businesses. With that answer, I also implied that our presence might be still about the conflict. </p><p>“Interesting. So we can assume no interference from your friend to our business,” he said. </p><p>“Assuming they don’t do anything to ruin my little hobby here,” I said. Another loaded word, one that implied that I had the ability to make executive decisions about it. </p><p>“Good to hear,” he said as he stood up. “How much do I owe you for the drink?” </p><p>“On the house. Think of it as a welcome to the neighborhood gift,” I said, subtly reminding him that we were here first, and they didn’t even realize it before they opened their business. A subtle power-play and a threat bundled into one. </p><p>He nodded and started walking away. Happy and satisfied. I overcharged my power once more, ignoring the potential cost as I read his attitude deeply once more. A tense attitude, but also confused. </p><p>I realized it was about the last part, the fact that I didn’t ask for any kind of payment. </p><p>I waited until he reached the door. “However, I have to charge you for garbage disposal,” I added just as he reached the doorknob. “My friend doesn’t like littering.” </p><p>“And, how much it would be.” </p><p>I smirked. “Oh, I’m sure a distinguished gentleman like you would be able to come up with a satisfactory cost. After all, none of us wants the streets to get dirty, right?” I said. </p><p>“Of course not,” he said, and left, leaving me alone.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The shopping trip had been fun … but not enough to make me forget the challenge I was facing. As I waited for the delivery of the drinks, I played with my new puzzle, trying to understand why it was triggering my power. </p><p>I failed. For one, I had never been a particularly avid puzzler, so I didn’t have a strategy to solve it. But that was only a minimal reason. </p><p>The real reason was the security feed I was getting from the security cameras. There was a serious crowd gathering near our bar, their numbers and nervousness suggesting that Tyler wasn’t able to hold back his tongue about what I had revealed. </p><p>Not something outside my expectations, but it didn’t mean I treated it as good news. </p><p>Still, it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. The gang members didn’t gather around my bar to threaten me. No, they didn’t even show their presence, but actually stayed on the surrounding streets, trying to make their presence accidental while they observed comings and goings. They didn’t even harass the truck that dropped me the drinks. </p><p>They were afraid of starting a confrontation. They were afraid of even testing me. </p><p>It meant, from now on, I was truly accepted as the henchman of a nonexistent villain. </p><p>Meaning, I was a potential villain rival, worthy of observing. Not exactly something I could avoid while I was in the crosshairs of a villain like the Slasher. </p><p>“At least I didn’t have to worry about heroes,” I muttered as I flipped the puzzle a few more times before I sighed and put it under the bar. </p><p>I didn’t have to worry about the heroes, because they would never care about the outskirts of the town, too poor to be worthwhile. </p><p>Who would have thought that there would come a day I would be happy about the hypocrisy of the heroes?</p><p>Luckily, just as I was about to fall into despair, the one person that constantly brightened my day walked down. Tara. </p><p>Wearing the new costume I had bought for her while shopping. </p><p>“H-how do I look?” she whispered, her voice coming out more threatening thanks to the reinforced motorcycle helmet she was wearing. </p><p>The outfit wasn’t’ particularly clever. Leather pants and a leather jacket, both loose enough to hide the truth of her assets, and a black shirt underneath. Motorcycle helmet, gloves, and boots completed the view while covering every inch of her skin. </p><p>Altogether, I was going for anonymity. Not because I expected anyone to actually fail to realize one of the two people in the bar was the mysterious bodyguard — that was too late to fix. No, I just wanted to make a point. </p><p>Supers, both heroes and villains, were rather determined about their own identity, wearing very distinct — often revealing — outfits that truly highlighted their specialness. Quite narcissistic, of course, wanting to be noticed and identified the moment they appeared, but it would be a lie to say I didn’t understand. </p><p>I would have shown off as well if I received something like the ability to summon lightning or spit magma. </p><p>Instead, I was hunkered on my little bar, thanking my lucky stars that Tara had decided to respond to that help-wanted sign. </p><p>However, that general inclination to show off and highlight their identity was why Tara’s outfit — which looked something like a mere henchman would wear — mattered. Her super strength was very distinct, and I displayed it deliberately by making her rip off the hood of their car. </p><p>Yet, despite her power, she was willing to abandon her chance to show off and follow our mysterious — not existing helped there very much — master villain, implying that they had to be very strong. </p><p>A surprisingly effective bluff. </p><p>However, I realized that while I was lost in thoughts, Tara was still waiting for an answer. </p><p>“Luckily, not too good,” I said, answering her earlier question, watching her wilt slightly despite her costume that was supposed to hide her reactions. This time, it wasn’t even my power, the way her shoulders dropped was too visible. I needed to train her more. But not before fixing her self-esteem. “Which is good, as I don’t want a bunch of drunk to ogle you. You’re mine, and mine only,” I followed, my tone exaggerated and sharp. </p><p>It worked wondrously to fix her mood. </p><p>“Really,” she said, her ego still fragile. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “Come here and I’ll show you,” I said, ready to have a little more fun, but just as she was about to take a step forward, I gestured for her to stop with a frown on my face. </p><p>We had guests. From one of the cameras, I saw several people walking toward the bar, though none of them dressed like henchmen at first glance. At least, not the kind that would work for the Slasher. </p><p>Interesting.  </p><p>Though, still, horrible timing as always. </p><p>“We have guests approaching. You remember what we discussed about your acting.” </p><p>“Yes, sir. Sit on the corner table, look at the bar, and give no reaction no matter what’s being talked about unless you give a signal.” </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said, complimenting her. “Do that perfectly, and you can pick your reward tonight,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered in excitement, her body language shouting joy as she dashed to her seat. I kept my gaze on her for a moment, making sure she wasn’t too giddy. Luckily, her obsession with following orders worked excellently as she took her seat transforming something close to a still statue. </p><p>I could still catch signs of restlessness, but only when relying on my power. </p><p>Things would work excellently unless they had a similar observation power … but if they did, I had far bigger problems already. Tara was hardly the only one that was creating such a mismatch. </p><p>I turned the approaching figures. Six people, four of them bodyguards, good ones considering the way they passively observed their surroundings to make sure there was no threat. Their tailored suits, the kind that required quite a bit of money to purchase highlighted their position further. </p><p>Despite the poor vision from the cameras, I could count three weapons on each of them, further highlighting their danger. </p><p>Without Tara, I would have started running away. They were not the usual incompetent hopeful that the villains picked off the street, but something more. I had no idea why such men were visiting me.</p><p>Worse, my fake identity meant that I should know that, giving me very little time to get an understanding, of pick an attitude to cover it. </p><p>I turned my attention to the other two, hoping that I would be able to get a clue. I recognized one of them. Or, more accurately, I recognized the blade he was carrying. Another follower of the Slasher, though with a higher ranking than my good friend Tyler. </p><p>However, those bodyguards were certainly not a part of the Slasher’s gang. </p><p>Which meant, he wasn’t my problem. The other one was. A man in his fifties, good-looking, dressed impeccably. His suits were even more impressive than what his bodyguards wore, probably costing more than a midline sports car, and he wore a classic watch. </p><p>He had no weapon, but he moved with confidence. </p><p>A dangerous man. Worse, considering he was making the first contact with an unknown element — me and my non-existent backer — it was a certainty that he was working for another, even more dangerous man. </p><p>I needed a way to intimate him. </p><p>My gaze slipped to Tara, and I corrected my thoughts. I needed to intimidate them in a way that wouldn’t earn an immediate physical retaliation. </p><p>I had no choice but to rely on my power. I turned my attention to the way they approached, doing my best to read everything about the man that was approaching. For the first time, I tried to push my power to the limit. </p><p>And, to my surprise, I realized that it was actually possible. </p><p>An immediate headache hit me, but along with it, came a flood of information that would have otherwise required a fine study of character. The way he walked, his cultural heritage, even his food habits — thanks to the fresh stain on the sleeve of the Slasher’s henchmen, who no doubt had dined with the man in question moments before they arrived — and a bunch of other information that almost useless. </p><p>I stopped only when it became truly unbearable, and held on the bar. Tara looked at me worriedly. “Don’t worry, I’m just practicing something,” I said, hiding my pain. No need to show her just how vulnerable I was … or the existence of my power. </p><p>Not yet. </p><p>I ignored the pain, and mixed all the information I had collected thanks to my power … to mix a perfect Whiskey Sour for the man, even going as far as one of the most expensive but unusual brands of scotch I had, with a suffocating smoky palette. </p><p>Like a forest fire, people defined. </p><p>Just as I was putting the finishing touches, there was a knock on the door. </p><p>“Come in,” I called as I took a deep breath. </p><p>My first real test. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Our journey back was silent. Whenever I looked at her, Nicole blushed furiously, almost as bad as after our first photoshoot. However, since I didn’t see any sign of anger — and shockingly, jealousy either — I didn’t say anything, letting her process what she had just seen. </p><p>“I …. I will go take a shower,” she said, blushing as she did so. </p><p>“Good, have fun,” I said, which didn’t help her blush any as she run away like a gazelle, the dance of her ass tempting me to follow her. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had a lot of shopping to do. New cameras, proper lights, screens, props, some minimal furniture … all just to furnish one of the many rooms, which would give me the operation I would require. Our account was still going viral, with people clamoring for more and more. </p><p>I had a lot of work to make sure everything was going alright. </p><p>However, when my phone buzzed with a message, I decided I could afford to rest for an hour. It was from Carol, asking me to pick up the papers from her home. </p><p>It would be rude to leave her waiting after awakening her arousal in such a memorable manner. And, as a bonus, she was on the way to the store where I would pick some of the props, so I could multitask. </p><p>After a message that confirmed I would be there in half an hour, I drove there directly, ignoring the temptation to go and check on Nicole. I had a feeling that, if I did so, it would take quite a while for me to leave. </p><p>However, as I arrived at my destination, I was glad that I had yet to buy my new camera. It was not the safest place to leave a top-of-the-line device around. I still had my old one with me, of course. This time, I wanted to take a few photos of Carol. </p><p>The ones that Nicole took … let’s just say she wasn’t a natural photographer like the way she turned out to be a natural model, and Carol deserved to have better photos, even if it was just for my private collection. </p><p>I rang the doorbell based on the address she texted me. The light from the peephole went off for a moment, suggesting someone looked through, but the door stayed shut. “Carol, can you open the door?” an unfamiliar woman shouted. </p><p>The roommate, I guessed. </p><p>“Can’t you do it, Amy? I’m busy,” Carol shouted back, their apartment not particularly well-isolated. </p><p>“Playing with yourself doesn’t count,” Amy answered, not particularly loud, but still clear. </p><p>“S-shut up, I’m not,” Carol answered, her panic suggesting she was aware of just how thin their walls were. “Who is it?” she asked. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Amy said, which gave me a reason to tease Carol a bit. Apparently, she didn’t tell her roommate the good news, that she found her a job. </p><p>Carol grumbled something that I couldn’t hear as she stomped toward the door. When she opened the door, I noticed two things. First, the extremely expensive silk dressing gown contrasted greatly with her cheap pink slippers. </p><p>Second, the abject expression of shock on her face. “S-Stephen, what are you doing here?” she stammered, blushing. In her shock, she didn’t notice, but I heard the roommate chuckling from the other room, which gave me an idea about exactly what had happened. </p><p>“Well, I’m here because you sent a message asking me to pick up the paperwork,” I said, deliberately acting confused as well, letting the roommate have her victory. Considering she was going to do a lot of work for me — assuming her work was satisfactory — there was no harm in keeping her happy. </p><p>Carol looked confused, but she still took a step to the side, inviting me. “I didn’t…” she started, but I raised my phone and showed it to her. She read texts in confusion, then checked the time. Then, she looked at the corner of the room, where there was a charger but no phone. </p><p>“Amy!” she suddenly shouted. “Where’s my phone!”</p><p>“You must have forgotten it in the kitchen,” Amy shouted back and stepped into the room. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was her hair, bright pink and long, with sides shaven, giving her a punk aura. I would have said she looked like a wannabe, but even without any piercing, her stance was tough enough to handle it. </p><p>Of course, both tough and a contractor, one might assume she looked masculine. Which couldn’t be further from the truth. Despite her tough aura, she had one of the rare auras that oozed sexiness, her curves helping immensely. </p><p>Though, the fact that she was just wearing panties and a tank top didn’t hurt. </p><p>Carol dashed toward her to rip off her phone. She grabbed it, trying to pull it, but Amy didn’t give, smiling even wider as she did so. </p><p>However, as she kept Carol’s phone despite her insistence, another interesting thing happened. A small blush appeared on her face, one that immediately ruined her tough aura. It was subtle, but my gaze was too sharp to miss it. </p><p>I even raised my camera to take a few quick photos before they noticed. </p><p>Carol finally pulled it off and checked her messages. “I knew it,” Carol growled. “Why did you send it?” </p><p>“Well, I wanted to meet with the man who finally popped your cherry hard enough that you were barely able to walk back into the apartment,” Amy answered. Her tone sounded casual, but after her subtle blush, I knew exactly what to look for, and could hear her longing, mixed with just the softest jealousy. </p><p>An interesting twist. </p><p>“I wasn’t a virgin,” Carol complained, but her blush grew immediately. </p><p>“Well, you might as well be considering just how long it had been since you let yourself have some fun with all the bankruptcy stuff,” Amy said, unaware that she finally gave me the clue I had been looking for about Carol’s presence in the middle of the nowhere. </p><p>Neither realized they just revealed another clue to me even as Carol leaned forward and they started whispering. </p><p>I raised my camera, stealing another photo of Carol’s blushing face even as I continued examining Amy, trying to understand exactly what was driving her. </p><p>Important, considering there was a likelihood that we would be working together. However, as I watched Carol whispering angrily while Amy reacted sheepishly, I could see that Amy had a one-sided crush on Carol, but she didn’t act on that. </p><p>I didn’t think it had anything to do with Carol’s orientation — which was obvious considering I had seen the way Carol looked at Nicole during their competition. Her possible attraction to Amy could be a problem, as she didn’t seem to register her mostly-revealed tits despite their closeness, but it might just be about friend-zoning her. </p><p>I caught a clue after I saw Amy’s gaze landing on Carol’s robe with a sudden distaste when Carol was not looking. It was a mixture of longing and frustration. </p><p>Bingo, I thought as I combined it with Carol’s passionate attitude toward work and her past. Carol was clearly working hard to get rich again … and either Amy didn’t share that drive, or she believed Carol was only hanging around with her because of her destitute status, and would put some distance once she got rich once again. </p><p>This might as well be true, as even with my ability to read them, my exposure to them was limited. I could have stayed at the edge, watching them even more to learn … but where was the fun in that. </p><p>Especially when I could teach Amy about the risks of playing games. </p><p>I walked toward them, and hugged Carol from behind. “So, now that the mystery of my arrival is solved, do you want to introduce us properly,” I said. </p><p>“Y-yes,” Carol stammered, remembering that she had a guest even if she wasn’t the one that called. “Stephen, this is Amy, the pain in my ass.” </p><p>“Damn. I was hoping I would be the one,” I whispered in her ear, just loud enough for Amy to hear while Carol blushed. </p><p>“You’re so bad,” Carol said, scandalized as she slapped my chest, missing Amy’s intense jealous gaze, mixed with surprise. Clearly, when she called me, she expected something more subdued. Maybe Carol didn’t mention her latest realization, or maybe it was Amy’s own misguided expectations. </p><p>“Well, not bad as your roommate,” I said as smiled at Amy before I whispered into Carol’s ear, this time making sure Amy couldn’t hear. “Now, do you want to make her pay for playing with your phone?” I whispered. </p><p>Carol turned to to look at me, smart enough to be suspicious of my offer. Unfortunately, her body was quick to betray her, the memories of her orgasm easily distorting her thoughts as my fingers slipped inside her robe, pushing it open, revealing she only had her underwear under it. </p><p>Sexy, but mismatching. “Oh, did I arrive just as you were trying to pick up your clothes before you called see,” I whispered again, once again louder to make her roommate jealous. I couldn’t help it. The anger looked good on her with her punk attire. </p><p>“S-shut up,” Carol said, trying to sound threatening as I dragged her toward her bedroom … only to freeze when we passed it and sat on the couch. She looked at me questioningly. </p><p>“It would be rude not to give your roommate a show after she went all the trouble of inviting me,” I declared. Carol blushed. </p><p>And Amy froze, her expression split between outrage and desire. Pity I couldn’t take a photo with my hands filled with Carol. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I just looked at Carol, not bothering to hide my smirk at our compromising position even as I held onto her back. She shuffled a bit, but didn’t try to pull back from the compromising position. </p><p>However, her expression wasn’t particularly hard to read. She was trying to find an excuse to get away, one that was needed considering she was the architect of our current situation — the fact that she was under the impression that I was the submissive party, sensitive enough to be hurt by a wrong move delayed her even further. </p><p>Amazing. </p><p>I decided to take the initiative. Thanks to her little competition with Nicole, she was already at the edge both mentally and physically, and required one last push. A push that I could deliver in many different ways, but I chose to stay loyal to the theme. </p><p>“Maybe we should separate. I don’t think you want to anger Nicole,” I suggested. </p><p>She stayed silent for a moment, her hesitant expression flickering as she processed the first part, more than ready to take the offer of the first part, then the second part hit her. “Oh. Are you sure you’re not a nature photographer instead?” she asked. </p><p>I did my best to look confused. “Why?” </p><p>“Because, for a fashion photographer, you don’t seem to know exactly how women work,” she said. I opened my answer, but I didn’t bother coming up with an answer, not when she rose to seal my lips with hers. </p><p>Making her claims that I didn’t know about how women worked absurdly. She would soon realize that as well as I put a practical display of my abilities. But, not. Immediately. For a while, I let Carol lead, her arrogance delicious as she did her best to dominate the kiss, but lacking the necessary experience to do so. </p><p>Just from that kiss, I could have pegged her as one of those rich kids that were desperate to prove they deserved their richness by spending all the time that was left of their social obligations studying — though, leaving quite a bit of time for yoga as well, as I added as I cupped her ass once again, this time much more aggressively. </p><p>We kissed for a while as I led us toward a wall, searching for a surface to properly ravish her. It was not exactly needed, but her every movement was shouting that it had been a while since she had the experience. </p><p>And it would be remiss of me if I didn’t make her return to the field memorable. </p><p>“Wow, you can get really heated once you start, right —” she started, only to yelp as I pushed her panties to the side, making her realize I had already shed my boxers while I brought her against the wall. “Oh,” she whispered, clearly having a last-minute panic. </p><p>Luckily, that was an easy barrier to pass. “We can stop if you’re scared,” I said, doing my best to look genuinely concerned rather than teasing, which was a tough call. </p><p>“Nonsense. Me, scared,” she growled, happily embracing her competitive anger rather than her concerns — like the fact that she was exposed in a warehouse, or about to get fucked by a man she had met just an hour ago. </p><p>And, sank down aggressively. </p><p>Not the best choice, though, thankfully, our long photoshoot was excellent foreplay, making it merely momentarily uncomfortable rather than actually painful. “Oh, I didn’t realize you were this … big,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, you’re barely halfway there,” I said even as I shifted my hands slightly, pinning her against the wall. “Do you want me to properly stretch you so Nicole doesn’t mock you when she arrives?” </p><p>This time, it finally clicked with her that her chosen field of competition was rather absurd. And, if I was reading the realization of her beautiful eyes accurately, she also realized that I wasn’t just an innocent submissive somehow being torn into two. </p><p>“Oh, why don’t you help me solve it,” she whispered sweetly as her legs tightened, showing that I might have overestimated her a bit. It seemed that she was still missing that second part. </p><p>She pushed herself down a bit more, her moan filled with equal amounts of desire and strain, and I adjusted my assessment slightly. It wasn’t that I overestimated her intelligence, but underestimated her arousal. </p><p>After all, it wasn’t only men who lost their rationality in the throes of passion. </p><p>Carol pushed herself down, then up again, her legs tightening around my waist for leverage as she pushed herself down, doing her best to contain her moans as she pushed herself to the limit, strain replacing with pleasure with the passage with each second. </p><p>And, as her pleasure reached to the surface, I decided it was enough playing. I started to move my hips, first just matching her movement, but then slowly taking the lead. In a way, it was like dancing, a subtle shift, and instead of me following her lead, she followed mine. </p><p>Too lost in pleasure to miss its significance.</p><p>At first. </p><p>As my hips got faster and faster, I was soon drilling her against the wall. She was just accepting that invasion at first, moaning louder and louder as I turned her into a beautiful ornament against the wall. The only thing that I pitied was that I didn’t have my camera to immortalize the contortions on her beautiful face as the orgasm hit her, quicker than I thought to be possible. </p><p>I let her recover for a moment, afraid that her first orgasm after a while would send her unconscious. Which would have been a pity considering I still had one more plan for her before we left. </p><p>However, as her orgasm faded, clarity returned. “Y-you bastard,” she gasped. </p><p>“Oh, that’s a new one,” I said, teasing her openly. </p><p>“Y-you knew exactly what was going on. You tricked me!” </p><p>“Oh, how exactly I did do that? By letting you act as you wished? By asking whether you’re afraid of Nicole?” I asked, deliberately vocalizing the situation to make it sound more absurd than it actually was. </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer, but no words came out as she realized it wasn’t exactly defensive. After all, acting submissive and weak to her advances didn’t sound nice. </p><p>I chuckled. “Does that mean you want to stop just after warmup,” I said. </p><p>“W-warm up?” she whispered, no doubt trying to match those words with what she experienced. “T-that was the best orgasm of my life, and you claim that it’s a warm-up,” she whispered, before blushing wildly. </p><p>Either she stayed away from the touch of the others even longer than I realized, or she had some really disappointing partners. Not that I wanted to delve it right at this moment to ruin the mood. It was hardly a priority. </p><p>“Since it was the best, should I assume you don’t need another?” I asked instead, watching her expression dance. Shame, arousal, desire, hesitation…</p><p>In the end, she just whispered a word. “P-please,” she whispered. </p><p>“As you wish, milady,” I answered with a deliberate exaggeration, acting like a gentleman, one that contrasted greatly with my next move.</p><p>I let her step on the ground, but only to flip her before I pressed her against the wall again I slipped inside her, this time from behind, impaling her hard. </p><p>This time, there was no holding back her moans. Pinned against the wall, she didn’t put the slightest resistance as fucked her hard — not as hard as I could go, but still a touch harder than could handle. </p><p>Her moans rose unbidden, echoing in the empty warehouse excellently. </p><p>I looked around, searching for Nicole. There was no chance she didn’t hear what was going on, and I knew that, after everything, she wouldn’t go away … but also she wouldn’t dare to come in. </p><p>Then, I saw her in a corner, peeking in a way she thought to be hidden. I thought about calling her, but after a moment, I decided it would be too much too soon. She was still unfamiliar with the concept, and even in the earlier confrontation, she barely managed to hold on with all my support. </p><p>As much as it disappointed me to admit, she wasn’t ready for a threesome yet. </p><p>I turned my attention to Carol, drilling her aggressively against the wall, enjoying her howls as she reached a new high of pleasure. “I … I’m splitting apart,” she moaned.  </p><p>“Does it mean I need to slow down?” I asked. </p><p>“No!” she cried in desperation and delirium. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said I tightened my grip before I truly loosened my assault, relentlessly fucking her even as I grabbed her elegantly cut shoulder-length hair, my other hand still on her hips.</p><p>I pulled at the last second, covering her ass with my seed while she moaned and gasped. She was at the edge already. </p><p>“I think that marks the end of our site visit,,” I said I chuckled while she fell on her knees, breathing desperately to control herself. “Now, you can send the documents to my email once completed,” I said, enjoying the panic on her face. “Or, you can drop me a message and I can pick them up from your home. Whichever you prefer,” I said as I leaned forward, and left a soft kiss on her cheek. </p><p>She said nothing as she watched me dress, and I didn’t either, happy to leave the ball on her court. </p><p>Especially since I had no doubt about what her choice would be. </p><p>“So, did you enjoy the show?” I asked once I met with Nicole in the corridor, only for her to blush wildly, almost as much as she did during our first meeting. </p><p>I decided not to push her too much and let her process her new experience. </p><p>I still cupped her beautiful ass as we walked, of course. After all, I had my limits, and not taking her in the backseat was already pushing them. She needed time….</p><p>And I needed to work. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The idea behind helping Mariel from her coma was simple … but not exactly easy. It required a lot of care and attention, as well as time. </p><p>It was why I started the process even before finishing up the necrotic god properly, instead, of letting the light ward constantly attack and weaken him further. Even locked in a small domain, it took a while to take him down, and I didn’t want to keep Mariel waiting anymore. </p><p>I created a thick shell of mana around her as the first step, one that covered about a mile. However, this time, I created two layers. A thicker outer layer that would keep any interference from outside blocked. </p><p>And, an inner layer made of the most malleable pure mana I could create, perfect for her to change and manipulate as she needed once she started stirring back. With that protection layer complete, I turned my attention to the area that was covered by the ward, purifying every inch with great care, not leaving even a hint of necrotic mana to ruin the process. </p><p>Then, I brought Mariel into the center, and gently coaxed her into her shell, touching her Divine Spark gently with my mana, and led the smallest tendril which was a mixture of Darkness and Light out, slowly spreading through the tiny domain, doing my best to copy how Helga and Seldanna achieved the same aim. </p><p>I waited, holding my breath. A minute passed, then two minutes … five minutes, making me wonder whether I needed to do something more. </p><p>Then, her Divine Spark started spreading. Slowly at first, but slowly picking up speed. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured as I moved out of her domain. I still had several wards that allowed me to observe every minute change that was going on, but I had other things to do. </p><p>First, the enemy god. I teleported to the outside of his cage while at the same time, tapping into the Aether Dimension, using all the available purified spark to drain necrotic mana, converting it into the modified light mana, and flooding the ward. </p><p>Once the transformation was complete, gods were strong and resilient, especially in their own domains. Unfortunately, to my enemy, that wasn’t exactly good news. It only expanded his suffering while I cut down his Divinity down bit by bit, until he ceased to exist. </p><p>Not in a glorious last stand, but with a pathetic whimper. </p><p>Giving me the most incredible bounty I had ever received. </p><p>[+4,491,152 Purified Spark]</p><p>I immediately channeled the most into my stats. Purified spark had its uses, but not without the necessary power to control it. As I received my new burst of power, I could feel my abilities reaching a new level. With all stats increasing, almost double, the combined effect was far more than just multiplying it by two. </p><p>[+50 All Stats]</p><p>[+20 Endurance]</p><p>[+15 Intelligence]</p><p>[- 4,282,460 Purified Spark]</p><p>It was a useful upgrade as I had a very tedious task at hand. Turning the plane into somewhere that Mariel could adapt as quickly as possible. Which was much harder to do for her than it was for Helga or Seldanna. Helga only had to create a tiny domain for herself, making her job easy. </p><p>And, Seldanna had both the heritage of the old Nature God that tried to possess her, and a huge spread of existing creatures, both elves and trees, that she was aligned well to use as vectors. </p><p>Mariel only had a ruined, dead plane still filled with zombies. </p><p>She was lucky that my abilities lent themselves to such a cleanup task particularly well, and the current spread of assets only made it easier. </p><p>First, I commanded our treant army to spread around the plane, even teleporting some of them to distant corners. Then I used the avatar I still had — diminished since I didn’t need all that power — to trigger them.  </p><p>First, transforming them into giant trees, then ordering them to flood the plane with their mana, triggering a sudden vibrant growth all along the plane, destroying the remaining presence completely. </p><p>However, as they pushed life into their surroundings, they started to lose their color, fading silently. I let them do so, intervening only when they were at the edge of collapsing. Even then, I didn’t heal them, but kept them in that state. I had a plan for them, but I was hoping that it wouldn’t be necessary. </p><p>It was a simple yet tedious work, one that took almost a week. </p><p>Meanwhile, Mariel managed to create a tentative bond with the small area I had created for her, but her coma was still a problem. Clearly, such a basic link wasn’t enough to relieve the soul pressure. Maybe she would have been cured if I left her here for a few decades. It was a time that most divine beings treated as a momentary rest, but my perception hadn’t been warped that much yet. </p><p>Not to mention, there was no guarantee the Eternal would leave us alone for that long. And, trying to defend her during an attack was far more dangerous than the little experiment I had. </p><p>I pulled all the Divine Spark I had from the main avatar and challenged the Nature Spark back to Seldanna. At the same time, I drained all the mana from the Avatar. The outer layers rotted with a rapid speed, falling apart before I gust of wing spread those pieces around to turn into fertilizer. </p><p>After the amount of mana it had been channeled through that wood, it made an excellent fertilizer. </p><p>All that remained of that giant avatar was a seed, one that maintained a tenuous connection with the near-dead forest around us. </p><p> At the same time, I grabbed a unit of new Divine Spark that Mariel slowly spreading into her new domain. </p><p>I named it Twilight Spark. The theme and the feeling it gave me fit it perfectly. </p><p>[+1 Twilight Spark]</p><p>Then, I moved to the center of Mariel’s new domain and buried that seed there, gently leading the solo point of Twilight Spark I had taken from her. First, it crystallized, making the seed a Chosen. Then, very carefully, I spread the weak spark into a demigod soul, and at the same time, started feeding pseudo-HP and pure mana. </p><p>[-1 Twilight Spark]</p><p>Unlike the flood of nature mana, the combined treatment didn’t allow the tree to suddenly sprout into a giant tree but barely allowed it to sprout. As it sprouted, the Divine Spark mixed into its structure further, reaching into the first step of godhood. </p><p>The same trick I had pulled with my God Forest, creating an unthinking, unfeeling divine vessel. </p><p>The perfect weapon for a goddess. </p><p>It took half a day of careful caring for the tree to reach a foot of length. At that point, Mariel’s domain finally embraced it, her tendrils of mana touching. </p><p>I touched the connection where they melded, allowing Mariel to bond with it. Slowly, her Divine Spark started to flow to it, strengthening the budding tree. Its trunk turned into a dull, tainted silver color … no, not tainted, I corrected a moment later, but shadowy. Like they were dancing at the surface, dulling and brightening repeatedly. </p><p>Similarly, the leaves turned into bright gray, but with dark streaks spreading through its structure, glowing and devouring light at the same time. </p><p>Fascinating, I thought even as made a temporary connection with the tree, and stole quite a bit more Twilight Spark. Luckily, the budding tree got strong enough to handle it.  </p><p>[+57 Twilight Spark]</p><p>I used that spark to convert purified main into Twilight mana, which, assisted by my stats, was far faster than Mariel could have achieved with the same amount of Spark. Her small domain was filled with Twilight Spark, but it was just a start. </p><p>I teleported out, and started Twilight Spark to connect the god tree with the other trees that were about to die … which was only possible because every single tree had originally been a part of that avatar, allowing the connection to be established successfully, but not easily. </p><p>I had to visit every single tree by myself and build the connections one by one, each taking a minute to successfully establish, and that was only with my most recent stat boost. Without it, it would have probably taken hours for every tree.  </p><p>Even in its shortened version, ten thousand trees meant ten thousand minutes, it took a week without even a wink of sleep. But, it allowed her slowly strengthening Twilight God Forest to spread across the plane, allowing her to bond with it much faster. </p><p>Two more days. </p><p>And her eyes opened. </p><p> I was there, waiting for her. </p><p>“Good morning, sleepyhead.” </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 115</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 115}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",
