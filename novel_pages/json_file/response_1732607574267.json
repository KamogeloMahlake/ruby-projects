    "content": "<p>I was faking being unconscious, but since the attention of the visitor would no doubt be on my poor panicking healer, I kept my eyes cracked open, only to see a sexy redhead enter the room. </p><p>“Aria, why are you alone here?” asked Emma as her eyebrows furrowed, her tone urgent. “Where’s Isolde? She was supposed to be guarding you, even if he’s chained!” </p><p>Aria’s answered with a shrill, panicked tone. “I sent her away!” Luckily, it was her usual reaction to being confronted, which was why Emma didn’t reach with anything other than an exasperated sigh. “She was going to ruin my hard work because of her temper.” </p><p>“I understand,” Emma answered. “But still, you should at least reached me. You shouldn’t stay alone with him. We can’t trust him not to have any trick.” </p><p>Aria’s shoulders stiffened immediately, because while Emma’s words appeared concerned on the surface, her usage of ‘you’ instead of ‘we’, combined with her emphasis, turned it to yet another subtle stab of Aria’s lack of combat ability and her weak personality. </p><p>It was a bitchy move, though it didn’t make it any less true. Emma had used the probability of me escaping as an insult, unaware that I had already made great progress on that front thanks to Isolde’s and Aria’s personalities. </p><p>Also, despite her indignation, Aria yielded immediately rather than pushing back. “I cast a sleep spell on him,” Aria said panickedly, trying to defend herself. I had to keep myself from sighing, because with the interference of the chains, casting such a spell effectively without killing me was very difficult. </p><p>Luckily, Emma was an Elementalist, therefore didn’t know the intricacies of casting healing spells with such a great interference —I only did because I had to cure myself far too many times during my rise to power. Trusted healers were in short supply in Dark Lands. </p><p>However, it wasn’t her lack of suspicion that caught my attention. No, it was the sudden glint of satisfaction in her eyes, one that reminded me of an assassin about to ambush her target, only to find her target passed out drunk. </p><p>Interesting…</p><p>“Are you finished here?” Emma asked, trying to sound casual, but her tone betraying her excitement, one Aria missed easily, distracted by her own distress. “You should go to prepare for dinner then. Her majesty requested your presence,” Emma said, this time a slight bitterness invading her tone. I was willing to guess that she had been left out of yet another dinner invitation, something that frustrated Emma immensely. </p><p>It was a detail that I noticed. As time passed, Emma was being isolated from public events more and more, something I noticed even from my cell based on the schedule of my interrogators during evenings of big events. They weren’t stupid enough to discuss that next to me, of course, but I was willing to bet the cracks I managed to carve in my chains it was Queen Sapphire’s making. She clearly didn’t appreciate an attractive redhead constantly next to her prospective son-in-law, creating gossip. </p><p>Emma hated it, of course. “Yes, I just need to tidy up and lock the door.” </p><p>“I’ll handle it,” said Emma. “You shouldn’t be late.” </p><p>“Okay,” Aria said before she dashed away, in a hurry to disappear, once again making me sad about her preference for long, loose skirts. I would have loved to watch her run away in a short plied skirt. </p><p>I turned my attention to Emma. Her clothes were the first thing I focused on, mainly because of the divergence from her usual style. She was wearing a long skirt not too different from Aria, but her blouse had a deeper cleavage than her usual preference as well as sticking to her body tightly, making me think that the bullshit story I had told Aria wasn’t entirely incorrect. She was probably trying to woo Lancelot when Sapphire decided to use her as an errand girl. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when rather than going away, Emma stayed in the cell, looking at me pensively. She was far too excited —though managing to conceal it from Aria— about the supposed sleep spell on me. That didn’t prevent me from feeling apprehensive when she pulled a small potion bottle from her pocket. </p><p>The lack of killing intent was the only thing that prevented me from making a mad dash to remove my chains despite the impossibility of doing so. However, that made me curious about her objective, especially when she crouched next to me and fed me a potion. </p><p>It surprised me, especially when I used the limited magic I had access to for a quick diagnosis —poison detection was another must-have of the Dark Lord kit, at least if the Dark Lord in question wanted to see the second week of his reign— only to realize it was a simple herbal remedy that would make me sleep rather than a magical potion. Since it didn’t have any magical properties, it wasn’t affected by the chains.</p><p>She sat on the chair and closed her eyes, trying to calm her mind while I quickly dispelled the effects of the herbal sleeping tonic, feeling curious about her plan. I made a point to act like I was asleep, my breathing controlled, occasionally shifting and mumbling as well. Playing possum was another underappreciated art. </p><p>Meanwhile, I decided to give her a bit of shock, and shifted in my ‘sleep’, which displayed the rather impressive tent Aria’s halfway treatment had left behind. Emma’s growing eyes made it worth it, pushing her out of the pensive mode she was feeling. </p><p>She wasn’t the only one to be surprised, though. I was no less shocked when she crouched next to me, Unlike her, however, it was less to do with the erotic implications of the view —through the resulting cleavage was spectacular enough to make my shaft throb— and more about the fact that she had just unlocked my chains. Not letting out a shocked gasp strained my acting abilities, as she just gave me a chance to escape without the slightest prompting. I wondered what she had in mind. </p><p>I received my answer in a moment later, when she forced several potions down my throat, first one to deepen my sleep magically —which I dispelled in an instant thanks to renewed access to magic, easily disguising the flare underneath the magical tribulation the potion had caused. </p><p>Her next action managed to shock me further, because she fed me three bottles of potions to weaken my mental defenses. </p><p>Three bottles of highly illegal and dangerous dark potions… </p><p>It wasn’t my first encounter with those potions —though rarely on the receiving side— so I dispelled their effects with the same ease I had destroyed the earlier sleeping potion. Maybe even easier, because they might be insidious, but they were rather fragile. Still, their effect was highly dangerous, with the possibility of risky complications including memory loss. They didn’t want to use it on me, because they were afraid of my memories about the Sacred Core being compromised. Three of them were dangerous enough to damage my mental abilities permanently if I hadn’t dispelled their effects. </p><p>It seemed that Emma had a different idea. She pressed her hands on my temples, closed her eyes, and flared her magic. A sudden presence pushed against my mental shields. </p><p>I let them collapse under the slightest pressure, suggesting that her plan was successful, amused by her audacity. </p><p>Mind magic was dangerous, even when applied by a master to a complete novice with no magical training. I was far from a layman, and she certainly was not a master, if the clumsy way her consciousness permeated into mine, bright and slow. At that moment, her life was in my hands. Just a flare of my magic, and she would end up brain-dead. </p><p>I didn’t do it, of course. While destroying one of my jailers would have been amusing, it would be a pointless act. Counter-attacking to see her own memories was equally out, because it would put me at her mercy unless I wanted to destroy her completely. </p><p>Feeling curious, I decided to let her play, trying to feel her intention. Her first target was obvious, the location of the treasure, something impossible for her to find with her meager abilities. It wasn’t her fault, though, as even disregarding my vast experience, the home advantage in mind spells was insurmountable. It was hidden in the depths of my mind. They needed to destroy my whole mind to reach that nugget, and considering the fail-safes in my thoughts, it was impossible. </p><p>There was a reason Queen Sapphire never tried that. Why Emma thought a couple of illegal potions would help her succeed, I had no idea. I decided to play with her a bit, though. I created a magical treasure chest in my mind, one with a huge glow and spiky chains, and seven huge locks. I hid it behind a few curtains, but created a path of breadcrumbs for her to follow. It didn’t have any benefits, but tempting her to go around in my mind like a huge treasure hunt was too entertaining to ignore. </p><p>“It’s here,” she murmured excitedly as she found the huge chest, treating me like a useless novice. When her mental presence pressed against the chest, I created seven keys and placed in different memories, before pushing flashes of them into her mental probe after a minute, giving her confidence that she had found the way to unlock my memories. </p><p>Her mental presence dashed forward in my sea of consciousness, uncaring —and probably unaware— of the damage she might have caused if the mental potions had worked as she intended and crippled my mental abilities. Then, she found the first key, sunken into a memory fragment. She let her consciousness permeate it, intending to remove the key…</p><p>Only for a shocked gasp to escape her mouth and jerk out of the memory —a memory of a particularly entertaining night I had spent with one of my lovers. It wasn’t even in my bedroom, but in the middle of the corridor, where any passerby might see me as I rammed my big cock into her entrance…</p><p>Emma didn’t last a second before trying to pull out of my mind hurriedly. I decided to give her a gift, and pushed the memory fragment into her mind as she pulled back —after making sure I copied another instance for myself, of course. She pulled back in hurry, so much that she physically stumbled back, her eyes wide but unfocused while the memory fragment played in her mind again and again. </p><p>She was clearly too shocked to stop it, but along with her shock, a thick blush spread onto her face, while her nipples hardened enough to peek through her blouse thanks to her lack of a corset. I smirked openly, aware that she was not in a state of mind to focus that, not when her gaze fell on my erection after seeing it on work. </p><p>Understandable, as I was rather proud of the effects I had on that memory, slamming inside my lover repeatedly while she cried with pained enjoyment, forcing herself to take my full length. </p><p>Despite her arousal, however, Emma managed to gather her wits in a moment, and pressed her hands against my temple once more, her mental presence immediately rushing to the projection of the chest. She pulled the key from the memory fragment, but as she did so, her arousal pulsated in my mind —another disadvantage of a mental probe, unless the attacker put good care, they might reveal much more than they intended to. </p><p>When she touched the lock with the key and the lock evaporated alongside the key, her elation shone, her arousal dimming slightly. Still, despite that, her determination was flickering.  </p><p>I wondered whether she had the courage to continue? </p>",

    "content": "<p>I waited for a minute for Penny to get her breathing back, though I would be lying if I didn’t like the way she struggled to breathe after an extended deep-throat session, even though it was cruel of me to make her first blowjob experience such a difficult one. On the positive note, I created a delicious baseline for her to address. </p><p>My smile widened when she finally lifted her head, only to look confused, like she wasn’t sure where her own arousal was coming from. And her arousal was still alive and burning thick. </p><p>A perfect expression to immortalize, I suddenly decided. </p><p>“Stand up, honey,” I ordered her even as I presented her with my hand to help her stand up. “We have a lot of work to do.” </p><p>She grabbed my hand, both her hands and her legs still shaking on the aftermath of the exhausting play, barely able to lift herself enough to sit on the hood of the car once more. “Can I have some water,” she asked. </p><p>“To drink or to clean yourself?” I asked. </p><p>Her blush was answer enough, but she still stammered and answer. “T-to clean myself.” </p><p>“Then you need to wait for a moment, I have some interesting photos to take first.” I raised the camera before continuing. “Smile.” </p><p>Despite her shocked expression, she followed my order, and a smile appeared on her face. It was a confused, hesitant one, but I still took several pictures. That expression might not be as impressive when it came to setting things up, but in her current state —exhausted and covered with my cum— it had a much better energy, worthy of being immortalized. </p><p>“Now, smile wider, and I want one of your arms pressing against the hood, the other on your stomach. Keep your legs crossed,” I said, giving her several directions rapidly. She followed them, and I added several corrections, some necessary, some purely to distract her a bit from the sheer pornography of the situation to give her more natural poses. </p><p>And it worked. After several more photos, her expression looked much more natural, arousal dancing just behind the surface. I decided to push that mood to the limit. “Excellent,” I said. “Now, both hands on your breasts.” She was quick to raise them cup her breasts, hiding them from the view —though not very effectively with her delicate hands. </p><p>“Not like that,” I corrected her, my tone exasperated like a teacher might have after seeing a pupil making the same mistake despite repeated explanation. And Penny blushed and flinched, reacting like an enthusiastic student. Perfect for my objectives. “I don’t want you to cover your breasts, I want you to play with them. Let your fingers sink into your flesh, play with your nipples, draw circles… Give me something interesting to work with, honey.” </p><p>She said nothing, but despite her blush, her hands followed my directions, and started mauling and squeezing her own breasts with a practiced ease enough to make my shaft rock hard once more. Her eyes fell down, examining my length —visible since I hadn’t bothered to put my pants back on after her spectacular service. </p><p>There was a practiced ease in her movements, suggesting that she might have fairly inexperienced when it came to sex, but the situation was quite different when it came to playing with herself. </p><p>And she was sensitive. Just a minute after she started playing with her breasts, her hesitancy and fear disappeared. Her cries joined to the monotonous clicks of the camera, making the scene much more enjoyable. Even better, she started to change poses unprompted, showing an initiative she had never shown before, and I pressed my shutter madly, trying to immortalize the amazing scenes she was generating just by playing with her breasts. </p><p>She might not be a natural model, but she was a natural pornstar… </p><p>Noticing my excitement, she blushed shyly, which only added to the beauty of the scene. Despite her shyness, she scooped some of my cum from her breasts and brought it to her mouth, sucking it gently, not neglecting to moan loudly. “You’re a masterpiece,” I exclaimed enthusiastically, impressed with her initiative. “Give me more.” </p><p>“As you wish,” she gasped, and leaned down while she pushed her breast up, until she captured her own nipple, sucking furiously, But the real surprise came when she parted her legs, revealing her treasure, stiff puffy after my merciless pounding earlier. Her moans got louder as her fingers disappeared deeper, her thumb teasing her clit with a practiced ease.</p><p>“You’re a wonder, a marvel of beauty,” I gasped even as moved closer, recording every inch of her body as she desperately fingered her body, But my focus was on her face, transforming every second with the build up of pleasure. At that moment, I was glad that I didn’t bother to put my pants back on, because it would have delayed my next action. Without a warning, I grabbed her wrist and forcibly pulled her fingers off her tits, only to replace them with my shaft, slamming mercilessly. </p><p>“Oh, yes!” she moaned, both hands on her tits once more as I impaled her mercilessly, the sound of flesh hitting flesh filling the opening. Her expression lost the last hint of reservation, filled with a wanton joy instead. I once again flicked the camera to record mode, immortalizing every twitch, every micro expression, every move. </p><p>I needed to keep her with me, I decided, maybe even signing an exclusivity contract to own her image to prevent her from working with anyone else without a hefty price —a price a competitor wouldn’t pay. I canceled my plans to —eventually— recommend her to my friends, because they were no different than me. Even the ones with different tastes would still do their best to use her as a chip to gain favor from their bosses or their clients. </p><p>Penny was mine, I suddenly decided. </p><p>“I’m cumming,” I warned her, despite having no intention of pulling out. After all, I had decided to make her mine. What better way to mark that decision than marking her in the most special way possible. </p><p>Her reaction surprised me, though not in a bad way. Her legs were suddenly wrapped around my waist, pulling me deeper. “Fill me in!” she moaned, lost in pleasure. I could never disappoint her like that, so I sprayed in, triggering another climax in her as well. I had no intention of pulling back, but her legs, still wrapped around my body, didn’t give me a chance in any case. </p><p>I stayed in, enjoying her warmth, while she rode yet another orgasm. I examined her body, thinking just how much money I could have made if I just convinced her to do porn. </p><p>Pity that I was too possessive. </p><p>Wrapped in her warmth, it wasn’t a surprise when my shaft was resurrected in a record speed. But instead of slamming into her once more, I leaned in and whispered. “Maybe we should call a day, you look exhausted,” I whispered in my throatiest tone. </p><p>“N-no,” she shuddered dazedly, like stopping at this point would have been the worst thing she could imagine… </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked, even as I put my hand on her lower stomach, just where her most sensitive spot ended, caressing gently. “You do look exhausted.” </p><p>“Please!” she whimpered desperately, loud enough to echo. “I need it, please,” she repeated. </p><p>“Your wishes, my command,” I repeated as I plunged myself into her deepest crevices, extracting another beautiful cry, hot enough to melt the ice. Her body, filled with desire, just arched back, enjoying the assault. Under other circumstances, I might have been a bit annoyed with her passive participation, but today, Penny deserved my attention. </p><p>I could always train her to be better another day. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean that she would not have anything to push. “Cry for me,” I ordered. “Cry for me as loud as you can. Tell me how you feel!” </p><p>“I feel amazing!” she cried in an earth-shattering volume, leveraging the fact that we were alone here to the limit. “I never believed that a pleasure at this level was possible. Do me harder!” she cried, each word getting out more and more slurred. </p><p>“Damn, girl,” I said even as I slapped her tit, making her tighten even more even as the sound echoed. She was really sensitive at her breasts. I grabbed her nipple with one hand, twisting, squeezing, and pulling with great impact, while the other dug into her firm flesh, hard enough to leave several red marks, but all in the areas that would have been covered by a normal bra. </p><p>We still had a lot of photos to take together, after all… </p><p>I could feel her getting close to a climax, so I decided to slow down a bit, pushing into her with slow, measured beats, turning her cries into lingering gasps, less loud, but no less sexier. </p><p>When her legs loosened around my waist, I decided to change things a bit. I pulled out despite the reluctant cry from her, but that was replaced by an excited yelp when I grabbed and lifted her legs, giving me an even better angle to impale her while testing her flexibility at the same time —and she got full marks. </p><p>One of my hands was enough to hold her legs up, so the other shifted down to her ass, which was no less generous than her tits, and started slapping softly but rhythmically, adding a new quality to her enthusiastic moans. The time lost its meaning as I slammed her again and again.</p><p>Seeing that she made no protest, I started slapping her ass even harder, enjoying the way it wobbled and trembled with every touch. Soon, she started to shudder under the effect of an earthquake, one strong enough to leave her a half-drunk, trembling mess, and her tightening was enough to get me accompany her alongside her spectacular journey of joy. </p><p>“Do you want it inside, or-” I started, only to cut by a very loud reply. </p><p>“Inside!” she shouted, at the same time, her walls were tightening to such a degree that I doubted I could have pulled out even if I wished so…  This time, I was too exhausted to continue —at least for the next couple of hours— and she was no better position. So, I pulled out, once again pulling my camera and focusing on immortalizing the way she collapsed against the car, my seed slowly sipping down from her legs into the hood of the car. I needed to wash it before dropping it back, I decided sardonically. </p><p>Or even better, make Penny wash it in their backyard, already imagining the incredible view it would create. </p><p>When she finally managed to gather enough energy to stand up, I was standing in front of her with a bottle of water. “Why don’t you clean yourself, sweetie,” I said as I passed that along with a towel, but added when she just reached for the towel, “Impress me.” </p><p>The smile she sent back was no less flirty. Apparently, being fucked to the point of unconsciousness repeatedly worked wonders for shyness. Who would have thought? </p><p>But when she arched her back to perfectly frame her tits, her face giving the perfect shot of erotism, I abandoned my self back-patting and focused on the view. She let the water to spill over her body slowly, following her curves, leaving a trail of wetness behind. “Is this okay,” she asked between gasps, while letting her fingers slowly trace the edges of her breasts, driving me crazy. </p><p>Downstairs, I could feel my shaft stirring once more, making me revise my earlier assumption about requiring a few hours to regain its functionality. However, as tempting was the idea of bending her over against the car again, but watching her slowly clean herself in the sexiest way possible with the assistance of a water bottle and a flimsy towel was not something to be missed. She slowly dragged it on her face, finally getting rid of my mark —a bit sad, but inevitable as we needed to go back to the traffic soon— then shifted to her breasts and stomach, cleaning them slowly. </p><p>And if her hand occasionally disappeared between her legs or several cries escaped from her beautiful lips as she meticulously cleaned herself… </p><p>Well… the photos were for my private collection in any case. </p><p>“And that’s it,” I called, and Penny smiled pridefully, then suddenly looked around, then looked down on her body, and a full body blush exploded. With the end of the shoot, the spell was broken, leaving her without an excuse to rely on against the assault of her memories. Somehow, that made her look innocent and sexy at the same time… </p><p>After chuckling at her dilemma, I opened the hood once more, and picked some clothes for her. It was a difficult choice as my preference was to keep her naked, which, unfortunately, was not an option for the crowded road we were about to rejoin. Maybe one day if we decide to take a long mountain trip together… </p><p>In the end, I decided on a flimsy white top that covered barely more area than a bra —and doing that part particularly worse than the average bra due to its flimsy fabric— and a pair of jean shorts that ended well above what was appropriate, leaving half of her ass naked. </p><p>“Are you sure?” she muttered, her shyness suddenly back as she looked at the ensemble, which made me as happy as her earlier wanton behavior did. It was good to see her reaction when she was aroused, but I liked playing with shy Penny even more. </p><p>“Don’t worry, we will be going fast enough for anyone to take note, and I’m going to drop you at your house, so no problem,” I said. </p><p>“If you say so,” she murmured as she pulled them on rapidly, while my eyes were stuck on her chest, especially the way her flimsy top stuck against her still damp skin, somehow making her even more erotic than her naked state. I decided to let it be, as we were driving a convertible. The wind would dry it in a moment. </p><p>I sat on the driver’s seat, and she took the passenger seat. “Are you ready for a fun drive?” I asked, but as I sat, I felt uncomfortable. Due to the earlier sight, my shaft was still rock hard, making sitting down very uncomfortable. </p><p>Luckily, I was driving through the abandoned country-side, in a beautiful red convertible, with an even more beautiful blonde on my passenger seat. Solving a problem like an inconvenient boner was trivial. With one hand, I pulled down my zipper, while my other hand found Penny’s hair and pulled her down. A moment later, I pressed the gas pedal, Penny’s enthusiastic tongue wrapped around my shaft.</p><p>Life was truly grand… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I took a deep breath as I stood in front of Titania’s private office, trying to still my nerves. Instead of wearing my library costume, I chose a simple rugged shirt and pants, the kind the menial servants wore. At this point, I didn’t want to emphasize the fact that I had been hiding under her nose for the last few years, though I wouldn’t hide it if she noticed as well. It was a weird balance to maintain. </p><p>“Come in,” called Titania, but she used the quintessential head librarian, sharp, cold, and unyielding. Not a good start. </p><p>For a moment, I considered whether disappearing was the smarter option. My subterfuge was high enough —especially with the assistance of the most recent stat upgrades— to make me disappear in any city other than the school itself, so much that even her network couldn’t find me. </p><p>Ultimately, it was just an errant thought. The necromancer threat was one thing, and the mysteries my achievements were continuously alluding to was another thing I needed to solve; and soon, if instincts were correct. So, I took a deep breath to gather my courage, and opened the door. </p><p>Only to find Titania sitting behind an impressive desk, its surface covered with books, ranging from destruction to warding. She stood impervious behind the desk, her eyes cold in their steely look, a thick robe wrapped around her, hiding her body perfectly. “Sit down,” she said in a tone that was devoid of any emotion. </p><p>An ordinary person might have felt the stirrings of despair at her impervious action, but I felt the stirrings of excitement as I sat on the chair she had pointed, which was considerably lower and flimsier than her own. I was excited, because she was too calculated in trying to be intimidating, which ran contrary to her usual demeanor. Normally, she was scary, just because of her overwhelming presence. </p><p>She was overcompensating, and there was only one probable reason for it. Even under the emotionally-oppressive effects of her Light Magic, she was still somehow affected by the memories we shared in that particular cave while I helped her to relax. </p><p>I decided to test it. “Before we start, there’s something I had forgotten to give you,” I said as I pulled the book from my sack, the book that she had went all the trouble to find, only end up in a deadly ambush. </p><p>“You got it,” she gasped in shock, reaching forward without a thought and grabbed it. I made sure to shift my touch at the last moment, making our fingers brush. The fleeting blush that appeared on her face before she pulled the book was all the confirmation I needed that the memories of the event was still alive and effective. Then, she continued in a more even tone. “I appreciate your efforts.” </p><p>“Sure thing,” I answered, repressing my desire to ask for a special reward. It wasn’t the time yet. “So, necromancers?” I asked. </p><p>“They are the pests of the earth that we need to exterminate with extreme prejudice,” she said, her anger flaring for a moment before her emotionless state asserted itself once more. She continued in a more even tone. “For the last few years, they are getting more and more daring, mostly trying to ambush me during my missions. During my last mission, they managed to interfere when I was fighting against a monster horde attacking a town, managing to damage me with a cursed dagger. Even with the best healers, it took a while for me to get well.” </p><p>It was probably the reason for her disappearance. But the sight of her fighting against a monster horde, covering the landscape with light blasts to drown crowds of creatures again and again, was an image sexy enough to turn me on. I didn’t give any sign of my thoughts, and answered professionally. “It’s a dangerous prospect, getting stabbed in the back while defending against such a formidable danger. It was just like the necromancers to broke that taboo.” </p><p>Monster hordes were the single most dangerous phenomenon humanity had been facing against. The reason for their occurrence varied. Sometimes, it was a particularly effective monster leading or controlling the horde, sometimes they were escaping the territory of a Titan level monster, only to lash out something on their way. Sometimes, they even popped in existence without no rhyme or reason —at least not one humanity could discover— and destroyed everything on their path until they finally came across one they couldn’t destroy, still struggling until they were smashed into pieces. Sabotaging the defense efforts was a taboo with the harshest punishment possible. </p><p>Though, considering Necromancers had earned that same punishment just by existing, it was easy to understand why they weren’t bothered taking action under such circumstances. </p><p>“That’s not good news,” I said. “Do you think it was a target of opportunity, or it was planned?” I asked, despite having confidence in my guess that it was the latter. </p><p>“It was planned,” she answered. “The skeleton knight was buried at the center of the defensive formation, and covered with multiple wards to hide its presence. Without accessing the defense schematics, it was impossible to do. I had been wondering how they did, then you discovered a mysterious figure controlling a necrotic shade in the Faculty building.” </p><p>“Yeah, that is not good news. Any idea about the identity?” </p><p>“No, and I don’t have anyone to help either. What if I tried to talk to someone, and they were the contact?” </p><p>I paused for a moment. I was happy with her discussing her concerns with me openly, though I was probably the only one that she could trust on the issue. After all, I was the one that saved her from a certain death in the hands of necromancers, which made me the only option for her to discuss the next steps. Of course, the fact that she had barely survived an assassination attempt in another mission probably had some effect on her decision as well. </p><p>Not to mention my unique ability to transfer mana! </p><p>“How about the headmistress?” I asked, referring to the enigmatic figure I had seen only once, during a graduation speech. “If she is on their side, we had already lost.” </p><p>“I don’t think that she’s on their side, but the same doesn’t apply the people around her,” she explained. “If I contact her, I need to do that in a way that doesn’t evoke any suspicion, and she rarely meets the faculty privately.” </p><p>“Maybe I can try to reach her?” I offered, despite not wanting to do so. Revealing myself to yet another person was the last thing I needed, but the more I learned about the necromancers, the more I was getting apprehensive, to a point that I was willing to expand the number of people that knew about me. </p><p>Though luckily, the headmistress didn’t have to know anything true about me, other than I was a strong warrior or mage —or maybe I could present myself as an assassin— saved the life of one of her teachers and trusted by her. I just needed to sneak into her room and manage to have a talk with her without being blasted into smithereens. </p><p>Easy task. </p><p>“Maybe,” she answered noncommittally. “I need to consider it more throughly before deciding on an action.” </p><p>“Is there anything else I can help you?” I asked. </p><p>She paused for a moment. “Not for now, but I’ll make sure to leave you a note if we need to talk,” she added. “When I get a new mission, I will need a backup.” </p><p>I nodded. It was a sensible request. With the agreement in place, we talked for a couple more minutes, agreeing on several signals and locations to drop discreet messages in case we didn’t have the opportunity to talk face to face on an emergency. </p><p>I bid her a good night and left, surprised by the mundanity of the meeting. I was tempted to suggest testing my mana transfer skill, but I held back for two reason. First, under all of her stiffness, she was still skittish. Second, and more importantly, I had no idea how I would measure against her Light Magic while she still had all of her mana, and didn’t want to risk it. Sooner or later, we were going to fight together, and she would need some extra mana to support… </p><p>Still, the night was young, and since I had left Helga enjoying a very deserved sleep. Luckily, I had another busty blonde friend that I hadn’t visited for the last few days. </p><p>I changed my path toward the Marianne’s room, intent on delivering a surprise visit. I even stopped in front of Cornelia’s room, sliding a note of invitation before moving forward. The note asked her to visit Marianne’s room, but dress normally rather than in her maid costume. I was tempted to humiliate her, but after a brief consideration, I decided against. Not only humiliating Cornelia next to her girlfriend —though my presence had muddied that term a lot— was not the best strategy to endear myself to either of them, but also that particular part of the training would be better under different circumstances. </p><p>After that brief detour, I arrived at Marianne’s door. As usual, neither the mundane nor the magical locks on her door helped as I opened the door, easily hiding myself from the view, even in a corridor filled with students of magic. </p><p>When I sneaked inside, I saw that Marianne was alone, on her desk, focused intently on a book in front of her. I carefully sneaked forward, careful not to alert her, and slipped to her dining room. Since I had already been there, I knew where the important things were, such as the wine bottles, glasses, and the cheese to accompany. I quickly prepared a small feast for us to enjoy in her bedroom, while she was still in her study, focused on her book, unaware of my presence. </p><p>I could have called for her, but I decided to make a flashier transition. I quickly dressed down to my birthday suit —as my musclebound body made a much better view than my ugly servant clothes— and slipped under her covers. Then I waved my hand, lighting several candles to create a romantic atmosphere before slowly dimming the lights in her study, until the shining candles were the only light available, creating an intriguing trail for her to follow.</p><p>Her tenseness was visible when she stepped into her bedroom, an arcana spell twisting in her hand, ready to be launched, but it dissipated the moment she noticed my enticing presence, my naked torso glistening with the flickering candlelight, with her covers strategically pulled to the beginning of my abs, showing my muscles to the best effect while hiding the most critical part of my anatomy, leaving the responsibility of uncovering it had fallen to her. </p><p>“Caesar,” she gasped, excitement easily replacing her earlier trepidation. “Such a welcome surprise, but I wish you have notified me about your arrival, I would have prepared for you.” She gestured herself, her face without makeup, her hair casually gathered into a ponytail, wearing a casual thick nightie that made a good attempt to hide her body. It still failed, of course, as her curves were not so ordinary to yield her nightie’s mundane attempts, but the attempt was good enough to make her uncomfortable. </p><p>“Don’t worry, princess, you’re beautiful even when you’re dressed casually.” It was not the most impressive compliment, but with my charisma, it made her blush prettily. </p><p>“Still,” she murmured shyly, before she raised her head, a surprising level of assertiveness shining in her blue eyes. “Give me fifteen minutes,” she said. Without waiting for an answer, she ran to her wardrobe, pulled several items —and hiding them behind her body to conceal their nature— before she dashed away without waiting for a response. </p><p>I watched her surprising display of initiative with an amused smile, then lay on my back, enjoying the softness of her bed. Maybe I should ask her to buy another one. My room was in a desperate need for a better mattress. </p><p>I was enjoying the warm touch of quality red wine when I felt the ward I had left at the door triggering, but a follow up mirror spell showed that it was Cornelia, following my invitation. I cast a simple arcana spell, and glowing letters appeared in her field of view, asking her to come to the bedroom, but make sure to stay silent. I even added a couple of arrows to create a path for her to follow. I even silenced the bedroom, keeping Marianne unaware, wanting to surprise her further. </p><p>Then, Cornelia appeared in the bedroom, wearing an oversized robe that covered her whole body, her arms tight around as if she was trying to hide herself in case of accidental reveal, making me curious about what lay underneath. I gestured her to undress, and she did so without complaint, revealing that she was wearing a black lace set, designed in the same shape with a corset, but soft enough to wrap her body perfectly. It wasn’t like her body needed the support. Even more beautiful was the bite mark I had left on her shoulder the last time, suggesting my dominance. Surprisingly, she didn’t try to hide, nor she flinched when my gaze found it. She was showing a surprising ability to accept her new circumstances. </p><p>Still, despite the amazing view, it took everything to prevent a frown from appearing on my face. </p><p>[More than 5 levels of difference! No Experience]</p><p>It was a completely new notification, and considering I was banking on the experience I would receive from her to push for a new level, rather untimely as well. I didn’t know it was a feature that always existed or it was a consequence of passing level twenty barrier, but nonetheless, it was unwelcome. </p><p>Luckily, I was already planning to solve her leveling problem, which in turn would help me help me increase mine. And there was no point in delaying that. </p><p>I patted the bed, inviting her in. She walked forward without the slightest reluctance. Finally receiving an achievement must have broke most of her concerns. And compared to making her work as a maid, inviting her for a romantic evening was a much better option. </p><p>“Why the sudden change?” she whispered, unable to help herself as she closed in, making sure to walk seductively. </p><p>“You have been a good girl yesterday, and good girls get rewarded,” I said to her, and she blushed, easily accepting the power imbalance inherit in my words. She was surprising me with the ease she had been showing. “Not to mention we have distressed our mutual blonde friend during our little scuffle.” </p><p>“You’re right,” she murmured enthusiastically as she slid next to me, her body heat tempting me to ignore my earlier words and taste the fruits of her offerings. From the way her eyes were trailing my muscles hungrily, she clearly shared the same opinion. </p><p>“Good,” I said even as I wrapped one arm around her waist, pulling her tight against my naked body, enjoying the sensation of her body pressing against mine. “So, are you happy with your new achievement?” I asked. </p><p>Her response was a lingering kiss, with a level of enthusiasm I would never expect from her a day ago, giving me insights about her personality much more than her fake dominant bluster. She wanted to be taken care of, and by solving her biggest problem, I proved myself as the best candidate. </p><p>I was going to test that, to see just how much I could push my newfound dominance, but not today. No, today was a reward for them. For Cornelia, her surrender. For Marianne, enabling it to happen. Not to mention, they deserved a reward for starting everything. If it wasn’t for their horniness, I would be still struggling to as a pathetic weakling stuck in level one. </p><p>Marianne signaled her arrival with a gasp. I turned to look at her, who was watching the scene with wide eyes —and a clear arousal— while Cornelia chose to speak. “Nice dress, honey,” she said. </p><p>I agreed. Marianne was wearing a white corset —a proper one unlike Cornelia. However, hers had one major modification. It ended just under her breasts, leaving her nipples naked while still supporting her already-perky breasts to the perfection, presenting them like a shelf. Her soft make up and new hairdo just enhanced the effect. </p><p>“Thanks,” Marianne murmured to answer Cornelia’s question, while I patted my other side, inviting her to the bed, and to an amazing show. </p><p>It was going to be a long, beautiful night… </p><p>————</p><p>[Level: 21    Experience: 228100 / 231000 </p><p>Strength: 26    Charisma: 36</p><p>Precision: 19    Perception: 23</p><p>Agility: 23     Manipulation: 28</p><p>Speed: 21       Intelligence: 28</p><p>Endurance: 20      Wisdom: 30</p><p>HP: 2289 / 2289\tMana: 3045 / 3045        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>When I finally arrived back to my room, the corridors were burning golden with the golden rays of dusk. I carefully sneaked into my room, not wanting to wake Helga up. </p><p>I was exhausted, and as much as I was tempted to slide next to Helga and bury myself to her bosom —very inviting in its naked state, barely covered by the blanket— but I had a lot of things to do. </p><p>With a sigh, I pulled some of the materials from the golden lions, and after a brief period of refining to make sure they lost their organic properties and condensed into magic crystals —my way of doing that was very inefficient, but finding an expert was unfortunately not an option— and started waving a complicated web of magic around them, connecting four corners of the room. </p><p>I didn’t use any attack spells, or other dangerous tricks. At this point, hiding from or delaying any possible attacker was much more important than actually killing them. There were two options that would go enough effort to break through all the stealth and shielding charms I had integrated into the structure, either it was the faculty itself that tried to enter my room, in that case killing one of them would have no benefit other than ensuring their enmity, or it might be the necromancers trying to deal with me silently, and in that case, a simple alarm would be enough to get the attention of the faculty to deal with them. </p><p>Either way, a passive scheme was much more important than an active one, so I continued working on that. And one instance of mana regeneration perk still active, I didn’t really care about wasting mana. Focused on the construction, I was startled when I heard Helga speak. “Impressive work,” she gasped in amazement. </p><p>“Yeah, after screwing up plans of several necromancers, I think that there’s merit in making sure I have adequate protection.” </p><p>“Without a doubt,” she answered before she started examining the structure itself. “Did you make these yourself?” she asked, pointing at the ward keystones at the corners. </p><p>“Yes, from golden lion bones, freshly hunted,” I said, shamelessly bragging. To be fair, killing six of them was definitely worthy of a brag. </p><p>Helga chose to focus on a different aspect of it. “And you hunted them alone or…” she said, letting her words trail off. </p><p>“Nope, Aviada was with me,” I said shamelessly, meeting her jealous gaze with a glare of my own even though my hands were busy trying to layer another anti-scrying spell. </p><p>“You could have woken me up,” she said, pouting. I didn’t know the impression she wanted to generate, but considering she was completely naked, relying a blanket to cover her bottom half while her breasts stood in front of me deliciously visible, it worked like a playful call for sex. </p><p>I leaned down and kissed her, not neglecting to inject a lot of mana in the process, which returned her as some extra experience. “I could have, but it’s not like you actually need to hunt anymore, do you?” </p><p>[-104 Mana]</p><p>“I guess so,” she answered, her breath lost after the heated kiss. “But doesn’t it also apply for that slut?” she added, unable to resist the temptation to insult Aviada, but her tone lacked any real animosity. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I answered. “She’s too much of a hothead to actually trust with that secret, especially since I doubt she would understand its full significance. She’s not as bright as you.” I made sure to compliment her in the end, which put a smile on her face. Despite her impressive abilities and amazing intellect, she still suffered from a lack of confidence, so reinforcing her position through compliments was a good idea. </p><p>She said nothing for a while I continued to establish layer after layer of protection, watching intently. Considering her nakedness, it made good watching. “How about if you use a seven-point structure to connect the lower layers?” she asked a while later. </p><p>I briefly considered it, and unsurprisingly, I realized that she was correct. Not only she was smart, but also she wasn’t confident enough to offer opinion until she was sure that it was correct, so I wasn’t really surprised at her accuracy. “Amazing idea, as usual,” I answered, and she blushed. “By the way, how many experience you have received from the latest mana rush?” </p><p>“Sixty-three,” she answered. “You shouldn’t waste that much mana in the middle of setting wards,” she added. </p><p>“Nope, it was just eighty mana,” I answered, watching her eyes widen in shock as she understood the implications.</p><p>“How?” she asked.</p><p>“You didn’t think I went hunting for the fun of it, right?” I asked with a smirk. “I have a much better idea what I’m doing after watching Aviada gain a level.” </p><p>“You did that to surprise me?” she asked with a gasp, excitement back on her face. I nodded, as while she wasn’t entirely correct, she was mostly correct. Without saying anything, she jumped up to her feet and kissed me heatedly, her hands immediately around my pants, freeing my shaft even as she continued to kiss me. </p><p>I was tempted to respond, but my hands were busy layering magic around the room. “You deserve a reward,” she said as she lowered herself, and wrapped her lips around my shaft without prompting. As she bobbed her head, pleasure spread through my body, making it difficult to concentrate on the ward scheme.</p><p>Luckily, after slowing down my construction speed, I was more than capable of enjoying Helga’s enthusiastic treatment and working at the same time. After a couple of minutes, I even started to inject mana to our little game, allowing Helga to grind level in a way that we both enjoyed. I spent thousands of mana, but luckily, one instance of my regeneration was still active. </p><p>[-3620 Mana]</p><p>“I’m coming,” I whispered, warning her about the impending explosion. She pulled herself back a bit, but kept the crown in her mouth, so when I exploded, she managed to swallow almost all of my mana-laden seed, triggering an expansion of her soul space in the process.</p><p>[-1370 Mana]</p><p>[Mana: 160 / 2700]</p><p>However I didn’t care that I almost emptied my mana pool, because the following notification was more than worth it, once again rewarding me greatly for actually discovering the abilities related to my original way of leveling. Yet another mystery I need to solve, but I was more than happy with the quality of the clues I was receiving. </p><p>[Achievement: Alternative Advancement. Make love, not war! Just like you have done for centuries. +2 to All, +10000 Experience]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Grandmaster Melee (Requires 5 Points), Master Elemental, Master Tantric] </p><p>I couldn’t help but frown at the points required for Grandmaster level improvement. If I chose that, it would mean no new skill points for the next four levels while that skill fully matured. What a waste. It was the main reason why I believed a wider expertise was the more rational choice, even though the Grandmaster improvement gave a total of fifty points rather than usual twenty-five. Of course, considering it required five levels, it meant a measly ten points each level. </p><p>Naturally, I chose Tantric once more. Master Elemental was tempting as well, but Tantric gave me the key to discover more about the System itself, and the benefits from that was impossible to overstate. </p><p>Helga, on the other hand, had just finished swallowing my seed and stood up, enthusiastic for more. She turned her back to me, and looked at my construct. “What do you think about building connection points in layers,” she asked as she examined my construct in more detail, followed by a gasp. </p><p>She gasped, because as she examined the structure of the matrix, she took a step back, aligning her entrance perfectly with my shaft. Feeling her warmth around my length, I pushed my hips forward, enjoying her moans. “Do you think it might cause an interference?” I asked, enjoying the way she tightened further. She was really enjoying the opportunity to have sex and discuss magical theory simultaneously. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 73%]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>[-26 Mana]</p><p>“No, they will be stabilized by overlapping effect, invalidating the possibility of interference,” she explained, though her explanation was interrupted by rapid moans as I started rocking my lips recklessly. For once, I was pushing for a quick explosion, because I wanted to activate the second instance of mana regeneration, which would help increasing her leveling speed. Grinding with such a speed with no risk was not an opportunity to be wasted. </p><p>“Good point, and if we set up an additional connection between node five and nine, we can stabilize the structure thirty percent,” I added, even as I carefully stopped casting from my right hand, continuing with one hand. I did so, because I wanted my right hand free to enjoy her naked body. Not digging into her beautiful breasts was a great loss, so I fixed that. </p><p>“It might work, especially if we add an amplifier in between to leverage the connection further,” she answered even as she trembled, stumbling hard enough to fall if it wasn’t for my grabbing. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 75% - Third Stage Completed +15000 Exp]</p><p>[New Perk: Skill Share]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Relationship not sufficient for the Fourth Stage]</p><p>She gasped as she lost her concentration for a bit, understandable, as I could feel her soul space changing as she received yet another achievement —a big one with significant boost to her mental stats if I was feeling the changes correctly. I let her enjoy the experience while I focused on the joy of receiving a brand new perk, feeling curious what exactly it was. </p><p>Well, I was about to find out if it activated the same way my mana regeneration perk did.</p><p>I sped up, pushing recklessly as I searched for release, which didn’t take long to finally attain. I exploded in joy, filling her with mana along with the usual liquid, losing every scrap I managed to regenerate in the process, dropping my remaining mana to single digits.  </p><p>[-265 Mana]</p><p>[Mana Regeneration perk activated. Count 2. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>[+1 Tantric] </p><p>Then, I felt myself almost forcibly being pulled into her soul space, until I touched one of her skills, with corresponding changes happening in my soul space. Or more accurately, just outside my soul space, creating a vessel similar to the skill I had just touched. It was the same skill she had chosen to improve. </p><p>[Skill Share perk activated. Target Skill: Expert Magical Theory. Copied: Duration, 24 hours]</p><p>[Temporary Skill: Basic Magical Theory (25/25)]</p><p>A sudden clarity appeared in my mind, allowing me to make previously-impossible connection between different schools of magic, even leveraging my other abilities like Melee and Subterfuge. Helga probably had advanced level if it completed, with expert track just started. Her prodigious instincts toward the areas of magic she didn’t even use herself suddenly made more sense. </p><p>With the connections made, I turned my attention back to the ward scheme, and started making rapid changes, making the structure several times stronger. </p><p>“It seems that I wasn’t the only one that just received some interesting benefits,” Helga murmured as she tried to catch her breath, still leaning against me, my right arm wrapped around her waist to keep her from falling. </p><p>“Yeah, I just received a new perk that allows me to temporarily copy a skill of yours, and I just got Basic Magical Theory. I have to say, it helps a great deal,” I said before leaning and giving her a long, drawn out, thank you kiss. </p><p>“Happy to hear,” she murmured she answered before extending the kiss, and we enjoyed an extended moment. </p><p>“So,” I murmured after we disconnected for a long breath. “Do you have anything urgent for today?” </p><p>“Nothing I can’t do tomorrow,” she answered. “You?”</p><p>“Not until the evening, where I will meet with the Head Librarian,” I answered even as I squeezed her harder. “So, there’s nothing that prevent us staying here all day long, working on … warding the room?” </p><p>She didn’t answer. More accurately, she didn’t answer verbally. Pushing me to my bed and straddling my lap was answer enough. We spent rest of the way wrapped around each other, sometimes working on the warding scheme, sometimes focusing my mana on leveling her further. I had drained my mana pool an staggering number of times, only for it to be refilled back again thanks to my active regeneration perk, though toward the end, the part I received from Aviada expired, slowing down the process a bit. But with great result, as Helga gained another level in the process, while I maximized my new skill. </p><p>[+23 Tantric] </p><p>When the sun finally set, the only reason we were still able to move was the generous amount of healing spells I had used, keeping our bodies on top shape. Even then, Helga was mentally exhausted. And two levels she had received during the day surely didn’t help her exhaustion. It was why I stopped using Tantric toward the end, just to give her soul space a chance to settle before she received another level. </p><p>For me, endless sex made my thoughts even sharper, though it wasn’t that surprising considering the source of my powers. </p><p>“I just received another achievement,” Helga murmured lazily as I collapsed next to her. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. </p><p>“Yeah, I just received three more endurance points, basically doubling it,” she answered, underlining just how poor her physical stats were. Luckily, system took our extended activities as an opportunity to boost her physical aspects. </p><p>“Good news, maybe you can last all day without healing spells on two digits,” I quipped, only to receive a playful slap to my chest. She sighed as we cuddled, enjoying the euphoria of a day filled with supernaturally-enhanced sex. </p><p>“Do you have a plan for your meeting,” she asked, dispelling the question I had in mind. </p><p>“I have some ideas, but it all depends on Titania’s reaction. I don’t know just how strong her emotions will be affected after a day of rest. If she returns to her previous mood, I doubt that anything other than cold logic will affect her.” </p><p>“Maybe you should find another ambush,” Helga said with a chuckle. I was amused by the ease she had accepted Titania’s presence, contrasting with the constant needling about Aviada —even though at this point it was pretty low-key. Maybe it was the hero worship she had toward Titania. I shrugged, as regardless of the reason, I was happy with the output. </p><p>“Yeah, they are at every corner,” I quipped. </p><p>“Aren’t they?” Helga answered with a chuckle. I laughed as well, despite the danger her words implied. After all, we went out for extended hunting trips two times, coming across necromancers on both of them. Either we were supremely unlucky, or there was a big danger about to happen. </p><p>“Maybe,” I answered with a sigh. “I’m sure Titania has a better idea about the risk. You finished copying the book, right?” </p><p>“I did, which was a very grueling work. Quite few of the letters had magical imprints that encripted further information. I copied them to the best of my ability, but I can’t guarantee that they are correct.” </p><p>“That’s a trade-off we have to take,” I answered even as I stood up, and used a water spell to imitate a shower. Not the most pleasurable thing, but markedly better than going to see Titania while still smelling sweat and sex. I kissed her one last time and whispered. </p><p>“Wish me luck…” </p><p>———————</p><p>[Level: 21    Experience: 228100 / 231000 </p><p>Strength: 26    Charisma: 36</p><p>Precision: 19    Perception: 23</p><p>Agility: 23     Manipulation: 28</p><p>Speed: 21       Intelligence: 28</p><p>Endurance: 20      Wisdom: 30</p><p>HP: 2289 / 2289\tMana: 3045 / 3045        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>When I woke up, I was feeling warm and comfortable, and more than a bit aroused. Not a big surprise considering I was sandwiched between two sexy beauties, both already woken up but still wrapped tight around me. The fact that Lillian was gently jacking me off while Astrid was massaging my balls had likely played a role in my arousal, though. </p><p>“You girls seem enthusiastic,” I murmured warmly even as I sneaked my arm around their waists, only to receive two instant slaps the moment my hands wandered lower. </p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” Astrid murmured, though her tone was no different than a cat purring with satisfaction. </p><p>“Yeah, my backdoor is still hurting horribly, and I doubt Astrid is feeling any better,” Lillian answered, and received a nod and a smile from Astrid. I couldn’t help but chuckle a bit at the scene. Who could have guessed that they would abandon their jealous competition through a threesome? Not that I was complaining, of course. I wasn’t an idiot. </p><p>“Pity,” I murmured, only to receive another pair of simultaneous playful slaps, this time to my chest. I gasped in playful outrage, and the girls echoed it. I was tempted to go back to sleep, enjoying their warm but playful embrace, but unfortunately, reality had other demands. I had already delayed it enough last night, even though the storm was an excuse. </p><p>A furious storm that was still raging outside. </p><p>I continued to lie silently for a while, enjoying the warmth and comfort before opening my mouth, and asking a serious question. “So, who wants to tell me what's happened since I fell unconscious?” I asked.</p><p>“Not a lot, considering the significance of the trigger,” Lillian explained. “The storm started as you fell unconscious, forcing us to find a place to rest, and the trading post was the only alternative.” </p><p>“So, the storm started during my Ordeal,” I asked, feeling curious. Considering the way the elements had raged around me, only for a shower of lightning to save me, the fact that the storm was linked to me was not a huge shock, but still a curiosity. “Do you know if that’s something typical?” </p><p>“Of course not,” Lillian answered. “Unlike you, other Magus aren’t crazy enough to actually have their ascension ritual in the middle of the wilderness. I doubt that there’s a precedence for it.” </p><p>“Good,” I murmured. If my enemies —and they were my enemies now after I had ruined whatever plan they had in such a spectacular manner— were any weaker, I would have advertised my new power level, which would have made them pull back. But while I didn’t know their full power, I had strong suspicions that they had more than one Sorcerer in their employ, as their actions were too brazen to be otherwise. </p><p>I needed them to underestimate me by thinking of me as a Magus. A strong and capable one, maybe, but nothing I had done under their gaze —other than the show I put on against the raiders— had suggested I had the potential of a Sorcerer; and that one could easily be assigned to a runic trap or another long-winded trick, considering they would have no idea about my idiotic plan to swallow a Dragon’s Heart actually working, but ruining my control in exchange… </p><p>“So,” I continued. “Anything interesting happened after we came here?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” Astrid said immediately while Lillian chuckled. </p><p>“Well,” Lillian murmured despite Astrid’s angry look. “Considering our dress, more than one trapper tried to hit on us, until Astrid punched two of them hard, then they tried to retaliate, forcing me to threaten them with a couple of spells. It was quite amusing.” </p><p>I chuckled, more at Astrid’s sudden blush than the situation itself. “Anything else?” I asked, this time looking at Astrid. I remembered her quiet desperation to direct us here. When I agreed, I hadn’t cared about the risks because I would be awake to observe her. Staying unconscious for a few days changed the issue significantly, giving her the chance to act if she had any ulterior motives. So, the question was my way of testing her. </p><p>Astrid looked hesitant, but when I let my gaze harden for a moment, it quickly melted. “I have received a message from Matron Helena,” she whispered. Lillian’s head suddenly rose, suggesting that Astrid hadn’t run that particular nugget by her. Before she could say anything, I tightened my arm around her, signaling her to stay out of it for the moment. </p><p>“Good, so she’s alive,” I said calmly, carefully watching the way relief spread on her face. Also, I slid my hand up, gently caressing her back, but this time, it was not about enjoying her smooth skin. No, I was discreetly feeling her heartbeat, a perfect technique to check whether she was hiding a secret enough to make her panic. “So, what did the message say?” </p><p>“It was a coded message, giving me a location to meet her in the next ten days.” </p><p>“Do you want to go join her?” I asked, only for her heartbeat to jump. </p><p>“No!” she exclaimed in panic. “No,” she repeated calmer but desperation still clear, her arms tightening around my chest. “I want to stay with you…” </p><p>I carefully watched her expression, making sure that it wasn’t a ploy, but I was satisfied with the honesty I could see in her eyes. “If you so wish,” I said, leaning forward for a quick kiss, one that she responded to rather intensely. I kept it short, however, because I felt a set of fingernails digging into my arm, courtesy of a jealous Lillian. “You know that you can stay with me as well if you wish so, right?” I said before delivering a kiss to her. </p><p>“I know,” she murmured as she snuggled tighter after we stopped the kiss. “But I need to go back to my family. I can’t just abandon my responsibilities. But why don’t you come back to Britanium as well? You might have been under risk before your ascension, but you’re a Sorcerer now. I’m sure your uncle will be powerless against you, and people would race to be your allies.” </p><p>“Not immediately,” I countered. “You’re right that I could easily go and take control of the family, but until I could identify who I could trust and who are die-hard supporters of my uncle, I would be vulnerable, and that’s not a position I want to be in after angering a group of mysterious strangers. I can’t give them a stationary target.” </p><p>Lillian frowned. “They were just a bunch of pirates, right? Maybe stronger than usual, but pirates and outlaws nonetheless. Will they really go against a Sorcerer?”</p><p>“They will if they have a Sorcerer of their own,” I countered. “And I do expect that they have one. I’m not sure if I mentioned it to you in the chaos, but the dragon serpent I killed on that island was actually a familiar, and I doubt a regular Magus could have controlled it.” </p><p>“A f-familiar,” she stammered, too shocked by the revelation to actually care about me concealing information. It was nice, because I didn’t need her trust getting shaken by things that had already passed. She had earned more trust. </p><p>“Yeah, that’s why I’m afraid. Not only do they have at least one Sorcerer, but also they have a suspiciously wide web of connections. Pirates, raiders, and tribals. These are not groups that naturally have communication between themselves, meaning there’s a chance that there’s a mysterious backer.”</p><p>“You suspect that they are from Britanium?” she asked. </p><p>“That is a reasonable possibility, considering how easy they were able to intercept you while they were traveling, but there’s an even more dangerous risk. They might have backers from the mainland, backers strong enough to exert power on the island as well. It’s not a reasonable risk to take.” </p><p>“Do you think it’s that serious?” Lillian gasped, her expression stiff. </p><p>I nodded, happy that she was taking my words seriously, even though I was sure that my Ascension had played a large role in that. Before, when I mentioned some of my suspicions, she had treated it like I was being paranoid, but my strength gave my words extra weight. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised by the sudden change. Lillian wasn’t the only person that took the words of stronger, or more popular people, more seriously. Back in school, I seldom bothered to explain anything to others, but on the rare occasions I had to, it was an uphill struggle, even if I had the perfect evidence. Right now, the reverse was happening. Lillian was taking some of my wilder assumptions as the truth. </p><p>It was convenient, though, as I didn’t have to go through a litany of explanations, including how I stole a Dragon’s Heart from the pirates, only to swallow it whole and somehow survive in the aftermath. </p><p>“Yeah, it’s serious,” I continued. “Why do you think I asked you to give a different meeting location for your family forces. That way, even if they have allies, at least we’ll still have the initiative. Still, it’s much safer for you if you stay with us.” </p><p>“Maybe you’re right,” Lillian said, her frown clear. “But we should still meet with them, if only to give them an explanation. Maybe we can ask them for some resources, even some guards to assist us in our journey. A few loyal retainers would certainly make our job much easier.” </p><p>“Not a bad idea,” I said even as I leaned down and captured her lips once more, enjoying the kiss as much as I enjoyed the way Astrid hugged me from behind, her tits smashing against my chest. </p><p>I once again turned to Astrid after the kiss. “So, where’s Helena’s new base?” I asked. “If it’s not too far away, we can swing by and meet with her before continuing our journey. From what I can see, there’s a certain overlap between our enemies, and there’s benefit in talking with her.” I leaned in for another quick kiss. “Not to mention it’ll be good for you to talk with her whether we stay there or not.” </p><p>“She has retreated to a secret camp in Mount Triama. It’s one of the places we had established together in case there was an emergency,” she said, then sighed. “It’s a couple of days of travel away, but largely on our way. We shouldn’t lose more than a few hours, but…” she said, only to trail away. </p><p>“But?” I asked even as I gently caressed her back, making her shiver under my touch. </p><p>“It’s a dangerous place. More so the creatures. Not only are they strong, but they are also very aggressive. When we went there to set up the camp, Matron Helena had hid us with a protective charm, avoiding the attention of the creatures. Without that, the travel might be deadly.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have that part under control,” I said. A talisman to hide from wild monsters might be a rare artifact for their tribe, but I could probably design one in less than a few minutes. More importantly, after my ascension, wild animals, even in significant numbers, didn’t scare me. “Is there anything else I need to know before leaving the room and going downstairs for a drink?” </p><p>“Only that some people might try to attack you,” Lillian interjected. “They weren’t exactly happy after I smacked.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but snort as I imagined the damage those tough hunters and trappers received to their reputation when they tried to treat two sluttily-dressed women, only to be beaten decisively. “I’m sure I can handle it,” I answered, unable to keep a wild smile from my face. After my ascension, my magic wasn’t the only thing that transformed. My body had received a qualitative change as well, from my senses to my muscles. I would have liked the excuse to test my new abilities. </p><p>“That’s for sure,” both girls answered at the same time, then they started giggling. I extracted myself from in between them, no matter how much I wanted to continue lying between them, enjoying their warmth. I already lost several days while I was unconscious. The least I could do was to go down and get some information about our surroundings, especially about any possible suspicious activity. </p><p>I made a show of dressing, giving the girls a small show that left them giggling, amused and aroused at the same time. They earned it after everything, I decided…</p><p>Then, I closed the door behind me, and walked downstairs, ready to get some information, and maybe release some stress… </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched Princess Aria blush cutely but hesitantly after the practice kiss she delivered to the back of my hand, I knew that pushing Aria too much immediately had the risk of scaring her, therefore ruining my whole plan. Thus logic dictated that I needed to play it safe, making sure everything was perfect before slowly warming her up for the next step. </p><p>But I didn’t rise from being gutter trash to a Dark Lord without taking a few risks. </p><p>It was a mistake that brought a lot of people to their ruin. They waited and tinkered until everything was perfect, delaying, again and again, only to crash and burn spectacularly when an unexpected variable decided to take some of the risks that they deemed excessive, ruining their plans completely. More than once, I was that unexpected variable, hence my meteoric rise toward power. </p><p>Locked in a prison deemed unbreakable, betrayed by my allies, and tortured daily —at least, what they thought of as torture, though it didn’t even enter the top hundred worst thing list for me, I had more painful training sessions regularly— I was not in a position to play safe. </p><p>And, if I was being honest, watching Aria’s beautiful blue eyes shining with a pleasure that confused her triggered me, tempting me to stain her beauty with my fingerprints. </p><p>She gave me the perfect excuse to do so. “H-how was it?” she stammered silently after taking several deep breaths to gather her courage, a move that made her bosom rise visibly despite her conservative dress. </p><p>“Not bad for a beginner,” I answered, smiling just a bit to soften the blow. She flinched still, easily reading the meaning under my words, though they didn’t reflect my true feelings. She was quite good considering her lack of experience, certainly enough to blow the mind of an idiot like Lancelot. But I needed her desperately trying to get better, so I gave her a much weaker compliment, while doing my best to make her think that it was actually to console her. Her panicked expression told me that she reacted just as I wanted. </p><p>She really was too trusting…</p><p>“W-what can I do?” she asked. </p><p>“Hmm…” I murmured, making a show of thinking. “Try to move your lips with more intent,” I offered, followed by a few more technical pieces of advice that would elevate her kiss to the next level. She nodded through my explanation, her face stiff with concentration. She was an exemplary student. “Now, try again,” I ordered. </p><p>This time, as she leaned in, her blush was even thicker, clearly remembering the rush of pleasure she had felt. Still, she obeyed my directions without saying a word, and pressed her lips to the back of my hand. I let my magic infuse into her mouth immediately, gently caressing the edges of her lips before slipping in, ticking her tongue. </p><p>“Don’t break it,” I ordered when she started to pull back, and did her best to follow my directions as I gave her more and more orders, making her kiss slowly better. But the more important part was the space between my orders, where she had nothing to focus on but on the kiss she was delivering, her blush intensifying with each passing second.</p><p>Even then, the sudden moan that left her mouth shocked me as much as it did her. She flinched back, her face crimson. “Sorry,” she murmured as she made a motion of standing up, but I cut in. </p><p>“Sit down!” I ordered, letting my inner Dark Lord seep into my tone, not the Dark part that made people tremble in fear, or the part that massacred people in the blink of an eye. No, the part I used was the Lord, the one that didn’t give orders as much as predicting the future, because he knew that any words he uttered would be turned into reality by his followers.  When the Lord spoke, people listened. </p><p>Aria was no exception, staying in place without even realizing the reason for doing so. It was fatal for a ruler to act like that, no wonder Queen Sapphire was trying to find a Prince-Consort for her as soon as possible. As she currently was, she was completely unfit for ruling. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, this time with a warmer tone, but still channeling the Lord, the aspect that was signaling its subject that he was satisfied with her actions. “Now, this one was much better, especially on the lips part, but your tongue needs a bit of work.” I made a show of thinking before continuing. “Why don’t we try a different exercise?” </p><p>“Like what?” she asked, justifiably concerned. </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured, then raised my index and middle finger together. “Why don’t you slowly kiss them, treating them like a tongue so that I can get a better idea,” I offered. </p><p>“If you’re sure,” she murmured, looking around hesitantly, but when she saw my eyebrows furrowing, she moved immediately and wrapped her lips around my two fingers, her tongue beating against them. I had to bite my lips not to moan as her tongue brushed against my fingers, sending shivers across my body. There was something uniquely arousing in receiving such a personalized service from the princess of an Empire. </p><p>Even better, my fingers gave me a much better way to expel and control my magic. My magical access might be limited, but it was enough to flood her mouth and trigger her joy. She was clearly holding back, so I gave her another suggestion. “Try to moan occasionally, it should help you to act like you’re enjoying it. It’s an integral part of the experience.” </p><p>Her expression of relief was simply spectacular. Finally having the excuse she needed, she stopped holding back, and her soft moans reverberated through the room, while the trembling sensation they caused spread into my body from my fingers. I could feel my own arousal growing to the point that I was unable to keep my shaft under control, not that I tried to. </p><p>It was time for her to see the consequences of delivering a successful kiss. </p><p>Lost in the magically-enhanced pleasure of the faux-kiss she was delivering, her eyes were closed, so she missed my growing erection for a long time. I continued to offer the occasional recommendation, but the space between them got larger and larger. I stopped offering recommendations, and even then, she continued delivering her simulated kiss. Encouraged by her loss of concentration, I started dropping more and more mana into the small spell I used to enhance her pleasure, but it somehow got missed. </p><p>In her defense, she had bigger priorities. </p><p>I carefully watched as she shuffled in her place, and when she stopped doing that, her legs were suspiciously pressed together. That might be explained, but the following slow fidgeting was a different issue. It suspiciously looked like she was trying to rub her legs together to generate some sexy friction without being noticed. I wondered whether she was aware of it. </p><p>A pity that my magic was barely enough to tease her tongue. I would have liked to add some heat to her —likely-unconscious— attempts of indirect masturbation. Still, I didn’t let the lack of power bother me. Two days ago, I had nothing. Today, I had enough magic for simple tricks. That was progress, and it wasn’t something to worry about. </p><p>My thoughts on improving my power potential flew away when I noticed her growing arousal, making her suspiciously close to climax. I watched with excitement, curious whether she might accomplish it. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed when her eyes suddenly flew open and she pulled back, breathing hard in shock and the impact of impending arousal. </p><p>I would have cursed loudly if that wouldn’t have scared her more. Instead, I played along. “That was excellent progress for the day, you have followed my directions perfectly, correcting your mistakes. You’re a good student.”</p><p>“Thanks,” she muttered, still avoiding my gaze. </p><p>I thought about pushing her a bit more, but then I remembered the surprise that was awaiting her, one that she had managed to miss in her distracted state, and changed my mind. “How about we continue with our healing. It’s starting to hurt.” </p><p>“Of course,” she exclaimed, her relief now that we were in more familiar waters was clear. When she sat back in her chair, however, her eyes widened in shock. “W-what is that?” she stammered as she pointed at my erection, which was making a rather impressive tent through my loose prison clothes. </p><p>“You’re a healer, I don’t have to explain that to you,” I said, not bothering to hide my chuckle, which made her blush harder, but she didn’t jump away, so it was a win. “Well, think of it as the objective evidence of your kissing skills,” I added. </p><p>“Should we wait until…” she murmured, letting her voice drift away rather than completing her words. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I answered, faking distress for a moment. “It’s going to stay like that for a while, because I can’t really handle it,” I said, making my hands into fists to remind her that my chains didn’t allow me to reach that far. </p><p>“Does it hurt?” she asked, unable to help it despite her blush. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said with a stiff tone, like I was trying to hide my pain from her. Her eyes widened, and I sighed. “It’s just uncomfortable. Think of it like a very noticeable itch you can’t scratch.” I was very tempted to mention similarities between her current state of unmet arousal and my struggle, but I refrained despite its amusement potential. However, the blush that suddenly appeared on her face suggested that she had made that connection, and possibly even overestimating its impact… </p><p>I wasn’t complaining. </p><p>“Is there anything I could do,” she murmured. </p><p>“There is, but I don’t really think you will,” I said, not bothering to hide my smirk, and her blush turned into a raging forest fire. </p><p>“Anyway, we need to continue to heal you,” she stammered rather rapidly as she put her hands on me and flooded me with healing energy. A rather uncontrolled burst of healing energy, I noted happily. It seemed that my erection worked wonders as a distraction, even better than her anger. While her gaze constantly slipped towards my tent despite her best effort to avoid it, I directed her excess magic toward the chains, slowly but steadily increasing my access. </p><p>The healing session lasted more than an hour, and she was even more jittery about my erection in the end than at the beginning, which was the reason I dreamed up several inventive scenarios where our roles were switched, and I was slowly educating her about the fun parts of being evil. I did that for two reasons. First, watching her like that was very amusing. </p><p>Second, maintaining her distraction. Casting healing magic through the interference of the magic-canceling bracelets was difficult in the first place without the added challenge of her shyness, giving me free-reign in manipulating the excess energy, finally damaging the magic-blocking chains enough to get me decent access to my magic. At first, thirty-five grains reached fifty, then a hundred, then five hundred, then thousands… The more access I got, the easier it became to damage it further. </p><p>Of course, thousands of grains sounded fancy, but only because I had such limited access before. It was still insignificant in the long run. I decided to classify my new capacity as one string. I could probably cast a magic missile, and if forced, an anemic fireball… Of course, the real opportunity lay in all the small tricks I could pull, including mental tricks that were more about control than power. </p><p>Not on Aria, though. She was too nice to deserve me messing directly with her mind. Indirectly, on the other hand… For the last half hour of the treatment, I was using my newly expanded abilities to slowly caress her skin magically, through a touch so soft that it could be easily mistaken for wind. It restricted me to the areas above her clothes, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make, especially after discovering that her neck was rather sensitive, making her shiver whenever I touched it. </p><p>“That’s it for today,” she finally pulled back, breathing hard. “Well, that was harder than I expected,” she added, which I understood. Healing through the chains was a difficult task, and my constant drain to weaken the chains hardly helped. </p><p>“You’re a lifesaver,” I said, smiling widely. “Literally. I doubt anyone else could have done what you did through a magic-blocking effect.” </p><p>“There are a lot more accomplished healers,” she said, immediately refuting it modestly. “And it’s our fault you’re hurting in the first place.” </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s war, these things happen,” I said. “I would have waved my hand dismissively, but with the chains…” I added, then chuckled. </p><p>“Yeah,” she said as she stood up, but her eyes once again slid down to my tent, then jumped away just as rapidly. Since she went through so much trouble healing me, I decided to give her a little treat. </p><p>“Before you leave, do you mind giving me a check-up, just in case there’s some bleeding you missed magically.” </p><p>“The spell I used doesn’t work like that, but if it’s going to answer your concern,” she said, and leaned down to caress my ribs, also feeling my muscles, which were hardy enough to resist a month in prison… Definitely hardy enough to make her blush as she caressed them. </p><p>“Maybe you should remove my shirt,” I said. “In case there’s some internal bleeding or something?” I added, and she blushed, but since it was actually a good idea because of the rib injuries which she was unable to rely on her diagnostic spells to check, she couldn’t reject it. </p><p>Though, the way her hands flew over the buttons despite their trembling, I doubted she wanted to do so in any case. “Tell me if it hurts,” she said as she started dragging her fingers along my muscles, giving a more thorough examination than necessary, not that I was complaining. My only issue was the dress she was wearing, completely lacking in any kind of cleavage despite her excessive lean. </p><p>“My leg is still hurting,” I reminded her when she finally finished her examination, and was about to reach for my shirt to close it. </p><p>“Okay,” she said, a bit louder than necessary, but wasted no time reaching for the string that held my prison-pants on my waist. I raised my hips, and she pulled my pants down, only to reveal that my underwear was a bit thinner than she expected, even giving a blurry silhouette of my shaft. </p><p>She made a great show of not looking at it even as she gently grabbed my thigh, giving them a very thorough examination despite any lasting sign of danger. “Hmm… There’s a suspicious spot, I need more light,” she said and cast bright light magic. The fact that it appeared between me and my shaft, therefore creating a very clear silhouette of my shaft for her to watch was completely coincidental. </p><p>Surely… </p><p>I decided to cut to the chase. “You can touch it, you know…” I said. </p><p>“What!” she gasped as she jumped back, the light spell she cast disappearing in an instant, her face contorted with shock. </p><p>“Nothing to feel ashamed of, sweetie. It’s my fault that you have been subjected to my erection for a whole hour while you tried to heal me. That’s the least I can do,” I said, then smirked. “Think of it as a part of our training.” </p><p>“But…” she murmured. “What if…” she added, only to fade once more. “It would be a scandal,” she finally admitted. </p><p>“Only if people knew about it,” I explained rationally. “You won’t tell, and I won’t either, and even if I did, no one would believe me. We’re in a secure cell with no way recording. It’s completely safe if you’re feeling curious…” </p><p>“No!” she said loudly. “No, no, nooo…” she repeated, each repeat destroying her conviction quicker than I ever could, the last one escaping like a resigned breath. She started walking toward me. “You promise you won’t tell anyone?” she asked, vulnerable. </p><p>“I promise,” I said. “Dark Lord’s honor,” I added with a chuckle, which made her let out a nervous giggle as well. </p><p>Then, silence ruled the room as she wrapped her fingers around my shaft, her fingers unable to meet on the other side. “Are they all this big?” she asked, her eyes wide. “It’s supposed to go there, how?” </p><p>I was so tempted to offer a demonstration, but it was far too early. “I don’t know about other men, but it’s probably average, maybe even below average if what they say about men who seek power is true,” I added with a depreciating chuckle, despite fully knowing where it was falling on the spectrum. I was proud of my cock, it helped me seduce so many wives and daughters of my enemies, helping me solve issues bloodlessly thanks to a spy that would never be suspected… </p><p>“Impossible,” she gasped, squeezing harder, and I gasped. “Am I hurting you,” she asked. </p><p>“No, actually, that’s what I would have done to relieve myself if it wasn’t for my hands,” I said. “Now, I have to suffer that the whole day.” </p><p>She was smart enough to read the under-text, but naive enough to not realize it was a very obvious trap. Maybe not naive, but blinded by her own desire, which seemed to be a rather new emotion for her. “Maybe I can help you,” she said. </p><p>“You would?” I gasped happily, making a show of being surprised. </p><p>“Yes,” she replied shakily. “It’s not weird, is it?” she added, her tone lingering in a way that suggested I didn’t need to struggle much to convince her about the next step. The hook was in place, now it was time to reel her onto the shore… </p><p>“No, no,” I replied quickly to console her now that a handjob was on the line. “When you think about it, it's a part of your healer duties.” She nodded seriously, both of us aware of the level of nonsense I had just spouted, but she was far too curious —and no less aroused thanks to my meddling— to not take the chance. </p><p>I bit the inside of my cheek, just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. After all, it was the only Princess of the Empire of Light, fiancee of the illustrious hero Lancelot, the most prestigious healer of the lands… And she was currently crouched in front of me, her fingers wrapped around my erection, squeezing slowly with an intense look of concentration on her face. Even after going through all the effort to arrange it, I struggled to believe that it was true. </p><p>“The most important thing about a handjob is to find the perfect amount of pressure,” I explained. “Too soft, and the impact will be limited, too hard, and it’ll just cause discomfort,” I explained, and she listened with rapt attention, slowly squeezing her hand while waiting for a sign from me. “That’s a bit too hard,” I warned, and she loosened her grip to a perfect degree. </p><p>“How about now?” she whispered, her eyes resolutely avoiding my eyes, but also had the sight of my shaft trapped between her fingers. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “But, keep your eyes on your job on hand, it’ll make you react better,” I explained. She followed my recommendation, but not without a thick blush covering her face. “You seem a bit uncomfortable, though. How about if you sit on my legs instead,” I offered, feeling comfortable enough to push for more. </p><p>A serious expression appeared on her face, but before she could say anything, a very distinctive clack of footsteps reached our ears, signaling another visitor. The panic that appeared on her face would have been amusing if her fumbling fingers as she tried to stuff my shaft back into my pants hadn’t risked my whole plan. </p><p>“Calm down and take a deep breath!” I ordered with the full might of my ruling persona. I was lucky that she responded to that rather than going even more catatonic. “Now, put my cock back into my pants, button up my shirt, and do your best to look exhausted. I’m going to act unconscious to make the situation even less suspicious,” I added rapidly. </p><p>Surprisingly, she nodded and followed my orders with a steady hand rather than falling into pieces. I closed my eyes, but I could still feel that she finished dressed me and already in the middle of the room when the door opened. </p><p>I wondered who our visitor was? </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Stephen,” she gasped in shock as I stood next to her, enjoying the sight of her naked body. Well, mostly naked, but considering she was only wearing a pair of slippers and a shelf bra that left her breasts naked, I was willing to omit that part. </p><p>“Yes, Penny,” I said even as I grabbed the hood of the car and slowly pushed it down, easily pulling it out of her trembling hands. When it was closed by an ominous click, it also removed Penny’s access to her clothes, leaving her naked. With the spell broken, a sudden blush invaded her face and she turned her back, trying to hide her body from my view, but giving me a view of her beautiful peach butt instead. With her toned but curvy body, it was a sight to die for, especially with her own arousal slowly dripping down her legs. </p><p>I decided to stop playing around. Without warning, I pushed her against the car, hard enough to cut off her breath momentarily, but luckily, she had her own impressive airbags to reduce the impact. “Stephen, please, stop,” she whispered, trying to beg me, which might have been effective if her voice hadn’t conveyed her arousal despite her best effort. </p><p>“Come on, Penny,” I replied even as I put my hand on her body. “I’m just preparing you for a private photo shoot, where’s the harm?” I said even as I gently dragged my fingers over her perfectly-toned ass, enjoying the sensation. “I’m not doing anything I haven’t done before,” I said, which was correct considering the way our test shoot had ended. “It’s completely professional,” I added, which was a lie as naked as she currently was. </p><p>Letting my shaft free and plunging inside her would have been easy, but I had a more important plan in mind. “Stay like this,” I ordered her, and dashed to get my camera. With the sound of the shutter accompanied by a soft flash —to fill the shadows and make the photo more attractive— echoed in the hillside, she stiffened, but got wetter at the same time. </p><p>“I’m … naked,” she murmured. </p><p>“Don’t worry, honey,” I said even as I put my hand on the small of her back. “It’s strictly private. No other man will see them,” I ensured her, leaving myself a small loophole, since showing the naked and horny pictures of other models was an excellent way to stow their concerns. After all, if someone else had done it, it couldn’t be that bad, right? </p><p>“O-okay, then,” she stammered, once again her complications easily broken. Her natural weakness, enhanced by her desire to be famous, made it really easy to break through her concerns. She was really lucky that I was the one that found her rather than a worse director, because, in a week, she would have found herself filled with cocaine and shooting ten low-budget porn a day, barely earning enough to afford her newly acquired drug habit. </p><p>I protected my own. They were mine, after all…</p><p>“Excellent,” I said with a smile. “Then, stay like that, but face me. I want a sultry smile for the picture, one that promises an endless night of pleasure.” She stammered a positive answer, but when she tried to smile, it was too shaky, too self-conscious. “No, not like that, brighter,” I ordered. </p><p>“How about this?” she asked after she made another attempt, which was even worse after I called her out, shaking her confidence. </p><p>I made a show of letting out a loud sigh. “It seems that I need to help you once again. You’re lucky that I’m such a willing partner,” I said even as I closed the distance. When my fingers found her wetness, the gasp she let out was beautiful. She made no note of protest as my fingers delved deep inside her, enjoying the way she felt. </p><p>“You’re not a virgin, you dirty girl,” I mocked her after fingering her for a couple of minutes, enjoying her moans. “Your boyfriend is a lucky guy.” </p><p>“Not…” she murmured. “Not my boyfriend.” </p><p>“Really,” I said, surprised by her admission, though not the fact that she was spilling her secrets. “When did this happen, then? Weren’t you together with your boyfriend since junior high?” </p><p>“It happened at the Senior Prom,” she admitted even as she used her hands to cover her face. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, unable to keep the mocking edge from my tone, even as I increased the pace of my fingers. “You’re really a dirty girl, aren’t you? Tell me more.” </p><p>“N-no,” she murmured, but I slapped her ass hard enough to echo on the nearby hills. </p><p>“Tell me,” I repeated as I plunged my fingers into her depths once more. </p><p>“O-kay,” she murmured, gasping beautiful enough to make my pants extremely tight, so I released my belt. “It was prom night, and we all had had a couple of drinks, all except Jason, who was the designated driver. He had a nice car as well,” she added, her sudden sigh making me remember her reaction to the car this morning. Apparently, she really had a weakness for cars, considering that was the only detail she mentioned. </p><p>“Then, what happened.” </p><p>“My boyfriend and his girlfriend both got drunk and collapsed, so I helped him drop them off at their homes. When we were alone, he offered to ride around for a while. Then we went faster and faster, until we stopped in a forested area…” she murmured, her words broken by loud moans toward the end. She was close to a climax. </p><p>I decided to quicken my plans for a bit. I smirked widely as I pulled my fingers out, only to replace it with my shaft, and pushed forward without a warning. “N-no,” she moaned, but her hips pushed back as I plunged deeper. </p><p>“Tell me more,” I ordered even as I grabbed her beautiful blonde hair and pulled her head back. </p><p>“Then, we did it … on the back of the car…” she finished her tale. “Do it slowly, please,” she begged, </p><p>“You only did it once?” I asked, and when she nodded, I couldn’t help but be surprised. What kind of idiot would let her go after just once. I certainly had no intention of allowing her to go that easily. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, followed by another loud cry as I pushed inside her. “Oh, god, this feels amazing,” she followed. </p><p>“Better than your other time?” I asked, despite knowing the answer. I just wanted to force her to talk. </p><p>“Much better,” she moaned as I started to impale her repeatedly, her voice filling the opening we were in. “And much bigger,” she added unprompted when I pushed myself as deep as possible. </p><p>I pulled out for a moment, only to flip her over, so that her back was pressing against the smooth surface of the car, her tits dangling with each push. I wanted to grab and squeeze them, tempted by their perfect rhythm, but the beautiful mixture of guilt, desire, and surrender on her face forced me to employ my hands in a different place. I raised my camera and started taking a string of photos, immortalizing her surrender on top of an expensive sports car, in the middle of nowhere. </p><p>“No photos,” she murmured, and raised her hands to cover her face. </p><p>I had no intention of allowing that. “You’re a model, don’t cover your face,” I ordered. “Be proud of your expression.” Those words were just garbage that I came up with on the spot, but luckily, Penny —who was never the sharpest tool in the toolbox— was too distracted to actually pay attention to the depth of my words. With her orgasm closing in, it was a small miracle that she understood the surface meaning and kept her hands away from her beautiful face. </p><p>“Better,” I approved. “Now, play with your tits, I want to see passion and joy,” I ordered. As she brought her fragile hands against her large tits, their size difference might have been comical if it wasn’t for the sheer eroticism the scene radiated. I took photo after photo in a frenzy, each flash tightening her further. It didn’t take long for her to finally climax. </p><p>I just continued pumping into her, not giving her a moment to breathe. I continued taking photos, of course, even when her arms fell to the side while she struggled to catch her breath under my merciless assault. “It feels amazing,” she gasped dazedly, at this point, uncaring about the constant movement of the shutter immortalizing her immoral actions. </p><p>But such an incredible moment had its costs, as I was rapidly closing in to the point of climax. Giving her a nice creampie was tempting, but not as tempting as covering her spectacular breasts with my white mark, something I’ve wanted to do since I saw her walk into Madison’s room with a top barely containing her magnificent tits.</p><p>I pulled out and sprayed, covering her stomach and her tits with my seed while she just moaned dazedly. “On your knees, for the next shot,” I ordered immediately, and she followed without a delay, sliding down the hood of the car, but stumbling the moment her feet touched the ground. Unsurprising, as she was very clumsy at the best of times. After two orgasms, it was a miracle she was even able to lower herself to her knees —on the pants I folded underneath her as I didn’t want her beautiful knees to be scratched— without falling on her face, even with my help. </p><p>“Now, you have your next task,” I said, pointing at my shaft, which deflated after that spectacular explosion. </p><p>“But, it's… dirty,” she murmured, unable to meet my eyes. </p><p>“I know,” I said even as I gripped her hair and pulled just hard enough to convey the seriousness of my order. She yelped a bit. “I know it’s dirty, but whose fault is that?” </p><p>“Mine,” she murmured softly. </p><p>“Exactly. And now, you need to take responsibility, and clean it properly,” I added, gently pushing my hand on her shoulder. </p><p>This time, she said nothing, just leaned forward and wrapped her lips around the entirety of my shaft, which was an easy job to do in its flaccid state. But under the assault from her warm mouth, assisted by her clumsy but enthusiastic tongue, it immediately started to grow, making it harder and harder for her to keep a hold. When it was halfway up, she surrendered and pulled back, but it continued its growth, large enough to press against her lips even after she pulled back, her back pressing against the car. </p><p>“It’s too big,” she murmured. </p><p>“I don’t like quitters,” I answered sharply, and she flinched. I took yet another photo, and she flinched once more. </p><p>She blushed. “I don’t know how,” she murmured. “I have never done this before…” </p><p>“Oh, honey,” I said with an overexaggerated helpful tone, unable to believe my luck. I might have found the only Midwestern beauty with no experience giving head, usually, it was their weapon of choice. Still, it only underlined just how precious that finding was. “Don’t worry about it, I’m going to teach you all about it… Open wide, and mind the teeth…” </p><p>She did so immediately and obediently, accepting my shaft as I pushed forward, slowly traveling down her moat until the crown was pressing against the entrance of her throat. She gagged panickedly, and I pulled back, giving her a moment to gather herself. “It’s too big,” she gasped between her coughs. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk at her words. I was a man, after all, and those words never failed to stroke our ego. “You need to be resilient,” I told her. “Think of it as a movie, no matter how difficult and unfamiliar, you need to hold on despite the discomfort. Can you do it? Can you prove to me that you have what it takes to be a real actress?” </p><p>“I will,” she answered, and before she could say anything else, I pushed deep into her throat, silencing her. She stiffened when it touched the entrance of her throat, but that wasn’t a reason to delay. I removed my shirt and put it against the back of her head like a pillow, ensuring she wouldn’t be hurt when I started to act rough, then pushed in even further, forcing her to swallow more of my shaft. Her reaction was beautiful, desperately trying to push herself forward despite her breathtaking gags. </p><p>It deserved better immortalization than a few pictures, I decided. Luckily, my camera could also record videos, so I changed the mode, and captured her desperate attempt to deepthroat. </p><p>Soon, she started to struggle despite her focus, but for a while, I didn’t let up on the pressure, not even when she started tapping my leg desperately. “Calm down,” I ordered. “You’ll never learn how to do it properly if you don’t push yourself,” I said as I enjoyed the innocent grasp of her throat, doing its best to push me towards another climax. </p><p>Her tapping stopped, showing that my words had been effective. I continued for another minute before pulling back, letting her gulp in air desperately. “Not bad for the first try,” I said calmly even as I continued to record her exhausted beauty. “Ready for the second attempt?” </p><p>“No-” she tried to start, but opening her mouth at that particular moment was a mistake. I pushed forward again, this time hard enough to lodge three-fourths of my length into her mouth in one move. Her gags rose once again, this time even louder, each attempt making her dirtied breasts jiggle. Her drool started to spill down her chin despite her best attempts, staining her lips even further. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said, patting her head patronizingly for a moment before pushing in even, enjoying the way she tried to swallow, making her throat even tighter. She was doing excellently. </p><p>But the real fun started when she started moving of her own volition, surprising me. She was a good model, but lacked the true instincts that made one a masterpiece. But the same was reversed when it came to giving head. If I hadn’t seen her development, I would have never believed that it was her first time. Her movements lost their mechanicality after a moment, one of her hands rose and started treating the base whenever she found the opportunity.</p><p>“Your other hand is idle,” I reminded her, and she started reaching toward my balls, another great instinct, but I had an even better idea. “No, play with yourself,” I ordered. </p><p>She moaned desperately, but followed my order, and soon, her hand disappeared further down. Correspondingly, her sucking got even more enthusiastic.  </p><p>My fingers slid down to her neck, caressing her beautiful neck, which made her tremble, somehow managing to register despite everything else she was experiencing. She was truly a natural when it came to sex… </p><p>I could feel her out-of-control pulse from my fingertips as I caressed her neck, her heart pumping hard enough to make her lightheaded. Luckily, the best solution to that was getting less oxygen, and I had that part covered.  </p><p>I let my fingers wander even lower, enjoying the thumping of her heart as I moved determinedly toward her nipple. When I arrived, I twisted it hard, and suddenly, she was shuddering with the telltale signs of yet another climax. </p><p>That broke my resistance as well, and I started filling her mouth with my load. Some, she managed to capture, and some started to spill. But luckily, it wasn’t wasted, as her spectacular breasts were ready to catch it, getting even dirtier. Still, since she was failing to catch all of it, I might as well use the opportunity for a more visually-engaging finish. I pulled out, and sprayed the remaining half on her face, staining it enough to rival her breasts. </p><p>When I pulled back, she fell on all fours, breathing hard. The combination of a lack of oxygen and her explosive orgasm had hit her hard. I recorded her for a few more seconds before switching the camera back to photo mode. </p><p>I had some interesting photos in mind… </p>",

    "content": "<p>A laugh escaped my mouth as I swung my sword —shining with the magic I dumped into it, so much man that  it was a miracle it didn’t melt— once more, this time costing the attacking golden lion a tendon, then, rather than following up with a deadlier attack, I once again rolled in front of Aviada, preventing the second one from taking her down. </p><p>Meanwhile, the remaining three were still locked in their earthen cages, smashing into them, again and again, to get free despite impaling themselves on the spikes I had created. If they were any stupider, they would have stopped long ago, afraid of the pain. Unfortunately, they were smart enough to understand the implications, forcing me to expend even more mana to keep them away from the battle. </p><p>[-260 Mana]</p><p>“Come on, little guy,” I called in satisfaction as I suddenly charged forward, meeting its charge halfway, enough to shock the creature. I doubted that it ever experienced a smaller creature trying to wrestle it down. Normally, even with my phenomenal strength, trying to meet a monster in a contest of pure strength was not the smartest move, but the creature’s astonishment was enough that it failed to react appropriately until I was on its back, grabbing its head and forcing it backward. </p><p>Aviada’s combat senses were good enough that I didn’t need to order her to charge for her to step forward and cut the monster’s throat with a precise swing, making it bleed painfully. Even as I jumped down and turned the other way, readying myself for the assault of the wounded one, I let my mana wrap around Aviada once more, so when she stabbed the head of the lion, I was able to observe the changes that happened in her soul space perfectly. </p><p>The sliver of power once again merged into her soul space, strengthening it further. </p><p>Taking down the wounded one was trivial. With its rushed ambush failed, it was wide open, allowing me to cut off its front leg, and Aviada easily delivered the killing blow, her soul space expanding even further. </p><p>The remaining three monsters revitalized their assault towards the cage, but with a big difference, they were attacking at the other side of the cage, trying to escape rather than attack after their hunting attempt cost the life of half of their pride. Unfortunately for them, I had enough mana to keep them locked in, easily dealing with them one after another, while Aviada delivered the last hit. </p><p>[-620 Mana]</p><p>I watched her soul space carefully, observing the changes that happened. When she absorbed the experience from the last one, however, a large change happened in her soul space. It suddenly started to expand, widening significantly but also gaining an elastic quality. I was finally able to get a better understanding of the leveling process. </p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>I didn’t try to mess with it, of course, not even when her sword-fighting ability was strengthened even further, signaling that she had once again chosen to overemphasize her already strong abilities. I didn’t have a problem with it, not when it made her even more dependent on me. Though considering the small change that happened, it was clear that her skill had reached the point of diminishing returns. </p><p>I let the process complete, watching carefully as her soul space solidified once more, covering a wider area, but also, for the lack of a better term, less elastic. Combining that with the findings from Helga and Cornelia, I had a preliminary hypothesis that the softness of the space was about the level cap. At one point, hardening enough to be unable to accept new inputs, whether it was from experience or achievements. </p><p>Experimenting on Aviada was definitely not an option, however. The risk of permanent damage was too high. </p><p>“Another level up, I’m level twelve now,” she exclaimed happily before she dashed forward and caught my lips. I responded immediately, happy that she trusted me enough to reveal her level without me prompting her. I had long deduced it, of course, but the fact that she trusted me enough to reveal it counted for a lot. </p><p>I let my hands wander over her mostly naked body, enjoying the way her chainmail bikini smashed against my body. And as much as I was tempted to continue it by pushing her down, we needed to move before even more dangerous creatures were drawn to the smell of the golden lion corpses. </p><p>So, I reluctantly pulled back and instead started processing the carcasses of the creatures. As level fifteen creatures, they were very precious in making new magical items such as weapons, armors, and disposable items. Unfortunately, the low success rate of the crafting process, as well as the fragility of most of the resulting items, made such items pretty rare. </p><p>Aviada’s sword was a very rare item in that sense, especially in the hands of a student. The only reason Aviada had that because she was the only one in her family able to use it, and the only reason she was able to keep possession of it was due to other people's lack of knowledge about its full range of capabilities. I doubted that even her ex-fiancee who was willing to kill her to acquire the sword, was aware of the full range of its capabilities. </p><p>The fact that she was able to use that sword to kill a golden lion with a couple of swings —even if they were hurt and immobilized— was a significant improvement. Normal swords wouldn’t even cut through their skin, and most magical swords would require several swings even with her impressive strength. </p><p>There was no hope that I could use the remains of the golden lions to make an item of a similar caliber —or even at the same class— but still, having a backup option might help. And since I finally made the decision to reinforce my room, storage was not a problem. </p><p>We were silent as we processed the lions, as even with magic, it was grueling work, but in the end, I was carrying a large bundle of precious magical ingredients —some I could even use to establish more permanent wards around my room… All around, a very profitable night. </p><p>“So, are you finally going to get something better than the garbage you’ve been using,” she said, pointing at my sword, which effectively turned into brittle scrap metal after the mana bath it received while I was fighting. </p><p>“Maybe, but I need someone to make a good weapon for me.” </p><p>She chuckled. “Finally, something you can’t do!” </p><p>“Hey,” I exclaimed as I slapped her ass, which was easy to do as most of her ass was naked thanks to the minimal coverage of her bikini armor. She gasped and tried to retaliate, but I dodged her and stepped forward, locking her in with a bear hug before leaning down and biting her neck near the collarbone, on a point that I knew she enjoyed immensely. She moaned… </p><p>And I pulled back, a smirk on my face. “That’s what you get for messing with me,” I said, enjoying the way she panted in arousal. </p><p>“Leaving a lady hanging like this is extremely rude,” she answered, but we continued to walk, exhausted and desiring to go back to the protection of the school. A pride of golden lions was far above my expectations. Even in the night, I wasn’t expecting the surroundings of the Silver Spires to be that dangerous.</p><p>“About your weapon,” she repeated after a couple of minutes of comfortable silence.</p><p>“I’m guessing you have an idea,” I said, which was a good guess considering she mentioned it again. </p><p>“Yeah, one of the enchanters is my mentor, and she does good work,” she said, missing the way my eyes brightened at the mention of a female enchanter. The discussion had immediately turned more interesting at that point. “She might be interested in crafting a new weapon for you.” </p><p>“Crafting a weapon from scratch is very exhausting work, would she really be willing?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, she is in a bit of debt,” Aviada murmured. “She might be willing to try if the payment is good enough, especially since she owes me one for allowing her to examine my sword.” </p><p>I almost slapped my head, unable to believe Aviada’s silliness. Trusting an enchanter with that sword was like trusting a shark with a piece of bloody meat. Though luckily, it also answered the questions about whether we could trust her or not. If she didn’t steal Aviada’s sword after examining it, she should be trustworthy enough to talk to. Not to a point of revealing any of my secrets, of course… “Sounds interesting, I’ll visit her if you can arrange a private meeting with her. I don’t want anyone else to see us,” I explained, and she nodded. </p><p>Our return was not without incident, of course. An impressive number of monsters had attacked us, though none of them worthy enough to take notice of —other than a lazy sword swing from Aviada —or a simple magic missile from me if they were too weak to even register for their experience. </p><p>Of course, I was gaining no benefit from the experience reward that they tried to give, I decided to experiment even more. Using the tricks I learned from my Tantric skill, I tried to redirect the nugget of energy that resulted in the experience gain, only to fail spectacularly several times, sometimes failing to affect it, sometimes pushing hard enough to evaporate it completely, wasting enough mana to leave me dry if it wasn’t for my enhanced regeneration. </p><p>[-673 Mana]</p><p>[+3 Tantric]</p><p>Then, one of my attempts was actually successful, and I managed to drag the experience nugget toward Aviada, and once connected, her soul space devoured it hungrily. She turned to me, questioningly. “Why did I just gain experience?” she asked. </p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>“I just figured out another trick, I can guide the reward for the last hit,” I explained. Unlike my ability to give experience through sex, it wasn’t exactly groundbreaking. And paradoxically, since it was related to combat, I expected her to hold that as a secret easier. </p><p>“Huh, that’s handy,” she answered, which was something I agreed with wholeheartedly. Aviada had no area-effect ability, and Helga was not much better at farming experience. This discovery would no doubt come in handy. More importantly, I could use this to help people with no companion bond if I ever expanded my circle more than the people I enjoyed spending naked time together. </p><p>I was about to answer, but then I noticed several dire rabbits escaping under the ground. A combination of earth magic and arcana enabled me to detect thousands of rabbits underground. Another earth elemental spell, although costly, turned their hive into a coffin, resulting in a rain of tiny experience droplets, as thick as the resulting cloud of dust. </p><p>[-420 Mana]</p><p>I tried to form a web to redirect the droplets toward Aviada. I wasn’t able to catch all of them, but enough to make her smile widely at what I achieved. “You’re the best,” she said with a wide smile, happy to receive her reward. </p><p>“Well, you better think about the payment,” I answered. She said nothing, but the sway of her almost-naked hips was sufficient for me. I took a step back and watched the way her hips swayed for the rest of the way. Only when we were about to sneak back into the school did she put her thick cloak on once more, not wanting to be seen in such a revealing state in the school. </p><p>“To the bedroom?” she asked when we finally arrived back at the communal section for female warriors. </p><p>“No, we need a shower,” I answered.</p><p>“I don’t have a private shower, we only have the communal ones,” she answered. </p><p>“And this is a problem, how?” I answered, earning a slap on my shoulder and a playful chuckle in response. She changed direction, and soon, we were in a room covered with rough stone, lacking the grandeur of the baths I had seen in Cornelia’s and Marianne’s rooms. </p><p>She closed the door, but since it was a shared one, locking the door was not an option. I put a detection ward up just in case even as I watched Aviada undress quickly. I would have preferred an extended show, but at times like these, she was definitely quicker. </p><p>Still, I watched her undressing with rapt attention. It wasn’t the first time I was seeing her naked, but that didn’t change the fact that her body deserved my undivided attention, tight and toned through countless hours of training, but deliciously curvy nonetheless. </p><p>I watched in silence as she walked toward the shower on the uttermost end, the towel in her hand rather than wrapped around her body. Then, just as she turned on the water, hot enough to raise a steamy cloud, I joined her. </p><p>“Do you mind washing my back,” she gasped even as she stood close enough for my shaft to disappear between her meaty ass cheeks. </p><p>“Sure,” I answered and started washing her slowly, tracing her muscles, making her moan softly. </p><p>I was tempted to push her against the wall and take her mercilessly, especially when she giggled playfully and started moving her hips up and down in a manner that was against her personality, but I held back, enjoying her elated mood after the great gains we made during the night. Of course, even as I caressed her body, I carefully examined her soul space, examining the way it slowly stabilized after the level up. </p><p>I was about to change the pattern when I felt the ward triggering. I didn’t want to get caught in the middle of the showers with Aviada, not wanting to deal with the resulting scandal. The simplest solution was to cast an illusion spell to hide as another girl and act unnoticed, but that would mean leaving without tasting Aviada while she was in the perfect mood. </p><p>Luckily, my magic was versatile enough to give me another solution. A simple application of fire magic made an even thicker steam cloud, one that made it hard to see anything other than a shadow. Using an illusion spell to erase my own silhouette was trivial at that point. </p><p>“Keep your voice down,” I whispered into Aviada’s ear even as I slid inside her simultaneously. She gave me a scandalized look, trying to look like she did not appreciate my initiative, but her body disagreed as I easily slid into her wetness, forcing out a small moan. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 56%]</p><p>The thick cloud of steam might be preventing our uninvited guest from seeing me, but the same didn’t apply for the reverse. Moments after my ward was triggered, a redhead that was even bustier than Aviada walked into the showers, and turned on the nearest one. I couldn’t help but examine her breasts, miraculously defying gravity despite their impressive size, though her hips were no different. She didn’t have Aviada’s perfectly toned body, but she was beautiful enough to make that thicker look work with her perfect hourglass shape. </p><p>[Level Difference of at least 50%! No Experience]</p><p>Pity there was no reward from seeing her, as I would have loved to make her a priority. </p><p>“Hi, Aviada,” she said cheerfully, indicating that they were good friends. I panicked momentarily when she easily recognized Aviada despite the cloud of steam, then I realized Aviada’s sword —a very distinctive piece of equipment— was just a few feet away. “You’re early again, another all-nighter hunting rabbits?” </p><p> “Same old, same old,” Aviada answered evenly, which annoyed me a bit. I didn’t like just how easily she was speaking with my shaft inside her, so I grabbed her breasts, my fingers sinking into her flesh to make it much harder. The gasp she let out was simply beautiful. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 58%]</p><p>“Hey, are you okay,” she asked in a concerned tone as she tried to peer through the cloud, her green eyes shining with concern. It was clear that she was a good friend of Aviada. </p><p>“Y-yeah,” she stammered, her response made even more difficult as I started pumping into her with long, even strokes, enjoying her warm tightness. </p><p>“You don’t sound okay?” she answered even as she stopped soaping up, and turned to face Aviada. The sight of her spectacular breasts, covered with a rapidly-thinning layer of bubbles made the sight even more delicious. I picked up speed, though still careful not to make any noise. </p><p>“I just p-pulled a muscle, not a big deal,” Aviada answered, but then she gasped painfully as a result of the surprise intrusion of my finger slipping into her puckered hole. I pushed Aviada even more, because our mystery visitor was clearly a good friend, and I was feeling adventurous enough to take the risk.</p><p> [Companion Acquisition: Progress 63%]</p><p>And if the sudden jump in the Companion Progress was any indicator, despite her angry glare, Aviada also enjoyed my domineering action. </p><p>“It doesn’t sound like no big deal,” she said as she closed in. “I’m going to take a look!” </p><p>I could have easily hidden with a mid-level illusion spell under the circumstances, but since she wanted to take a look, I decided to give her what she wanted, and let the cloud of steam dissipate, just as she was a step away from Aviada. </p><p>Their eyes widened simultaneously as they found themselves face to face without anything to cover their bodies. Our mystery guest’s gaze fell down for a moment, to the point where my shaft repeatedly disappeared into Aviada’s entrance, frozen in shock. </p><p>“So, Aviada, won’t you introduce your friend,” I said even as I increased the pacing, and suddenly the sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room. </p><p>“Carla,” was all she was able to say before her climax hit her mercilessly as she collapsed to the floor, shuddering. Normally, I would have held her upright and continued fucking, but the alternative was just too amusing not to take. </p><p> [Companion Acquisition: Progress 65%]</p><p>I presented my hand to Carla. “Since Aviada is rude enough not to continue, let me introduce myself. Caesar,” I said, and even grabbed her hand to place a soft kiss on her knuckles with such a perfect mannerism that it wouldn’t be amiss at a high-class party. </p><p>Of course, the fact that I was naked, and making my rock hard shaft still coated with her friend’s juices very visible might have changed the impact slightly. “Nice to meet you,” she managed to stammer, mostly in shock as her gaze bounced around the room, including Aviada’s naked figure, and my erect shaft.  “I need to go…” she continued, still dazed in shock. “I have a thing…” </p><p>“You certainly do,” I said even as I looked at her breasts very pointedly, which was finally enough to trigger her to escape, her ass jiggling with each hurried step. </p><p>“You’re an evil man,” Aviada said, but she made the mistake of saying that while she was still naked and on all fours in front of me, so I decided to teach her a lesson. A quick spell was enough to clean her puckered hole, and I slid inside for an even tighter second round. </p><p>When we finally finished almost half an hour later, Aviada was barely able to stumble into her bed, yet utterly satisfied…</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 72%]</p><p>As I snuck back to my room, a wide smile was on my face, my mind already on how to arrange another meeting with Aviada’s interesting friend… </p><p>————</p><p>[Level: 20    Experience: 203100 / 210000 </p><p>Strength: 24    Charisma: 34</p><p>Precision: 17    Perception: 21</p><p>Agility: 21     Manipulation: 26</p><p>Speed: 19       Intelligence: 26</p><p>Endurance: 18      Wisdom: 28</p><p>HP: 1980 / 1980\tMana: 2700 / 2700        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Expert Tantric [75/75]</p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Pomerium (City Center), Rome, Italy</strong></p><p>A man in his seventies, wearing the ceremonial toga that signified him as a member of the Roman Senate, walked through the crowded streets of Pomerium, the holy center of the Roman Republic, the strongest bastion of Imperium. As he walked, the crowd parted around him, each looking at him. Some with reverence, some with hope, others with hatred, but regardless of the source, he enjoyed their eyes on him, because it signified the power. </p><p>Most men would be afraid of people’s hatred, fearing harm, but he was not one of them. And not because of a dozen Gladiators, armed to the teeth. He had guards, because his prestige as an Ex-Preator and one of the most influential members of the Senate required it. He was one of the strongest Sorcerers, managing to cultivate his power to the limit, and quenched it with decades of experience in the Battlefields of North Africa. Anyone that was strong enough to threaten him would have destroyed those guards in a second… Not that he needed to be afraid of it. He trusted himself as peerless in the Sorcerer realm. Only a group of Sorcerers, or gods forbid, and Archmagus could threaten him. </p><p>Former could never penetrate into the Heart of the Republic to face him, and the latter… Well, if an Archmagus really wanted to kill him, he probably could, but luckily, there were less than a dozen of them in the Republic, and every single one of them was older than two hundred, long withdrawn from the chaos of Politics, lost in their esoteric studies, trying to decipher the meaning of reality. They would never get involved with daily life unless there was a huge emergency, or another Archmagus decided to target the Republic. </p><p>Once his plan was complete and he ascended, he was going to be a different kind of Archmagus, on that he was certain… He was going to remind the world why Archmagus was to be feared. </p><p>Of course, only if his pathetic subordinates could finally achieve their mission, he thought with a sudden frown, when he felt a small stone in his pocket pulsating. His frown stayed on his face as he stepped into his villa, his gladiator guards staying at the perimeter. When a slave walked toward him, carrying a wine, he gestured him away, instead, he walked toward his private study. </p><p>Before doing anything else, he raised the defensive wards to prevent any attempt of spying. They were a result of centuries of a collaborative effort of his family, which had to honor of raising many Sorcerer’s. His villa’s defenses second only to Senate, even surpassing many important temples. Still, even then, he made sure to check for listening spells. The game he was playing was too dangerous to slip… </p><p>Only after making sure that he was completely protected, he activated a runic device. It was a communication device manufactured by an Archmagus itself, given as a gift to one of his ancestors. It was priceless, more than enough to buy a city if he ever sold it. It was precious, because it allowed perfect communication without any chance of interception. </p><p>He took a deep breath and activated the device, and a screen of light flickered into existence before it formed the illusion of a tall man, wearing a combination of gray and black, with a rune-covered blade on his waist. On his back, the sea was visible, a small storm still ongoing, and in the distance, a large port could be seen. </p><p>Even remotely, the man dressed in blacks was enough to intimidate many people, but the senator wasn’t one of those. “Any news,” he asked impatiently when he recognized the port itself. It was the port of Londinium. </p><p>“We have discovered the identity of the stowaway,” the figure spoke with a clear tone, one that signaled a rich upbringing and quality education. “It seems like poor luck. We have identified him as a student that failed to graduate, then escaped from his uncle for a family dispute. It was our poor luck that the Conduit turned out to be from the same class, so he took the risk of saving her.” </p><p>The senator took a deep breath to control his spiking anger, trying not to lash out. He usually didn’t bother sparing the feelings of his subordinates, but the captain was different. As another Sorcerer —even one of the lower circles— he deserved some respect. Still, he felt it challenging, as challenging as the day he had reported that he somehow lost the Conduit and the Spark on the same day, even losing his own familiar in the process —a true disgrace for a sorcerer. </p><p>“So,” the senator murmured in a false calmness. “You’re saying that it’s a complete coincidence that a plan of twenty years had staggered in its most critical stage, and only because you were too busy to defend the most important ingredients of the ritual.” </p><p>“I went to acquire the Container personally,” the captain defended himself, and not for the first time. “There was no way anyone else could have to succeed in stealing that. Not my man, not that barbarian priest with an overinflated sense of ego, not even your precious Legionnaires-” he tried to continue, but was silenced when the senator raised his hand. </p><p>“Enough,” he called. “I’m fed up with listening to your excuses. They were pointless enough the first time. I don’t want to endure a repeat of them. You know our deal. Only after you collect everything I require, I’ll loan you enough money to hire the mercenaries you require. Then you can go back to Constantinople and die your pointless attempt to become the Emperor.” </p><p>“We’ll see,” the captain answered sharply. “I will not rest until I get the throne I deserve, not even in death!” </p><p>The senator looked at him, doing his best not to show his boredom at his pointless display. Like it mattered whether he deserved power or not. It was all about what you could take, and what you could hold. Pointless entitlement wasn’t the reason he was able to climb to the top of the Republic’s power structure, and aiming to heights that had never been reached before. </p><p>Just as he was about to end the communication, he was struck with a flight of fancy, wondering the name of the unlucky person who had managed to put himself into the meat grinder of his plans. “What’s the name of the man that ruined my plans by accident?” he asked, then chuckled. “Maybe I should offer him a job.” </p><p>“You shouldn’t,” the captain said immediately. “He’s just a bastard son of a disgraced family, tethering near destruction. I don’t even remember his name, but his family name is Scipio.” </p><p>The senator suddenly felt his heart grasped by a cold claw. “Scipio!” he shouted in anger. “Did you say, Scipio!” </p><p>“Yes,” the captain answered, suddenly stammering. Even from a distance, a peak Sorcerer’s anger was not something to be suffered lightly. </p><p>“IDIOT!” the senator cried even as he grabbed the relic, squeezing hard. Then he noticed a new crack, and realized he had damaged a precious artifact in a moment of fury. He loosened his grip, making his hands into fists instead, punching the wall repeatedly, the pain only an echo. </p><p>“What’s-” the captain started, but he was silenced immediately at the cries of the Senator. </p><p>“Moron,” he called. “We have been played. Tell me everything you learned about this young Scipio,” he ordered. </p><p>“Give me a moment, I’ll ask my subordinates,” the captain said, and he disappeared, leaving the senator alone with his frantic heartbeat. </p><p>Forty years, the senator thought in desperation. He had thought that he had managed to get rid of that stupid fool called Aemon Scipio forty years ago when he came strutting down into Rome, like he was anything more than an upstart rat from one of the colonies. What if he had a prestigious family name. What if he showed the strongest potential their backwater academy had ever seen. Who was Aemon to seduce a girl above his station, one he had fancied as well…  </p><p>He had thought that upstart Aemon how the game was played when he finally ambushed him with his cohort, injuring him badly enough to ensure he would never become a Sorcerer. </p><p>He had thought himself clever when rather than killing him, he sent him limping back to the Colonies, banished from Rome, like a living testament to all of his rivals that challenging him meant not only pain, but also ultimate humiliation… He even believed that just a couple of years ago, he had delivered the ultimate humiliation, when he discreetly arranged for his son to receive a deadly poison, giving him a shameful death in the hands of his own blood… </p><p>Of course, now that his progeny suddenly found himself in the middle of his plan, he was cursing the pride that made him do those things. Maybe he should have just killed him. </p><p>While he was deep in thought, the captain stumbled back into view. “His name is Marcus Scipio,” the Captain said. “Unremarkable despite rumored to be trained by his grandfather, Aemon Scipio. Complete lack of aptitude toward magic, shy, cowardly, not good in magical or military theory…” the captain started, every scrap of information he counted making the senator panic harder. </p><p>“We have been played,” the senator exclaimed in anger. The captain looked at him questioningly. “Don’t you see, Aemon raised him just to have his revenge. There’s no way someone raised by him is that unremarkable, unless he was playing possum until the time to strike. How can it be a coincidence that the grandson of my enemy suddenly finds itself in the docks to board your boat, throwing his chance to a good life through graduating, coincidentally being there the only time he could intercept both the Conduit and the Spark. He was the perfect counter, a step ahead of us the whole time.” </p><p>“But that’s impossible, it means that they knew exactly where we were, and what was our action plan. That means…” </p><p>The senator completed his sentence. “That there’s a traitor in the Council, maybe even more than one.” He took a deep breath. “Don’t tell anyone, I’ll be responsible for finding that traitor. You need to find Marcus Scipio’s trail as soon as possible. I’m going to send two cohorts as support just in case.” </p><p>“A thousand Legionnaires, and two Sorcerer-Centurions?” the captain asked, shocked. “It’ll be three Sorcerers if you want me to cooperate. Don’t you think it’s a bit excessive?” </p><p>“Maybe, but it’s better safe than sorry. We have already made that mistake. I would have sent a full legion if I could have got away with it, but the risk of getting noticed by other senators is too high. Two cohorts are the limit, and only because he’s near the border.” The senator took a deep breath. “You have your orders. Don’t screw things up, and don’t let the Container to be lost as well, or you might convince me that you’re the spy.” </p><p>“Understood,” the captain said, his sudden blanching showing that he fully understood the threat he received. </p><p>“Excellent,” the senator said, and ended the communication, his mind on the devastating hit one of his old enemies had delivered beyond the grave. </p><p>Maybe he should have just killed him years ago… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I pressed my shaft against Lillian’s entrance, I wasn’t expecting her to raise her head and start begging. “No, not my virginity, please,” she said, telling me that I might have misread the situation. </p><p>“As you wish, honey,” I answered as I prepared to pull back, but I decided to test my luck nonetheless. I raised the crown of my shaft just a bit, until it was pressing against her puckered hole. “How about this?” I asked, chuckling. </p><p>I was expecting either a hesitant rejection, or an emphatic, panicked pull. Her sudden silence was surprising, though not as much as when she caught my eye and whispered. “Will it hurt?” she asked, but she wasn’t frightened. A bit hesitant, maybe, but definitely very excited nonetheless. </p><p>“It’s supposed to hurt a bit, but it’s nothing compared to the pleasure I’ll bring you,” I promised, happy with the sudden turn of events. Not getting her virginity was nothing compared to the permission to take her tight hole. And since I finally had control of my magic once again, I had access to my shortcuts. </p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment of concentration, then cast my spell, preparing and lubricating Lillian for the fun that was about to start. “What was that-” she started, only to be interrupted by a gasp of shock when I slipped a finger inside, forcing a moan out of her. </p><p>“Just a little magical aid to ensure you’re prepped and ready to go,” I answered even as I pushed my finger deeper, forcing her to moan rather than replying. </p><p>“That’s enough talking, you still have a lot to do here,” Astrid said suddenly, pushing herself into the conversation in a fun way as she grabbed Lillian’s head and pulled her down, forcing her to continue her service. </p><p>“Hey-” Lillian tried to exclaim, only to be silenced as Astrid pulled her down, Astrid’s superior strength coming in handy. My finger moved back and forth as I watched the amazing scene, enjoying the way the girls chose to bridge their differences. It still left the question of what had happened when I was unconscious to make them closer despite their rivalry, but the way Lillian moaned as I added a second finger was enough to demote the importance of that question. </p><p>I watched as Lillian’s tongue danced around Astrid’s entrance with practiced ease, suggesting that some of the guesses the boys had about the hobbies the female half of the student body had had were rather accurate, at least where Lillian was concerned. From the way her back arched, putting her spectacular breasts on display, Astrid seemed to share the idea. </p><p>“God, your tongue is amazing,” Astrid moaned. “It’s the second-best thing I’ve ever had there,” she complimented. I couldn’t help but smirk pridefully. Lillian just hummed in appreciation for a while, not breaking her stride. “Work it out, you whore,” Astrid added, and that managed to raise Lillian’s ire. </p><p>She pulled back despite Astrid’s moan, and turned to me. I didn’t say anything, because I recognized the expression on her face, it was the same one she had when she decided to humiliate Astrid by sabotaging her clothes —mischievous yet sexy. Since the previous one had ended in such a spectacular manner, I decided to give her the chance for a repeat. </p><p>“Cast the spell on her as well,” Lillian ordered sharply. I might have normally taken offense at such a tone, but under the circumstances, and with what was about to follow, I decided not to react badly. I still added a third finger prematurely just as I cast the spell, making her moan loudly. </p><p>Lillian’s way of dealing with the pain turned out to be rather inventive. Without a warning, she jammed three of her fingers inside Astrid, making her gasp in shock and pain. Lillian’s tongue was already on her knob, continuing to lick her, which turned Astrid’s pain into confusion. </p><p>“How dare-” Astrid started, but I gestured for her to stay silent. She followed it immediately, not knowing I did that for her benefit. Lillian was not the best person to provoke when her fingers were jammed into such a sensitive place. Instead, Astrid limited herself to moaning loudly, her voice strained by a delicious combination of pain and pleasure, making my shaft throb in anticipation. </p><p>It was time. I pulled out my fingers and pressed the crown of my shaft against her puckered hole, only for Lillian to gasp. “Isn’t it a bit early?” she rapidly asked. </p><p>“I’m just following your lead, honey,” I answered even as I slowly pushed my shaft inside, enjoying the way her tightness wrapped around me, gifting me with an amazing sensation. She moaned in a tone that was eerily similar to Astrid’s, one I might have mixed if Astrid hadn’t been crying simultaneously. </p><p>“Fuck, you’re tight,” I gasped even as I slowly invaded her virgin tightness, but before I could continue, I felt the repeat of the weird connection I felt while I was cumming in Astrid, our magic mingling. But with one great difference, the resonance was even stronger with Lillian, like she was the epicenter and Astrid was the support. </p><p>I decided that a particular question couldn’t be delayed too much, though stopping what I was doing was definitely not an option either. “So, Lillian, tell me what happened after I collapsed.” </p><p>“A lot,” she said, trying to sound stern, which was rather difficult with my presence lodged in her behind, pushing deeper and deeper. “What in the world made you decide that in the middle of the wilderness with absolutely no preparation whatever was a good place to ascend to Sorcerer level?” she asked, sounding angry and concerned at the same time. She once again raised her head from between Astrid’s toned thighs, but her fingers were still in her puckered hole, pumping repeatedly. </p><p>“You know that I went through the Ascension,” I asked. </p><p>“Of course I do,” Lillian answered. “I’m the heiress of the house. Do you think you’re the only one with access to secret documents, or do you think yours is the only family with a past more glorious than the present.” </p><p>I didn’t want to admit that I had never read anything about the transformation until I could milk her a bit more, so I decided to play along. If she thought I knew what I was talking about, she would be more open with her family secrets —not to mention I had the environmental distractions aligned to confuse her even more, though once again accidentally. </p><p>I had already learned that what had happened to me was a natural reaction to the Sorcerer ascension, though the way I handled it was certainly unorthodox. “I guess not,” I said.</p><p>“What was the method you used? A family secret?” she asked, fascinated, though followed by a moan as I slammed inside her, pushing the full length inside her for the first time. Also, she switched to Greek as we talked, making sure that Astrid didn’t understand a word of it. Considering the way Astrid was moaning, I didn’t think was a likely possibility, but I was happy to follow her lead if it made her more willing to share her secrets. For a while, she lost her track of thought, the sound of flesh hitting flesh filling the room. </p><p>“Something like that,” I said, still in Greek instead of Latin, doing my best to sound boastful and smug. Luckily, with the beautiful sight in front of me, it wasn’t hard to feel smug. “Why, impressed?” I added like I was mocking her.  </p><p>“Of course,” she answered. “I have never even read a story about someone trying to break the barrier without first thoroughly hiding themselves from the Earth. The backlash of the elements is impossible to resist,” she said, then added. “Well, supposed to be impossible, but they probably didn’t consider your crazy family,” she said. She must have been affected a lot, because she launched into an explanation about why doing Ascending without isolation was supposed to be impossible, with several very graphic examples.</p><p>“I don’t know what method you used,” she continued, her heated explanation broken by repeated moans as I continued to slam into her ass, still feeling our magic mingle as well. “But whatever it was, it wasn’t enough to completely stabilize you. You’re lucky that I was there to use a secret family technique to stabilize you.”  </p><p>Only then did I realize the extent of my luck. I didn’t know why, but I knew that the repeated lightning strikes were responsible for my survival. Well, them and Lillian if she was telling the truth. Considering my own magic seemed to agree with her, I had no reason to disbelieve her.</p><p>“Interesting,” I said. “But I’m going to put a limb on the line and guess that you weren’t the only one that used that technique,” I asked. </p><p>“I was,” she answered, surprising me enough that I stopped for a moment. “Hey, don’t stop!” she warned. “After everything I’ve done for you for the last few days, the least you can do is to fuck me properly,” she added. I decided her complaint had merit, and started impaling her even harder. </p><p>“So, you’re the only one that used it,” I asked. </p><p>“Yeah,” she said, but her tone suggested that there might be other relevant details. “I was the only one that used it, but then you had to be weird and unpredictable,” she added. </p><p>“How so?” I asked even as I slapped her ass, more for the sheer joy of leaving a mark on her alabaster skin than anything else. </p><p>“I had just triggered the ritual, and was on the first of seven steps, when your magic lashed out and wrapped around me. It was supposed to do something similar, but only after I coaxed it through several actions then…” she said, then suddenly falling silent. </p><p>“Then what?” I asked. </p><p>“Then we needed to connect carnally at the seventh step to mingle our magic, and through mine, your magic would stabilize and strengthen,” she admitted. I couldn’t help but feel touched, as I knew the implications of her sacrificing her virginity considering her position as an heiress. And with extra knowledge about their secret art, the value her family would put on her purity would be incomprehensible. </p><p>It also raised some new questions about her kidnapping, but I decided to leave them to a later date. “So, what happened instead?” </p><p>“Your magic jumped out and coaxed my magic instead, then jumped to Astrid as well.” She stopped for a moment to man to her heart’s content, then continued. “It should be impossible to establish such a bond with three people, but I’m beginning to understand that you’re too stupid to understand what’s impossible.” </p><p>Her last statement managed to earn a moan from me. “Maybe, “ I said, switching to Latin. “But we have bored Astrid enough with our discussion. </p><p>“She doesn’t seem bored,” Lillian answered, gesturing at Astrid, who was moaning happily as Lillian continued to finger her asshole, using all five fingers. </p><p>“Maybe, but it doesn’t mean that we can’t make the situation even more fun,” I said even as I pulled out for a moment, and threw Lillian on top of Astrid, their breasts pressed tight, their lips just inches apart. Then, the next time I pushed forward, it was Astrid’s puckered hole I found myself in rather than Lillian’s. </p><p>Astrid cried in surprise. “We need to keep you silent,” Lillian said before she started kissing Astrid, their tongues swirling together. Blonde and crimson mixed, they created a beautiful sight that I wanted to immortalize, but since I wasn’t a painter, I decided to enjoy the moment fully, and pushed deep inside Astrid, enjoying her plump ass. </p><p>A minute later, I switched, then it was Astrid’s turn to silence Lillian. She chose to go a slightly different direction, and pulled her against her chest instead, silencing Lillian with her spectacularly large tits. </p><p>It was a beautiful view, but I was once again distracted by the reaction of my own magic. It started sizzling under my skin, warm but not painful. Then I felt a magical echo from both Lillian and Astrid, separately but throbbing with a rhythm. I felt connected with my instincts in a way I had never experienced before. Unlike the call of the Dragon’s Heart, it didn’t feel foreign, but it was overwhelming nonetheless. </p><p>I had a feeling that I could have rejected the call, but doing so would somehow cause me to miss a monumental opportunity. I wouldn’t have followed it, but the feeling was the exact copy of the moment that lightning started to rain during my Ascension, saving my life. </p><p>I decided to take the risk, and flared my magic under the guidance of my instincts. I barely had enough time to draw several runes in the air, hiding the magical signature of the room. I dumped enough power into those runes to kill a Cohort of Legionaries, but I had a feeling that it would be barely enough…</p><p>Lightning flared around me, covering my skin, but since the girls just moaned louder rather than crying out in deadly pain, I decided to continue. Though, with my magic flowing unrestricted, throbbing as if trying to tell me that stopping was not an option. </p><p>The girls cried, their eyes shining with the small flares of lightning, copying the transformation of my own magic. They moaned and gasped while I recklessly invaded their puckered holes, and Lillian started trembling with the most explosive orgasm I had ever seen when I finally filled her puckered hole, and she collapsed, unconscious, but I could feel that she was healthy. Maybe even healthier. </p><p>“I want it too,” Astrid growled, wild and primal even for her. She pulled herself from under Lillian like she wanted to wrestle me down, but I was quicker. I pinned her down and slid inside her puckered hole, slamming with the aggression she deserved and welcomed at the same time. </p><p>When I finally came inside her ass, she repeated Lillian’s reaction. She trembled and gasped as her climax pushed her into unconsciousness, but her magic continued to flow strong, suggesting that I somehow managed to do something impossible again. </p><p>Well, that could be left for tomorrow, I decided. Whatever that was, it drained me almost completely, and strained my magic-isolating runes to the point of collapse as well. I dispelled them —and added several protective runes around the room just in case— before I slid back into the bed, between the two exhausted beauties. </p><p>However, as I slowly lost consciousness, I couldn’t help but think that what I did was just the first step of a very complicated journey… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After a brief consideration, rather than returning to Helga, I decided to leave the school for a midnight hunt, something only a madman would do. </p><p>A madman, or an extraordinarily-strong level twenty with a wide range of expertise that was suddenly feeling trapped after his latest realization that there was a mysterious threat out there. I felt trapped, and with my strength, I didn’t appreciate the feeling, and I was willing to risk a violent death to get rid of it. </p><p>During the day, the surroundings were usually safe enough that even low-level students could go hunting without too big of a risk as long as they had a minder. The same wasn’t applicable for the night, however. There were a lot of creatures that preferred the darkness to move around in, easily avoiding the culling efforts. The shadow wolf that almost killed me when I was in the protected forest was a good example of it. </p><p>So, when I actually heard the footsteps barely louder than a whisper, a smile appeared on my face. When I felt the presence closing in, I did nothing until the last second, then slashed expertly four times before my attacker could react. The shadow wolf collapsed on the ground, bleeding, quickly driving toward its death despite its impressive vitality. Just a sign of how far I had come. </p><p>However, I decided to experiment. I let my mana seep into its head, trying to force it into the creature’s soul space, or whatever its equivalent was. </p><p>I received a stab of pain as a reward. </p><p>[-53 Mana]</p><p>[-266 HP]</p><p>“That was a stupid move,” I murmured even as I rubbed my head, trying to ignore the sudden stab of pain. I hadn’t expected its core to be filled with violent energies, immediately attacking toward me the moment I touched it. The smart thing would be just to let it slide, but I decided to do the stupid thing, and kept my mana around its core, just not letting it connect again. When the creature died, the core dissipated except for a sliver of energy, and that sliver of energy tried to connect with me, but failed to find a purchase before dissipating. It was nothing I had read about, but I had a feeling that I had discovered how normal people gained experience. </p><p>It was a barely noticeable process, the only reason I was able to detect it was because of my ridiculous stats and specialized Mana manipulation skill. Even then, I had a question. Did I discover something new, or did I discover something that others knew but kept under wraps. I had a feeling that it was the second part. </p><p>With a sigh, I continued my deadly hunt, killing several creatures in rapid succession, the most dangerous one being a Class Fifteen Blood Owl, but even that didn’t survive for more than a minute against me. For every creature I tested, I observed the same pattern. Violent core, linking with its killer, but only to fail to find a purchase in my case. Maybe I should observe them being killed by another person. It would give me a better idea of what was going on during a level up, maybe even to a point that I might enhance the effectiveness of my newly-discovered leveling methodology. </p><p>It was a pity I didn’t have anyone I could wake up in the middle of the night to ask me to accompany for a bit of killing. </p><p>Or did I? </p><p>With a smirk I returned back to the school, once again avoiding the guards with contemptuous ease. I knew that they were geared against monsters rather than human infiltrators, but it was still shameful. Rather dangerous as well, considering my encounters with the necromancers. Slipping into the Fighter quarters had been a bit more difficult. Unlike the outer walls, this section was protected by the students, and some rangers had rather sharp eyes.</p><p>Luckily, I was well past the point of being scared of their attention, not with my stats. Disguised as a servant, it required only a few low-powered spells before I arrived at the female section. </p><p>At a glance, I could see that the living principles in this area were very different. The mage section allowed expensive rooms with opulent furnishings, while this section was much more spartan. Noble students had a small room for themselves, while the others lived in bunk beds, a necessity considering there were a lot more warrior classes than mage classes, especially from the less fortunate with no perceived potential for high levels. </p><p>With a low-level cap, warriors were a much better choice than mage classes. </p><p>As I walked through the rooms, concealed in the shadows, I saw many beautiful students in various states of undress. Unfortunately, it was invariably followed by that infernal notification. </p><p>[Level Difference of at least 50%! No Experience]</p><p>At level twenty, I was well-past the limits of this school. I believed that I was strong enough to defeat the majority of the teaching staff, even, even if that was more about my unorthodox style and overwhelming stats than a dominating level advantage. Other than the very rare exceptions like Cornelia, students couldn’t help me enhance my strength. </p><p>When I arrived at Aviada’s room, I did my best to silently unlock the simple lock that was keeping her door closed, and slid inside before alerting anyone. </p><p>I wasn’t expecting to meet with the naked figure of Aviada, who, apparently, preferred to sleep in the buff. I decided to mess with her a bit, and quickly undressed before sliding in next to her, curious just how long I could mess with her without waking her up. </p><p>First, I gently caressed her arm, making her turn restlessly until she was laying on her back, her legs parted enough to reveal the beautiful treasure between them. However, I had other priorities. I leaned in for a kiss, and with the opportunity, I even slipped a small stream of mana in, examining her soul space. </p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>With our strong bond and the increase in my Tantric abilities, the impression I received was the clearest yet. I could easily sense her stat distribution, heavily leaning toward the physical side, with strength shining above and beyond others. Her mental stats were low, but relatively well-distributed. </p><p>Her skills, on the other hand, were extremely specialized. She only had two skills, a fully evolved Grandmaster Sword, and Basic Observation. She was amazing with her sword, which was shining on the hook above her bed, but without that, she was dangerously vulnerable. </p><p>Luckily for her, I was making great strides in understanding the System. Who knows, maybe when I attain Master Tantric, I might actually do something about that. After a brief examination, I carefully dissipated the mana, not letting it get absorbed by her. I didn’t want to give her experience yet. Not because I didn’t trust her, but because I was afraid that she wouldn’t get the dangers associated with a wider reveal. She was too straightforward to be a part of this discussion. </p><p>Instead, I started caressing her breasts, enjoying the way they stiffened and she moaned, but still not waking up. I decided to up the ante, and let my fingers cross the smooth expanse of her stomach before arriving between her legs, caressing gently. Once again, she just moaned, but still stayed asleep, even when I gently fingered her for five whole minutes. </p><p>It was likely because unconsciously, she identified me as a familiar presence, preventing her from waking up in alarm, as there was no other explanation for her sleepiness. Maybe I should teach her a lesson before we went out for training. </p><p>I climbed on top of her, and grabbed both of her arms, ready to pin her in place the moment she woke up. Then, I aligned myself at her entrance, and leaned down for a kiss. “Good morning, princess,” I whispered before kissing her softly, and her eyes popped open in shock. </p><p>“Caesar-” she started, only to be silenced as I slid inside her, enjoying her tightness. She was wet thanks to the foreplay she received when she was sleeping. She moaned at the sudden intrusion, but before she could cry, I stole another kiss. </p><p>“I didn’t put any up any silencing wards, so you need to be silent,” I warned her with a playful smile. </p><p>“You’re seeking death,” she murmured as she tried to raise her arm, only to find herself unable to move. “You got stronger,” she whispered in shock, which was very understandable. The last time we wrestled, she was stronger than me by a small margin, and I only managed to defeat her through my recent boost. </p><p>This time, she was barely able to move, not shocking considering I had several points more strength, and a superior position. “I did,” I answered simply before leaning on for a lingering kiss. </p><p>“How?” she asked followed by a moan considering I was still moving deep inside her. </p><p>“It all started after I left you girls behind and went to the canyon, only to find a deadly necromancer ambush. A horde, several bone dragons, and two dozen necromancers,” I explained, and her eyes widened in shock. Understandable, as that group could have easily destroyed a town, and even against a mid-sized city, they wouldn’t have necessarily lost. </p><p>“How did you survive that?” she asked in shock, though from the way she tightened, she was clearly enjoying the story. </p><p>“The ambush was not for me, so I managed to hit them from behind, breaking their magical trap and killing a couple of necromancers as a start,” I explained, before launching into a detailed breakdown of the battle, making sure to avoid any references that would reveal Titania’s identity. Once again, I didn’t trust her capacity to hold secrets in the areas she wouldn’t understand its importance. Even convincing her not to brag about my part was a challenge. </p><p>Still, I was glad that I told the tale for a few reasons. She was my ally as well as my girlfriend —or something like that, at least, the titles were rather confusing at the moment— and she deserved to know of the growing threat of the necromancers. Also, if I could resolve my challenges, I would be able to boost her combat capabilities a great deal, enough to make her a deadly combatant, especially with her unique sword, Also, unlike the more mysterious details, she fully understood the sensitivity of the combat information, and would keep her mouth closed. </p><p>Of course, the benefits were not limited to that. When I pushed deep inside her once more after finishing my tale, I was met with a welcome notification.  </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 51%]</p><p>Apparently, impressing her with the tales of my heroic battle made our relationship even stronger, making the discussion worthwhile. “So,” I said with a smirk as I lowered myself down until I started looking at her eyes from very close proximity. “Do I get a reward for my impressive performance,” I asked even as I sped up my pacing, impaling her again and again, enjoying the way she tried to suppress her moans, but with limited success. </p><p>I decided to have mercy as her orgasm hit her. I quickly established a silencing ward to cover the wall, but I didn’t inform her of that, watching as she bit her lips desperately, trying to contain the moans of her orgasm, only to fail spectacularly. The panic in her eyes was just beautiful. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 54%]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 2. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>“Don’t worry, I silenced the room just before you lost control,” I whispered into her ear throatily, and earned a painful bite on my shoulder as a result, one that hurt despite my ridiculous endurance. </p><p>[-10 HP]</p><p>“That’s your punishment for daring to play with me like that,” she explained even as she tried to get away from my grip. I let her slide away, but when she tried to push me out of the bed, I chose to roll out and started dressing instead. “You’re leaving?” she murmured, her tone uncharacteristically vulnerable. </p><p>“No, we’re going,” I answered. “I’m in the mood for a midnight hunt,” I added, before letting my smirk widen salaciously. “And maybe more if the way you dress impresses me,” I added. </p><p>“Is that so?” she murmured, her smile equally wide as she walked toward her closet. “Turn your back,” she ordered mischievously. </p><p>I did so, curious about her surprise. When she called me to turn back, I couldn’t help but frown as she revealed herself in a thick travel cape, tied up to cover her whole body. A frown appeared on my face, and she smiled wider before letting it widen just enough to give a glimpse of her armor underneath, one that covered significantly less area than I had been expecting. “Much better,” I said with a smirk, gesturing for her to follow me, while I once again cast a spell to conceal our presence and let us fade into the shadows. </p><p>[-15 Mana]</p><p>“I have to admit, magic can be useful occasionally,” she admitted with a sigh, which was a great thing considering her usual antagonistic approach. It was good to see her finally getting softer on the issue. We stayed silent until we reached the walls, and she spoke in shock. “We’re going outside?” she gasped. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered. “I’m not in the mood for hunting rabbits.” She looked unsure, so I put my hand on her shoulder, squeezing softly. It was enough to renew her courage. </p><p>She finally let her cape open when we were a couple of miles away from the school, revealing the ensemble underneath, making me harden immediately. She was wearing a set of completely useless armor. Well, useless in terms of combat, as I could easily imagine different usages. Her top was covered with no more area than a bra —a particularly salacious one, even— while the bottom part was literally a piece of metal kept upright with strings. Under the moonlight, she looked delectable enough to eat.</p><p>“That seems useful for combat,” I said mockingly, but I let my gaze devour her body to convey the impact of it on me. Also, I was touched. The fact that she walked outside with absolutely no protection highlighted her trust in me, conveying that, with my skills, she needed no armor. </p><p>Not a functional one instead. </p><p>I was tempted to push her down and take her on the grass, but we were interrupted by a band of golden lions. Scary creatures, class fourteen power, strong cooperation, and a vicious mentality. Moreover, they were famous for their magic resistance, making them true pests. The attacking pride contained six members, definitely a scary combination. “Keep on defensive,” I ordered her even as I drew my sword, and dashed forward —after coating it with magic because its steel wouldn’t have resisted my strength otherwise. </p><p>[-96 Mana]</p><p>I was in need of a better weapon, as constantly wasting mana to reinforce my sword wasn’t the best option. Luckily, with two instances of my regeneration perk active, I wasn’t exactly straining for mana. </p><p>Golden lions were vicious predators with a unique blend of strength, grace, and vitality, but against me, they were helpless. I ducked under one of their claws, cutting its throat in return. I still rolled away, because even a cut to the throat was barely an inconvenience. </p><p>When I noticed two of them charging toward Aviada, however, I decided to act quickly. I raised my hand, and a thick earthen cage appeared around them, pinning them in place. </p><p>[-140 Mana]</p><p>They raged against the walls, trying to break it, while I delivered another bleeding wound to the one that attacked me first. I wanted to remove at least one of them as soon as possible. After receiving two more wounds in the next second, it pulled away rather than waiting for its pride mates. I used the opportunity to strengthen their cages, but didn’t bother to cast an offensive spell. Their skin was too strong to actually be affected by an elemental spell, at least not in a way that would be worth the mana expenditure. </p><p>[-430 Mana]</p><p>“Kill the wounded one,” I ordered even as I dashed forward and cut two of its tendons, but not without a cost. It landed a vicious blow to my shoulder. Luckily, I had HP to spare. </p><p>[-130 HP]</p><p>I stood in front of the wounded one, protecting Aviada as she approached, even casting a few lightning bolts to distract them. They might be resistant to magic, but nonetheless, the bright crackling of lightning cutting through the darkness was scary enough to trick their primitive minds. </p><p>I let my mana senses expand and wrapped them around Aviada and her victim, carefully watching the changes as Aviada delivered the killing blow. Like before, the creature’s energy dispersed into the air, with only a small sliver of it flying toward the soul space of its killer, in this case, Aviada, and merging with its boundaries, strengthening it slightly. </p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>Interesting, I thought even as I turned toward the rest of the lions, ready to make quick work of them. </p><p>Even as I charged once more, I couldn’t help but smile elatedly. The experiment I was running was a true joy, beautiful weather, danger enough to make me appreciate life, and a sexy brunette with a body to die for dressed in bikini armor. </p><p>Sometimes, being a nerd paid off… </p><p>———————</p><p>[Level: 20    Experience: 203100 / 210000 </p><p>Strength: 24    Charisma: 34</p><p>Precision: 17    Perception: 21</p><p>Agility: 21     Manipulation: 26</p><p>Speed: 19       Intelligence: 26</p><p>Endurance: 18      Wisdom: 28</p><p>HP: 1840 / 1980\tMana: 1920 / 2700        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Expert Tantric [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p>",

    "content": "<p>Jenny was uncharacteristically silent as we stepped out of the cab, and took the first step into the luxury hotel that was going to house us for the next few days. The reason for her silence was understandable. After the excitement of the moment passed, the guilt took root in her heart once more, unaware that her girlfriend had long passed the point of infidelity, well before I had been involved in their little game. </p><p>I could have tried to calm her down, but I let her stew on it, not wanting to have that conversation under the shadow of a curious cab driver, whose attention was on us —or more accurately, on Jenny’s beautiful legs— far more than appropriate. I was afraid that mentioning a girlfriend would distract him too much. </p><p>More importantly, I needed Jenny to properly process the action she had taken, and a silent cab drive, followed by equally silent processing through reception gave her sufficient time to process that. “You can go to the right room, and I’ll come after completing the paperwork,” I said to Jenny as I stood at the reception, leaving her alone. </p><p>“Sure,” Jenny murmured, standing next to me, confused about what to do. Then, after a moment, she leaned in and kissed my cheek softly before skittering away like a confused dove. A sexy, redheaded dove delicious enough to eat. </p><p>The reception stole away quite a bit of my time, almost fifteen minutes to sign all the papers required for the corporate retreat and tomorrow’s arrivals. Still, rather than walking upstairs immediately, I chose to stay at the bar, slowly nursing a beer, giving Jenny even more time to process her slip, before I swooped in for the killing blow. </p><p>It was almost an hour later that I walked upstairs to my room, and took a shower, ignoring the temptation to visit Jenny immediately, who was just a door away —not even through the corridor, as our rooms were connected through the wall, making the situation even more tempting. I wanted to stop there and take her once again.</p><p>Pity I still had one more thing to do before the action. I reached for my phone and made a video call, only for Natalie to answer immediately. Her eyes widened slightly as she saw my body, covered only by a thin towel wrapped around my waist, displaying my torso to her. “What if I was in a meeting,” Natalie murmured in shock, her beautiful face alight in shock. </p><p>“Then you would deserve it by opening a video call from me in a crowded room,” I said dismissively. “Are you alone?” </p><p>“Yes, but that doesn’t justify-” she started, only for her to stop immediately when I raised my hand in warning. </p><p>“Let out your tits, I’ve missed them,” I asked shamelessly. </p><p>“Do you think that-” she started, only to be cut off halfway once again. </p><p>“Yes,” I simply said even as I caught her eyes. It was satisfying to see that even though the small screen of the phone, I could make her flinch from just a word and a glare. Natalie had come a long way in order to accept my place above hers. She was mine, and no one else. </p><p>I was confident enough to ask her for help in completing the conquest of her girlfriend. </p><p>I watched as she pulled her blouse down, giving me a glimpse of her perky breasts, enough to form a tent in my towel even after months of exposure. She might have a rotten personality, but her body was spectacular. “Do you have something to speak about, or did you call just to ogle my tits?” she asked, snapping a bit. </p><p>“Guess who we met on the flight,” I asked, and when she looked with empty eyes, I continued. “Let me give you a small clue. We were in first class, and you were still in denial about the effects of my touch,” I said, only for her to shudder. </p><p>“Don’t tell me that you met with that silly stewardess,” she said derisively. </p><p>“Oh yes, and she was as tight as I remembered,” I answered. “Though Jenny was a bit apprehensive about her presence,” I added, only for Natalie to gasp in shock, and not a little bit of anger. “Don’t tell me that-” she started. </p><p>“Calm your tits, honey,” I said. “Jenny stays untouched by another female hand,” I said, and she let out a sigh. “A male hand, on the other hand…” I added with a smug expression. </p><p>Natalie just sighed, like it was a question she had no power to react to. Though, considering the several threesomes that she had stayed rather passive through, she probably did accept that, probably helped by the fact that Jenny was already carrying my child. After everything, nice lovemaking was not a big problem. </p><p>“However, we have a problem. Unlike us, Jenny still has a conscience, and she feels guilty. We’re going to help her get past it.” </p><p>“Of course we are,” Natalie murmured. “It’s not enough that you’re fucking me every single workday and have threesomes with us almost every time, but also I have to help my girlfriend get used to cheating on me.” </p><p>“Hey, don’t blame me for winning a fight that you started,” I said, amused by her insistent complaints. “Just make sure to tell her that it’s okay for me to help her relax,” I said. “And since you’re brave enough to backtalk, a little punishment is in order,” I said. </p><p>I could see her teeth squeezing, no doubt burning with a desire to ignore my words. “What do you have in mind, sir?” she ultimately whispered in defeat. </p><p>“You remember the little toy we used during the last investor meeting,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>Her expression turned into an interesting mixture of despair, arousal, and amusement. “Are you talking about the remote-controlled pink one,” she said. </p><p>“I can also control it from my phone,” I answered with a smirk. “Put that on, and if you can be convincing enough, I’m going to leave the camera running,” I said, and an excited smile suddenly appeared on her face. She obviously liked the last-minute addition to the plan. For all of her pride, Natalie was a simple creature, easily managed by a mixture of threats and rewards.  </p><p>After closing the call, I knocked on the door that was keeping our rooms separated. “Is that you, Nathan?” asked Jenny. “The door is open, you can come in,” she said. I opened it, only to see Jenny sitting on the bed, wearing a thick bathrobe, putting on a fresh layer of nail polish. She tried to look casually relaxed, but I knew her enough to see the lines of stress on her face, normally a practical impossibility from her cheerful self, especially after a long shower. </p><p>She was a nice woman that deserved more than Natalie —or me, if I’m being honest— but that was the situation. Luckily for her, however, I cared for my own. </p><p>“How are you feeling?” I asked. I ignored her noncommittal shrug and put my hands on her shoulders, feeling her tenseness as I squeezed softly. At first, she didn’t react to my massage, but after two minutes of my practiced caresses, she gasped. Unlike what I expected, however, she tightened up further after that. “You need to relax,” I murmured. </p><p>“It’s not that easy after what I did,” she murmured, her voice suddenly hitched. “I can’t believe I did that, betraying Natalie’s trust just like that.” </p><p>“Hey,” I answered. “Don’t push yourself too hard,” I said. “I’m sure that Natalie will be understanding if we just talk to her.” Even as I said, so, I pressed the volume up button on my phone, which was currently managing the intensity of the small vibrating toy inside Natalie. </p><p>“But how can I take that risk,” Jenny said, her beautiful green eyes wide as she turned to face me. “What if she reacts badly. And there’s a baby on the way-” she continued, suddenly spiraling, but I leaned forward to steal a kiss, more tender than I preferred, calming her down. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have a plan,” I said, not fearing the reaction of the woman I had been fucking every single workday for the last few months, especially not when she was wearing a remote-controlled vibrator at my orders. </p><p>I raised my phone, once again calling Natalie on video, and also subtly increasing the intensity of her toy another notch. Jenny looked at me in shock, but before she could react, Natalie answered. “Hi, Nat, sorry to disturb you in the middle of a busy day,” I said. </p><p>“No worries, though it seems like you’re interrupting yourself,” she said. </p><p>Jenny flinched, but I hugged her around the waist with one arm, trying to calm her down. For punishment, I increased the intensity by two levels, forcing Natalie to gasp in shock. Luckily, Jenny had other priorities that stopped her from noticing it. “Are you okay, Nat, you’re a bit flushed,” I said. </p><p>“It’s the air conditioner,” she explained in a hitched voice. “It’s making the room rather warm.” Then, she took a deep breath, getting a sliver of control back. “I’m guessing you guys are having a bit of trouble with that as well, considering the way you’re dressed.”  </p><p>“That’s what I wanted to talk you about, actually,” I said before Jenny could panic, and I increased the intensity yet another level, making it almost impossible for Natalie to maintain her composure. “The flight had been a bit hard for Jenny, and she is feeling a bit stressed.” </p><p>“Oh, no. She shouldn’t feel stressed, maybe the spa would help?” she said concernedly, faking it well enough to make Jenny look even guiltier. She was edging for punishment, I decided, forcing the device to the maximum speed without a warning, making Natalie yelp. </p><p>“Are you okay? And what’s that sound?” I asked, my tone just stiff enough to convey my warning. </p><p>“Someone left their phone on vibration,” she answered quickly, biting her lips to hold back a moan. She was lucky that Jenny was looking at the floor in her shame. “So, you were saying about the spa?” </p><p>“It’s not a bad idea, but I was hoping for a more familiar form of stress relief, which, as you know, helps a lot with Jenny’s special condition,” I said, intentionally letting the phone dip down, showing my erection. Next to Jenny who was dressed in just a bathrobe while teasing Natalie remotely worked wonders for my libido. “However, Jenny doesn’t want to do that without you, she says she feels guilty. Do you mind giving us permission for the day to explore our personal dynamics,” I said, wiggling my eyebrows playfully even as I pulled Jenny on my lap, a move that easily pushed away my barely-hanging towel. “The fun way, of course,” I added.  </p><p>“Hmm,” Natalie murmured thoughtfully, and Jenny stiffened, but on her face, hope was more prevalent than guilt. Natalie smirked in a way that made me suspicious that she was going to force the issue, which was an impressive expression to display while she was holding a furious vibrator inside, so I leaned back and sent a warning glare, making her flinch. “No, I don’t have a problem with it, you guys can have fun for today, as long as you have enough energy for me tomorrow,” she said panickedly, but Jenny was too happy to notice that particular detail. </p><p>“Really, sweetie, are you sure?” Jenny said happily, though not completely free of doubt. </p><p>“Yes, Jen, I’m sure,” Natalie answered, at that point, her eyelids were trembling a little as she struggled to hold her moans. I used the opportunity to lift Jenny a bit, just enough to pull the bottom of her robe out of the way. When she sat once more, she sat directly above my throbbing shaft, sliding inside her in one smooth motion. “Considering your situation, I think we’re well past the point of making a bit of private fun a problem,” Natalie said, struggling to hold a moan in.</p><p>Luckily for Natalie, she wasn’t the only one that was holding a moan in, and unlike her, Jenny was rather bad at it. My surprise intrusion forced her to blush, biting her lips desperately. “Well, that started quickly,” Natalie said, but I waved at her and ended the call. </p><p>“That was rude-” Jenny murmured even as I lifted her, only to slam deep inside her once again, interrupting her with a moan. “She allowed us to do so, and you just started immediately.”  </p><p>“I’m sure I can make it up to her,” I answered Jenny even as pushed her on the bed, her robe pulled open in the short tussle, showing her body that was worthy of goddesses. “Be right back,” I said even as I played with my phone a bit, making sure it was recording before I put it on the desk, leaning against the wall, the camera getting an amazing view of us. I promised a show to Natalie, and I was a man of my word. </p><p>When I came back, I was holding a bottle of chocolate sauce. “What’s that for-” she started, only to be silenced as I sprayed her tits with a fresh coat of chocolate, then leaned down immediately to suck them. “Stop, they are sensitive,” she tried to murmur, but this time, it was her own moan that interrupted her. </p><p>“I know,” I said as I raised my head to catch a fleeting kiss that shared the taste of chocolate with Jenny. “That’s why I’m going to eat you up.” </p><p>“Naughty,” Jenny moaned naughtily before she pulled me to her chest, forcing me to suck her breasts. I wasn’t exactly complaining, but I was surprised by the speed of her reaction. I was letting her wallow in guilt hoping for that exact reaction, but the intensity of her move surprised me. </p><p>Still, I wasn’t exactly unhappy in the position I was forced in, the beautiful smell of her body after a shower mixing with the delicious aroma of chocolate while I enjoyed the beautiful texture of her nipples with my tongue. I flicked, and she moaned, intensifying further as I gently sucked. </p><p>She pushed me back, and for a moment, I felt surprised, but then she grabbed the bottle and sprayed the chocolate over my chest. I just smiled, leaning back to enjoy the way her lips caressed the contours of my muscles, her body still carrying the marks of chocolate. </p><p>The covers were going to get ruined badly, not that I cared much about that. Why would I, when I had a delicious redhead to spoil while her forcibly-submissive girlfriend was watching from several hundred miles away…   </p>",

    "content": "<p>After my interesting discussion with Princess Aria, rest of my day was surprisingly routine. I spent the rest of my time using the minuscule amount of magic I had access to weaken my magical restrictions. It was a rather fruitless work, as despite working on it for the whole night, I wasn’t able to increase my access from two grains to three. </p><p>On the positive side, it turned out to be an excellent exercise for control, allowing me to make a marked improvement in my ability to handle magic. I smirked, imagining the expression on Lancelot’s face if he knew I was using his priceless artifact as a training machine. Pity I couldn’t reveal that particular detail. </p><p>It was almost noon the next day when the door of my cell opened once more, and Lancelot walked in, followed by Isolde and Emma. Aria was on the other side of the door, and made an attempt to enter, but Isolde stood in front of the door. Lancelot spoke. “We have talked about this, sweetheart. You can’t stay inside, you’re too fragile for this,” Lancelot explained, unaware just how patronizing he sounded. </p><p>“I should be there, I can heal him better if I see how he gets wounded,” Aria answered, showing a surprising amount of spine for her, but she still nodded in defeat when Lancelot rejected her offer. Baby steps, I decided. </p><p>When he turned to face me, Lancelot had a hard expression on his face, mixed with exasperation. This time, they started differently. He nodded at Isolde, and immediately, Isolde’s foot collided with my ribs. Rather painfully, I must add. “Come on, Byron. We both know that you’re going to talk eventually. Everyone breaks. I just don’t want to hurt you too bad before you do.” </p><p>“I know you won’t,” I answered with a bloody smile, well aware that Lancelot was not worried about my wellbeing, but his own self-perception of virtue. He wanted to be the good guy who didn’t rely on torture, but the more painful techniques they used, the less he could convince himself that what they were doing was just some ‘innocent’ enhanced interrogation. I decided to push them a bit. “Luckily, your sluts are too weak to properly hurt me,” I said. </p><p>My response was another kick, this time even more reckless, and I felt my ribs giving in. But Isolde smashed her foot once again without waiting for a response, hurting me even more. Through the pain and the red mist, I saw Isolde gearing up for yet another one, this time even more of her weight behind her. If connected, it had the risk of actually killing me, but Lancelot managed to hold her back. “Pathetic,” I murmured despite the pain. I added, They were truly amateurs, allowing their prisoner to anger them, enough to deliver a deadly wound. </p><p>Lancelot started berating Isolde while Emma watched with clear satisfaction in her eyes. And it wasn’t my pain she enjoyed, not when her eyes were locked on Lancelot as he berated Isolde. She clearly enjoyed the situation Isolde found herself in, aware that Isolde was yet another barrier in her desire to snag Lancelot for herself. </p><p>“I guess that’s it for today,” I said with a smug smile after watching them fighting for a couple of minutes. </p><p>“What are you talking about,” Lancelot answered, surprised. </p><p>“Well, I’m not fully confident on the count, but it feels like she broke about five of my ribs, and some of them are digging in whenever I breathe. If you continue, I’ll die, and you’ll never get the Eternal Core,” I said calmly. I could feel amused at the panic on their face. Here I was, chained, wounded, and magically-blocked, but still I had the control of the situation. Despite the pain, I enjoyed that fact. </p><p>Pride was a dangerous vice, but one I enjoyed nonetheless.  </p><p>“You’re lying,” Isolde said, but she was smart enough to understand that another kick wouldn’t solve her concerns. </p><p>“You guys really need to find a professional to help you,” I helpfully offered, smiling despite the pain, enjoying the way they had to listen to my words. No wonder Queen Sapphire was playing them like puppets for her own needs. </p><p>When they looked at me incredulously, I couldn’t help but another quip. “If you guys can’t find a professional, go to the library. I’m sure there’s a book called Torture for Idiots.” </p><p>They didn’t look like they appreciated my comment, though whether it was about calling them idiots, or the fact that I mentioned the T-word, I wasn’t sure. Lancelot looked at me confused, once again unable to fathom a presence that didn’t follow his idiotic lead… That was the problem with chosen ones, they were too used to solving their problems with their sword or their reputation. They were rather helpless when neither was an option. </p><p>He said nothing, but opened the door, revealing Aria who was sitting on a chair directly in front of the door. She took one look at me, and gasped in panic, her experienced eyes easily seeing the signs of danger, just another credit to her sheer ability. “What did you do?” she gasped at Lancelot but dashed forward, pushing him to the side. </p><p>“Just a bit of a miscalculation,” Lancelot said sheepishly, but Aria looked at him like he was an idiot after poking my chest a couple of times. Due to the interference from the chains, she didn’t use diagnostic charms, but broken ribs didn’t require magic to diagnose. </p><p>“Miscalculation!” Aria said. “He’ll die of internal bleeding in an hour if I don’t do anything. What were you trying to calculate.” She was furious. Her healer instincts and her distaste toward torture explained some of it, but not all of it. </p><p>It was clear that our earlier encounter had created a bond, which was not surprising. Even without my additional manipulations, imprisoning someone for a long time usually led to some unhealthy emotional attachment, something I had observed a lot in kidnapping victims. </p><p>“Is it that serious?” Lancelot asked. “Can’t you just heal him?” </p><p>“It would take just a second,” she answered, and Lancelot sighed in relief. “As soon as you remove the chains for a moment,” Aria added, and just like that, Lancelot’s smile was replaced with a grim expression. </p><p>“Out of the question,” he answered sharply, then his eyes brightened like a child who just solved a difficult math problem. “It’s his plan all along, he wants us to remove the chains, so that he can try to escape. I won’t allow it!” </p><p>“Then it’ll take me at least three days to cure him until he’s fit enough to handle more of your treatment,” Aria countered. I was the only one that realized that her blush wasn’t just due to her anger. </p><p>“Three days?” Lancelot said. “I’m sure you can do it quicker,” he said with a bright smile. </p><p>“M-maybe,” Aria suddenly stammered, this time, the reason for her blush was clear. Her crush on him was strong. I didn’t appreciate it. “I’ll try,” she quickly responded. </p><p>“That’s all I ask for,” Lancelot answered with a huge smile, but that part didn’t annoy me. Because that idiot didn’t know what he was doing leaving his fiancee alone with me. He turned to Isolde. “You’re going to stay here to protect her,” he ordered, his tone sharp, clearly unhappy with the delay he was facing. </p><p>Too unhappy, even. Combined with the emergency council meeting of the day before, it wasn’t hard to guess there was something pressuring them, though still not critical enough to resort to really dangerous tricks. </p><p>Lancelot and Emma left the room, though the latter smiled smugly at the two girls that stayed behind, and neither Isolde nor Aria appreciated Emma’s gloating. </p><p>Isolde was more expressive with her anger. She slammed the wall with her fist, uncaring of the pain. “Careful, honey, you’re going to make me homeless if you hit any harder,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” Isolde exclaimed, only to be stopped by a flare of magic. It was healing magic, and completely harmless, but the light show was enough to remind Isolde of her mistake. </p><p>“He’s wounded enough,” Aria said, but Isolde didn’t look like she was about to listen. “Do you want me to call Lancelot,” Aria added, and only then did Isolde pull back. </p><p>“He’s asking for it,” Isolde said. “I’ll kill him if he says anything else.” </p><p>“He’s goading you, and he’s winning,” Aria answered. “Go sit under a tree and skin a deer or something. I don’t want you here. Healing him is going to be difficult enough without worrying about you destroying all of my hard work for no reason.” </p><p>“I’m supposed to guard you,” Isolde murmured. </p><p>She pointed at my bound figure. “Yes, he’s clearly very dangerous when he’s bound, helpless, and wounded,” Aria said. Normally, I wouldn’t appreciate that statement, but I was interested in Aria’s efforts of making sure that we were alone. “I won’t tell anyone. As long as you stay out of sight, go do whatever you want.” </p><p>Isolde didn’t smile, but she lost her tenseness and nodded slightly, which was the closest she had come to showing appreciation. Then, she turned and left, leaving the door open. I couldn’t help but smile as Aria stood up to close the door. It seemed that the previous suggestions were slowly taking root inside her mind… </p><p>“Won’t you get a chair for yourself?” I asked, and she looked at me questioningly. “Unlike yesterday, you’re going to take a while to finish healing me, so crouching or kneeling isn’t an option if you still want to be able to walk when we finish,” I reminded her. “As much as I enjoyed the view of you hovering above me,” I added with a smirk. </p><p>“Good point,” she said, blushing furiously. </p><p>“Hey, as I said, you’re my favorite,” I answered, smiling back, but from her grimace, I guessed that my smile wasn’t as charming as her shy one in my wounded state. Still, she went out to get her chair, once again closing the door behind her. After she placed the chair, she pressed her hands to my body, and healing energies flooded in, trying to cure the worst of my wounds. </p><p>Like before, the magic-inhibiting chains were blocking her efforts significantly. However, with her full concentration on my wounds, I wasn’t able to redirect her energy to weaken my chains. I needed to distract her. </p><p>Still, I waited about half an hour to speak, enjoying her treatment silently, knowing that her focus wouldn’t slide away until I wasn’t under immediate risk of death. Luckily, even though it was just a sliver, my own magic was helpful in diagnosing my own condition. I didn’t want to die just because I had distracted my healer, after all. </p><p>“So, do you think Emma is working together with Isolde?” I suddenly asked.</p><p>“What do you mean, of course, we all work together,” she answered, confused. </p><p>I smiled at her, which looked decent now that the outward signs of my injury were cured. She was so naive, missing my implication. I decided to be more explicit. “Not that way, I’m talking about them working together to seduce your fiancee,” I added. </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered. “They wouldn’t do that, would they?” </p><p>“Well,” I murmured. “Considering this is the second time in a row that Isolde had injured me ‘accidentally’, forcing you to stay here, you should realize that she’s trying to keep you away.” </p><p>“She just has an explosive temper,” Aria answered, though doubtful. Then, after a brief consideration, she continued, more confident, and a touch condescending. “She doesn’t have the personality to plan something like that.”</p><p>“She might not, but what if Emma was whispering into her ear, suggesting that sharing Lancelot might be the better idea,” I suggested. “After all, Lancelot wouldn’t be the first high-ranking official with visible mistresses.” </p><p>“No, that’s impossible, as a prince-consort, he can’t have mistresses,” Aria answered panickedly. “It would be a big scandal, acceptable even for a hero,” she said, her jealousy clear.  </p><p>“Yes,” I answered, glad for the opening. “He won’t be able to have mistresses … if he becomes the prince-consort.” </p><p>Princess Aria took a deep breath, her beautiful blue eyes shining with the stirrings of fear. She was ensnared with the dangerous picture I had painted with my words. “He wouldn’t do that!” she repeated forcibly. </p><p>I just shrugged. “You know him better. If you claim that cooperation of a slutty but pretty mage and an exotic warrior wouldn’t be able to make him veer even when he was feeling depressed due to his failure to get the Eternal Core, who am I to argue. He just needs to be better than every other male. A simple thing for such a vaunted hero, a shining paragon of light.” </p><p>“He is!” she exclaimed loudly, increasing the flow of healing energy several times in the process. It was just what I needed. I easily diverted most of the excess energy to the chains, adding some new internal cracks to its conceptual ability to keep me powerless. Suddenly, instead of two grains, I had access to five grains. Five whole grains. </p><p>It was ridiculous. Me, Byron Mordred, the Dark lord that scared the whole world was celebrating because I finally had enough power to barely cast a light spell as bright as a weak candle for a second. Still, it was better than nothing. I kept my mouth shut as Aria was lost in thought, her magic flow out of control, instead directing it to weaken the chains further. My five grains had turned into ten, then twenty… When she finally stopped, I was able to control thirty-four grains of magic, enough to cast a very simple spell. A small miracle. </p><p>“Sorry about that!” Aria uttered in a panic. “Are you hurt?” </p><p>“No worries, it was actually soothing,” I answered. I was tempted to mess with her by claiming that I was hurt, but I didn’t want her to be more careful. Her distractions were my best bet to attain a relative freedom. </p><p>She sighed before pressing her hands to my body once more, a more controlled stream of energy filling my body. “It won’t happen again!” she resolutely stated. </p><p>“I don’t care about that. Why don’t you tell me what’s on your mind?” I answered. </p><p>“Nothing,” she answered, but I kept gazing at her, her determination melting easily under my pressure. “Maybe not nothing,” she admitted. “I trust Lancelot, but everybody says that man can’t be trusted. What if he strays?” </p><p>“Honey, if he does, he’s an idiot. You’re leagues better than that crimson tart, or that barbarian idiot,” I answered. Normally, she might have defended her friends, but with the earlier doubts I had introduced her, she just smiled. “However, as we talked about the last time, if you want to make sure, you need to take control of your beauty.” </p><p>“Will you really teach me?” she asked. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered. “You have been working hard for the last half an hour. Why don’t you take a break and show me what you remember from yesterday.” </p><p>It was a small miracle that her only reaction was a blush as she stood up and took a few steps, her body swaying seductively as she replicated what I had taught her the day before. I added a few suggestions to correct small mistakes and add flair to her turns. When she leaned forward, despite her corset her breasts started to force the abilities of her dress to contain them. Unfortunately, she didn’t have a convenient knot to mess with today. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “Now, why don’t you show me what you remember about kissing,” I said, and despite her blush, she put her hand against her lips, and delivered a delicious-looking kiss. It was beautiful, far more than what was necessary to keep a hold of an oblivious idiot like Lancelot. I frowned while trying to look like I was hiding my disappointment, visible enough for Aria to catch. </p><p>“Is there a problem?” she asked. </p><p>“N-no,” I stammered, before sighing in defeat against her display of panic. “Well, something doesn’t seem right, but it’s hard to comment from a distance. Maybe you should try that on me,” I said. </p><p>“W-what are you saying,” she stammered in shock. “I-I can’t … on the lips…” </p><p>As much as I enjoyed watching her melt in panic, I needed her on a functioning degree. “Well, I wouldn’t say no to a proper kiss, but I was talking about the back of my hand. You can kiss it, and I’ll get a better feel of your technique.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured. Her panicked misunderstanding was to my benefit, because it leveraged a simple psychological trick. Once someone rejected a big commitment, they could justify a smaller commitment much easier, especially if they were already inclined toward it in the first place like Aria clearly was. </p><p>Her blush was so thick as she crouched next to my right hand, I was worried that she was about to faint. She stopped for a moment to wash my hand, and at that point, I expected her to pull back due to last-minute jitters. But still, she resolutely pressed her lips and started kissing, her lips moving up and down slowly in an approximation of a tender kiss. </p><p>It was a nice attempt for an innocent kiss. She was relaxed —other than the obvious stress the situation created— but that was only because she didn’t know that I had access to my magic, however limited. I reached for my newly expanded usable mana reserves, and brushed softly against her tongue through her slightly open mouth, teasing her tongue, like a phantom tongue caressing gently against it. </p><p>She shivered under the unexpected sensation. I expected her to pull back, so when her lips started to move more, I was surprised. Her lips moved up and down, trailing my hand beautifully, enough to cause a stirring in my pants. I suppressed my boner through sheer willpower, not wanting to alarm her. </p><p>Yet. </p><p>When she pulled back almost two minutes later, she was flushed, and her breathing was out of control, making her chest heave sexily, making my earlier decision about containing my arousal even harder. “Excellent,” I said. “You’re as talented as you’re beautiful.” </p><p>“Thanks,” she said, but despite her excitement, she managed to maintain eye contact, her face flush with excitement. She was reacting quite a bit more impressive than I had been expecting. </p><p>I wonder whether I could push her for more, or should I let her cool down a bit before scaring her? </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was feeling exhausted as I drove my new —and temporary, required for today’s shooting— sports car out of the rental location, my fingers hurting from the number of signatures I had to leave. And the fact that I had to wake up early to help Katie sneak back to her room took its tool as well, especially when we used the opportunity to get a morning quickie which then turned out to be not that quick. </p><p>However, it was easy to ignore the said exhaustion. After all, I had just spent a very enjoyable morning with a sexy nerd who was showing a great aptitude for everything I had been showing her, and now, I was driving to meet with another sexy blonde, this time a naive midwestern beauty with amazing tits. Pleasure and anticipation were better than the thickest cup of coffee, especially with the excitement of driving a high-powered red convertible.  </p><p>It was a good time to be me. </p><p>Since we were stretched for the time a bit —I didn’t want to lose the perfect light— I sent a text to Penny, telling her to be outside in five minutes. When I arrived, I didn’t even have to pull the driveway, because she was waiting at the sidewalk, her face as bright as a child who just learned that they won a roller-coaster ride.</p><p>Penny won a ride as well, even though she didn’t know that yet. </p><p>“Amazing car,” she exclaimed in shock. </p><p>“Unfortunately, not mine,” I said as I shook my head at her excitement while she took the passenger seat. She examined the car, excited, and I used the opportunity to examine her. She was wearing a light sundress, a blue fluffy one that would fit perfectly for a day on the beach, which, considering today’s location, fit perfectly. It was short enough to display her toned legs to a great effect. The design of the dress was considerably more conservative around the chest area, but the dress wasn’t designed to hold back a great rack like Penny’s, so it strained enough to create a delicious cleavage that begged to be ogled. Its spaghetti straps left her shoulders bare, completing the ensemble.  </p><p>“It’s an amazing car, though,” Penny said even as she continued to examine it. “Did you borrow it from a friend or something?” </p><p>“No, it’s actually rented by the client, we’re going to use it as a prop for today’s shoot.”</p><p>“Excellent,” she gasped, not bothering to hide her excitement. </p><p>“So, you like fast cars?” I asked, and when she nodded, I pressed at the gas pedal, driving us toward the nearest highway with quite a bit more than the recommended speed. The real excitement started when we finally arrived at the highway. I pressed the gas pedal, pushing well above one hundred and fifty miles, earning a string of excited cries from Penny. Luckily, the roads were rather empty, allowing me to drive as fast as I could manage. </p><p>Pretty fast with the masterpiece I was driving.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, I pulled a beautiful cliff with a sea view, concealed from the road by several tall trees, creating a beautiful secret location, the perfect place to shoot a naughty underwear catalog with no team. I stopped only after driving the car dangerously close to the cliff, as required by the client requirements. “Fascinating,” Penny murmured, her breathing still fast after our exciting drive, whether she was talking about the beautiful view or the drive itself was a mystery that I was content to leave as a secret. </p><p>“Are you ready for your first proper modeling job,” I asked with a smirk even as I walked to the trunk, and pulled two bags, one for my photography equipment, the other for her modeling job. I did have a second bag still sitting in the corner of the trunk, but once again, that was for my personal collection, to be revealed when Penny was in the mood for later. </p><p>“I’m so excited,” she exclaimed as she dashed toward me, stumbling midway in her usual clumsiness before arriving at my side, and grabbed the bag I gave her. </p><p>“The bag is already sorted, so just change into the first one, and we can start,” I said, carefully watching her from the corner of my eye even as I set up my equipment. She pulled the first one, a rather wholesome white teddy and raised it, then she stilled in shock.</p><p>“Where should I change?” she asked in shock. </p><p>“You can change wherever you want, there’s no one else here,” I said casually, like it was no big deal for her to change next to me. </p><p>“But…” she murmured with a blush, her voice fading away immediately. </p><p>“Come on, honey. What’s a little nudity after the ending of yesterday’s session,” I added while doing my best to look like my focus was on the camera. Penny blushed prettily as she remembered the events of the day before, where I had fingered her into orgasm after a very revealing photoshoot. </p><p>I was prepared to continue pushing her, but when she murmured an answer and walked to the other side of the car, unable to argue. Even as I was doing my best to set up the lights and reflectors, I let my gaze shift toward Penny, who was struggling to change crouched behind the car, giving me the occasional glimpse of the smooth pale skin of her breasts. I was amused at her effort to hide her body, but let her succeed for the moment. It would make the eventual victory all more delicious. </p><p>“How do I look,” she murmured after she finished dressing and stepped toward me, her naked feet sinking into the white sands. </p><p>“Exquisite as always,” I murmured even as I dragged my eyes on her body, hidden behind a conservative teddy that struggled to keep her chest hidden, though her tits still managed to force its confines. I made a show of licking my lips, and she blushed. “If you’re ready, stand in front of the car, and give me a neutral pose,” I asked, curious just how much she remembered from yesterday’s session. </p><p>She immediately took the pose I recommended almost flawlessly, requiring only a few corrections before I took a batch of pictures. With the beautiful view of the sea behind her and trees to add a touch of life, it was an amazing sight. “Excellent, now put your hand on the door, and lean on the car,” I added, which started a medium length session where we walked around the car with a number of casual poses. </p><p>None of the poses we took could be classified as erotic, but I didn’t waste time with that, no matter how tempting. Penny was still an amateur, and I wanted to finish the items required by the job. She started well, but I didn’t know how she would react to exhaustion. Working under the natural light, we had about an hour to finish the job before the sunlight got too strong, ruining the photographs. We had two days to finish the job, and trying to rent the car for the third day would wreck the project budget, cutting my earnings seriously. </p><p>I could stay professional to ensure a better income, especially since finishing the sets didn’t mean that we needed to leave the beach immediately. I was sure that I could convince Penny for some quick exercise, maybe swimming, maybe something more interesting… </p><p>“Excellent,” I called. “Now, let’s do the red one,” I said, and Penny once again walked behind the car, struggling to change without giving another glimpse of her body, with rather limited success. We photographed the red teddy even quicker, showing that while Penny wasn’t an innovative natural like Nicole, she was still able to display her learnings rather efficiently, enough to make the day work really smoothly. </p><p>So much that, I started to hope that we could actually finish the whole work in just a day, resulting in a huge bonus. “You’re doing excellent,” I called in satisfaction. “We can finish everything today without losing the golden light if you hurry up,” I ordered her. “If we do so, I guarantee that I’ll try to arrange a meeting with a producer friend,” I said, making her smile widen even further. </p><p>With the promise of the reward dangling hypnotizingly in front of her eyes, she picked up speed. And, when it was the time to change into new clothes, this time a substantial set of green underwear with a bra thick enough to cover even her spectacular breasts, Penny didn’t bother to go behind the car, rather she changed in front of me, allowing my eyes to feast in her body. I wondered if she was overwhelmed with the excitement enough not to care about her nudity, or whether she was trying to make that introduction a certainty. </p><p>Considering the way she steadily blushed, my vote was on the second option, not that I was complaining. Even when she turned her side to minimize the impact and positioned her arm to hide her breasts, her curvy body was impossible to contain with such limited measures. </p><p>With her sudden enthusiasm, we managed to finish the rest of the clothes less than two hours, leaving her collapse exhausted on the driver’s seat. “Amazing work,” I said as I took the passenger seat, no less exhausted, and squeezed her thigh to congratulate her. I let my hand linger there, which she steadfastly ignored, allowing my fingers to rest on her beautiful thighs as she enjoyed the comfort. </p><p>I was planning to spruce the session with a selection of my own, but that plan changed when I forced the whole shooting to finish in one day, which left both of us too exhausted to use professional posing as a flirting technique. </p><p>I decided to cut the chase. “Would you like to change into something interesting,” I said. She quirked her eyebrow, and I continued. “I have a few sets from a previous shoot. Trying them might be more interesting,” I said. </p><p>“Really,” she said. “Where is it?” </p><p>“It’s on the trunk, let me get it,” I said, but she waved her hand. </p><p>“No, I can get it,” she said as she opened the trunk, and disappeared behind the raised hood. Almost immediately, she looked from the side, smirking and blushing at the same time. “Why didn’t I think that, we had a screen for dressing all the time.” </p><p>“Well, it wasn’t like I had a problem with it,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured even as she leaned down, hustling reaching my ears. “Which one I should wear?” </p><p>“Surprise me.” </p><p>And surprise me, she did. I couldn’t see her hidden behind the hood, but when she hung the underwear she had been wearing just moments ago to the edge of the hood, I started to feel excited imagining her naked body on the other side of it, impatient to see her. </p><p>But it didn’t work as quickly as I had hoped. Instead of stepping to a place where I could see her, she hung another piece on the hood, this time a sexy a green piece from the second bag, one of the more conservative ones, but not the most modest one either. For a moment, I felt disappointed, thinking that even a relatively conservative one pushed her limits, but as she continued to hung clothes on the edge of the hood, each more revealing than the last, I realized that she was pushing in an opposite direction, a detail I enjoyed immensely.</p><p>“How’s this one?” she asked as she leaned from the side, just giving a glimpse of her upper torso. I couldn’t help but whistle at the result, as the push-up effect had elevated her already impressive bosom to the level of a goddess, making my pants uncomfortably tight. </p><p>“You look spectacular in it, though I’m not sure about the excessive assistance it provides upstairs,” I said smugly. “Your tits are spectacular enough without cheating with a corset.” </p><p>“So rude,” she answered, but her playful giggle contrasted her words. A couple of tries later, she stepped out once again, this time wearing a frilly white set that would fit perfectly to a blushing bride, an impression she gave perfectly with her trembling smile. “This one?” </p><p>“Delicious enough to tempt me to push you on the car, and take you hard until you started to moan my name,” I answered, coming too strong at my excitement. </p><p>With a blush, she escaped behind the hood once more. She disappeared for a minute, making me worry that my statement was a bit too much, but then, I received a small clue that indicated an issue in a completely different direction. A soft moan reached my ears, one that required me to strain myself to hear, making my insides tingle. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one feeling aroused by our little game.  </p><p>It took a couple of minutes for her to step in with new underwear, this time black and lacy, barely enough to contain her perky breasts, though the panties weren’t succeeding any better to contain her bountiful ass. This time, she displayed her whole body, but only for a total of three seconds, before her will shattered and she ran back to her concealed spot, not even asking any questions about my impression. “You look even more beautiful in black, it brings your inner naughtiness,” I called, only to receive a mumbled thanks. </p><p>I didn’t mind her shy response, not when I could hear her soft moans as she played with herself behind the hood, aroused to perfection. Her reaction didn’t surprise me. A high-powered sports car, a lengthy lingerie photoshoot followed by an even sexier private show, all while the memory of my aggressive treatment from yesterday still bright in her mind… She was far too innocent to ever have a hope of resisting it. </p><p>Still, I could feel a bit reticent when she stayed there for several minutes, tempting me to cut our little game short. But then, she threw the black set she had been wearing during her last show on the edge as well, making me shuffle with anticipation. </p><p>“Are you ready?” she asked, still hidden. Her voice was excited, but not without an edge of nervousness that she failed to hide. </p><p>“I could never be completely ready for your beauty, but waiting is even bigger torture, so go ahead,” I asked. </p><p>“Really?” she murmured, and I could hear the shy blush on her tone. This time, rather than stepping out, she slowly pushed the hood down. First, revealing her beautiful face framed by her shining blonde hair. The expression on her face alone, mischievous yet shy, was enough to harden my arousal rock-hard. Then, she lowered more, and her elegant shoulders came into sight, broken by the thin black lines of her new underwear. I wondered which once she picked out of the remaining black options, including a shelf bra, not that I expected her to wear that one. </p><p>When she stalled, I doubted that I could have prevented myself from begging if it wasn’t for the amazing morning I had, giving me the power to resist. Even then, it was hard to resist her shy smile and trembling hands. She was excited enough to do that, but shy enough to have trouble with it, which made everything much better. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as she continued to lower the hood, slowly bringing the curves of her bosom onto the view, unobstructed by any fabric as she moved it lower and lower. Another surprise was awaiting me as the hood passed the middle of her chest, only for her naked nipples to came into the view, unobstructed by any pesky fabric. </p><p>She did wear that shelf bra, much to my surprise, leaving her tits bare for my viewing pleasure. I grunted in arousal, and she smiled enticingly.  </p><p>She crouched a bit after that, hiding her beautiful chest from the view, showing her intention of extending the show, but wearing that shelf bra was more than I could tolerate. I stood up without a warning, and walked to her, entertained by the sudden widening of her blue eyes. “Stephen,” she gasped as I stood next to her, my eyes widening even further as I realized that she wasn’t wearing any panties, her slit glistening invitingly. I slammed the hood close and pushed her on the car, her beautiful nakedness shining under the bright rays of early afternoon, her legs parted invitingly. </p><p>Playtime was over… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I walked around for ten minutes before I returned to the trailer, because I had to wait for my annoying boner to disappear. I felt a bit of guilt, but more importantly, I felt confused at the sudden reveal, my mind already churning about how to handle her. </p><p>When I thought her as a nerdy ugly duckling, everything was pretty clear. Just to have bare minimum interaction with her, enough to make sure she didn’t leave the trip earlier, using my painting as an excuse as needed. And technically, nothing had to change, as I just needed to scrub the sight of her body —her voluptuous but surprisingly tight body— while maintaining the original idea. </p><p>However, my body seemed to be determined not to let me forget, which was an inconvenience. </p><p>With a sigh, I returned to the RV, with a soft smile on my face. Anna was already sitting on the bed, wearing loose sweatpants and an even looser t-shirt. With her large glasses covering her face completing the ensemble, it was so easy to be convinced that she was just another nerdy unpopular girl that would never enter my selective radar, even when I was just a horny teenager. Even then, I was tall and muscular enough to impress any cheerleader, especially in my impressive painting skills that convinced girls that a sensitive soul lay underneath all that muscles —which was bogus of course, but I never bothered to convince the girls otherwise after the one time I did convince the girl that I was a mess that only she could fix, making her cater my every whim for six whole months, even after I explicitly said that I was going to continue having sex with other girls. </p><p>Apparently, girls loved bad boys with damaged souls —if that soul was housed in a tall, muscular body with a chiseled face. </p><p>Consequently, I didn’t exactly know how to act toward the girl that was sitting on the couch that was converted into a bed, her e-book reader in hand. And like that was not complicated enough, I still needed the rent money from the travel, and acting impulsively might result in the travel being cut short. </p><p>“Any preference for dinner?” I decided to ask when she looked at me with her blue eyes concealed by her thick glasses. I was still struggling to decide how to act toward her, and cooking was a great distraction. </p><p>“Do we have any frozen meals, or are we limited to cans?” she asked. </p><p>“Really?” I asked even as I reached to my small fridge and pulled some peppers, chicken, and spices from the drawers. “You prefer to have canned food rather than fresh chicken?” </p><p>“You can cook?” she asked, her shock palpable. </p><p>“Don’t be that surprised about it,” I said, amused by her reaction. I decided to mess with her a bit. “I might not be as smart as you, but I can still use things other than barbells and painting brushes.” </p><p>The way she jumped up to her feet, waving her arms desperately was too amusing. “No, no, no! I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that. Of course, you can-” she continued panickedly, words spilling out of her mouth like a torrent until I cut her off.  </p><p>“Relax, I was joking,” I said, smiling widely to convey the feeling, though feeling curious just how long she would have floundered if I let her speak. </p><p>“Sorry,” she murmured as she avoided my gaze, blushing furiously. I should have laughed once again, but instead, my mind decided to supply me with an interesting question, whether her blush spread below her neck, toward the interesting areas covered by her loose t-shirt. It was lucky she was avoiding my gaze, because it took a while for me to ignore the sudden magnetic pull of her chest. </p><p>“Hey, don’t feel sorry,” I managed to say after several seconds, but just to be safe, I turned on the stove, then pulled a knife from the rack, and started to dice the peppers, the distinctive crack of the knife over wood filling the room. </p><p>“Wow, you’re really fast,” she gasped as she walked closer. “Aren’t you afraid of cutting yourself?”</p><p>I shrugged. “Not really. It’s all about the technique. As long as you know how to hold your knife and how to place your fingers, it’s actually safer than the other way.” She nodded. “Have you ever had an accident in the kitchen?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she answered, but curiously, she sounded unhappy about it. I sent a gaze at her. “With my classes, homework, and debate club, I don’t spend much time in the kitchen.” </p><p>“That’s a pity,” I answered. “Cooking not only calms you down, but also it’s the only way of having decent food without paying a fortune. It’s an invaluable skill for your college life,” I said. “Not to mention, the less you spend on food, the more you can spend on partying.” </p><p>“Not really a burning need for me,” she answered, then added with a whisper, one no doubt I wasn’t supposed to hear. “Not like anyone would invite me to a party.”</p><p>I had to struggle not to laugh. All she needed was to replace her glasses with contacts and change her horrible clothing into something tighter —though getting rid of them altogether would have worked even better. I was tempted to tell her that as well, but I lacked a method. I could have claimed that she was beautiful in her own way, which was the same as calling her ugly, or I could tell that she had a rocking body, which required me to admit that I had seen her half-naked. In the end, I settled for a distraction. “I can teach you how to cook?”</p><p>“Really?” she said, excited, though she immediately continued in a more subdued tone. “I don’t want to be a bother. I’m already giving you enough trouble by invading your personal space.” </p><p>“It’s better for me to learn. If you learn how to cook, I can dump my chores to you,” I said, once again making sure to smile wide to convey I was joking. </p><p>She smiled back. It was a gentle, friendly smile that flickered on the edges, like she wasn’t sure if that was the right thing to do. “In that case, teach me, master,” she said.</p><p>“The first skill you need to master is how to hold a knife,” I started immediately, because I didn’t like the way my heart raged at her last word, and needed a distraction. I was about to summarize quickly before showing the most basic hold, but her rapt attention continued steadily as I showed alternative grips and techniques, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>Of course, when we moved on the practicals, I realized teaching her that wasn’t the smartest way of distracting myself from her physical attributes. “Not like that,” I said immediately as I realized her little finger of her guiding hand was loose, risking a cut. I grabbed the wrist of her knife-holding hand, preventing a nasty cut. </p><p>With my fingers tight around her wrist, I could feel her pulse, suddenly picking up speed at my touch. “You need to start slow, and be mindful about where you put your hand,” I said even as I guided her hand over the peppers with a smooth move. “Focus on your form first, and speed will come later.” </p><p>Following my command, she started chopping the peppers in a more even manner, but I didn’t pull my hand away for a while, forcing a lingering touch for a long while, more than what was appropriate. She said nothing, but just blushed. </p><p>“Good work,” I said, even as I reluctantly loosened my grip around her wrist, no matter how much I wanted to wrap my arms around her waist, enjoying the smooth body hidden under her baggy clothing. “Continue with the peppers while I prepare the rest,” I said before getting another knife —not my preferred chef’s blade, which was currently occupied— and started dicing the chicken and bathing them under a liberal application of spices. </p><p>The rest of the preparation and cooking passed in relative silence, and she watched my every move with the rapt attention that made her an excellent student. </p><p>“It’s delicious,” she moaned as she took a bite. “I can’t believe I helped to cook something as delicious as this.” </p><p>“It’s all about the balance of the spices,” I answered. “I like that particular mixture of acidic and bitter, especially after they are seared with the liberal application of butter. Not the healthiest material for cooking, but definitely the most delicious,” I explained even as I took another bite, followed by a sip from my apple juice. Normally, I would have preferred to have wine or beer with it, but currently, I didn’t have any, mostly because I was afraid that Anna’s family checking the fridge to see if there was anything inappropriate there before letting Anna come with me, therefore ruining my finances. </p><p>Now, however, I cursed, because I didn’t have anything to dim the image of Anna in my mind, glowing sexily, her tits spilling from her arms. </p><p>“Interesting,” she said. “I didn’t know spices could make such a big difference. My mother doesn’t use anything other than salt and pepper.” </p><p>“What a big waste,” I said sincerely. As an artist, I liked to enjoy life, and it included food. “Don’t worry, I’m going to teach you everything to know about the spices,” I assured, and she giggled. The rest of the dinner passed without anything notable, discounting the determination of my gaze, tracing her body whenever I was distracted, forcing me to remember how she looked without the ugly cover of her t-shirt. </p><p>“Let me do the dishes,” she said just as I was about to stand up with my plate in hand. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked, but even as I did so, I left the plate on the small fold-able table that we used for dinner. Unlike cooking, I never liked washing the dishes, and I was more than happy to dump that task to her until her goodwill evaporated. She nodded, and I smiled. “Excellent, then you don’t mind if I go out for a quick walk?” </p><p>“Of course not. This is the least I can do for you,” she said, and after a nod, I left the RV, appreciating the opportunity to calm myself. With the result of my accidental peek still fresh in my mind, I was having trouble staying in the close quarters without hitting on her. </p><p>I walked for twenty minutes, though I made sure to stay close enough to see the RV at all times. There was no guarantee that we were alone here, and I didn’t want to take the risk. But the walk hadn’t exhausted me as much as I hoped, so, I decided to exercise some more. I didn’t have my weights with me, but I didn’t need it either. I walked closer to the RV, looking for a branch strong enough to assist my pull-ups, and once I did so, I removed my shirt and started a short, yet exhausting, set of exercises that alternated between push-ups, squats, pull-ups, and various other body-weight exercises, trying to work up a sweat. </p><p>I was focused on my workout, so only toward the middle of my exercise, I realized Anna was at the window, concealed behind a curtain, watching me. She was concealed well, with only the corner of her glass peeking to give me her location. Somebody was being a naughty girl, I realized with a smirk. </p><p>It was time for some payback. I didn’t want to be the only one distracted by our proximity. </p><p>So, without making anything that would signal she had been caught, I started a new set of exercises, this time, choosing the visual impact over the actual benefit. I flexed my muscles, leaned forward, and made sure that she caught a long glimpse of my abs. It was an act of innocent revenge, after all, and unlike me, she was pretty intent in continuing to observe me. </p><p>However, my amused reflection was distracted by a moan, one that still reached into my ear despite RV’s soundproofing. I was lucky that I was facing the other way at that moment, because I had no chance of hiding my expression of utter shock. Her peeking from a concealed position had been surprising enough, but playing herself as she watched was more than I had given her credit for. </p><p>Amusingly, I could feel myself blush at the thought. Luckily, it was impossible to notice with my exhaustion and sweat, especially the dim light of the sunset, the sky darkening more with each passing second. </p><p>I continued exercising, feeling that it was a pity that she had stopped watching me, but when I turned my back to look, I could still see the corner of her glass. More importantly, her glasses were shaking, presumably with the rest of her body. </p><p>“Cheeky little slut,” I murmured in amusement as I lay for another set of push up, shocked by her daring, continuing to play with herself even after she had lost control and moaned loud enough to be heard from outside —though she likely assumed that I hadn’t heard her moan, or missed its significance. As if her arousing cry could be mistaken for anything else. </p><p>I exercised for another half an hour, straining myself well above my usual limits, partially to impress her, partially feeling curious to see when she would stop. </p><p>To my shock, she stayed in her position, her body shaking slightly for the whole period. I grabbed my shirt and started walking toward RV slowly, more about my exhaustion than giving her a chance to gather herself. </p><p>When I stepped inside the RV, she was in her bed, the covers were pulled almost to her chin, and she was looking at her book. I used looking rather than reading, because she was obviously trying to look at me without being noticeable. Her disheveled state was clear, and the subtle sweet smell that filled the RV despite one open window. </p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth when she raised her eyes, however, only to meet with my naked and sweaty torso from a much closer vantage point than she had been enjoying for the last hour. “You don’t mind, do you?” I asked. “I don’t want to ruin my shirt if it’s okay with you,” I said. </p><p>“No, no, nooooo… Not a problem at all,” she spat out rapidly as her blush intensified even further. If I hadn’t heard her, I would never have suspected her from peeking on me as I exercised, especially not while she played with herself. That raised a new set of difficult images in my mind, but at least I could take comfort from the fact that I wasn’t the only one that would feel those. </p><p>“Excellent, I would have hated to make you uncomfortable,” I said even as I turned my best smile at her. A dark, crooked one that suggested a sleepless night that was filled with cries, grunts, and naked desire… </p><p>She blushed even further. “No, I have no problem with it,” she answered, quicker than the question merited like she was trying to convince me, or herself. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I moved toward the shower. “I don’t like to wear shirts unless necessary, so seeing you okay with it is a huge relaxation.” </p><p>“No shirts?” she stammered as she raised her head, and I recognized the glint in her eyes as excitement, clear even with her ugly glasses. </p><p>“Well, not unless you have a problem with it,” I said ruefully. “Maybe I should wear them just in case. I feel like I put you on the spot, and you’re feeling forced to agree.” </p><p>“No!” she exclaimed as she raised herself, unaware that her blanket slid down revealing her chest. She was still dressed in the same ugly t-shirt, but with a great difference. Her bra was obviously absent. Obviously, because her hour-long masturbation session had left her quite sweaty, enough to turn her t-shirt slightly transparent. Her erect nipples were pressing against the fabric determinedly as well. </p><p>“No?” I repeated, amused. </p><p>She blushed further as she pulled her blanket once more. “I mean I’m being sincere. It’s not a problem for me for you to walk around naked.” She took a deep breath and mumbled. “It’s not exactly a chore.” </p><p>“Excellent, I hate shirts,” I said as I grabbed a towel and stepped into the shower. Just before closing the door, I gazed at her added one last thing. “By the way, I sleep naked, so be careful if you need something in the mornings,” I added. She blushed deep, but I smirked. “Thankfully, we can separate my bed from yours, so I don’t need to change that habit,” I said even as I pointed at the thin curtain that was supposed to create an impenetrable barrier. </p><p>I was planning to laugh at her in the confines of the shower, but once again, she managed to ruin that plan, because a sudden expression of arousal passed through her face, one that intensified the blood flow around my waist immediately, my boner immediately turning rock hard. The expression was replaced by a shy one immediately, but once again, the memory of it was seared in my brain. </p><p>Maybe teasing her like that wasn’t the smartest choice… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Cornelia’s helpless moan, begging me to fuck her, put a prideful smirk on my face. I couldn’t help but feel proud, considering less than a week ago, I was skittering like a rat around her, fearing her attention. Now, she was lying in front of me, wet and naked, begging for my cock even after I assured that she would still receive the help she needed even if she chose otherwise. </p><p>I could have just slid inside her, of course, invited by the way her hips rose deliciously, giving me access to her entrance, but that would have been a relief she didn’t deserve yet, especially with Helga in the mix. I needed to stretch a bit more, so once the situation was revealed to Helga, I could spin it off as an act of preliminary revenge I took on her behalf. </p><p>With that in mind, I waved my hand, and Cornelia’s bag of goodies flew toward me. Another flick, and ribbons flew out and wrapped around her wrists, forcing her spread-eagle. She twisted her neck in an effort to glare at me, but the blindfold that wrapped over her eyes prevented her from doing so. “What are you-” she started, only to receive a spank to her ass. </p><p>“Don’t speak without prompting,” I ordered to her, my tone sharp and unyielding. The moan that escaped her lips, as a result, was positively delicious. She was getting wetter after she was completely immobilized, proving once and for all that she didn’t just have a dominance but also a submission fetish. </p><p>A fetish that I was going to use for my benefit in the future. However, for now, I had a much more important task than planning for the future. Her entrance was glistening beautifully, waiting for my presence. </p><p>I pushed forward mercilessly, enough to make her cry in pain despite her wetness, the unfamiliar presence stretching her untouched walls. But that cry was followed by a string of moans, showing her enjoyment of pain. </p><p>[+1500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 2%]</p><p>I started hammering her mercilessly, the sound of colliding flesh filling the room. She tried to clench her legs, but the ribbons around her limbs prevented her from moving, keeping her in place. She gasped and moaned, intensifying whenever I slapped her ass to further enhance her desires. </p><p>“Do you like it?” I asked even as I slapped her ass once more, turning it into a glowing mess, but she just moaned further. </p><p>“Yes, sir!” she shouted in response. “You’re filling me completely. I never felt anything like this before.”</p><p>“That’s what you get for denying your true nature, firecracker,” I said even as I changed my pace, impaling her even harder, but instead of spanking her, caressing her ass. “You tried to overreach by trying to dominate others, trying to rail against your fate of being stuck at your level, not knowing that you needed to accept your true nature before you can break the barriers.” </p><p>“I understand-” she started only to be silenced as a sudden wave of pleasure hit her, silencing her much better than any other method. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 7%]</p><p>I didn’t stop, of course. Tonight wasn’t about teaching her the tender meaning of pleasure. No, tonight, she was going to be used until she turned into a helpless blob, unable to move in her own power. However, as much as I wanted to put my full attention on ramming her repeatedly, I had more important things to focus on, namely, measuring the effect of the Companion process on my Tantric capabilities. </p><p>With that in mind, I put my finger on her mouth, and she sucked greedily, too far gone to even notice the generous dash of mana I had slipped inside her. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>This time, the connection was much stronger, giving me a perfect view of her soul space, confirming my guess that it was the companion system that was allowing the smooth interaction. Pity, as otherwise, it would have been a really broken ability. With a sigh, I focused on examining her power, examining her soul space. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was the sensation of the area itself. Both Helga’s and Titania’s power felt, for the lack of a better term, more flexible, while Cornelia’s was stretched out to the capacity, preventing it from growing further. Though it had a scary implication. Titania was yet to hit her level cap. Just how strong was her potential! </p><p>“Fuck me harder, sir,” Cornelia cried, pulling me back to the present. </p><p>“What did I tell you about speaking without being asked first, slut?” I said, my tone harsher. I was about to slap her ass as a warning once more, when my eyes caught something more interesting. A small biomancy spell later, I forced my finger into her asshole without warning, making her cry in pain. “That’s what you deserve, slut,” I called even as I added a second finger, intensifying her moans. </p><p>“Yes, sir. I’m a worthless slut, and that’s what I deserve,” she moaned. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 13%]</p><p>She once again spoke without permission, but seeing the great jump in the companion acquisition process, I decided to let it slide, once again focusing on her powers. It wasn’t a surprise to see her mental stats much higher than the physical ones, though her physical ones were still decent, probably averaging around five. Not bad for a dedicated mage. In her mental stats, however, her charisma and manipulation were really high, understandable considering her explosive power and ability to shape her flames. </p><p>The surprising part is her skills. I was only able to detect three skills, Arcana which was either advanced or expert level, something related to mana I failed to pin down, and flame magic. Flame magic, however, dominated all others, probably reaching the Grandmaster level. </p><p>Suddenly, I understood the reason for Cornelia’s reputation. She probably received Grandmaster Flame skill quite early in her career, allowing her to build a reputation early on. However, I doubted that she expected herself to stop at level fifteen, because Grandmaster skills had one big drawback. They consumed five skill slots to fully mature, meaning, after taking it, the next four levels offered no new skills, each raising skill cap by ten until it reached a hundred and fifty maximum in its maturity. </p><p>In my personal opinion, it was a bit of waste. Yes, it allowed casting extraordinary spells, but with the cost of extreme specialization. </p><p>I didn’t spend much time over Cornelia’s misguided skill selection, but continued to examine the edges of her soul space, trying to get a better feel of the reason for her unable to gain more experience, but ultimately, I failed to understand it, though from Cornelia’s intensifying moans, it easy to see her enjoyment. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 19%]</p><p>In the end, I decided to stop my examination for the moment, waiting for the completion of the first tier of the Companion process. Whether she would get an achievement, and the changes in the process, would give me important information. Not that I needed the excuse to continue fucking her body, mind, and soul. </p><p>When she tightened around me yet another time, I decided to mix things up a bit. I pulled out of her, and she opened her mouth to say something, only to replace it with a gasp when she felt the familiar presence of my shaft pressing against her puckered hole. </p><p>I impaled her without a warning, making her cry in pain, taking her anal virginity in the process as well. She belonged to me, after all. My little noble fucktoy. </p><p>“Tell me what you feel, slut,” I said, once again using a spank as punctuation. </p><p>“I feel dirty, sir,” she moaned in reply. “I feel used, I feel worthless, and I feel like I’m just a little toy. I have never felt this good in my life!” </p><p>“Good,” I said in amusement as I pushed even deeper into her bowels, enjoying her untouched tightness. “And tell me what are you going to do to make it continue?” </p><p>“Whatever you want, sir,” she moaned. I decided to reward her with a unique gift. A flicker of mana was enough to make the ribbons disappear, and she collapsed on the bed. I wrapped my arms to her waist and pulled her on my lap, her back pressing against my chest, her eyes still blindfolded. </p><p>I lifted her and took a few steps, until we were standing in front of her huge mirror. Her legs were parted open, creating a perfect view of my shaft repeatedly disappearing in her asshole. </p><p>“Do you want to see your own slutty face?” I whispered into her ear. She didn’t say anything, but I decided to take her sudden tightening around my shaft as a positive response, and pulled down her blindfold. </p><p>“Oh my god!” she cried in shock as she saw her own slack-jawed face, broken with pleasure, which proved to be the last thing she needed to trigger yet another orgasm. With her almost-virgin asshole clenching around my shaft, I exploded as well, filling her bowels with my seed, not to mention a lot of mana, enough to make her pass out with pleasure. </p><p>[-500 Mana]</p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25%]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25% - First Stage Completed +5000 Exp]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Master Elemental, Expert Subterfuge, Expert Tantric] </p><p>Once again I selected Tantric before I quickly followed the stream of mana I deployed, analyzing her soul space. Thanks to my increased closeness, the view was even clearer, but it wasn’t the only change. I could see a familiar sliver of energy floating in her soul space, trying to merge with her stats, but no matter how many times it smashed against, it failed to merge. </p><p>It was the achievement she just received, or more accurately, supposed to receive, I decided, and decided to help. Luckily, I had deployed enough mana to overwhelm her capacity, so I wrapped it around her stats, softening the surrounding space —for lack of a better term— to allow the new achievement to merge. </p><p>[+3 Tantric]</p><p>However, as the minutes ticked, I realized that I might have bitten a bit more than I could chew. No matter how much I played with her stats, I failed to merge the achievement with her. </p><p>I had no intention of surrendering. I caught her lips in a searing kiss, dumping as much mana as I could manage, feeling glad about my mana regeneration perk. It would have been a waste if I hadn’t had my full mana here. </p><p>[-750 Mana]</p><p>[+6 Tantric]</p><p>With the addition of my new mana, I started my battle anew. I pressed and squeezed mentally and physically, forcing the borders of her soul space to soften. And suddenly, it started drinking my mana. I let it do that, because I realized that the more mana it drank, the softer it became. When it drank over a thousand points of mana, it finally softened enough for the achievement to slid inside its place. </p><p>[+8 Tantric]</p><p>[Achievement: Enforced Error. Create a forced glitch in the system while using only your own abilities, achieving a first since the Calamity. +2 to All Stats +10000 Experience]</p><p>I stumbled back to the bed, with Cornelia still on my lap, murmuring softly. I wanted to laugh and relax, as I had achieved the impossible. Even better, I achieved the impossible while filling the backdoor of one of the most eligible young nobles in the school, and once again received a spectacular reward in return. </p><p>However, once again, the description of the achievement threw me off. The reference for something called the Calamity was intriguing enough, but my attention was grabbed by the part that mentioned that forcing a glitch by my own power, achieving a first. </p><p>It implied that there were others capable of forcing a glitch, even if they were forced to use some external support. </p><p>That wasn’t good, I thought even as I pulled Cornelia tighter against my body, cuddling her even as my thoughts run wild with the possibilities. I hated the feeling. I finally hit Level 20, an achievement that was supposed to ensure a safe and comfortable life for me, but instead, I was desperately trying to deduce whether I had an enemy behind the scenes, pointing a dagger behind. </p><p>I would have liked to believe that it had nothing to do with me, but a sinking feeling in my heart was telling me that it wasn’t the truth. </p><p>“Perfect, just what I needed. More challenge,” I murmured even as I lazily squeezed Cornelia’s breasts, treating them like toys, exquisite ones, but toys nonetheless. It might have sounded ridiculous to someone else, but I had the full intention to take my sixth sense seriously. </p><p>I was tempted to lean down and fuck Cornelia mercilessly after waking her up with a slap, but a soft touch with my Tantric ability showed that her soul space was, in a sense, strained. I decided to refrain from fucking her before she got used to the new presence. I continued to lay next to her, my mind on the possible implications of the latest reveal while I also lazily observed the changes in her soul space, which gave me several interesting insights about it. The next time, it was going to be even smoother. </p><p>Cornelia’s eyes flickered open an hour later, an astonished expression on her face. “Im-impossible,” she stammered as she looked across the room unfocused, like she was reading a sentence that didn’t exist. “I received an achievement!” </p><p>“Keep it down,” I ordered her, but unlike the other times, my tone was soft. I understood her elation more than anyone else, and I didn’t begrudge for enjoying it. I just didn’t want her to shout it. Intellectually, I acknowledged that there wasn’t a risk, but I was still feeling skittish. “This is the evidence that I can help you increase your power,” I said, and she nodded enthusiastically. “You’re smart enough to realize that you shouldn’t reveal it under any circumstances.” This earned another enthusiastic nod, and she leaned forward to kiss me. </p><p>I allowed her lips to connect, enjoying being the receiving end of her tender touch. I was still going to dominate her mercilessly the next time, but for now, I was happy to share that flicker of intimacy. But when she tried to climb on my lap, I stopped her. She looked at me, her expression between shocked and wounded. </p><p>“What I had to use to give you that achievement has some impact you can’t feel, but you need to rest to avoid side effects,” I said. I had no doubt how the increase of the companion core would affect the process, and I had no intention of actually testing it. “I want you to take a sick leave tomorrow and stay on the bed, doing absolutely nothing. I’m going to visit you in the evening after that, maybe even with a guest. Be prepared to serve two.” </p><p>“Understood, sir,” she moaned as she shivered, making me wonder whether it was my kindness or the following orders that triggered her enjoyment. </p><p>“Now, sleep,” I said, even as I put my hand on her body, using Biomancy to cure some of the worst damages, but leaving enough to be visible. </p><p>Then, I leaned forward just like I was about to give her a midnight kiss, but instead, I bit her shoulder hard, enough to leave a mark, which I made permanent with a unique application of Biomancy. “Just to remind you who owns you.” I whispered throatily, and from the way she pressed her legs together, it seemed that she enjoyed the idea immensely. </p><p>I quickly dressed, and when I left, exhaustion once again had conquered her, leaving her unconscious. I left the room, my mind on my next steps. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 20    Experience: 203100 / 210000 </p><p>Strength: 24    Charisma: 34</p><p>Precision: 17    Perception: 21</p><p>Agility: 21     Manipulation: 26</p><p>Speed: 19       Intelligence: 26</p><p>Endurance: 18      Wisdom: 28</p><p>HP: 1980 / 1980\tMana: 920 / 2700        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Expert Tantric [67/75]</p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p>",

    "content": "<p>Waking up shouldn’t be a surprise, but considering my last memory was the rage of the elements surrounding me while lightning rained on me with rage, trying to flail my skin, all the while my insides burned with an unnatural heat, I was rather surprised. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was that I was in a bed, with two familiar presences with me, one on the left, one on the right, making me feel rather cozy. </p><p>The second thing I noticed was the sound of the storm that was raging outside, a torrent of rain beating against the ceiling. It wasn’t an ordinary rain but a dangerous storm, accompanied by dangerous winds that made me glad that I wasn’t outside. However, that came with its own complication, namely the fact that I was inside a building. Not exactly comforting despite the protection it granted, considering the number of dangerous people that were after us. </p><p>I forced my eyes open despite my exhaustion, curious about my location. Astrid was lying on my right, while Lillian was on my left, both girls in their underwear as they hugged me, deep in sleep. I wasn’t exactly expecting that level of familiarity from them, not that I was unhappy about it. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the room, trying to understand where I was, but markedly more relaxed, as the presence of the girls next to me indicated that I wasn’t in a situation that was immediately dangerous. It was a modest-sized room, with equally modest but functional furnishing. A bed that was far too small for three people —not that I was complaining—, a small table with a couple of chairs that looked more uncomfortable than the floor itself. Impressively, it also had a door that opened into a small bathroom, which made the room quite luxurious. </p><p>I could have awakened Astrid and ask her questions about the place, but I had something much more important to focus on, something I delayed only to make sure I wasn’t under an immediate threat. I closed my eyes, but rather than trying to sleep, I focused on the flow of my magic… </p><p>Only to find a completely unfamiliar landscape. The magic that was flowing in my body was completely foreign, reminding me of the lightning that rained over me rather than the calm flow of pure mana, but from the way it reacted to my control immediately, there was no doubt that it was mine. The fact that my magic was once again under control was amazing news, enough to take the sting of the fact that it once again transformed completely. The Dragon Heart was gone, shattered and absorbed into my body, and transforming me completely in the process. </p><p>Still, everything paled against the fact that once again I had total control over my own magic. Even its surprising lightning-like transformation didn’t make me doubt it. Why would I doubt it, when it once again flowed in my veins comfortably, ready to jolt out at the slightest flexing of my will? </p><p>I still wanted to experiment, not because I wanted to make sure I had the control, but I wanted to test the limits of my new reserves and the potency of my casting. And getting some experience wouldn’t hurt. I was a sorcerer, on that there was no doubt, but I knew for a fact I had at least one other sorcerer’s eternal enmity, and with the possibility of even more. That captain had surprisingly wide clout for a pirate captain. Who could guarantee that he didn’t have another sorcerer ally? </p><p>I lay on the bed for a couple of minutes, letting my magic circulate in my body, exhaustion flowing away, replaced by a crackling sense of energy, my muscles feeling stronger than ever; another thing to test, probably right after the magic experiments. I had never heard a sorcerer ascension improving the caster’s physique, though considering everything I knew never amounted anything more than scraps, it might be my lack of knowledge as well… </p><p>I was tempted to talk to Lillian about my transformation, but I knew that Lillian already wanted me to return to Londinium with her, revealing that I had strength enough to stand on the apex of the whole Island wouldn’t exactly help. </p><p>To be fair, if it wasn’t for the mysterious enemy, I might have actually considered it. With my recent boost, my uncle was not a threat anymore. But having a fixed place while being hunted by unknown enemies, after stealing a Dragon Heart from them, was hardly conducive for survival. </p><p>I tried to extract myself from the bed, which was rather difficult, considering I was wrapped tight by two pairs of arms, not allowing my movement. Trying to wiggle out failed rather spectacularly when they tightened their arms further, and a repeat of it made Astrid open her eyes. </p><p>“You’re awake,” she gasped in excitement as her arms wrapped tighter around my chest while her lips smashed against mine. </p><p>I knew for a fact that in the grand scheme of things, magical experimentation with my new powers while an unknown amount of enemies were following us was much more important than enjoying the kiss from a sexy redhead wearing only underwear, rubbing her sexy body against mine, but that particular fact felt oddly theoretical when I felt her hardened nipples pressing against my naked chest while her tongue invaded my mouth recklessly… </p><p>I let my hands explore her curved body, my raging arousal blanketing my mind, about to rip her underwear off, when Astrid let out a pained yelp and pulled back. Surprisingly, it was Lillian that was responsible, Astrid’s hair wrapped around her hand. My mouth stayed open, as I was surprised by Lillian’s uncharacteristic action. Not the meanness of it, but the fact that she actually took physical action. </p><p>I was even more surprised when she smashed her lips against mine in a desperate kiss, hugging me desperately. Far too desperate to be something sexual. Even more interestingly, Astrid, rather than retaliating, chose to hug us both, while tears spilled from Lillian’s face. “Idiot,” Lillian murmured as she pulled away from the kiss. “How can you be stupid enough to trigger an ascension ritual in the middle of nowhere with no preparation. I thought you were going to die for sure!” </p><p>It was good that she started another kiss immediately after her words, because I didn’t know how to react. I understood what she was referring to by ascension ritual, since I wasn’t an idiot, but her words implied that it was a common thing, just the way I progressed was unexpected. It made me revise my initial idea about not talking to her about it. My lack of information was much more dangerous than I had presumed. </p><p>As the kiss stretched, I noticed something even more interesting. I could feel some of my magic slipping out of my lips to mix with Lillian’s only to return moments later, calmer and more controlled. I let the kiss stretch even as I expanded my magical senses, only to feel slivers of my magic swimming in both Lillian and Astrid. </p><p>Curious, but not alarming, as I could feel that whatever it was, it couldn’t be used for binding. I was sure, because I studied a lot about binding magic after I learned about the death of my grandfather, afraid of my uncle decided to use it as a shortcut to eliminate me despite the taboo of using them on close kin. </p><p>We needed to talk about what happened since the elements around me decided to go crazy, but then I felt the covers being pulled away, and a pair of lips around my erect shaft, once again convincing me to delay the questioning in favor of more immediate needs. </p><p>Astrid’s ambitious move managed to get Lillian’s attention. She pulled away from the kiss and watched Astrid for several seconds. I couldn’t see her expression from that angle, but her body was stiff, making me curious —and more than a little apprehensive— about how she would react next. </p><p>I didn’t expect her to face me once again with her face burning with arousal while she ripped off her bra desperately. She leaned in for another kiss, but this time, it was a desperate one that conveyed vulnerability. No, it was one that burned with a carnal need, even thicker than the bath we shared in the cave. </p><p>The sudden development surprised me, but not to a point that I couldn’t react. My hands joined the fray immediately, tracing along her spine before it reached the small of her back, caressing softly. She moaned softly without even interrupting the kiss, and I used the opportunity to slide my tongue inside her mouth, invading mercilessly. </p><p>Her moans intensified further as my fingers found her perky breasts, enjoying their firmness mercilessly, enough to hurt her a bit, but from the way her tongue moved, it seemed that she was enjoying it. Normally, I would have stretched the foreplay until she lost herself into arousal, but it was hard to maintain control while Astrid’s lips were around my shaft, moving up and down aggressively enough that whenever she lowered herself, I felt her throat closing around the crown of my shaft. </p><p>I pulled away from the kiss even as I pushed Lillian back, but my lips were already around her nipples before she could react, forcing her to moan in arousal rather than trying to respond to the sudden change of mood, but her reaction was nothing compared to when my fingers found her knob, a gentle circling enough to make her shiver in anticipation. “Touch me harder,” she moaned. </p><p>“I’ll do something even better, but you need to help Astrid push deeper,” I said even as I grabbed her hips and lifted her, easily pulling her on my face and flipping. She didn’t feel any heavier than a feather, showing the extent of my strength boost, unexpected but very welcome. </p><p>“Of course,” Lillian moaned as I brushed my tongue against her entrance, enjoying the taste of her arousal. Then, she leaned and once again grabbed Astrid’s hair, and I felt my shaft fully engulfed in Astrid’s warm mouth, her throat tightened around most of my length.</p><p>Astrid gagged and moaned, her desperate attempts to take a breath increasing my enjoyment even further, but Lillian kept her in place. Her juices were flowing even faster, showing her enjoyment of the situation. My tongue quickened further, exploring her entrance for sensitive spots while she continued her attempts to make Astrid suffocate.</p><p>She must be enjoying it even more than she had been displaying, because it barely took two minutes for her to shiver uncontrollably as the orgasm hit. Even more surprising was my own eruption, coming out unexpectedly, filling Astrid’s mouth, and when she pulled back to avoid being drowned in, covering her face and tits. From the amount I exploded, I could guess that I was unconscious for a long while. At least three or four days… </p><p>The more interesting thing was the sudden sense of connection I felt with Astrid on a magical level, something I had never experienced before. Like the earlier kiss, my lightning-natured mana slipped out with my cum, only to end up covering Astrid, increasing the sense of connection between us. I wondered whether it was about the transformation itself, or something that happened afterward… </p><p>I could have just asked the girls, but when my shaft jumped back in life immediately, I decided that I had more important things to focus on. Especially when that erection was accompanied by an animalistic sense of possession toward the girls that were doing their best to teach me the meaning of true pleasure. It was similar to the urges I got when I was battling against the Dragon Heart, but with one great difference. At that time, I was sure that if I yielded to those emotions, I would have lost a part of me. </p><p>This time, it was just something to fulfill me further, a natural part of my transformation. </p><p>I decided to trust my own sixth sense, and stood up and grabbed Astrid, only to throw her on top of Lillian, who was still trying to breathe after her explosive orgasm. Astrid looked like she was about to argue, but when she turned, she saw me standing behind her, my shaft already aligned against her entrance, so she did the smart thing and braced herself. </p><p>I couldn’t help but moan in satisfaction as I slowly pushed in Astrid, enjoying the way her virgin hole tighten around my shaft while her back arched beautifully. I enjoyed Lillian’s jealous expression peeking through Astrid’s red hair almost as much as I pushed even deeper, destroying Astrid’s barrier. </p><p>It was clear that whatever happened after my loss of consciousness had pushed them closer, but not enough to prevent Lillian from feeling jealous, especially since due to her noble identity, she needed to protect her virginity. Respecting that decision was markedly easier when I had a sexy redhead wrapped around my shaft, moaning as I slowly explored her untouched regions. </p><p>Lillian tried to wiggle out of her position but her action was in vain. “Do it somewhere else,” she complained, but I just smirked. “I need to-” she tried to continue, but I decided to cut her in a rather innovative way. I pushed Astrid’s head down, connecting them in a kiss. The fact that Astrid’s lips were still covered with my cum made the situation even better. </p><p>“Be a good girl and help Astrid clean up,” I said even as I continued impaling the redheaded beauty, who was getting more used to my invading presence. I could see outrage dancing in the depths of her blue eyes, but Astrid didn’t share her concerns if her enthusiastic moan was any indicator. </p><p>No matter how much she wanted to deny, Lillian was no less aroused than Astrid, and the taste of my cum managed to break through her reluctance. She closed her eyes in surrender as her lips joined the fray, their tongues battling in abandon. I rammed inside Astrid even harder, partly to ignore the temptation to push inside Lillian to enjoy the beautiful sandwich they created even more. </p><p>Lillian seemed determined to make that decision even harder, because when she pulled away from the kiss, I was expecting another round of complaints from her. Instead, she continued kissing Astrid’s neck and face aggressively, following my earlier order to clean her up with remarkable gusto. I wondered if it was the taste, or the fact that my seed was weirdly magical. Nonetheless, seeing the proper and impeccable noble heiress devouring the breasts of a barbarian priestess just to get a taste was a spectacular view. </p><p>With Lillian busy with her breasts, Astrid’s lips were free for the moment. “Harder!” she moaned, using the opportunity to ask for better treatment, something I was more than willing to give. The sound of flesh hitting flesh exploded in the room as I pushed deep inside her mercilessly, as hard as she could manage. When I started spanking her ass, her moans intensified even further. </p><p>Then, Astrid cried even louder. The reason showed itself when her torso rose a bit, showing bite marks around her nipple, hard enough to leave a mark that would last for days. Lillian just smirked at satisfaction. “You’re too loud,” she said even as she grabbed Astrid’s hair, pulling her into a kiss once more, which also had the added benefit of pinning Astrid in place, allowing me to really cut loose. </p><p>Time lost its meaning as the three of us fell into a hypnotic rhythm, ending only when I exploded once more, filling Astrid’s insides with my seed, which, once again, accompanied by a flow of magic. This time, however, the sensation even more intimate. With our direct connection, I could feel my magic connecting with hers, and —for the lack of a better term— illuminating it brightly, like it was forcing transformation… I could feel our magical presence mingle, creating a lingering connection with me at the dominant position. </p><p>I decided to push for an explanation, but that decision was once again delayed when Lillian wiggled from underneath Astrid, only to move behind her and start licking her nether lips, enjoying the treat I had just left there. Looking at Lillian’s lithe body, aroused face, and wet entrance, I decided to delay questioning for a while… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I lay on the cold stone floor, every single bone in my body aching in pain, the only emotion I felt was elation. </p><p>How could I feel anything else when I finally feel my magic after a month of imprisonment. Yes, it was a sliver smaller than I could use when I was five years old, barely enough to light a candle, but I didn’t care. I finally had leverage. </p><p>Magic-blocking was a very complicated piece of magic, especially the robust ones like the chains around my limbs. I doubted that there was more than a dozen artifact that could block magic long term without constant supervision, most schemes required maintenance from at least three mages simultaneously, and even then, they weren’t perfect. </p><p>But that ignorant pathfinder gave me the opportunity to put a crack on them, and I finally had the leverage, one I could use to destroy the chains, probably in less than a day. But the question of what was next held my hand. I was in the middle of the capital, and even if I managed to escape, I would be still in the center of their territory, with no hopes of escaping. And if by some miracle I managed to escape back to dark lands, an assassin's dagger —or more likely, many of them— awaited me. </p><p>I needed to be patient and find an opportunity, and if I could manage, some allies. </p><p>The gods must have decided to have pity on me, because it was that exact moment the door opened, and Princess Aria stepped inside before closing the door. </p><p>Alone. </p><p>I was curious about her sudden appearance, so I decided to keep my eyes closed. “Sweet gods of light,” she exclaimed in shock as she dashed forward me, her hands already glowing with pure healing magic. She pressed her hands on my body and warmth flooded in my body, destroying the majority of the pain I was feeling. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my inhibitor chains, she would have cured me in less than a second —none of my wounds are magical, which made healing efforts much easier, especially to one of the strongest healer in the land like her— but the inhibitors devoured her magic gluttonously, preventing her from effectively curing me. With the mana she was spending, she could have pulled a regiment from the edge of death.</p><p>There was an impressive number of tricks I could have used on her if I had more of my magic, but unfortunately, the sliver I had wouldn’t push through her resistance. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I couldn’t mess with her with the tricks I had access to. She was still distracted with her healing efforts, and the wild flow of her magic was blanketing the room, so it was easy to cast a spell without detection. </p><p>Deciding on my target was almost trivial. She had probably come right after —or during— the meeting, because she was still wearing her long and conservative dress, covering her body to the limit of what was fashionable, once again showing her lack of confidence. However, her tailors had put a rather complicated knot on the center of the dress, making her avoidance of a cleavage a fashion choice. </p><p>A knot that was easily undone with a simple magical pull. </p><p>It took even less magic than I had expected, as the knot was already tightened to the limit with the pressure from her breasts, strained further as she bent down to press her hands on my body. Without the knot to hold on, the neckline of her dress dipped quite a bit lower, gifting me with the most beautiful thing I had seen since my capture, tempting me to raise my hands and dig into their beautiful expanse. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was impossible, so instead, I continued my task of loosening the strings that held her top together. Without the knot, it was even easier, though it was a bit ridiculous to see myself acting like a teenager who just discovered his magic rather than the dark lord I was. Admittedly, considering I was locked with chains too short to actually allow me to masturbate while enduring daily visits from several sexy —and dangerous, which only added to their sexiness in my view— women, my actions should be excusable. </p><p>Still distracted, she barely noticed as I continued to get a better view of her cleavage until it was deep enough to reveal her corset. My eyes widened further upon the sight, as her already large breasts were looking wondrous at the point they contacted with the hard edge of her white corset, spilling out temptingly, making me wish that I could just lick them. </p><p>It was a pity that before I could start working on the corset, the magic flow slowed. Since I was yet to recover from most of my wounds, it was probably just a pause. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to exile her exhaustion, but her deep breaths created an even more spectacular view of her chests. I kept my eyes closed, only peeking through a slight crack, acting like I was asleep, not wanting to get caught looking. I didn’t want to spook her. </p><p>She took several breaths before her eyes opened, realizing that her chest was feeling colder than it was supposed to feel. The gasp that left her mouth was spectacularly beautiful, as beautiful as the cute panic that danced in her eyes as she turned her back immediately, her fingers dancing on her top to cover her chest. I used the opportunity to twist my legs enough to conceal my erection, hard enough to imitate steel. </p><p>It took a couple of minutes for her to recover from her panic and turn back, carefully examining me to see whether or not I was sleeping. Luckily, acting unconscious or sleeping was a trick I was competent at. Previously, it saved me from several assassination attempts, and now, it allowed me to feast my eyes with the beautiful sight of Aria’s cleavage without any cost. </p><p>She was still reticent as she crouched next to me, softly touching at my shoulder to make sure I was still unconscious. I didn’t react. She tried to use magic to make sure, but luckily, the interference from the chains was too much for her to get a clear reading, so even with my sliver of magic, it was easy to manipulate her reading. “Thank the light,” she murmured as she let out a big sigh, which strained her haphazardly-tied top once more, enough that one of the critical strings that held it together was fraying. I decided to take a mad risk and let out a flicker of magic, and it snapped. </p><p>“Again,” she murmured in the complaint as her cleavage appeared once again, but this time, she didn’t turn back in panic, not after she had just made sure I was sleeping. She still blushed, of course, her attention fully on the strings. This time, a raging boner wasn’t my only challenge. I was also struggling not to laugh, because an issue that would take a simple mending spell had stumped her. Probably because she was a princess, she had never learned household spells. </p><p>At that point, I had resigned the fact that she would just turn and leave, though a night of pain was worth the amazing sight I had experienced. So, I was rather surprised when she leaned down with an exasperated expression —her blush everpresent— and started another session of healing. She was banking on the fact that I was still asleep. </p><p>A kind person would have let her finish healing and leave. But while I was rather kind, it was only by the standards of my occupation. The mark the previous dark lords had left wasn’t hard to surpass in that area. </p><p>I acted just as she was about to finish her second session of healing. “Wow, I must be dead, because there’s no way I could enjoy such a beautiful sight otherwise,” I murmured. The cry she let out echoed in the room as she jumped up to her feet, her hands trying to cover her chest —with limited success, with her big breasts and small hands, a comprehensive one was impossible. </p><p>“You’re awake!” she exclaimed as she staggered back to the wall, her eyes widened in shock. Which, even for a shy girl like her, was an overreaction. It wasn’t like I saw her naked, the most I got was a glimpse of her beautiful pink areolas when she had leaned excessively in a moment of distraction. </p><p>“Yes, I am,” I answered, as casual as I could manage. “And thanks for healing me. That bitch hits really hard.” </p><p>“N-no problem,” she stammered, even under the circumstances, unable to skip the pleasantries completely. “You s-saw?” she stammered. </p><p>“Come on, princess, it was just a bit of cleavage,” I answered casually. “And considering I’m still seeing blurry, it doesn’t even count.” </p><p>“You’re seeing blurry?” she asked immediately as she took a step forward, her healer instincts able to suppress her panic for a moment as she dashed forward. She put one hand on my head while the other tried to keep her cleavage contained, and once again I felt the rush of healing energies filling my body, even thicker than the previous times. </p><p>It was a mistake on her part, because unlike the last time, she was fully aware of her cleavage, and continued tugging it, trying to avoid my gaze. It was a mistake, because it meant that she wasn’t really focusing on the flow of her magic. Even with my limited power, guiding a portion of that healing rush toward the crack on my chains was trivial. Healing magic wasn’t exactly destructive, so its impact was minimal, but minimal was a very different thing than nothing. When she pulled back once again, exhausted even more, my access to my powers almost doubled. Of course, it meant that I had two grains of sand instead of one, but still, it was an improvement. </p><p>“Thanks, now I can see much better,” I said as she pulled back. “Would you mind giving me another glimpse?” </p><p>“You pervert,” she gasped in exclaim as she once again pulled back, her hands on her cleavage. </p><p>I smiled at her, though I doubted it was exactly comforting with dried blood and dirt on my face. “Come on, it’s literally nothing, how are you going to handle your wedding night if you’re reacting a little glimpse like that,” I said, and she blushed even further. </p><p>“T-that’s none of your bu-business,” she stammered. “Stop messing with me.” </p><p>I shrugged. “You’re right, it’s not my business, but I’m not messing with you.”</p><p>“You’re not?” she asked, unable to keep herself from answering, which was a horrible mistake under almost all circumstances. No matter what, she was one of my interrogators, and unlike the others, she didn’t have the slightest idea about how to handle that —not that the others were masters on it. She was already shy, and letting me dictate the discussion was a dangerous mistake. </p><p>She was lucky that between my jailers, I liked her the best, as otherwise, I could have easily ruined her life. I still intended to mess with her, of course, but nothing even close to what I had in mind for others, especially her mother. “Of course not, you’re the only one that actually cares for me in this hellhole,” I said, sad and vulnerable. Artificial, of course, but her expression softened, showing she swallowed it immediately. Unbelievable, I thought. It was a miracle that she managed to survive politically if she was gullible enough to believe that I would be weakened enough to act vulnerable just because I was imprisoned for a month. </p><p>I was a fucking Dark Lord, a detail that she somehow managed to forget!</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she murmured, her arms helplessly on the side, her head lowered, the sudden sadness overwhelming enough to make her forget the state of her dress. “I don’t think the treatment you’re receiving is fair, but the Empire really needs the Eternal Core.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I have my pride, sweetie,” I answered, neglecting to mention that the leverage was the only thing that was protecting me from her mother, who was the scariest opponent in the Empire now that I was captured. “But enough about that. I was serious about your shyness and its impact on your upcoming marriage,” I explained, and she blushed once more. “Do you really think that the girl that was always around him would leave your marriage alone if they see the slightest opportunity?” </p><p>“N-no, Emma is just childhood friend,” she answered rapidly, waving her hands. Of course, her panicked movements jiggled her breasts deliciously, making my mouth water. </p><p>“If you say so,” I said, but when she nodded, I continued with a smirk. “However, you were rather quick deducing that I was walking about Emma.” She stammered a messy response that was supposed to be negative, but lacking conviction. “It’s not your fault that you’re feeling jealous,” I said.</p><p>Her eyes turned toward me, hopeful. “It’s not?” </p><p>“Of course not, she definitely knows what she is doing hanging around. And believe me, she is opportunistic enough to swoop in at the slightest opportunity.” </p><p>“Lancelot would never do something like that!” she shouted suddenly, more to convince herself than me. </p><p>“If you’re absolutely sure,” I said with a shrug, conveying my lack of conviction. </p><p>“I am,” she said as she pointedly turned her back and started trying to fix her top. Her fingers weren’t used to it in the first place, but the discussion about the inevitable affair of her fiancee rattled her enough that her fingers were trembling, making her snap the laces that were supposed to hold her top together. When she turned to face me once more, her eyes were shining with unshed tears, though the delicious view of her cleavage was more important. </p><p>“I’ll help you,” I said. </p><p>“I won’t open your chains,” she answered immediately, her sadness replaced by panic. She was clearly warned repeatedly about the probability. </p><p>“You don’t need to, just listen to my directions,” I said. Grab the first string, and pull just a bit…” I started, and she followed my orders, assuming that it was better than walking out of my cell with a ruined top. Not entirely illogical. I was tempted to ruin her top even more, but that would ruin the point of the earlier discussion. I needed her to trust me. </p><p>“Thanks,” she smiled brightly as she managed to recover her top after ten minutes of careful knotting. </p><p>“No problem, it’s rare for me to have such a pleasant break,” I said. “So, is there anything else I can help you with, like teaching you how to seduce your fiancee?” </p><p>She blushed so hard that I feared that she would faint. “No, no, no, no…” she murmured, stringing a long line of the word, each repeat of the word weakening her own conviction. </p><p>“Of course, if you have someone else that could answer your questions about a male perspective, be my guest,” I said. Her silence was enough to answer. “Think of it this way. You can ask me anything, and I’ll answer to the best of my ability. You don’t need to feel self-conscious, as even if I were to tell anyone, no one would believe me.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured, trying to make a decision. The silence stretched for a minute. “Will you really help me?”</p><p>“Yes,” I answered simply. “As I said before, I actually like you.” I smiled softly, suppressing my desire to smirk. “But I recommend keeping the tricks you learned until the wedding, as by shocking him, you can ensure his loyalty.” I had no intention of letting that asshole Lancelot actually benefit from my teachings, after all. </p><p>“O-okay, let’s try it,” she said. </p><p>“The first thing is how you stand suggestively. Turn your foot a bit, lean forward…” I started, explaining to her several techniques to be more aggressive in getting male attention. She didn’t need any help with that, of course, but it was a good way to generate trust. She followed my directions for the next five minutes, until I uttered a very distracting statement. “Now, it’s time for kissing practice.” </p><p>“WHAT!” she shouted, shocked. </p><p>“Relax, you will use the back of your hand,” I said with a chuckle, making her relax. She blushed but nodded, raising the back of her hand to her lips, delivering a soft, lingering kiss on the back of her hand, which was strangely erotic, making me glad that my prison clothes were rather loose. “Was it your first kiss?” I asked. </p><p>“Is it that obvious,” she said, exhausted. </p><p>“Hey, don’t worry, practice makes it perfect, though I can advise you much better if you kiss the back of my hand instead.” </p><p>A deep blush covered her face and neck, no doubt also covering her body but unfortunately, her cleavage was hidden behind her dress. She froze, making me hopeful that she would actually follow the recommendation, which had several interesting possibilities. </p><p>But my luck decided to throw a curveball, because the door suddenly opened and Isolde walked in. “You’re finished with healing him, good,” she said as she grabbed Aria’s arm. “We need to go, they are calling for another meeting,” she added, and pulled Aria away before she could answer, leaving me alone. </p><p>I chuckled as I called my magic and started working on expanding the breach on the magic-inhibiting chains. It was a show, mindnumbing work, but much better than counting bricks once again. </p><p>But a part of my mind was focused on the most important question. What should be my next action?</p>",

    "content": "<p>I left my room three hours later, leaving Helga behind, sleeping. For three hours, we leveraged my mana regeneration to extract the most utility while enjoying our intimate embrace. Helga gained almost five hundred experience points in the process while I spent over five thousand mana points, almost completing her companion progress for the third stage as well. It was not the most efficient way of farming experience for her, but it was the most enjoyable way. </p><p>The fact that it was repeatable and free of danger was just another bonus. </p><p>I made sure to cover the room with a thick layer of defense before I left, including an impressive number of life-energy traps in case of a necromancer intrusion. It wasn’t supposed to be likely, but after the last two encounters with them, I decided to play it safer. Helga was too important for me to risk. Her skillset was vital, and she knew a lot of my secrets. </p><p>If I was less wise, I might even convince myself otherwise, but with great wisdom came an annoying level of self-awareness, forcing me to admit to myself that I didn’t want any harm to come to Helga, because she was important to me emotionally. She was mine; mind, body, and soul, and I was willing to go to very scary lengths to keep it that way. </p><p>A very dangerous thing considering my skill set. For anyone that was stupid enough to target her, of course. </p><p>I focused on more immediate concerns as I neared Cornelia’s room, this time not even bothering to disguise myself as a servant but using arcana to hide. I didn’t want to reveal my disguise trick in case Cornelia was watching. I was two hours late, not that I cared much. I made my position in her life very clear, which also implied that she was the one that needed to be on time then wait obediently for my arrival. I knew that she was smart enough to realize that. </p><p>The question was whether she could control her pride in the application of it. The answer laid behind the door I was standing against, so, after a brief stop to make sure there was no trap, I unlocked the magical lock and stepped inside, and passed the foyer in smooth steps before I arrived in Cornelia’s living room. </p><p>I was glad to see she was there, waiting for me, and I was even more glad to see her wearing a maid costume. Or more accurately, a naughty approximation of a maid costume, one that fit her perfectly, revealing a lot of skin while managing to keep what was the important secret. “Where-” she started the moment she saw me, her face contorted by anger, only to be interrupted by a spell. </p><p>My spell, to be exact. The moment she started speaking, I conjured a ball gag in her mouth, preventing her from speaking. “Careful, firecracker. I almost thought that you were going to lash out at me, but I must be wrong,” I said even as I dispelled the ball gag, but she stayed shocked. Understandable, considering the difficulty of being able to conjure anything in another magician’s personal space, even if that mage was distracted like Cornelia. I doubted that I would have been able to before my recent level-ups and stat increases. </p><p>Cornelia might be a collection of anger and pride, but she was smart enough to realize she was truly outmatched. “I’m sorry sir, I forgot myself,” she murmured as her eyes fell to the floor demurely. Since she was such a good sport, I decided to ignore the way her fist tightened. </p><p>“You’re catching on, it’s good,” I said, then added in a stage whisper. “A bit slow, though.” </p><p>The way her chin clenched was almost as satisfying as the way her dress revealed most of her naughty body for my viewing pleasure. “Thank you, sir,” she managed to say, even keeping her tone relatively even, impressing me with her control. I would have never expected her to resist such a casual insult. “Is there anything I can help you with?” </p><p>The question reminded me that I was yet to take a bath after two very long carnal sessions, limiting myself to cleaning spells. “Draw me a bath, firecracker, I’m feeling exhausted,” I said, enjoying the way her eyes brightened in anger whenever I used her new nickname. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she still managed to say through her squeezed teeth, making me smile in amusement. She turned to talk away into the bathroom, but before she could take a step, I was next to her, and slapped her ass hard enough for it to ring in the room. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>She stiffened, but still walked away without trying to turn back, her steps stiff. I watched her walk away, sad that she was walking away without swaying her hips, wasting the potential of her short skirt. She was thoughtful enough to leave a glass of wine already filled for me, and I sipped it, but only after I checked it for poison, just in case she had a nasty surprise. </p><p>She stepped out five minutes later, her face redder, and her clothes slightly more transparent thanks to the humidity, giving me a beautiful show. “The bath is ready, sir,” she said.</p><p>“Thanks, firecracker,” I answered as I walked in, only to stop and turn after a few steps in. “What are you waiting for there, come in,” I ordered.</p><p>“In-inside,” she stammered, but when she received a stiff glare, she obeyed immediately. Still, when she arrived next to me, she received another spank to her barely-covered bottom. It wasn’t painful, but humiliating. I had no doubt that she would have preferred to be chained to the wall and whipped rather than playing the servant. </p><p>Which was the whole point of the deal. Even without the Tantric, I was sure that I could help her, but I needed her ready to follow orders before I did so. I said nothing, just raised my arms and turned my back to her, no doubt tempting her to stab me in the back. Instead, she removed my clothes in a surprisingly gentle manner. I was expecting her to at least slip and accidentally scratch me or something like that. </p><p>She failed to hide her blush as she pulled down my boxers, revealing my shaft. And considering she was providing an amazing view of her cleavage as she did so, she met with the full mast version, though I had to admit that the only reason it was still alive was because of my biomancy skill. Even with my endurance, exhausting both Titania and Helga on the same day had been a challenging affair. </p><p>“Are you ready for your bath, sir,” she murmured, doing her best to suppress her blush as she tried not to gaze at my erection, which was a difficult affair for her. </p><p>“I am, firecracker, but are you?” I asked. She looked at me with mild panic. I gave the explanation she didn’t ask for. “You’re going to properly wash me, of course,” I said, then turned my back, ignoring the sudden mana build up behind me, recognizing the bluff. The mana build-up was too obvious to actually be an attack. The frustrated growl she let out confirmed it. </p><p>I set myself in the water, but in a way I faced Cornelia, enjoying the impromptu strip show she was about to provide. She reached for the straps of her dress, hard enough to rip it off. I was tempted to ask her to dance, but after consideration, I decided not to, mostly because I wanted to see her natural reaction. </p><p>She undressed rapidly, but didn’t bother to hide her body, giving me a glimpse of her beauty before she wrapped a small towel around herself. Smart, but only tactically, I decided. She realized that acting shy would have made it more fun for me, and acted to remove that. Tactically a sound move, but strategically horrible, because it forced me to act in a way to satisfy my need for entertainment. </p><p>[+200 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>I said nothing as she crouched next to me, using a small cup to rinse the parts of my body out of the water, followed by soap. Despite her gentle touch, I could sense her anger from the way her fingers stiffened at each touch. However, considering the way she had been acting when she had the power, it didn’t arouse any sympathy from me. </p><p>She was reaping what she sowed. </p><p>I pulled out of the water, and sat on the corner of the large tub —or more accurately, a small pool— once again giving her full access to my naked body. I grunted in appreciation as she slowly soaped and rinsed my back, her touch soft and gentle. </p><p>I opened my eyes when she started working on my legs, because her towel was straining to contain her body as she acted. I wanted to enjoy the full show. When she started on my torso, however, she was struggling to keep her blush down once again, her tiny towel not enough to hide the signs of arousal. I didn’t know whether it was my muscles or the fact that I was forcing her to serve me, but I was happy with the result either way. </p><p>She even washed my erect shaft without a complaint, though I suspected the sudden lingering touches were not from her obedience, but her desire instead. My senses were sharp enough to smell her arousal after our extended contact. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>It was the reason I changed my mind about asking for a blowjob. I was planning to until she started showing signs of actually anticipating it. “Towel,” I called as I stood up, enjoying the momentary flash of shock that passed across her face, soon replaced by a dull disappointment. Damn, educating her was going to be even more fun than I had expected. </p><p>She was quick when she dried me off, and even better, she followed me obediently as I walked back to her living room first, then directly to her bedroom. “It’s time for a massage,” I said, and she quickly reached for a drawer, pulling out several oil bottles. She was truly prepared. </p><p>However, I stopped her when she was about to pour some oil on her hand. “It’s not me who’s going to receive the massage, but you,” I said. </p><p>“M-me,” she stammered, my statement once again managing to break her bubble of calm. This time, she was angry. “Couldn’t you find a better excuse to fuck me?” she said scathingly, her frustration from denial and her frustration from being ordered around finally bubbling out. Of course, when she realized the potential harm of her statement, she blanched. </p><p>I ignored her reaction as I walked closer, and when I was just a step away, I pulled off her towel violently, leaving her naked. She didn’t even bother to hide her body. “Do you think I need an excuse to take you however I wish, bitch,” I said, my tone not playful. </p><p>“N-no, sir,” she stammered. </p><p>“Good that you still have a sliver of common sense,” I said scathingly, though my anger was completely artificial, once again tapping into my Subterfuge skill. “The massage is a part of the treatment I promised, but since you know much better than me, maybe I should just follow your lead,” I continued, threatening her with the thing she wanted the most. </p><p>“No, sir,” she gasped in shock, her panic completely genuine. I was planning to make her sweat a bit more when she surprised me by kneeling in front of me, like an obedient slave trying to earn the favor of her master. “I’m sorry, sir. You’re my only hope. Please forgive my impudence.” </p><p>“You’re lucky that I have a soft heart, firecracker,” I said, my tone once again soft. She raised her head, her eyes shining with hope. It seemed that she was even more fragile from her lack of leveling than I had been expecting, which was suspicious. “Tell me what happened,” I said in a sudden bout of inspiration. </p><p>“I have received a message from my uncle, setting up a challenge between me and my cousin, or more accurately, his champion,” she said. “My only chance is for you to be my champion, but even then, it’ll be for survival only. They’ll know that I’m not strong enough to challenge my uncle, and it’ll be game over,” she said. </p><p>It was definitely an inconvenient development. I was hoping for more time. “It’s bad, but at least you’ll be alive,” I said, confident of defeating whatever champion her family could put in front of me, though not appreciating the necessity of revealing myself. “When is the challenge?” I asked. </p><p>“In a month,” she answered despondently, followed by a shocked gaze when I laughed out loud. “Is my suffering amusing to you, sir?” she said, which made me laugh even harder, especially since she still added the honorific. </p><p>“Quite a bit,” I admitted without shame. “But it’s not why I’m laughing, firecracker. Believe me, a month is more than enough to solve your little level problem,” I said in confidence. A month might as well be an eternity with all the options I had in front of me. </p><p>“Really, sir?” she asked, this time hope coloring her tone. </p><p>“Yes, but don’t forget the price. If you take my help, I’m going to make you my toy, mind, body, and soul.” </p><p>“As long as it’s behind closed doors, I accept the bargain, sir,” she answered rapidly, showing more determination than I had expected. Or maybe it was the impression I made on her. </p><p>“Good, then go lay on the bed on your face, and we’re going to start the first phase of the treatment,” I ordered, she threw herself on the bed. It was interesting to watch a prideful woman like her folding into an enthusiastic maid because of a threat to her position, especially since she was so proud of her dominance. </p><p>When I stood above her, I spent a moment enjoying the splendor of her naked figure before putting my hands on her body. First, I checked the spell that I made to detect whether she followed my order about playing with herself, and much to my surprise, it seemed that she followed it. </p><p>I put my hands on her back, and started delivering a top tier massage that applied the full range of my abilities, even using the occasional Biomancy trick. Soon, she was biting the pillow to contain her moans, and that was without me touching any sensitive locations. She was backed up for too long, it seemed. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>She let out a surprised gasp when I put a finger in her mouth without a warning and ordered her to suck. “I need to use my mana to check your status,” I explained, and slipped my mana in her, only to meet a very stiff obstruction. Despite my increased skill, analyzing her was harder than doing it to Titania. I barely got a glimpse of her core, with virtually no detail. I couldn’t even identify her fire skill. </p><p>It might be the effect of the level cap, I decided. But more likely, it was the Companion System that allowed me to access their core. I didn’t have enough evidence to decide one way or another at the moment. </p><p>Luckily, it could be solved easily. I could have slipped inside her, finally taking her virginity to trigger the Companion counter, but it wouldn’t be amusing enough. Instead, I cast a spell on her to prevent her from climaxing, then I continued to massage her, driving her crazier and crazier. </p><p>Soon, even biting the pillow failed to prevent her from crying in pleasure, turning into putty in my hands. “Please,” she murmured. </p><p>“Please, what, firecracker?” I asked her, and got a shy moan. I leaned into her ear, whispering throatily. “I’m going to give you two choices. If you want me to keep away, just say so, and I’ll never touch you again, no matter what, but still help you. Or, you can ask me to fuck you, and I can give you the best, most delicious orgasm of your life. Choose, firecracker.” </p><p>“I want you to…” she murmured, her voice dwindling into a moan as I continued to massage her. </p><p>“Clearer, sweetie,” I said. “I can’t hear you.” </p><p>“I want you to … do me,” she murmured once again. </p><p>“Use the exact words, sweetie, or I will assume that you don’t want to do it,” I threatened. </p><p>The way she froze under my fingers triggered a primal part in me, begging me to take her, make her mine. Still, I waited for her answer. “Please, fuck me, sir,” she moaned deliriously, trying to flip over, only to be prevented by my arms. </p><p>[Achievement: Delicious and Delirious.

    "content": "<p>The journey back to the school was surprisingly uneventful. I had been attacked by a few monsters, but there was no sign of any kind of undead. I wasn’t surprised by their decision, as after the last battle, not only had their losses become untenable, but they had also lost their leader. Also, it might be vain of me to say, but I believed that I had thoroughly intimidated them, hitting them with surprise after surprise. </p><p>Of course, they weren’t the only ones that experienced earth-shattering surprises. My encounter with the librarian had a fair number of surprises, from her enthusiastic carnal involvement to her mind-altering Light Magic, from my surprisingly effective new Tantric skill to the incomprehensible revelation I had received in my achievement. Things were even more complicated than I had expected, and the fact that I somehow positioned myself as a stalwart defender against a very dangerous Necromancer plot didn’t help the situation any. </p><p>I slipped through the guards with familiar ease, and as much as I wanted to take a long bath, I didn’t have the time for it. I still had my meeting with Cornelia —by some miracle, I hadn’t missed it— and before that, I wanted to check in with Aviada and Helga, just to tell them that I returned safely. </p><p>I disguised myself as a servant before starting to look for Aviada, which turned out to be a good choice as I found her in the arena, battling against two men —one fighter, one mage-- at the same time, destroying them easily. It was easy to see the incredible development she had shown since our last meeting. I felt pride when I easily recognized some tricks I had used when I was fighting against her and Helga. </p><p>Unfortunately, the place was too crowded for me to actually talk to her, so I quickly scribbled a note for her, obscurely mentioning my return and giving her a meeting date for tomorrow early in the morning, then waited until her victory, then made eye contact with her. I gave her a small wave as I slipped the note between her items. The relieved smile on her face told me that she recognized me, though it was immediately followed by anger. </p><p>I was going to pay for my disappearance tomorrow. </p><p>With Aviada handled, I changed once more, this time into my library assistant outfit, then I went to where I would find Helga. The library. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to locate her, huddled in an obscure corner, a tower of books piled in front of her as usual. Unlike the other times, I could see that her mind was on something other than reading, her gaze blank on the page, not bothering to flip it as I watched. She was truly worried. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel a stab of guilt as I saw her worried. It was the right choice to force them to leave, as I doubted any of us would have got away with our lives if we were together. They were definitely not ready for that level of combat. Still, seeing her scared gave me a little ping, so I decided to reward her for her obedient waiting. </p><p>I sneaked behind her until I wrapped my arms around her, and whispered gently. “Guess who?” It was a testament of our closeness that despite not detecting me before, she wasn’t panicked by a pair of arms suddenly around her. Instead, she turned her head and caught my lips in a desperate kiss, one that conveyed fear, longing, and relief. </p><p>It was a beautiful kiss that lasted for a couple of minutes, which was still too short in my opinion, especially when it was followed by a hard slap. </p><p>[-1 HP]</p><p>I could have avoided it, of course, but I let her succeed, knowing it was a way to express her fear. “Where were you?” she gasped. “I was worried sick.” </p><p>I briefly considered lying to her, but then I remembered the book in my possession. She was the best person to help me solve its mystery before I gave it back to Titania. “Things were more dangerous than I had expected,” I whispered, letting my expression reflect the full seriousness of the situation. “Really dangerous. But we can’t talk about it here, let’s go to my room,” I said. She nodded, but I was amused to see the slight blush on her face. “Don’t expect much from my room, though,” I warned her. “It’s a real dump.” </p><p>“It’s okay,” she answered as she stood up. After leaving the library, I once again changed into a servant outfit and guided her through the corridors, helping her to avoid attention as we walked down, something easy to achieve as we walked down the corridor. </p><p>To her credit, Helga managed to keep her curiosity in until we arrived at my room, which was then replaced by an unimpressed gaze. “I told you it’s a dump,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>“It’s not that bad,” she murmured with a blush, which was very unconvincing. I smiled widely to tell her that I wasn’t offended. “So, what happened?” she asked, immediately delving into more important topics. </p><p>“A lot,” I answered even as I turned toward the wall, started drawing several runic nodes, tracks of mana burning brightly. “Too much to talk about without making sure we aren’t overheard,” I added, and after finishing the most basic layer of defense, I passed the book to her. </p><p>[-53 Mana]</p><p>“Meanwhile, can you please examine this, maybe you can get a better idea about it,” I added. Setting up the defenses was going to take a lot of time, so Helga working on the mysterious book was a good opportunity. </p><p>“What’s this?” she asked, intrigued. “I’ve never even seen this alphabet, let alone the language.” </p><p>“I don’t know either, but it’s valuable enough that two dozen necromancers used it as the bait for a trap.” </p><p>“Trap! Two dozen!” she exclaimed, the book lay forgotten at her concern. “And you were involved in-” she tried to continue, but I silenced her with a kiss. It was a slight miscalculation, as when I tried to pull back, Helga’s arms wrapped around my torso, pinning me in place, preventing my attempts of pulling back. </p><p>[Level Difference of at least 50%! No Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Relationship not sufficient for the third stage]</p><p>The notifications were annoying, but I ignored them as I focused on the kiss. Helga was too delicious to rebuff just because the System decided to act like an asshole. </p><p>I moaned in appreciation as she slipped a tongue in my mouth, her hands caressing my body like she was trying to make sure that I was still alive, scared of the danger I had gone through earlier. And since she insisted on a break, I decided to give her a break to remember. </p><p>My hands danced over her robe’s buttons and ties with a striking familiarity, quickly getting rid of her outer clothes, revealing her unappealing blouse and skirt, and a body that still managed to be sexy despite everything. I was about to undress her further when she surprised me by hiking up her skirt and pushing her panties down, following that by frantically pulling my shaft out. </p><p>Then, she pulled away from my kisses, and leaned against the wall, her ass raised, angle perfect for my entry. I was surprised by her initiative, but not as much as her next words. “Fuck me hard!” she moaned. “I need to make sure that you’re still here.” </p><p>It was a request impossible to deny, so I stood behind her, quickly fingering her entrance a few times to make sure she was loose enough before impaling her. She moaned loudly as she turned her head, her lips seeking for a kiss, her hips pushing out to meet my frantic pounding. The sound of flesh hitting flesh mixed with desire. With Helga showing such impressive enthusiasm, it didn’t take long for her to reach climax, dragging me along with her. She tightened around me, and I filled her. </p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>The notification came as a surprise. Under the excitement of the moment, I had forgotten that I was edging depletion after pumping Titania full with my mana as well as my seed. </p><p>“Mmm, that was what I needed,” Helga gasped as she tried to control her breathing, but she cried in surprise when I pushed her on the bed and ripped off her clothes, their resistance nothing against my enhanced strength. Soon, she was lying on my bed completely naked, her nipples deliciously erect and her entrance stained with my mark.  </p><p>“You’re delusional if you expect me to stop after that,” I said even as I hovered above her in missionary position before sheathing myself inside her again. “We were supposed to work-” she started only for me to silence her with yet another kiss. I impaled her once again, but this time, it was a long, patient slide that contrasted greatly with my earlier frantic assault. The one before was to remind her that I was still alive, this one was about reminding her of the meaning of pleasure. </p><p>With my lips alternating between her lips and her neck, and with my fingers triggering every sensitive spot in her body, it didn’t take long for her to fall under the daze of pleasure. With her usual caution burned into cinders with desire, she looked spectacular, almost making me explode prematurely. Luckily, I had excellent control over my body. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” she moaned. “This is the peak of pleasure.” </p><p>It was good to see her losing her mind from pleasure, but I wanted to teach her that what she had said was not entirely true. The test run of my new skill had worked wonders on Titania, so I was curious about how it would work on Helga. </p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>I started slow, using my kiss to slip a flicker of mana to her, while maintaining control. The first thing I noticed was the ease I could control that flicker of energy. In Titania, it would have disappeared in moments, but Helga’s mana space was a calm sea compared to Titania’s tornado. </p><p>I easily reached Helga’s core, using my flicker of mana to examine her skills. The view I got from her was much clearer. I still couldn’t identify exact points, but I had a much more accurate view of her abilities. I wondered about the reason for it. Maybe it was the level difference, or maybe it was the increased exposure. I didn’t spend a lot of time on that, however, and focused on the concrete information it provided. I could theorize about its drivers later on. </p><p>The most important difference between Helga and Titania was the quality of the core itself. Titania’s was much stronger, and much more concrete, though it was probably the effect of the level difference. Other things caught my attention as well. Such as the deficiency in her physical stats, her strength in particular. She really needed to bring them up. Her mental stats were much stronger, with her intelligence shining well above her other stats. </p><p>To make things even better, I could also read her skills as well. Though I wasn’t able to recognize all of them, I could easily identify that they were either about magic, or mental aptitude, both working excellently with her designation as a magical researcher, with Arcana as the only actual applicable skill. No wonder she had never been taken seriously in combat parties. </p><p>I was lucky that the rest of the school was stupid enough to miss her true value. </p><p>With that cursory examination finished, I pumped more mana inside her, curious on whether I could make any changes. </p><p>[-250 Mana]</p><p>I targeted her strength, poking and caressing it with my mana, but failed to achieve anything other than a sudden intensifying in Helga’s moans. So, I wrapped my mana around her strength, trying to reinforce it. That came with an interesting result, as I felt her hand around my biceps gripping me much stronger. With sudden inspiration, I solidified the reinforcement before pulling back. </p><p>“What! How!” Helga gasped between my long, even pushes. </p><p>“What happened, sweetie?” I asked. </p><p>“I just received a temporary strength bonus,” she murmured, shocked. I just smirked in satisfaction. “How-” she tried to ask, but when I quickened my assault, her cry of pleasure took priority. I decided to experiment a bit more. I pushed another generous dash of mana into her, but this time, just let her absorb it. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>[Achievement: Boosted Blast. Discover an alternative way of helping your ladies level up. +2 Intelligence. +500 Experience]</p><p>The achievement was a surprise, though definitely appreciated. “Impossible!” she cried even as she suddenly tightened around me as she climaxed. “I just gained experience!” Interesting, I thought, even as I let myself climax as well, filling her with my seed and mana.</p><p>[-500 Mana]</p><p>Her trembling just intensified further, experiencing a second climax before the first one even subsided. She was gasping and moaning helplessly, unable to control her trembling. I lay next to her, pulling her into a gentle spooning while I waited for her to calm down. It took awhile for her to recover from that spectacular high, while I just lay there, enjoying the moment of calm. </p><p>Then, she decided to speak, her tone still trembling and weak. “I just gained experience,” she murmured as she twisted until she was looking at my eyes. “Twice.” </p><p>“Before explaining, can you tell me how much experience you gained,” I asked. </p><p>“Not a bad amount,” she answered. “Two points the first time, which was nothing, but the second time I gained almost fifty points.” Not bad, I realized, though there was a great difference between the methods of delivery, the more intimate version had almost ten percent efficiency. Not a great amount, but considering the skill was not yet fully evolved, it still showed promise. “Stop thinking,” she cut me off. “You owe me an explanation.” </p><p>I could have tried to argue against that, or maybe try to convince her that it was an illusion, but I didn’t bother. I believed that our relationship was strong enough to handle the truth. Not to mention, after the latest reveal, I decided that I needed to understand the origins of my powers. Helga needed to know about it to actually help me. </p><p>“It all started one night in the library,” I started, before giving her a quick breakdown of my unique status. I didn’t reveal all of my secrets of course, and slanted the events in a way that made me look better. Still, some of them were shocking even when softened. </p><p>“I can’t believe you’re Orlin,” Helga murmured in shock, slapping my chest again and again in anger. Luckily, it was quick-burning anger rather than true rage. “Did you take that shape to seduce me?” </p><p>I smirked. “Believe it or not, I was just trying to read books without arousing suspicion, when I saw you needed help. Since I had a soft spot for you, I decided to help, and you can’t blame me for falling for you,” I explained. “And once I had to retire that disguise, I did my best to reconnect with you.” Luckily, rather than a punch, I earned an extended kiss. I once again thanked my charisma. Without it, I doubted I could have avoided a nasty castration attempt. Not to mention, explaining that after two spectacular, back to back orgasms made it even easier. </p><p>I still avoided giving details about the rest of the girls, and completely skipped Cornelia for the moment just to avoid triggering her. I had other ideas to handle that particular revelation. Then, the explanation reached today. </p><p>“I can’t believe you saved her life,” Helga murmured as fascination, shock, and hero worship were battling in her eyes when I explained to her what happened with Titania. Considering Helga practically lived in the library, her hero-worship for the strongest female in the school was very understandable. </p><p>I wondered how she would react if I could manage to arrange a threesome with her. </p><p>“It was a surprise for me as well,” I explained. “But it was mostly luck, the necromancers were so focused on keeping her contained that it gave me the perfect opportunity to destroy their traps. From there, even though it was a tough and exhausting battle,” I said. “Maybe I deserve a reward,” I said cutely while I blasted her with my charisma. </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured, and I hit her with a biomancy spell, curing her exhaustion. Before she could say anything else, I had already slid inside her. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 52%]</p><p>The sudden notification put a smile on my face as I started pumping into her once more, enjoying the way she climbed onto my lap with a renewed fervor. Revealing my secrets made us closer, allowing the companion tracker to progress once more. But as she rode me wildly, my attention was firmly on her beauty rather than the implications of another power boost or the strategies to handle new challenges. </p><p>Those, we could handle tomorrow. For now, I had a blonde bookworm to enjoy. </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 19    Experience: 181050 / 190000 </p><p>Strength: 20    Charisma: 32</p><p>Precision: 15    Perception: 19</p><p>Agility: 19     Manipulation: 24</p><p>Speed: 17       Intelligence: 24</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 26</p><p>HP: 1653 / 1653    Mana: 1359 / 2375        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Tantric [50/50]</p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Marcus!” exclaimed both girls at the same time in exaggerated happiness the moment I walked into the opening, before throwing each other angry glares, like they were accusing each other of stealing their ‘brilliant’ idea. I smiled as I walked close, acting oblivious to the tension. </p><p>“Ready to move, girls?” I asked. “I have found an excellent camping spot, warm, concealed enough to set a fire as long as we get rid of the smoke, and best of all, with a small river next to it so we can fish and bathe.” </p><p>“Bathing, that sounds lovely, let’s move,” Lillian jumped immediately as she fluttered her eyes alluringly, pushing her chest out to display it  the best way possible. Only then I noticed that while fixing her clothes, she had applied some critical alterations to her top. It was tighter, for one, and its cleavage ran much deeper. </p><p>I gazed at Astrid as well as we started walking, examining the changes in her clothes. Unlike Lillian, her top was looser, and covered more area. For a moment, I was confused, as the changes contrasted greatly with her argument with Lillian, but then I remembered that it was Lillian that was responsible for fixing her clothes. Clever, I thought, even though it was rather pointless. With the amount of fabric that was available, even Lillian’s best efforts failed to make Astrid’s spectacular cleavage disappear. </p><p>And soon, Astrid decided to fight back. Lillian was walking next to me, rubbing her breasts into my arm at every opportunity. Astrid advanced a couple of steps extra, and started swaying her hips with a level of lewdness that would blend in perfectly in a brothel. Admittedly, her movements weren’t as smooth as I would have liked —but understandable considering until recently, she was a sexy, nubile priestess in a barbarian tribe that did her best to avoid unwanted attention. </p><p>Still, I let my gaze stay fixed on her hips as they danced aggressively with each step, and not just because doing so galvanized Lillian to an absurd degree. Astrid might not be perfectly smooth in her seduction game, but then again she didn’t have to be, not when she had a  derriere with perfect curvature, beautiful enough to warm the blood of the coldest man. </p><p>From the way Lillian harrumphed in dissatisfaction, she seemed to be well aware of that fact, no doubt lamenting her childish idea to mess with her by forcing her into such a sexy dress. But she was not a quitter, so rather than accepting defeat, she grabbed my hand, pulling it dangerously close to her body, my fingers brushing against her thighs at each step. It was a good choice, I had to admit, as even after everything, touching her skin excited me. </p><p>Watching the most popular girl back in school, famous for being untouchable, doing her best to debase herself just for my fleeting attention was an incredible boost to my pride. </p><p>I couldn’t help but send my thanks to that idiot pirate who decided to force me onto their ship. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to save Lillian, acquire the Dragon’s Heart, and somehow managed to break through the barrier between the realms of Mage and Sorcerer. </p><p>If it wasn’t for that, I probably would have found myself as a mercenary, listening to an overgrown noble or a wannabe warlord’s annoying wishes just to get a living wage. Or I would have found a little town no better than an overgrown village and began trying to establish myself without drawing too much attention. Trying to establish a powerbase alone was almost impossible to do, even for an extraordinary mage. </p><p>Things were different for a Sorcerer, of course. Even the weakest Sorcerer represented a dangerous weapon that threatened to ruin the balance everywhere except the biggest cities. An unknown mage would have been accepted grudgingly under the best of circumstances. An unknown Sorcerer, on the other hand, would have been recruited with the best benefits the organization could provide. Understandably, considering most Sorcerers worked for the government. </p><p>The impeccable discipline of the infantry wasn’t the biggest reason for the Roman Legion’s scary reputation. No, that honor went to Legates, every single one of them a Sorcerer with great accomplishment in battle magic, and they usually converted their battle honors into election materials, gaining themselves a senate seat, even gaining a Praetor seat if they were charismatic enough. </p><p>With the possibility of a Senate seat —a lifelong position of riches, comfort, and unbelievable political power as a part of the ruling mechanism of one of the top countries in the world— not many Sorcerers considered taking roles in other organizations. Not when even the mediocre Legates received a retirement package that ensured a comfortable living in Rome itself. For the foreign Sorcerers, joining auxiliary legions was even more tempting, because completing their service came with citizenship, something that was reserved for only the luckiest ones that were born in Italy itself. </p><p>I had no intention of joining the military, of course. Spending twenty-five years risking my life for the whims of the Republic, or struggling through yet another pointless battle with the Eastern Roman Empire trying to tweak the nose of whomever that was holding the throne in Constantinople didn’t appeal to me. Especially since the latter meant fighting against other Sorcerers, backed by the impeccable Gryffon Cavalry, famous for their lightning strikes. </p><p>The sudden wetness I felt on top of my fingertips distracted me from my musings. I turned to my left, surprised to see my hand disappearing under the thin strap of cloth Lillian called a skirt, forced into intimacy. Lillian gave me an annoyed huff, and only then I realized that while I was musing distractedly, my eyes were stuck on the show Astrid was providing. </p><p>Lillian took it personally, and since I had no problems playing with her as we walked, I slipped my fingers inside. Lillian moaned immediately, quite a bit louder than necessary, enough to make Astrid turn. However, her face was alight with determination rather than frustration. </p><p>Astrid slowed down until she was on my right side. “What’s our plan for tomorrow’s journey,” she asked. It wasn’t an urgent discussion, but when she grabbed my hand, I could easily see that it was an excuse to force intimacy. </p><p>Since I wasn’t an idiot or eunuch, I played along, curious just how far they would push with a bit of competition. “Nothing should change from my perspective. With all the false trails we laid, there’s no way for our enemies to catch up with us. So, we’ll continue to travel, but at a more comfortable pace.” </p><p>“Praise Saturn,” Lillian exclaimed even as her grip around my hand tightened, forcing my fingers deeper into her. “I appreciate the chance to sleep.” </p><p>Astrid said nothing, but I felt her body begin to pull away from me. I was surprised by that, as I hadn’t expected her to be dissuaded that easily. Then, I felt a pair of hot, round objects pressing against my biceps, familiar with their presence. I hadn’t had to turn to see Astrid once again free of her top, but I did anyway, mostly for my viewing pleasure. “Yes, sleep well,” Astrid said smugly. “I’m sure we can find something to do to fill the time.” </p><p>Lillian chose to say nothing but glare instead. Astrid turned to me once again. “There’s a small trading outpost just half a day’s walk away from here. Maybe we can hunt something on the way, and use it to exchange for resources, and maybe to rest as well.” </p><p>“Wouldn’t that give our followers a clue?” I replied.</p><p>“We can always disguise ourselves,” she answered immediately, like that answer was already prepared. And while pressing her naked tits into my arm was a good way to distract me, it also allowed me to feel her heartbeat, which increased immediately after my rejection. She wanted to go there for more than convenience and supplies. The question was for what? </p><p>I decided to play along. The sooner I understood what really drove her, the better. “In that case, it might work, assuming we can take down some decent hunt, of course.”</p><p>“I’m sure you can handle it easily,” she answered even as she rubbed herself along my arm. “I have seen you take down a thunder bear without breaking a sweat.” </p><p>I could feel Lillian getting restless —her nails sinking into my arm was very clear— but I didn’t want her to distract us right now, so I quickened my fingers, forcing a moan out of her. Meanwhile, I continued talking with Astrid. “So, tell me about this trading post more,” I said. </p><p>“I don’t know much, I only accompanied Matron Helena a couple of times when she went there to manage the trade,” she answered. “It’s a small place that was set up by a couple of Veteran Gauls. They buy fur and semi-precious materials…” she started, and in the next five minutes, she gave me the breakdown of the camp. I noticed that she was very careful glossing over the negative aspects and exalting its positives. She really wanted to go there, the question was why. </p><p>“That seems like a good strategy, and I appreciate the opportunity of sleeping in a bed after a long while,” I said, accepting the suggestion. It was better to see what she was trying to do rather than harboring suspicions. I might have been more suspicious if our meeting was anything other than complete coincidence, but under the circumstances, I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. </p><p>Though, just to be honest with me, if she hadn’t been a voluptuous redhead with tits beautiful enough to browse the dead, I doubted I would have taken the risk. </p><p>When we arrived at the camp location, Lillian was having trouble standing straight after ten minutes of uninterrupted fingering and an orgasm. She collapsed on the nearest flat space, breathing hard, while Astrid looked at her with a mixture of grudge and amusement. </p><p>“Lillian clearly needs to catch her breath, and I’m feeling exhausted,” I said. “Astrid, why don’t you fish for a bit while I take a bath,” I ordered before I walked toward the small alcove where the river created a calm spot, perfect for washing. After walking around the whole day without a shirt, in a forest, I really needed a bath. </p><p>I shivered as I stepped into the water, wishing that I had regained enough control to use runes. A cold bath was definitely not ideal, though I still sank down, enjoying the soak with my eyes closed. Without any soap, I needed to soak for a while to feel clean, so I started circulating my mana to multitask. </p><p>The flow was much smoother, I realized with satisfaction even as I forced it to move faster and faster. My new core started thumping faster and faster, following the rhythm of the flow, and warmth spread through my body, negating the cold. Too much warmth, even, as I could suddenly feel water bubbling around myself, and suddenly, I was glad for the chilly water. My body was burning, my bones replaced with cinders, and my blood with magma. </p><p>At least, that was what it felt like. </p><p>Even then, I only forced my mana to flow faster, because I could feel that the mysterious sensation of fire was forcing my body to renew. My muscles felt like fire, but with each passing second, they felt stronger. I didn’t know what was going on within my body, whether it was helpful or harmful, but it felt natural. It was something that was supposed to happen. </p><p>That feeling didn’t help the pain. </p><p>The burning sensation was unbearable enough, but soon, it was replaced by a stabbing sensation, radiating from my bones, like someone had stabbed a dagger, hard enough to break through. A distant cry reached my ear, and with the distracting pain, it took awhile for me to realize that it was the echo of my own cry. I bit my lips, trying to contain my voice. </p><p>Soon, the sound of my cries was replaced by the bubbling of boiling water, violent steam covering my surroundings. Soon, the wind picked up, circling me, no less wild than a tornado, while the boiling water circled the other way. I stumbled despite my best effort to stand up. For a fleeting moment, I was afraid that my legs lost their ability to keep me upright. It would have been an ignoble death, if I lost my balance and drowned in waist-deep water. Then, I realized that it wasn’t my legs that were shaking, but the earth itself. </p><p>Earth, water, fire, air… The fundamental elements were raging around me in discord, forced into a state of chaos, all triggered by my mana flow. I didn’t know whether to resist it or try to stop it, as I never had any access to material about sorcerers. My family hadn’t had one in centuries —there was a reason that my family was in Britanium, exiled from Rome proper despite carrying the name of one of the biggest heroes of the republic. </p><p>I didn’t even know if what I had been experiencing was a part of breaking through the barrier, or it was an aberrant reaction from the dragon heart I had absorbed. After all, I had never heard anything close to it. Maybe I didn’t, because it was impossible.</p><p>Maybe I was about to die, split between the elements. </p><p>I could feel the chaos around me getting stronger and stronger, the pain from the elements that surrounded me surpassed the internal pain I had been going through, so much so that death was looking like the better choice. The rage of the elements was picking up speed, threatening to drown me, like the world itself wanted to destroy me. I was being burned, flailed, suppressed, and shaken. Death was only a matter of time. </p><p>Then, the lightning struck, bright enough to sear my eyes despite my closed eyelids, bathing my body under it. </p><p>I didn’t know if it fell from the sky, or it escaped from my body and cut through the sky. Maybe both. But whatever it was, I could feel the skin of my body breaking down. Then, another lightning bolt fell, then another, and another… </p><p>Ultimately, I lost count, the pain becoming the only constant, but somehow, not only was I alive, I could feel my vitality increasing. My arms felt stronger, my breath deeper, my heart stronger.</p><p>When the last bolt of lightning hit my body, I collapsed onto the floor, taking the deepest, most delicious breath I had ever taken. I was exhausted, about to collapse. Falling asleep never sounded more appealing, but I forced my eyes open. The water in the natural pool I had been bathing in had evaporated, but I could still feel wetness around my feet, meaning it was slowly filling up. Drowning after surviving that disaster would have been a ridiculous thing to do. </p><p>But when I felt familiar hands grabbing at each of my arms and dragging me forward, I decided to let myself go, surrendering my fate to my two lady friends. </p><p>The last thing I noticed before I fell into unconsciousness was that the dragon heart that had been accompanying me for the last few days had disappeared, replaced by a genuine magical core —or what I assumed to be what a genuine magical core looked like— though it still felt eerily similar to the dragon’s heart. </p><p>I had a feeling that, when I woke up, my life was going to get even more complicated… </p>",

    "title": "Chapter 1 - Introduction",
    "content": "<p>I couldn’t believe that after everything that happened, I got captured by a bunch of useless schmucks. How humiliating. I, the Herald of Darkness, Conqueror of the Eternal Plains, Slayer of the One-Eyed Titan, Scourge of Light, had been captured by a bunch of idiotic but opportunistic heroes, led by the most annoying person I ever had the displeasure of meeting, Lancelot Lightsoul himself. </p><p>“Come on, Byron, just tell me where the Eternal Core is, and the pain will stop,” Lancelot said in a compassionate tone, completely sincere, which was rather annoying considering my body was still burning as a result of the beating I had received. It was amusing just how easily so-called heroes resorted to torture —sorry, enhanced interrogation— when they needed to extract something from their prisoner. </p><p>“N-no…” I murmured exhaustedly, acting like I hadn’t seen the way his eyes brightened with satisfaction at my display of weakness. He wanted the Eternal Core, one of the strongest artifacts in the world, and the only hope he had for it was me, and I wasn’t speaking.  </p><p>“I don’t enjoy your suffering,” he said, and I could read the sincerity in his eyes. Funny enough, that made me hate the situation even more. Being a prisoner was bad enough, but my enemy didn’t even have the decency to hate me. He treated me like furniture, a means to an end, and nothing else. </p><p>And nobody treated me like that. </p><p>It was the whole point of becoming a Dark Lord. I hated the idea of being one of the nameless mooks, living and dying without any impact. Of course, I was smart enough to admit that if I had been born into a better family, maybe I would have chosen a more benign way to it, maybe a Knight, or a Scholar. As the bastard son of a disgraced peasant, I wasn’t exactly swimming in options to become someone that mattered. </p><p>So, I chose the path of darkness, making sure that everyone knew my name, until for good or ill, I mattered. </p><p>I hated Lancelot for exactly that reason. He was everything I was not. Born to a minor noble family, recognized as the reincarnation of the previous hero, blessed by unmatched raw power, mentored by some of the strongest warriors and mages, supported in his every action to the point that he was engaged the only princess of the Empire, poised to inherit the throne itself. The fact that his party was filled almost completely with sexy and available women, each of them a master of their craft, just drove the difference deeper. </p><p>The entitled shit was everything I hated. Everything he had was simply presented in a silver platter. </p><p>… including my ignoble defeat and capture. </p><p>It was what rankled me most about my situation. I had been fighting nonstop almost for a month against my rivals in yet another coup attempt —the title of Dark Lord doesn’t promise and long and comfortable life— when my rivals broke the unofficial rule of engagement and helped Lancelot and his trope of nubile idiots into our battle, at that point, forcing me to fight against an alliance of light and dark. </p><p>It was shameful, because it was a move outside of my calculations. I didn’t expect it, I wasn’t prepared for it. Even after pulling all the stops, I failed to defeat them, though I would like to think that I had given a good fight. When the battle ended, more than half of my traitor rivals were dead, most of the others, including Lancelot, were badly wounded. Impressive considering several of my rivals were stronger than me in terms of pure magical power was concerned, not to mention the absolute dominance Lancelot was able to display. </p><p>They were shocked when I pulled all the stops and started fighting really ugly. Not ugly in the traditional Dark Lord sense, which meant Demons and hostages and forbidden curses. No, I fought ugly in a way I did when I was just a skinny boy in the abandoned streets, trying to survive alone. Invisible caltrops, spits, childish insults, crass distractions, poisons, traps… Anything as long as it worked.  </p><p>Of course, the real difference was the way I approached the magic. Lancelot had been trained in one of the sacred traditions of the Empire, exclusive for the heroes of light. It was not too different for my rivals. Many of them came from noble families or belonged to ancient organizations, with corresponding hidden arts and sacred techniques. </p><p>I had a mishmash of techniques that I stole, beguiled, copied, deduced, even invented. They insulted me for it, of course, even going as far as to call me Peasant Lord —only where I can’t hear after I made several very convincing examples of the ones stupid enough to challenge me on my face. I would admit that my fighting style lacked the majesty and the grace that the others displayed. But it worked well with my opportunistic mindset, enough that I was able to defeat enemies that were supposed to be above my weight class. </p><p>While I was lost in my thoughts, Lancelot was standing above me, a frown on his face. “I don’t want to hurt you. Please tell me where is the Eternal Core is, and I’ll set you free as long as you vow not to attack the Empire anymore,” he said, something I had no trouble disbelieving. Not that I believed he was lying, he was idiot enough to actually believe my vow. </p><p>The queen, on the other hand, was a completely different matter. Queen Sapphire was a mediocre mage, but she was ruling the empire with an iron fist covered in a thin layer of velvet for the last two decades, directly after the disappearance of the old king. She was one of the few people I respected, not that it prevented me from hating her in a burning passion. I was almost sure that the situation of my downfall had been engineered by her. </p><p>She was a formidable woman more than she was a formidable mage, keeping the palace functioning singlehandedly despite the dysfunctional political situation in the Empire, especially with the chaos of the council. As a bonus, she was total MILF, perfect legs, smooth skin, and a large bosom to die for, all circled by her flowing blonde hair and shining blue eyes. </p><p>She usually accompanied Lancelot on the interrogation sessions, but this time, she was absent, replaced by Emma, one of the most accomplished elementalist mage I ever had the pleasure of fighting against. She was smooth, strong, and elegant, if a bit predictable for my tastes. She was a redhead with a thin, almost fragile body that hid a fiery temper and some impressive assets. </p><p>Also, she was Lancelot’s childhood friend. </p><p>She nursed a painfully-obvious crush on Lancelot, of which the idiot managed to miss easily. She wasn’t the only one in their little troupe that was crushing on him, but hers was stronger than the other girls in their adventuring party, a party that was consisted on almost exclusively of women who had feelings for Lancelot; something that so-called Bastion of Light was either unaware of it, or so repressed that he never even tried to take advantage of it. </p><p>Idiot. </p><p>Of course, Emma was unhappy today, because she and Lancelot were accompanied by Queen Sapphire’s daughter, Aria, who Emma hated with a great passion, because in addition to her other impressive traits, Princess Aria had a title that Emma was willing to kill for.</p><p>Lancelot’s fiancee. </p><p>Unlike the others that were watching me with vindictive or uncaring eyes, Princess Aria’s eyes were filled with compassion, unhappy with my imprisonment. Though it wasn’t true empathy, more like the gaze she would spare for a wounded dog. I was alive, and I was in pain, which triggered her overdeveloped sense of responsibility, but never to a point that she actually tried to stop my torture, or heal me without permission from her precious fiancee. More than once I had heard her begging Lancelot to stop torturing me, but that meant nothing, especially since she had the right to order the guards to stop. She was the only princess of the Empire, after all.  </p><p>She was soft, naive, and lacking a spine.</p><p>However, she had some good traits. She was one of the most accomplished healers I had ever seen, capable of raising anything short of true death. And, just like her mother and the rest of the girls in their group, she was a true vision of beauty. Like her mother, she was a blue-eyed blonde beauty, but unlike her mother, she was more reasonably proportioned, or at least I assumed so, as her conservative dressing didn’t leave a lot of space for guessing. </p><p>Princess Aria looked like she was about to say something, when the door opened, and a girl dressed in a revealing leather armor stepped in. Isolde, the most famous tracker of the Empire, and one of the best even compared to the ones with decades more experience. She was a natural. And, like the other girls, she was a part of Lancelot’s party, though unlike the others, I didn’t know much about her. She was rather hard to read. The only thing I knew about her was her explosive temper. </p><p>“There’s an emergency council meeting, and queen needs you all to join,” she informed them in her usual calm, almost emotionless tone. From the way every other occupant of the room looked at me like they were blaming me, it wasn’t hard to assume that I was the reason for the said meeting, probably pushing for my execution. I doubted that even Lancelot was stupid enough to actually reveal the presence of the Eternal Core to a bunch of greedy politicians.  </p><p>But it meant that the time was ticking for me, but for them as well. </p><p>“Thanks, Isolde, helpful as always,” Lancelot said as he walked toward the door, leaving her blush prettily, contrasting her usual dour expression. “Can you finish up here and activate the spells before leaving our guest alone,” he added. Alone, because unlike a regular prison, my cell was in a forbidden tower, only accessible by people allowed by the Queen herself, which meant Lancelot and his band of lovesick ladies, and no one else. They didn’t dare to allow anyone else, rightfully afraid of me revealing my secrets to one of their opponents for revenge. </p><p>Admittedly, it was something I might actually do, so I couldn’t blame them for the idea. </p><p>Aria and Emma followed Lancelot and left my cell, leaving me alone with Isolde. “So, do you think they are going to have a quick threesome before the meeting, they left in a hurry,” I said mockingly. </p><p>The response exploded on my ribs in the form of one of her boots. “Silence,” she ordered. </p><p>“Someone is cranky, did someone stayed out of the rotation last night,” I said. “Maybe Emma took too much of Lancelot’s time. She was limping today,” I mocked, only to be silenced by another attack, this time back of her hand exploding on my face. “Did I hit a sore spot?” </p><p>“Shut up!” she shouted as she punched me. “Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!” she continued, each repeat punctuated by another punch, enough to strain me against my chains. I just laughed, earning another set of punches. It was a good feeling to win, I decided. I might be the one that was receiving the punches, but she was the one that was hurting more. It was an asshole move, as I was sure that Lancelot was too weak to actually sample the goods the girls around him was more than happy to offer, but Isolde was just insecure enough to actually believe that the rest of the group was having orgies but leaving her out. </p><p>Like anyone with half a mind actually trying to keep her out of an orgy. She had a horrible demeanor, but that didn’t change the fact that she was extremely beautiful. But I continued goading her, because it was a part of my plan. </p><p> “Truth hurts, doesn’t it,” I said, ignoring my bleeding. “You have spent countless sleepless nights to track his enemies, while he spends countless sleepless nights plowing his sexy fiancee and slutty best friend.” </p><p>I stopped only when I felt her blade pressing against my throat. “One more word, and I kill you,” she warned. </p><p>“Really,” I answered. “That’s the best you can do, beating a man in chains.” </p><p>“I’ll show you,” she said angrily even as she reached down and forced my chains open. “Stand up, we’re going to fight, and I’m going to teach you a lesson.” I felt my magic rush back in, soothing my wounds, and for the first time, I felt like I had a fighting chance. Pity that I was in the heart of the Empire. Even if I was in a perfect state, escaping would have been a legendary feat. While wounded, exhausted, and unarmed, simply suicide. </p><p>But I had a plan. I raised my hands like I was preparing to punch her, only to receive a mean right hook. I stumbled down, my hand pressing against my own pool of blood. “Stand up,” she ordered, but I made a show of breathing loudly like I was trying to catch my breath. Meanwhile, unnoticed by her, I was already drawing several runes. </p><p>I stood up when they started to glow slightly. Thankfully, Isolde was having too much fun venting her anger by punching me, again and again, to actually pay attention to her surroundings. </p><p>Twenty minutes I resisted collapsing, no matter how many punches I received. When I finally received an uppercut hard enough to threaten my consciousness, I threw myself in the same pool of blood, and dispelled the runes I had drawn earlier. I was half delirious when Isolde locked me in my chains once more and left the room. </p><p>A burst of manic laughter escaped my mouth even if each gasp hurt like a dagger. Because, even with the chains in place, I could feel my magic. A mere trickle compared to my full potential, but it was still infinitely more than what I had available. I finally had a fighting chance. Now, I needed to decide on my next action. </p><p>Ironically, I would never have the opportunity if Lancelot hadn’t been an idiot and properly fucked his prospective harem to satisfaction… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I examined Astrid carefully even as I walked toward her almost-naked figure, her knees on the ground and a shocked expression on her face. I was enjoying the sight of her beautiful breasts, especially since she didn’t even bother covering them. </p><p>Pity that I couldn’t turn my full focus to them, as I had to pay attention to her mood. She was currently stuck between a beautiful mixture of fear, shock, and arousal, and it was my job to lessen the impact of the first two and enhance the last. She was a sexy vixen, the way her crimson hair spilled on her shoulders enough to harden me even if her beautiful tits hadn’t been in the display. However, no much I wanted to push her down and take her, I needed to make sure about the future implications. After all, for the next twenty days, she was my only guide, and I didn’t want to piss her off. </p><p>So, no matter how much she looked like she was ready for the next step, I need to take it slow, no matter how much I wanted my fingers to disappear into the vast expense of her beautiful breasts. I stood in front of her, towering with a great margin since she was still on her knees. “So, you decided to be a little naughty,” I murmured even as I put my finger on her chin, caressing gently while carefully looking for signs of revulsion and reluctance. </p><p>I was happy to see that the expression that bloomed on her face was almost pure desire, though it was soon polluted with other concerns. “I’m sorry, leader,” she murmured. “It’ll never happen again.” </p><p>“Really?” I said. “So, you’re saying that I should just forgive you without a punishment,” I said. I was expecting her to nod, so when she shook her head, it caught me with surprise. “Explain!” I ordered. </p><p>She raised her head, her green eyes burning with desire she was barely able to suppress. Clearly, the show I put through Lillian had worked even better than I had expected. I didn’t know why. Maybe she had lesbian leanings, or maybe she was too excited about the prospect of punishment. Maybe it was a combination of it. Regardless, I was happy with the way her eyes shone. “I deserve the punishment, leader,” she murmured. “Only by internalizing the punishment, I could learn from them.” </p><p>It was a good answer, delivered with conviction. Unfortunately for her, my eyes were too sharp to miss the stiffening of her nipples, nor had I missed the way her legs tightened in a desperate attempt to remember. “Interesting,” I said. “Did the previous leader punished you a lot?” </p><p>“No,” she said, but I could see that there was more to her answer. I gave her a pointed glare, reinforced by a tap of my foot. “He never dared to. His wife, Matron Helena, would have taken his head if he dared to touch anyone else, especially me,” she continued, and I waited a bit more. “It was the matron that punished me.” </p><p>I could see her getting even more aroused the moment she referred at the matron. Since I wasn’t an idiot, I decided to push for that angle. “And how did she punish you?” I asked in a throaty tone, and even let a wisp of mana to escape, giving a sense of pressure over her, betting that she would enjoy it in the context. </p><p>From the way she gasped, I was willing to bet that I was right. “She liked to use a crop,” Astrid murmured. “But never hard enough that a simple healing spell wouldn’t cure the next day. Sometimes she tied me and let me hang, stretching in pain while she caressed my body,” she added. </p><p>How interesting, I thought even as I listened to the little tricks her leader had been applying to my little Astrid. I had to thank Helena for training such a spectacular little bundle of joy, then ship to me untouched. I knew a lot of nobles would have turned their nose at her, preferring their soft and carefully trained pleasure slaves, but even the idea of it was repugnant to me. Sex was enjoyable, but also it was a game. What was the point of playing with an unwilling opponent… Astrid, on the other hand, was perfect. Wild enough to make it dangerous, skilled enough that her presence was not a burden, and with a potential for the magic that if groomed correctly, would make her a minor powerhouse. </p><p>Her beauty, and her delicious reaction to her own tales about her punishments were definitely impressive bonuses though. Maybe I should keep her even after we reached our meeting destination. With Lillian going back to her family, I would definitely need a travel companion. </p><p>“Difficult competition,” I murmured after she finished the full list of punishment she received from her matron Helena. “I guess I need to be creative if I really want to make an impression,” I added even as I caressed her cheek, before suddenly tightening my grip. “Do you agree, sweetie?” I said, my tone much darker than my words. </p><p>She whimpered in a way that indicated a positive response, so I started walking. When I arrived at her back, I forced her arms to her back, using the ripped remains of her top to tie them in place. She whimpered in a way that made my pants uncomfortably tight, so when I walked back in front of her, I decided to show just what she had caused. I grabbed her hair and pulled her close until she was smashed her face against my erection, which, unfortunately, was still in my pants. “My discomfort is your fault,” I whispered. “What are you going to do about it?” </p><p>I loosened my grip around her hair, letting her pull back. Surprisingly, she didn’t pull back, and even more surprisingly, when she opened her mouth, it wasn’t for speaking. Instead, she grabbed the string that was keeping my pants in place with her teeth, and loosened it with a tug. Her movements were choppy and unpracticed, and sexier because of it. When she followed it by pulling down my pants with her teeth, it was a small miracle that I didn’t explode into her face. </p><p>“How about this, leader?” she said even as she pressed her lips against my shaft, now naked, before slowly traveling down, leaving a string of kisses. However, despite her enthusiasm, she wasn’t able to hide the way her eyes widened when she first saw his shaft. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said dismissively, but made sure to smile at her for a moment to remove the sharpness. She was showing great aptitude, so I didn’t want to scare her too much. At my words, she smiled even wider before parting her lips before capturing the head between her beautiful lips, making me moan softly. Her eyes looked proud. </p><p>Unfortunately, the rest of the treatment didn’t go as well. She tried her best, but it was obvious that she wasn’t used to it, or any kind of sexual encounter with men. It wasn’t a problem, of course, as the smoother experience was definitely no substitute for my own untouched —by male hand at least, as Helena’s stories were definitely not just punishment— redheaded barbarian priestess, willing to fulfill my desires. </p><p>“We’re going to move on with the punishment, relax your mouth,” I ordered even as I grabbed her read hair, enjoying her brief moment of panic as I pushed myself deeper into her mouth, stopping as the crown tickled her throat. I stopped there, no matter how much I wanted to push even deeper, not wanting to shock her at the first moment of her experience. </p><p>When I pulled back, the movement was accompanied by a moan from her, and a groan from me. She might be inexperienced, but the sensation of her tongue was simply divine. I pushed back and forth, treating her mouth like a toy, and she just moaned, tempting me to push even deeper into her throat. I didn’t push it in, but only because I had been facing an even greater distraction. </p><p>Her breasts. Her huge, perfectly shaped, perky breasts. </p><p>She let out a disappointed sigh when I pulled my shaft out, only to be replaced by a shocked gasp when I pushed her down. She found herself laying on the floor in an uncomfortable position, with her hands still tied at her back, but it didn’t look like she was bothered by it, not when my shaft took the prestigious position between her breasts, my hands pressing them from the side to create a nice sense of pressure. </p><p>Then, I started moving, our moans mixing together. And it was a spectacular sensation, the warm grasp of her breasts, giving me jolts of pleasure with each push. “Damn, you’re delicious,” I murmured. </p><p>“Thank you, leader,” she moaned even as she lay obediently, her expression of desire thickening with each passing second. She was clearly enjoying the rough treatment I had been subjecting her to. My mind was already dancing around the other possibilities I could subject her to, but it was a pity that we were in the middle of an opening, with a hurry to disappear. Even the current break we were taking was rather excessive considering the circumstances, but my desire needed a release. </p><p>She must have released my urgency from the way I sped between her tits, so she leaned forward until she captured the crown between her lips, her tongue dancing furiously at the top. “Good girl,” I said in appreciation, enjoying her display of initiative. The small shudder that went through her body at the compliment hadn’t gone unnoticed as well. </p><p>She was deliciously submissive. </p><p>I decided to give Helena a lavish gift if we ever had the opportunity to meet —assuming she wasn’t already dead due to coup— because she had gone such trouble to train Astrid to my specifications while also leaving her untouched. I really owed her one. </p><p>Wanting to test Astrid’s limits, I decided to slap her breast softly, only to receive the loudest moan yet. “Excellent,” I murmured in appreciation even as I slapped her other breast, this time hard enough for the slap to echo between the trees, and her only reaction was sucking my shaft even more enthusiastically. </p><p>No matter the changes I had gone through, I was still only a human, and constantly sliding between the tits of a redheaded beauty while the said beauty’s lips were clasped around the crown was impossible to resist. Especially when each spank to said spectacular breasts made her moan even harder. </p><p>I pulled back just before I exploded, leaving her confused for a fleeting moment before I started spraying, covering her breasts and her face with a thick layer of my seed. The expression of aroused surprise on her face made me laugh. “Good girl,” I muttered once more upon seeing that she was licking her lips obediently. </p><p>I felt relaxed, but after that display, she deserved a release of her own as well. I grabbed her arms and gently pulled her on her feet, then sat to a nearby rock and pulled her to my knee. “Open your legs,” I ordered, and she did so immediately, allowing me to easily slide my fingers into her underwear, which was already sopping wet. My fingers danced at her wet entrance, and she moaned and gasped, which, unfortunately, had the effect of resurrecting my hard-on. Pity that we didn’t have the time to enjoy that. </p><p>I grabbed her still bound hands and pulled them hard, and the jolt of pain pushing her toward the edge. She climaxed with an earth-shattering moan, and started trembling on my lap. I wrapped an arm around her waist, but still leaving her tied up as she enjoyed the aftershocks of her orgasm. </p><p>“Fix yourself, and keep a watch on Lillian,” I said even as untied her hands. She stood up, but her legs were still trembling. “I’m going to find a good spot for camping, and maybe even hunt a bit if I can arrange it.” After a moment’s thought, I added one last order. “And try not to antagonize Lillian too much before I return. I don’t want you two fighting without me to keep it from going out of hand.”  </p><p>“Of course, leader,” she said, the last word once again underlined with arousal and desire. I didn’t know if it was desperation, my impressive magical display, or the pleasure she had just experienced, but she was being very enthusiastic about accepting her new lot in life. </p><p>More power for me, I supposed. </p><p>I would have liked to stay and watch Astrid as she washed her face and chest to clean herself from my seed, but I already had a raging boner, and didn’t trust myself to maintain control. And if I lost control, we would have ended up without a good camping spot, meaning we would be exhausted the next day. </p><p>Luckily, it took less than five minutes for me to find a well-concealed location with a small river nearby, with plenty of fish to enjoy. When I returned, I was met with the sight of Lillian and Astrid facing each other, glaring daggers at each other. The fact that Astrid’s chest was still covered in my cum and Lillian’s panties were still dislodged made the situation even sexier. My erection was resurrected in an instant. I decided to listen to their argument, curious whether Astrid would be able to keep her moans under control. </p><p>“I’m not going to say it again,” Lillian said angrily. “Stay away from Marcus, he’s mine.” </p><p>“Really?” Astrid said, before pointing at her breasts that were still covered with my marks. “Those seem to disagree.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” Lillian answered sharply, too sharply even. The way her arms rose to her own chest protectively told me that she was feeling some jealousy under the circumstances, an understandable feeling. As a whole package, Lillian was as impressive as Astrid, but in the chest department, she was horrendously outmatched. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter. He’s going to go back with me in a month, so the only way you could follow him was to accept a position as a slave.” She smirked evilly, but it somehow made her even sexier. “And I would enjoy having you as our slave.” </p><p>Astrid wasn’t flapped by her statement. “Are you sure he’s going to go back with you,” she stated confidently. “From what I had seen, he seems like he’s enjoying his freedom despite the challenges.” </p><p>“It’s a passing fancy,” she said with a wave of her hand. “He might have some problems back at home, but it’s nothing my family can’t solve.” Lillian giggled. “They will do their best to help my future husband.” </p><p>“I see,” Astrid murmured despondently, not happy with Lillian’s last words, before a sudden realization hit her. “Wait, does he know about the husband part?” </p><p>“W-what?” Lillian stammered, blushing furiously. “N-yes, maybe, it doesn’t matter anyway,” she rapidly spat out, frustrated. Astrid smiled at her in a superior manner. “Why do you care anyway,” Lillian sniped. “It’s not like he’s going to marry a barbarian trash like you.” </p><p>Unlike what Lillian intended, Astrid took her assault in stride. “Of course not,” Astrid said in a matter of fact tone. “He’s extraordinary. Brave and strong, and while forceful, he’s also kind and caring. I can never hope to hold a position of equality. My best hope would be to be a mistress, but I would settle to be a bedwarmer.” </p><p>“You worthless slut,” Lillian gasped. “You’re just going to throw your body at him to stay with him.” </p><p>“And it’s different from what you’re doing, how?” Astrid answered. “Also, don’t forget that you’re the idiot that forced me to dress like this, making me get his attention. Do you think he would have noticed me in my previous clothes,” she added, giving her one last smug smile before walking away. </p><p>Lillian’s expression of shock was beautiful. Astrid’s last comment wasn’t accurate, of course. Even in those clothes, she was a delicious vixen, and it was a matter of time I seduced her. At most, it would have delayed things a day. Still, it was masterfully delivered to unsettle Lillian. </p><p>I stayed hidden, watching the girls silently mend their clothes, clean, and dress, finding their half-naked chores enticing. </p><p>When I returned to the opening and informed them about the camping spot, their answers were calm and subdued, but their eyes burned bright as they planned to resolve their argument in a different way while camping. </p><p>I was very excited about the prospect… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was caught flat-footed by the sudden notification, so much so that I was barely able to respond to Titania’s lingering kiss before she collapsed unconscious against my chest, her breathing soft and content. I could have slid underneath her, or started walking around the cave to gather my thoughts, to theorize about the source, but I chose to continue lying underneath her lithe body instead, my half-erect shaft still inside her. If I was going to spend some time theorizing about the sudden new challenge, I was going to do that through a delicious distraction. </p><p>Not to mention maintaining contact might give me some clues. </p><p>Even with the euphoria I was feeling after that spectacular explosion, I couldn’t help but be stressed. The notification of my special ability being countered was never a good sign, but the fact that it happened with Titania was even worse. She was the strongest and most influential person I got in contact with by far, and she represented real risk for me. I was feeling comfortable due to her cute shyness and other reactions, but that was before realizing she had a skill that interfered with mine. </p><p>I decided to experiment once more. I leaned in for a soft kiss, slipping a sliver of mana inside her, but this time. Even in her sleep, she moaned softly as she sucked my tongue, eagerly allowing my mana into her body. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>[-13 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>However, this time, I did things differently. Instead of letting go of the control of the mana, allowing her to absorb it easily, I maintained the control, letting it slip inside her. </p><p>I was rewarded with an incredible finding. I could suddenly feel a familiar yet foreign presence of power throbbing inside her. I hadn’t had to turn inward to check the source of the familiarity. It was the source of her power, the core of the system. It was hard to describe, of course, like a blind person trying to describe a dragon after a brief touch. Still, like a blind person feeling the majesty and danger of the dragon by just a touch, I could feel the majesty of her power, dwarfing my current status by a huge margin. </p><p>Then, my mana disappeared, so I decided to lean in and give her another kiss for another dose of mana, to understand her power. Luckily, my mana regeneration was still active, even though I was counting the remaining time in minutes rather than hours. From the earlier experience, it was almost enough to fill my mana pool twice before expiry.</p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>[-16 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>The second impression I got about her power was marginally clearer. Some parts, I was able to recognize, such as Charisma and Wisdom. I even managed to identify her arcana skill, though the rest was hard to understand. The real clincher, however, was a thick web of white energy spreading over her power core, like it dominated all others. I let my mana touch it, only for my mana to disappear in an instant, absorbed into the web. </p><p>It was the same light magic she had been using in the battle. </p><p>Suddenly, a sudden inspiration clicked in my mind, proving the usefulness of my extraordinary wisdom and intelligence. I doubted that I would’ve made the connection that quickly otherwise. Some of the older books I have been reading to discover the root of my powers had snippets and footnotes referring to some metaphysical concepts like actual presences, describing them a bit more holistically than necessary, even giving them personalities and traits like they were real beings, like skills and stats had personalities once upon a time. It was not something I took note of at the time. </p><p>The stories and footnotes were by no means comprehensive, but I remembered it talking about the Light like it was pure, but also emotionless and unyielding, driven by logic and perception of justice more than anything, not to mention aloof and hard to connect to. It didn’t describe the Titania that blushed with just a fleeting kiss. But it described the peerless head librarian that scared everyone, who worked and lived for her duty. </p><p>The difference, her mana depletion. </p><p>Once I realized that, it was so clear, especially with the learnings I gathered from my diagnosis. For whatever reason, Light Magic wasn’t working like just another skill but affecting her mind, state and thoughts, as well as blocking out her emotions. I didn’t know whether it was something unique to her or it would happen to anyone that would take that skill, but regardless, it forced me to change my plans significantly. </p><p>Suddenly, I was very glad about not taking that particular skill. </p><p>Of course, while considering all those points, I was still inside her, smoothly going back and forth, enjoying her tightness just in case I never had the opportunity to in the future. And even while she was comatose because of exhaustion, her grip was spectacular, and her moans were beautiful. And since I needed one last diagnostic before making a plan, I decided to use the opportunity to my benefit. I continued pumping until I was ready to climax, and then filled her insides once more, using the moment to deliver a burst of mana as well. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 12%] Progress Blocked! </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[-120 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>Once again, I maintained the contact with my mana, the abundance of it allowing me to observe the changes in her power much clearer. But in the core of it, I could see something familiar trying to change, only to be suppressed by the cage of light. Something that carried a piece of me. </p><p>I was willing to bet everything that it represented the Companion process. I decided to experiment and flooded all the mana I could still control towards it, smashing the cage of light around it with all my might. It cost all of my mana, but it managed to make a crack in it, a crack that the Companion energy expanded just a bit more.</p><p>[Ability Countered!]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 13%]</p><p>[Achievement: Rattling the Rival.

The rewards were incredible, of that there was no doubt. Two points across all stats was an incredible benefit, and even at my current status, ten thousand points of experience was nothing to scoff at. </p><p>But it was nothing compared to the description. Until now, achievements were always amusing, sometimes mildly informative, such as the second-biggest library. However, the last one I received came completely unexpected. The rival thing was confusing enough, as even if I squinted badly, I wouldn’t exactly put my budding relationship with Titania rivalry. However, the real kicker was the eons-old rival part. I was fairly certain that two decades didn’t count as an eon. </p><p>It was a very intriguing —and potentially dangerous— mystery considering the spottiness of historical records, which tends to happen when cities and civilizations fall under monster hordes in a surprising frequency. Still I decided to shelve that for the moment, as no matter how intriguing, I had more immediate concerns to address. </p><p>Such as the beautiful girl currently on my lap sleeping, or the skill selection from the level up. Though, the latter part was relatively obvious. I just chose Tantric, as it was not only immediately useful, but also it had implications I wanted to explore. Not to mention avoiding Light Magic for the moment was the prudent choice. </p><p>The next half an hour passed in a relative calmness, though it required my utmost concentration. I was still inside her, sliding in and out repeatedly while also kissing her, injecting small charges of mana, trying to understand how best to slow down or destroy the encroachment of the Light into her mind and soul. I spent quite a bit of mana, but luckily, with my regeneration still active —with less than five minutes remaining on the clock— I still managed to recover my mana to near-full levels. </p><p>During that, however, I used my new Tantric skill to great effect, earning experience as well as improving my control on transferred mana. </p><p>[+4000 Experience]</p><p>[-420 Mana]</p><p>[+25 Tantric] </p><p>I decided to wake her up, and wake her up with style, even though it was risky with the Light magic spreading in her despite my best efforts —while not waking her up, making it much more challenging. “Good morning, sleeping beauty,” I cheered even as I used my biomancy skills to gently wake her up, not wanting her to feel groggy. It worked better than the best coffee, her gray eyes shining bright, but her expression was cold, showing that the suppression effect was working greatly. </p><p>The confusion on her face was annoying, but also beautiful. It was clear that she was trying to process what had happened, but through her logical, emotionless perspective. Her first activity was trying to pull herself away from me. I decided to make it even harder for her, and captured her lips in a searing kiss, also dropping a lot of mana with my kiss, something made easier thanks to Advanced Tantric, giving me a much better control over externalized mana. </p><p>[-80 Mana]</p><p>The shock on her face was beautiful, and her attempts to pull back choppy and reluctant, the rush of pleasure enhanced by the mana flow enough to affect even her emotionless state. Only after a minute of kissing, did I pull back, leaving her panting and confused, but my arms were still around her, preventing her escape. </p><p>“What are you doing!” she gasped, her hand raised threateningly like she was about to cast a spell. On the surface, her anger was apparent, but I knew that it was driven by her confusion. Thanks to my interference, she was still feeling something, but unlike before, Light Magic prevented her from processing it properly. Or at least, that was my best guess. </p><p>“I’m helping you recover your mana,” I said calmly, my subterfuge skill once again showing its worth. Before she could say anything, I continued. “We need to move, and my enhanced mana regeneration is about to expire. It’s for the best if I use the last moments of it in order to increase your mana, in case we come across hostiles. It’s simply logical.”</p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured, her tone cold, but her eyes shrouded with emotion. “That’s a very reasonable course of action. Give me your finger,” she said. </p><p>“Don’t you remember, we discovered that the finger is a subpar way of delivering mana, and found out a much better way,” I said, doing my best to look calm and collected, but keeping back that smirk was a difficult challenge. “The other way is physically more challenging, but considering the circumstances, it’s a worthy trade-off.” </p><p>“But-” she started, a small blush spreading on her face, proving that the interference I had been running while she slept was not wasted. She wasn’t too far gone into the emotionless space. </p><p>Her words would remain unfinished, because I slammed my lips against hers, silencing her the best way I could. And when I pushed my shaft deeper into her once again, I managed to extract a beautiful moan from her despite her reluctance. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 13%] Progress Blocked! </p><p>The notification annoyed me, especially since I was afraid that she would realize my fight against her Light Magic. I needed to distract her further. </p><p>Luckily, my experiences since my initial discovery gave me an impressive library of actions I could use to distract her. I decided to start with something simple, I flipped our positions so she was laying underneath me, my impressive frame hovering above her as I slammed in as deep as possible, earning another moan. </p><p>She looked at me with her confused gaze, desire battling with cold logic. Regardless of that, she looked far too aware of herself. So, I decided to carry things to the next level. Previously, she experienced calm and comfortable sex. Now, it was time to introduce her to pure fucking. </p><p>I grabbed her legs, and before she could react, put them on my shoulders and leaned forward, forcing her to bend in a very uncomfortable angle. An angle that gave me a perfect angle to impale her tunnel. I took the chance, and slammed inside her mercilessly. </p><p>What followed was pure drilling. I slammed inside her again and again. I kissed her repeatedly to inject mana, but even those carried no hint of tenderness, but pure domination. I used the opportunity to dump mana into her, but just maintained contact. It wasn’t time to take action yet. </p><p>[-300 Mana]</p><p>[+1500 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 13%] Progress Blocked! </p><p>I was annoyed with the repeated reminders of the progress stalling. Luckily, she was rapidly approaching towards a climax under the unfamiliar sensations, giving me the excuse I needed. We orgasmed at the same time, her juices mixing with mine, as well as a flood of my mana, enough to massacre a small army if applied differently. </p><p>[-850 Mana]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Ability Countered!]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 15%]</p><p>I could feel her Light Magic desperately trying to reestablish its control, but with her lack of mana, it didn’t have a fighting chance. The defense around her companion core was shattered completely, giving us a chance to establish a proper connection. </p><p>Since herthe emotions were back in the game, I decided to shift back to being gentleness as well. I pulled out for a moment, letting her legs fall back to the floor. Then, without wasting a second more than necessary, I thenook continued loving her in the missionary position, our lips linked together, except for the occasions I pulled back to whisper heated compliments into her ear, something that triggered her as much as the calm and long beats of my shaft invading her again and again. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 18%]</p><p>“It feels so good,” she moaned, as she went through yet another orgasm. “How come I never tried thisit before!” she added wistfully, her sentiment also proving that she wasn’t exactly aware of the emotional restriction her magic was forcing on her. Luckily for her, I was more than willing to shatter those imaginary cuffs, freeing her from her torture. And if I was going to replace those cold cuffs with velvet ones, well, that was a fair exchange for her. </p><p>Our tender lovemaking lasted another half an hour as she slowly absorbed my mana. I would have liked to stay in the cave all night long, exploring the details of our new relationship, but unfortunately, there were two things that made it a bad idea. The first one, were we needed to return to the school before her enemies decided to take action in her absence. Luckily, it wasn’t yet the nightfall, and even necromancers wouldn’t be stupid enough to act while everyone was around. The second, my mana regeneration perk hadwas finally expired, making it harder for me to refill her mana while being able to use mine. </p><p>[-400 Mana]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 23%]</p><p>I could have pushed forward a bit more, at least to the point that I reached the first milestone of the Companion process, but I refrained, not wanting to add yet another explanation to an already-confusing situation. “We need to return to the school,” I whispered as I pulled out of her, not bothering to hide my regret. </p><p>“Yes, we do,” she agreed, looking no less enthusiastic about it. “My mana is recovered enough to be able to B avoid an ambush, and I need to be in my library before they try anything else.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” I said, then added another thing, no matter how much I didn’t want to. “I think we need to return separately, just to make sure they don’t identify me,” I added, no matter how much I wanted to hang around her, maybe even catching a quickie on the road before the Light Magic turned her cold once more. </p><p>“I agree,” she said with a nod even as she sat up, making no effort to hide her naked body, covered with my markings. “For now, they don’t know who you are and where did you came from, and your skill set is diverse enough to make it impossible for them to pin your origin,” she added. “So impossible that I still don’t have an idea,” she added with a bitter tone. </p><p>I leaned in to steal a soft, lingering kiss. “Don’t worry, we’re going to speak more about it,” I answered. “Make sure you rest for tonight. Tomorrow night, I”m going to visit you in your room and we’re going to have a real talk without immediate danger.” </p><p>After a lingering kiss, I quickly dressed, and after one last kiss, I left Titania behind, naked. I didn’t worry about her, because with her mana back and without an extensive ambush prepared, it was impossible for them to hurt her, at least. And if they did, my presence wouldn’t be enough to change anything. </p><p>With a sigh, I dashed away, though only after ten minutes of frantic running did I remembered the book in my bag. The book that was stolen from her, the one that started everything. I shrugged. I could always give her that back tomorrow, and maybe even use the opportunity to delve deeper in its secrets. Even if it was in a different language, there was a chance I could get some snippets about its source. </p><p>The last achievement spooked me a bit. I was in a mystery deeper than I first assumed.

    "content": "<p>Her reaction to my proclamation was a thing of wonder. A beautiful expression of confusion spread on her face, enhanced further by the blush that turned her alabaster skin to red. She wiggled uncomfortably, but made no attempt to pull away from her comfortable position of leaning against my chest. </p><p>Her innocent yet accepting reaction made her impossible to resist even without considering the fact she was the impeccable head librarian, one of the deadliest mages in the country, her name enough to make her foes tremble. And now, she was trying to ignore her own reaction as I pulled her on my lap. She shivered, her shyness obvious, but that didn’t prevent her from wiggling on top of my shaft, trying to get comfortable. </p><p>A little bribe for her tantalizing obedience was in order, I decided even as I put my finger to her mouth once more, but this time, rather than sliding it directly, I lingered on her lips, tracing the edges even as her mouth opened helplessly, a gasp escaping her mouth. She moved her lips, trying to catch it, but I moved my finger before she could, earning a frustrated growl, enough to make me chuckle. I let my finger slide into her mouth and let my mana flow once more. </p><p>[-55 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>I was happy with the rapid development of my new skill, even though I had doubts about its usefulness. But I wasn’t asshole enough to focus on long term goals when I had a fragile brunette on my lap whose work life and ambitions blinded her to the true pleasures of life. </p><p>So, while she was distracted, I discarded the washcloth, and let my other hand free on her body. I wanted to delve deep into her breasts, but for her first time, she deserved a more considerate treatment. Instead, I let my fingers drift on her stomach, caressing it with gentle, fleeting touches. Already charged with our earlier play, that was enough to trigger a moan from her, muffled due to my finger in her mouth. I wasn’t letting any more mana out —I wanted to regenerate more in case we had another ambush— but she continued to suck it with the same enthusiasm, making my imagination work overtime about other things she might enjoy sucking. </p><p>“It feels … different,” she murmured as I let my hand climb upward, dancing on the bottom of her naked breasts, ideas such as modesty and personal space long forgotten. I reached for her breasts, which, while smaller than what I had been enjoying thanks to Marianne, Helga, and Aviada, were still beautiful in their perkiness and perfect shape. And the way her nipples stiffened at my touch was more than enough to address the deficiency in size. </p><p>She was beautiful. And the fact that she was several times stronger than me just made the moment even more exciting. </p><p>I wanted to speak, to tease her about her new experience, but when I saw her eyes closed in an effort to contain the new sensations, I decided to take it a different way. I gently traced her nipple, earning another moan in the process, before letting my fingers dance over her body. </p><p>[+400 Experience]</p><p>My finger wasn’t in her mouth anymore, which allowed me to continue caressing her nipples even as my other hand moved down in a determined journey until it ended around her panties. I thought about sliding in her panties, then I decided to pull them off completely, leaving her naked for my view. She gasped cutely as I dragged them down her toned legs, but gave no resistance. I couldn’t help but feel excited at the sight of her most sensitive location, cleanly shaved despite her lack of experience. </p><p>“So, let me teach you how to masturbate,” I whispered into her ear even as my fingers gave a cursory caress to her lower lips before focusing on her inner thighs, massaging her slowly but sensuously. </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured dreamily, but from her tone, I could easily see that she was not in a mood to listen, so rather than speaking, I decided to teach her by example. As my fingers started their determined dance on her thighs, however, she moaned once more. “Faster,” she begged. </p><p>Normally, I would have stretched the moment, torturing my partner deliciously with a bit of delayed pleasure, but I decided to make an exception for Titania. Not experiencing arousal for decades was a true tragedy, something I knew intimately from my own fate. If I could enlighten someone else on the subject while enjoying the moment, I would never say no to it. So, I let my fingers move to the hot zone, enjoying the way her wetness coated my fingers. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>“It feels amazing!” she moaned loudly. </p><p>“Of course it does, but you haven’t seen anything yet,” I said to her even as my fingers started moving, her enjoyment displayed by a string of moans that left her mouth. She was truly delicious. I decided to push the boundaries even more. “By the way, I would like to try an alternative mana conducting method, if you’re okay with it,” I asked her. Her response was an absentminded nod, followed by another moan. She wasn’t in a state to really comment on it, barely understanding the significance of my question. </p><p>So, she froze when I pressed my lips against hers, cutting off another moan halfway. I kissed her softly, even as I let my mana flow from my body to hers, in a soft, lingering kiss. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>[-128 Mana]</p><p>[+4 Tantric]</p><p>Mana transfer was a silly excuse to kiss her, so I was surprised when I actually felt it flowing much smoother. I didn’t need to ask her about the efficiency, as by now, I was familiar enough with the mana flow to realize mouth-to-mouth transfer was highly superior to delivering it through my finger. Of course, that brought up another question, whether a full-blown sexual delivery would have been even more efficient. I didn’t know, but it was definitely a worthy —and potentially very enjoyable— test. </p><p>That was for later, however, as there were more immediate concerns that deserved my attention, such as the way Titania was wiggling on my lap even as she neared the first orgasm of her life, the distance between her muffled moans dwindling even further. So, when I finally slipped a finger into her entrance, it wasn’t shocking for her to start trembling helplessly as she was struck by her orgasm. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>I slid my hands to her stomach, gently caressing her as she tried to process the pleasure, while I maintained a lingering kiss. “How was it?” I asked after a minute. </p><p>“It was amazing!” she said excitedly. “I have never thought that it would’ve been that enjoyable. I missed a lot of time.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s not too late, you’re definitely beautiful enough to compensate for the lost time and if you want I’m always ready to help.”</p><p>“Really?” she asked, looking between excited and shocked. </p><p>“Of course, that was my pleasure,” I answered. Then, I decided to push her a bit. “May I ask you a personal question?” I said, and she nodded shyly. “You said you’ve never even masturbated? Is there a reason for it? Weren’t you at least tempted to it?” </p><p>“I don’t know. Learning to use Light Magic took a lot of effort from me when I was young. I guess I never had the time or the inclination,” she murmured, which admittedly, confused me a little. She seemed honest in her response, making it a bit of a mystery. Not doing it because of external pressure or some other reason might have been understandable, but not feeling the inclination for it was weird. It would have made sense if she was asexual, but from what I had seen in the last half an hour, she most definitely was a sexual being, though quite deprived. “Is it always that enjoyable?” she asked in a small tone. </p><p>“No,” I answered, and her shy smile turned into a frown, but before she could say anything else, I continued. “What we have done was just a preview. The real thing is much better than that.” </p><p>“Really, how’s that possible?” she asked, shocked. </p><p>“That’s just how it goes,” I answered, even as I let my hands on her stomach start moving once more, climbing toward her breasts, caressing the edge sensually, something that made her moan. “This was just a prelude. The real thing is something special, even earth-shattering,” I said then suddenly caught her eyes with a wide, smug smirk. “If delivered by a person that knows what he’s doing, of course,” I added. </p><p>She smirked back, though it still had a shy edge to it. “And the next thing you’re going to say is that you know what you’re doing.” </p><p>“Well, I’m not one to brag but you can say that I have some minor accomplishments in the subject,“ I said even as I let my other hand slip down to her entrance, circling around her clit to force a moan out of her. “As you can attest…” </p><p>“Bastard,” she murmured, yet feeling much more comfortable in my arms than before. I said nothing, but let my fingers dance at her entrance slowly, enough to arouse her, but not enough to build her toward another climax. The silence stretched for a while. Well, not exactly silence as her moans rang in the cave in an exciting frequency. </p><p>Then, she spoke once more. “Maybe we should explore the alternative ways of mana delivery,” she whispered. </p><p>Since my blood was mostly in the lower half of my body, it took a moment for me to understand what she was saying. “Of course,” I stammered, excited, not expecting her to actually take the recommendation that easily. “It’s our responsibility as magical researchers,” I said, though as I said that, I made sure to lean towards her ear, delivering it through a husky whisper. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she raised her bottom a bit, enough to pull my pants down. She might not be as strong as me, but she was strong enough to almost rip my pants as she pulled them down, quite excited. She was about to lay on her back, but I gestured for her to stop before laying on my back. “Why don’t you take the seat of honor, Miss Head Librarian,” I said as I smiled in amusement, even though my heartbeat rose significantly. Inviting one of the most dangerous women known to mankind to ride you in a cowgirl position was a rather dangerous thing, after all. </p><p>Luckily, she lacked the mana to take offense, and more importantly, her blush and her excited smile weren’t exactly signs of uncontrollable anger. Her legs were trembling as she hovered above me, feeling excited at the prospect. She closed in before turning her back, lowering herself toward my shaft, but I stopped her just as her entrance kissed the crown of my shaft. “What’s wrong?” she whispered, her fear palpable. </p><p>“I want you to turn around. I want to get lost in your beautiful gray eyes as we do it,” I said. She turned at me, hesitant and shy. “For the safety of the experiment, of course,” I continued mockingly. “I need to watch your expression in case something goes wrong.” </p><p>“I see,” she whispered even as she turned to face me, once again giving me a full-frontal view of her beautiful, tight body, making my shaft throb in anticipation. “It’s good to see you’re careful about the experiment,” she added, trying to replicate my mocking edge, but unable to suppress her innocent excitement.   </p><p>Then, she lowered herself, slowly engulfing me within her hot grasp. She staggered a moment when I felt the pressure of her barrier, but she didn’t let it delay her for more than a moment, getting rid of it with a stiff push, not even bothering to stop to adapt. Not surprising, considering her prowess, a little bit of pain wasn’t going to stop her from what she desired. However, as she sank lower, her speed slowed down, while her expression twisted in joy and desire. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 1%]</p><p>I was happy to see the companion tracker ticking once again, though I was not exactly surprised. After all, not only had I saved her from a deadly ambush, but also come up with a totally new way of mana transfer just to cure her deficiency easier. It would have been surprising if she wasn’t feeling a connection with me. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she murmured as she stilled, giving a pause to her task of devouring my full length. I let her move up and down at her own pace, letting her enjoy the experience before I took control. She rose up until only the crown was enveloped in her warmth, before she moved down with a torturous slowness, only to stop when she reached the previous point. </p><p>“You’re beautiful,” I whispered even as I maintained eye contact, doing my best to display my sincerity. It was not a hard task, not when her beautiful body lay in front of me in its spectacular full-frontal nudity while she did her best to make my shaft disappear from view despite her discomfort, her beautiful face contorted with pleasure. </p><p>Her sudden tightening was a nice surprise. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 3%]</p><p>“Really?” she gasped, surprised, like she had heard it for the first time. </p><p>I was about to dismiss that as a ridiculous notion before I remembered that the raven-haired beauty in front of me was also the most intimidating person around back in the school. Even without adding in her unflattering clothes and steely expression there, I doubted that many had the courage to openly flirt with her. </p><p>It was a travesty that needed to be corrected, I decided. “Yes, you are,” I said. “The way your raven hair sticks to your glowing face, the way your beautiful lips shine under the flickering lights, the way your eyes sparkle in joy, every part of you is beautiful,” I whispered throatily even as I reached up and put my hands on her body, caressing her sides in a gentleness that wouldn’t go amiss in a marital bed. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 7%]</p><p>“Tell me more,” she gasped, her tone indicating that she was already halfway to orgasm. </p><p>“The way you walk is spectacular,” I whispered. “Scary and intimidating, but it still makes me want to pull you into an abandoned part of the library before I rip your clothes off to see what’s underneath…” </p><p>Her pacing picked up speed, every repeat forcing my shaft deeper into her core. She didn’t look entirely comfortable with the amount she took, but if she wanted to push her limits, who was I to argue. “And, do you like what’s underneath my clothes?” she gasped even as she looked into my eyes, though despite her willpower, she was barely able to maintain eye contact. </p><p>“Oh, did I?” I whispered. “I found a treasure trove above and beyond even my admittedly ambitious dreams. Your shoulders are beautiful enough to breathe life to a dead man, your stomach smooth enough to make me lay on it forever, enjoying its surface,” I said with a throaty whisper, making her shiver at each word. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 10%]</p><p>“Tell me more,” she gasped even as she picked up speed, rocking her hips recklessly, unaware of the danger that was building up inside me. </p><p>“Of course,” I said. “Your breasts are more perfect than a seven node array balanced to trigger,” I whispered, letting some magical theory into our flirting, curious of the effect. It was a nice surprise when she tightened even further, proving that her librarian role was not just for show. “Your hips are beautiful, sculpted to perfection, and your pussy…” I said, lingering a bit before letting out a moan. “Oh, your pussy is the greatest sensation I have ever felt in my life…” I added. </p><p>[Achievement: Seductive Sonnet.

    "content": "<p>When we started walking once more, I couldn’t help but wish for a monotonous journey, even though I knew that with two sexy women who were using me a target to prove their dominance, it was fairly impossible. The fact that I was using actual lightning to torture myself as I walked in an effort to control my magic was just made the situation weirder. </p><p>Continuously using magic was a risky affair even when I tried to keep it low key, risking detection, but still, it was better than facing the enemies without adequate control on my magic. I was lucky not to have a credible threat as I tried to came into terms with my new power as a Sorcerer. Shapeless elemental bursts were good enough to fight against the raiders and tribals, but they wouldn’t work against a skilled mage, who could easily twist even reverse such an assault if prepared. </p><p>After my display against the raiders, I had no doubt that any mage we would face would have been briefed about my style of combat, and with appropriate preparations. I needed my flexibility back to fight against them. </p><p>Of course, the tempering exercises were quite an attention-grabbing, so during the next stop, Astrid was curious as she drifted to my side after casting yet another spell to remove our tracks and implant false tracks. Her magical ability wasn’t exactly impressive, but her spells were rather effective under the circumstances. So, when she decided to gather the courage to ask about my exercises, I decided to be honest, for a given value of it. </p><p>“I’m trying to regain control of my magic after using a dangerous spell,” I explained succinctly even as sat on a nearby stump, giving her the same story I told Lillian. It told them what they needed without revealing my own secrets. </p><p>“What do you mean you’re trying to regain control?” Astrid asked, shocked. </p><p>Lillian smirked at her shock, and interjected before I could answer. “Don’t tell me that you thought he’s limited to that pathetic bursts of elements. How insulting,” Lillian said gloatingly as she closed in, enjoying Astrid’s angry glare. She must have enjoyed the rise, because she decided to push the envelope by sitting on my lap, hugging me intimately, in a way that sent my shaft into the full mast, something she noticed if her satisfied smirk was any indicator. “Marcus is a master of magic, as he should be to deserve being my man.” </p><p>I chuckled at her proclamation, positioning me somewhere between a boyfriend and husband. Still, seeing Astrid’s anger, I decided to put a lid on the discussion. “Be nice, sweetie,” I said even as I slapped her bottom playfully, but still hard enough to make a hard crack, making her gasp. “To answer your question, Astrid, yes, my specialization is runes and enhancements, but as you have seen, I’m not half-bad at combat magic as well.” </p><p>“How?” she stammered. “Is every noble mage as strong as you? No wonder we were getting destroyed in every battle.” </p><p>Lillian looked like she was about to deliver a scathing answer, so I decided to warn her by squeezing her ass, making her squawk beautifully. “Not even close,” Lillian admitted after my warning. “Marcus is special.” </p><p>“How special?” Astrid asked, curious despite her jealousy, trying to better understand the circumstances she found herself in. </p><p>Lillian looked at me, and I nodded, giving her permission to speak about my power. It wasn’t a difficult decision, as Lillian didn’t know the true depth of my power as well, so there was no great risk even if Astrid was captured and forced to reveal my secrets. “He’s definitely the strongest one in our graduating class,” Lillian said, and Astrid looked a bit lost, lacking the frame of reference to understand the significance of it. “He can probably defeat the next three students combined without too big of trouble,” she added. </p><p>This time, Astrid nodded, even as she looked at me in a renewed fascination. After all, it was a comparison she could easily understand. Even in the tribe, a warrior needed to be truly spectacular to defeat three other warriors at the same time. Admittedly, with my recent boost, I believed that I could fight against a dozen of them and still be the winner. My so-called classmates were strong and reasonably skilled, but they lacked the experience to truly stand against me. </p><p>“We need to move,” I said, no matter how much I enjoyed Lillian on my lap or the renewed worship in Astrid’s gaze examining me like a particularly tasty cut of meat. </p><p>“So soon,” Lillian asked with a playful pout. I would have admonished her, but she chose that moment to wiggle her tight bottom, making me come alive with desire. </p><p>I was tempted to extend the break to teach her about the dangerous waters she was wading, but the reality of the situation intruded. “We needed to cover more ground and find a good camping spot before the nightfall,” I explained. “We can’t take the risk of walking around in the dark.” </p><p>“Danger from the wildlife?” Lillian asked, but I shook my head. </p><p>“We don’t want to miss our tracks in the darkness,” Astrid cut in, and when I nodded, she sent a satisfied smirk at Lillian. “Let’s move,” she said. </p><p>“Yeah, let’s move,” Lillian agreed, but rather than standing up, she twirled at my lap until she was straddling me, her miniskirt not helping to reduce the impact of her move. Once again, she captured my lips in a heated kiss, her tongue swirling in my mouth, her hips moving back and forth. I let her do it, as her lips were too delicious to push away, and her hips were giving me jolts of pleasure. </p><p>Astrid coughed pointedly, but Lillian kept kissing me until she repeated it. “We need to move,” she said testily, the jealousy clear in her eyes. </p><p>“Sorry,” Lillian said with an insincere tone. “I needed some distraction before another few hours of monotone walk.” </p><p>“Then do something useful,” Astrid said angrily. </p><p>Lillian looked ready to join the argument, but before she could do so, I slapped her bottom playfully. “Behave,” I said. Lillian frowned while Astrid opened her mouth to gloat, only to receive the same treatment. “Behave,” I repeated as I slapped her bottom, making sure that my hand lingered there for a moment. </p><p>This time, Lillian glared at me, while Astrid was too busy blushing in an effort to match her skin color to her fiery hair. I just chuckled before gesturing them to move. Astrid turned silently, while Lillian huffed angrily, but their hips were swaying noticeably as they walked away, tempting me to stop the walk to test their envy in a more interesting setting. </p><p>Pity that I had real priorities to focus on. Once again, I continued tempering myself, but this time, rather than using the lightning trick, I forced my magic to flow along my body, forcing it to circulate around my body. It wasn’t the best tempering exercise. It had questionable effectiveness and it was wasteful. But it had a big advantage, it didn’t have an upper bound to handle. Considering that I lacked Sorcerer-tier techniques to temper my control, that was my best option, even if it was a bit wasteful. </p><p>For the next hour, I didn’t pay much attention to my surroundings, focusing more on the way my mana was circulating around my body, so I was rather startled when I felt a sudden mana fluctuation close by. Without even thinking about it, I forced my mana outward, suffocating the area, making the spell disappear. </p><p>It was a reflexive move that took a chunk of my mana, but the results were spectacular. When I raised my gaze, I was met with Lillian and Astrid facing each other, their hands raised like they were about to cast a spell, but there was no mana in their hands. And it was not intentional, considering the shock they were showing. </p><p>Still, even with their shock, it was a nice sight, because it was clear from the evidence that they had been fighting even before they tried to use magic, something I had managed to miss in my inward focus. “Look at me,” I ordered them, though I couldn’t feel too annoyed at their childish display. Not when their clothes were the only casualty. Lillian’s top was relatively intact, though a large gash went through the side, giving a familiar glimpse into her spectacular breasts. </p><p>Astrid’s top, on the other hand, was already in pieces, exposing her beautiful nipples to the air. I wasn’t surprised, as her top was barely up to the task of containing her spectacular breasts, and under Lillian’s assault, I wasn’t surprised that it fell into pieces. I couldn’t help but lock on them, enjoying the curves, imagining the feeling of sinking my fingers into their huge expanse. </p><p>The girls weren’t stupid, and I wasn’t exactly trying to be discreet, so they easily realized my focus. Their reactions differed, however. Astrid blushed, but didn’t neglect to send a satisfied smirk at Lillian. Lillian, on the other hand, was bouncing her angry glare between us, unable to decide who to focus. </p><p>“What’s going on here,” I asked several seconds later. </p><p>“She’s being a stupid bitch,” Astrid said at the same time Lillian insulted her being stupid, before things rapidly devolved into another catfight, though this time it stayed limited to their words. From their fight, I understood that the subject was when to take a break, but they chose that moment to flex their authority to establish their pecking order. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I watched two deadly women devolve into a schoolyard scuffle, especially when they once again resorted to physical. This time, Astrid’s top lost the last semblance of coherence while Lillian’s skirt suffered a similar fate, leaving her in deficient underwear. But when they started casting, I decided to interject. </p><p>I decided to try the earlier trick, I forced out a generous amount of mana, forcing it to blanket my immediate surroundings, once again their spells falling apart. They turned to me, this time, the significance of my new trick. “How?” they stammered simultaneously. </p><p>“Just a small trick. Think of it as a stiff wind, extinguishing the fire before it had a chance of getting started.” Lillian looked like she had followed up questions, but I decided to cut her off. “We can talk about that later. I want to focus on the childish display you two put together,” I said, trying to sound stern, which was a difficult task to do while enjoying the sight of their mostly-naked bodies, making my pants very tight. </p><p>“But-” Lillian started, but I silenced her by once again letting my presence outward, this time using it to convey a sense of pressure. They stiffened in panic, but I was sure that fear wasn’t the only emotion they were fearing, not with Astrid’s suddenly stiff nipples and the small damp spot that appeared on Lillian’s panties. </p><p>“No argument,” I said even I looked for a nearby seat, but seeing nothing, slammed my foot on the ground, forcing a well-crafted earthen seat to rise from the floor, showing I was getting my control back. Of course, the smooth display of magic impressed them quite a bit as well. “Come here, Lillian,” I ordered her as I took a seat. She walked, though her steps were slow, I was familiar enough with her to know that her hesitancy was fake, and her sway was too controlled for someone afraid of her situation. </p><p>Maybe I needed to teach her not to be too dismissive of my threats. </p><p>I decided to go to a more traditional route, especially since with Astrid here, I doubt that she would be arguing too hard, afraid of losing her position to the redheaded bombshell. It was an opportunity to teach her a lesson, I decided. I patted my lap. “Lay down,” I said. </p><p>“W-what?” she stammered, her smirk disappearing as she realized the implications. </p><p>I fixed her with a glare, and a dose of magic. “If you’re going to act like a child, you’re going to be treated like a child! Now, lay down,” I ordered, for once tapping into the sense of domineering presence given to me by the dragon’s heart. Lillian folded instantly, throwing herself onto my lap. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said, patting her head nicely, which made her smile despite the circumstances, though that wasn’t long-lived, because I followed that pat with a hard spank, extracting a cry from her. </p><p>“It hurts,” she said in protest, only to receive another stiff spank. </p><p>“It’s supposed to,” I explained calmly as I landed the third one, making her delicious ass glow brightly. “And that’s the third of twenty.” </p><p>“Twenty-” she tried to complain, only to receive another one. </p><p>“Now, twenty-five,” I said even as I spanked her again, but this time, letting my hand linger on her bottom, enjoying her ass. She opened her mouth to argue. “Do you want it to be thirty?” I said, and that silenced her, a petulant expression on her face. I turned my gaze to Astrid, who was watching the situation with a great shock. I winked at her, and she smiled back. Amusingly, at the shocking sight, she had forgotten the absence of a top, her tits free for my viewing pleasure, her nipples rock hard. </p><p>How I wished to slide my shaft in that glorious white valley between her mounds. </p><p>I turned my attention back to Lillian, even as I landed the tenth one, straining Lillian’s stubborn determination to keep silent. She was biting her lips desperately to keep herself from crying, but her limits were reaching. A couple more, and her silence was broken by a pained cry. I decided to help her a bit, so rather than spanking her immediately, I let my fingers caress her bottom gently, making her gasp softly. </p><p>“Is the massage better, or do you want me to finish it quickly?” I asked even as I spanked once more, followed by more caressing. Though, I know that it was a trivial question, because I could feel her wetness in my fingers. She was gushing freely, her arousal almost a physical entity. </p><p>“Massage is better,” she admitted immediately, her eyes closed, forgetting the presence of Astrid. Astrid looked like she was about to comment, but a warning glare from me was enough to silence her. I didn’t want the moment to be broken. </p><p>“Okay, but only good girls get the massage. You promise to be a good girl, right?” </p><p>“Of course, Marcus. I’ll be a good girl, following your orders obediently. I promise!” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I pulled my hand away from her bottom, but this time, rather than spanking her immediately, I pulled her panties down, leaving her ass bare. When I caressed her naked skin, she shuddered helplessly, following with a moan when my fingers finally connected with her nether lips. It was a soft, fleeting contact, but it still worked perfectly as a trigger after such a lengthy spanking session. </p><p>The next spank was much softer, as with her obedience assured at least momentarily, it was the time for the reward. After the spank, my fingers once again drifted toward her wetness, this time lingering much longer, enough to turn her moans into a string. Another spank, followed by an even lengthier fingering session where I drifted toward her knob, enjoying the way she shuddered. Even when my fingers slipped inside a bit, her only reaction was to moan louder. </p><p>At that point, I once again turned my attention to Astrid, who was watching the happening with a hypnotized expression, her earlier amusement replaced by shocked arousal. Her nipples were hard enough to cut the rock, her pouty lips slightly parted, begging for me to slide my shaft inside to test her throat. </p><p>Maybe after I was finished with Lillian. </p><p>It was far too soon when I reached for the promised twenty-fifth spank on Lillian’s bottom. On the positive side, at this point, I didn’t really need an excuse —even a transparent one— to touch her. I let my fingers free, two of them sliding in and out of her entrance, though careful not to risk her virginity, while my thumb was dancing on her knob, slowly but inevitably pushing her toward an explosive climax. And since I wanted to play with Astrid without her interaction, I deliberately extended the treatment, making sure she didn’t come too early, even with all her begging. </p><p>So, when it finally came, she simply collapsed into a trembling mess. She moaned softly as her eyes closed, saying nothing as I slid her panties back. It wasn’t just the after-effects of her climax, however, no matter how much my male pride wanted to believe that. The journey was much more than her endurance could handle, even without the other factors like our aggressive foreplay the night before or the exhausting boat trip. </p><p>Astrid proved her intelligence and common sense by saying nothing while I dressed Lillian and lay her a few feet away, close enough to be protected in case of danger. </p><p>Then, I turned to Astrid. “Are you ready for your punishment,” I said in a dark, no-nonsense tone. </p><p>The way her chest heaved as I walked toward her was answer enough… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Seduction was a delicate affair, especially with a target as confusing as Sabrina, showing an impeccable marriage of contradictions. On one way, she was cold and dangerous, and if she was a bit unpolished, her mysterious —but very dangerous— family definitely made up for it. On the other hand, there was an untamed fire in her, one that raged boundlessly at the slightest prodding. And with that flame came an act of unique courage, as while this engagement ploy was deadly for me, I didn’t doubt that it was risk-free for her, not with the stakes. She was too determined to be the little heiress of the rich family. </p><p>Of course, all that made it even more tempting to make her mine, especially when she was growling in frustration as she reached my belt, trying to free it from its confines, enough to pull away from our kiss. And when I smirked at her smugly, she actually looked angry. </p><p>My crime, not losing my mind under her heated kiss. </p><p>“I’m going to show you, you bastard,” she growled, one that made my spine tingle, even as she freed my belt in measured, determined movements. Her gaze fell down, the concentrated expression on her face making my pants very uncomfortable. Luckily, she, very determinedly, unbuttoned it and pulled down my zipper, letting my full erection the space to breathe. </p><p>I was expecting her to slow down a bit, so I was surprised when she pulled my pants and underwear at the same time, leaving my bottom bare. She gave me a challenging smirk before diving back into the kiss, but with one major change. Only one of her hands went to my chest, while the other stayed around my shaft, moving up and down in a torturous slowness, contrasting the passion of our tongues as they danced. </p><p>“You’re playing a very dangerous game, miss fake-fiancee,” I growled when she pulled out of a kiss. “Do you think you can handle the consequences.” I would have liked to say that it was a calculated taunt that was there to arouse her competitive spirit, but that would have been a lie. It was an honest reaction that escaped me, though definitely effective. </p><p>“Bring it on, white boy,” she gasped in response even as her grip around my shaft tightened for a moment. I just smirked as I grabbed the zipper of her dress, pulling it down glacially no matter how much I wanted to rip the dress off her mercilessly, before taking her on the coffee table. </p><p>Still, she shivered as the zipper slowly peeled off her body, allowing my fingers to touch the naked skin of her back, trailing along her spine. That didn’t prevent her from kissing me like there was no tomorrow, nor the fact that she was giving me a slow handjob —though the second part picked up speed soon after. </p><p>When the zipper came down, however, rather than letting her dress fall down, she pulled out of the kiss and used her free arm to keep it in place, hiding her breasts from my view. “You need to work better,” she gasped erotically. </p><p>I decided to follow her direction, leaning forward to press a lingering kiss on her delicate neck, making her shiver once again. My hand sneaked behind her back once more, this time caressing along her spine, while the other hand ended around her waist before tightening around her. </p><p>A shocked cry escaped her mouth as I stood up without a warning, her legs wrapped around my waist reflexively, trapping my shaft with her beautiful body, while her arms ended around my neck, wrapping tight. I just smirked before walking toward a closed door that I hoped to contain her bedroom, slowly and determinedly while I did my best to devour her neck and devour her lips alternatively. Her cries of desire echoed in the room whenever her lips were empty and I was focusing on her neck. </p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth when we finally arrived at her bed and I threw it on quite a bit harder than necessary, but from the way she showed absolutely no resistance as I pulled her barely-hanging dress off her, I was willing to bet that she wasn’t particularly torn about that detail. </p><p>I stopped for a moment, enjoying the sight of her perfect body, her caramel skin contrasting against the white linens of the bed. I would have said that she looked like a classical masterpiece —like her stunning legs and flat stomach and perky breasts definitely qualified— but no art piece from the classical period had such a thick layer of arousal on their face. She was panting and groaning even as I hovered above her, defenseless with her skimpy panties and her stiletto shoes and nothing else. </p><p>At that moment, I could have commented on her beauty, that I could have mentioned that she was a Mayan goddess came to life, that she was free to rip my heart, and for a fleeting moment, it would have been true. However, I know that a single word like that risked the destruction of the magic that filled us, pushing her far more than she was planning in her little ploy. </p><p>I sat next to her, still hovering above, and slid my hand in her panties. The gasp that escaped her mouth was truly spectacular, but I disregarded it, preferring to gently caress her entrance instead. Her back arched beautifully as my fingers danced at her entrance, my own shaft throbbing with unmet desire. Still, I said nothing as I wiggled my fingers, torturing her with a slow wave of pleasure. </p><p>A few minutes passed in that slow, torturous manner, though I used the opportunity to get rid of the rest of my clothes. For a while, she had a defiant expression, clear on what I was trying to do but determined not to let that succeed. Unfortunately for her, I had spent quite a bit of my young life doing card tricks, meaning I had unbelievably skillful fingers, more than enough to wear down her paltry resistance. “Act faster, you bastard,” she finally gasped as her body wiggled. </p><p>“Is this the way to talk to your fake-fiancee, princess,” I said in a mocking tone, and even better, when she opened her mouth to let out a scathing reply, I twisted my fingers, forcing her to gasp helplessly instead. </p><p>It took a while for her to catch her breath under my determined assault, but she managed to do it in a minute. “That fake-fiancee better start acting faster, or I’m going to show him that I’m not just a pretty face,” she said, her trigger finger clenching reflexively, though I doubted she expected me to catch the last part. </p><p>“Violent much,” I said with a chuckle, but before she could interject, I continued in a huskier tone. “Be careful what you wish for, princess,” I said even as I leaned down and captured her lips in a domineering kiss, one that hadn’t used for the evening. If the way her breathing came to a still was any indicator, she was enjoying it. </p><p>Enjoying it too much to actually pay attention to anything else. She missed when I climbed the bed, my knees on both sides of her. She missed when I slid down her panties, leaving her shaved pussy bare for my attention. She missed when my chest pressed against her sexy torso. </p><p>But she didn’t miss when I pressed my erection at her entrance, ready to slam in. </p><p>“No,” she gasped in panic. “I’m a virgin.” </p><p>Admittedly, that came as a bit of a surprise. From the rather great aptitude she was showing, I wouldn’t have expected that. Probably, she was one of the technical virgins, thinking that not taking that last step somehow changed things. Or, I thought, suddenly thinking of her family circumstances, maybe it was a requirement from her family. Her dangerous, mysterious family… </p><p>Knowing that only made me want it more. After all, I was already slated for a very dangerous fate, and whether I took her virginity or not wasn’t likely to have a huge impact on my ultimate fate. Still, I wasn’t asshole enough to actually impale her without her permission, how much my throbbing shaft begged me to do. </p><p>“How about I put just to tip in,” I asked in a soft, boyish tone, one that implied a more innocent type of desire than I had been feeling. </p><p>“You won’t push it in,” she stated, though the question was still implied. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said, before letting my smirk widen. “Not unless you order me to, of course,” I added even as I pushed my shaft into her core, her warmth enveloping me completely. </p><p>“You’re going to wait for a long time,” she said confidently after a moan, which I believed was completely unwarranted. After all, here we were, just several hours after we met, naked, with my crown snugly inside her snatch, making her moan even as I carefully moved back and forth. Of course, rather than arguing the point, I leaned forward, and for the first time, pressed my lips to her breasts. They weren’t huge, barely enough to fill my palm, but their perkiness and perfect shape were more than enough to compensate for the size. </p><p>The minutes passed, and I ended up hoping that it was as much as torture on her that it was to me. I was still above her, in missionary position, both of us burning with desire while the top of my shaft repeatedly slid in and out her, enjoying her slickness while she gushed like a broken tap. My fingers explored her body in a similar kind of laziness while hers roamed over my back with a contrasting wildness, enough to leave more than one red line. </p><p>She was getting closer. I decided it was the perfect time for some interrogation. “Tell me, Sabrina,” I whispered into her ear huskily. “Why are you doing this?” </p><p>She was smart enough that even in the throes of passion, she didn’t mistake my point. “Because I hate being the little girly chip of my family,” she spat in surprising vitriol. “I’m more competent than all my brothers combined, but all of them have their own part of the business, even though they are running it to the ground. But not me, not the little girl of the family. I just need to be a little pretty thing to catch the attention of a couple of low-lives to make sure my family can get into new markets. Just because I’m a girl, the fact that I’m the heiress of the Blue Guard means nothing.” </p><p>“It’s tough,” I said, even though I wanted to jump from the nearest balcony. Hiding my reaction took a lot. Blue Guard was arguably the strongest organization in Latin America, the only thing that limited them was that their reach never passed the ocean, or Central America. They were the kind of danger that triggered a national security alert. </p><p>And like the idiot I was, I was trying to take the virginity of one of the daughters of the ruling family. </p><p>It was madness, but I stayed in position, ignoring the impact of the revelation. My fate was determined the moment I barged into that poker game, and sealed when I entered her room. Now, my only saving grace was the sexy naked girl under me that was twisting with desire. I decided to continue probing her, both literally and metaphorically. “You’re too brave to take this lying down,” I whispered into her ear. “I’m guessing our little ploy is a part of the game. Is there anything else I need to know about it.” </p><p>“Nothing much,” she said, interrupted by a moan as I bit her nipple. “Just never step outside the resort without talking to me.” She didn’t give any reason, nor that she needed to. Even if I hadn’t been a spy, I could have easily imagined possible endings, none of them pleasant. </p><p>“As you wish, my fake-fiancee,” I said even as I pushed forward, just enough to caress her barrier for a moment before pulling back. She gasped beautifully, which was followed by another string of moans as her clit continued to struggle under my smooth fingers. </p><p>Several more minutes passed, filled with kisses, caresses, and a slow, determined assault on her willpower where I was very careful about not letting her climax, then, she let out a frustrated growl. “You’re a pathetic bastard,” she cried. </p><p>I pulled away to catch her gaze, though my shaft was still at her entrance, ready to plunge. “Does that mean you want to stop, my fake-fiancee,” I said with, more cheerful than I was feeling. It might be hard for her to contain the desire, but it wasn’t that much different for me as well, especially while I needed to silence the sound that was begging me to take her completely. </p><p>“No, you bastard!” she gasped. “You win! Impale me! Take my virginity!” </p><p>“As you wish, dear,” I said even as I leaned forward to capture her lips in a soft, gentle kiss, something that contrasted greatly with the merciless push of my hips, breaking through her barrier and graduating her into a true woman. She gasped against my kiss, but not much as I expected. Despite her outward charm, she was one tough woman. </p><p>I wanted to test just how tough. </p><p>It was why I barely let her gather herself before pulling my hips, before sliding inside her once again, this time even deeper, forcing her walls to expand painfully. “Damn,” she managed to murmur between kisses, but when I stayed back to let her speak, she chose to sink herself into our kiss once more, which was more heated than the previous one. </p><p>The more I felt her getting used to my presence, the more merciless I started to plow her, until I was repeatedly ramming inside her while she mewled like a little kitten. “Yes, harder, faster!” she cried, proving that she was more than ready to take the final step, but couldn’t find someone idiotic enough to anger one of the most dangerous illegal families in the world. Luckily, I didn’t anger one. </p><p>I angered three! </p><p>So, it was a little understandable when I started impaling even harder as I realized my climax was coming, reminding me of the utter lack of protection we had. Still, I didn’t pull out, instead, I pushed even deeper inside her before filling her insides, which triggered a spectacular climax in her as well, leaving her trembling and moaning helplessly. </p><p>She was barely moving as I lay next to her before pulling her to my chest, giving her a break to breathe while she struggled to come down from the spectacular explosion that almost pushed her to the land of unconsciousness. Even after she gathered herself, she continued to breathe softly while drawing circles on my chest, while I held her tight. </p><p>“That wasn’t the plan,” she finally murmured. I didn’t say anything, just tightened my grip to comfort her, but when she pulled out, I let her, even though I was sad to let her leave, enough to put a genuine frown on my face. But when rather than leaving the bed, she chose to straddle herself on my lap once more, this time skewering herself on my shaft, taking the perfect cowgirl position. “But since what’s done is done, there’s no harm enjoying it a bit…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Please come in,” Sabrina said excitedly as she took half a step to the side, giving me enough space to pass, but not enough to put a lot of distance between us. A trick to force intimacy, a well-known trick out of seduction handbook, even though she hadn’t executed it perfectly. Combined with the signs of her extensive firearm training, things were getting more and more interesting. </p><p>“Thank you,” I said even as I stepped inside, letting one of my best seductive smirks appear on my face, happy to notice her irises widening just for a moment, especially since the rest of her face stayed the same. Score, I thought. There were a lot of ways of faking attraction, but diluted irises were one that was impossible to fake without a very determined preparation. </p><p>I let my eyes wander around the room as I walked inside, ignoring her unnecessarily close footsteps. In a different location, I would have been afraid, but here, in the middle of the VIP section, I felt quite secure. The hotel took its security seriously. </p><p>The foyer I was in was larger than my own room, sparsely decorated but still elegant. “May I take your jacket,” she whispered even as her fingers touched my neck for a fleeting moment like she was trying to underline our intimacy. I said nothing, but lifted my arms, allowing her to remove it. If she was going to play the intimate hostess, who was I to argue. Though, I noted the practiced way she caressed my arm after like she was trying to smooth it. A move, unlike her irises, was very much practiced. </p><p>After she hung my jacket, she gestured me to follow her before walking toward the door to the right, her hips swaying hypnotically, enough to make my mouth feel dry. She might be targeting me as a mark for her seduction game, but it didn’t make it any less effective. </p><p>We stepped into a larger room, with a large dining table and a comfortable looking couch directly facing a huge screen, white and cream, underlining opulence and richness. Especially with the dinner table filled with a number of delicate dishes, and a bottle of wine resting in an ice bucket, their smells suggesting that each prepared to perfection. It was really driving the difference between VIP and normal customers. Comparing it with the tiny box they called a room, I couldn’t help but feel like I had another reason to get a VIP position. </p><p>And who knows, maybe I could get an extended holiday after my mission was complete. </p><p>I cut my musings short when Sabrina turned to face me, a cute expression on her face almost managing to obscure the dance of calculation that was going behind her eyes. “I wanted to thank you for saving me earlier today,” she gasped as she pushed her chest forward, just enough to accentuate the curves of her spectacular breasts without being too forward, the red of her dress contrasting perfectly with her caramel skin. </p><p>“Nonsense, we’re more than even,” I said with a chuckle, waving my hand. “Saving a damsel like you from a bunch of useless drags like them has been a pleasure,” I smirked. “Not to mention I had managed to earn quite a bit thanks to your assistance.” </p><p>“Then, maybe we can share a dinner like two new friends,” she said, fluttering her eyelids cutely. I nodded, not wanting to resist too much, just to give the impression that her little seduction game was working. I was feeling curious about her endgame. I made a gesture to fill our wine glasses, but she stopped me, instead choosing to serve me herself, not neglecting to dip down to give just enough cleavage. Then, she raised her glass. “To new friendships,” she called. </p><p>“To new friendships,” I agreed with a grin, couldn’t help but feel excited at the smile on her face. Her seduction might be artificial, but her beauty, and a part of her attraction, was real, which was making me rather interested in the later parts of the night. </p><p>After a brief small talk, she came with her first question. “So, what exactly do you do?” she asked. </p><p>“Currently nothing,” I explained with a shrug. “I had a small software company which I sold just a couple of months ago, and decided to take a holiday to relax.” </p><p>“Couldn’t be that small,” she said playfully. “Not with the money you’re throwing around on the table.” </p><p>“Eh, boring stuff,” I said with a shrug, which was intentional. She had seen the amount of money I had, which meant underplaying was to my benefit. “You?” </p><p>“Nothing much,” she answered. “I have a very traditional family with strict opinions about what I can and can’t do,” she explained, her sudden sadness not all fake. “While my brothers are raised to take the family business, I’m expected to be the good little daughter and marry to expand the dynasty,” she said. “And as you have seen in the game, the candidates they have in mind is not exactly spectacular.” </p><p>“Yeah, I met tree stumps with more attractive personalities,” I countered with a smirk, earning a genuine laugh. Still, her laugh didn’t distract me from one important fact. One of her husband candidates was a high ranking member of Dominion Cartel, and the fact that they were trying to impress her rather than forcing the family to comply had very dangerous implications. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my mission which had dangerous implications on thousands -maybe even millions- of innocent lives, I would have never dared to interject into such a volatile situation. Unfortunately, I was alone in the middle of the ocean, in one of the most dangerous locations in the world, completely bereft of support. Like earlier in the poker game, I had to take risks. “I’m sure that their fathers would love the fact that they lost all that money,” I said mockingly. “I wonder if they would cry.” </p><p>“Oh, I’m sure about that. Though their fathers would be more annoyed about the fact that they lost in such a public setting rather than the money itself,” she added even as she lazily reached across the table and caressed my hand in a gesture of intimacy, still doing her best to play the seduction game. I avoided her gaze shyly as I changed the subject to a more casual area, until the dinner was finished. </p><p>“Do you want to join me on the couch,” she asked after the dinner was finished, but before she joined, she filled us two glasses of scotch from a decanter, the smell alone telling that it was an amazing vintage, above anything else I had tasted, even during the training. I nodded before following her direction, and sat on the one side of the couch, giving her enough space to choose the distance, curious about what she was going to do. </p><p>She was silent as she passed the glass. I took a sip, a perfect combination of sharpness and smoky flavor filling my mouth. She sat down close to me, close enough to make it extremely inappropriate considering our lack of relationship. I let her stay silent while I enjoyed my drink. </p><p>One of her hands landed on my knee even as she took a deep breath. “I need to ask a favor,” she murmured helplessly, once again acting to reflect the intended emotion, though I could tell that it wasn’t completely fabricated. She needed my assistance, and considering her hesitancy, it was going to be a big one, easily overwhelming the favor she earned through her assistance in me earning a hundred million dollars. </p><p>Still, I nodded. “What exactly do you need?” </p><p>She smiled hesitantly even as she grabbed my hand, sliding close enough that her beautiful breasts were pressing on my arm. “I need you to act like my fiancee for the next month,” she said, like she didn’t know I would be signing my death certificate if I was as normal as I was presenting myself to be. For all her beauty, she was a dangerous woman. A true femme-fatale.  </p><p>It was a dangerous request, even for a junior spy like me. After all, curiosity was seldom worth angering three dangerous entities. Dominion Cartel was a known quantity, and whichever organization was behind Thomas, I didn’t expect it to be considerably weaker. </p><p>The real clincher, however, was Sabrina’s family, which I suspected to be significantly stronger either organization, something not easy to disregard, maybe enough to track me down even after I left the island for ruining the reputation of their daughter. If they were willing to marry her to a member of the mafia, they were either in the illegal business, or they were strong enough that it was just a blip on the radar. To my best guess, Sabrina was making a play for freedom, and I was her smokescreen. </p><p>However, there were advantages as well. As her fiancee, I would be a part of the spectacle in a way that was completely unconnected to my Agency affiliations, making me a known commodity, giving me an actual chance to achieve my mission. In exchange, however, the moment I left the island, I would meet with a torrent of assassinations. </p><p>Even worse, asking her about her family was not an option without spooking her. I was supposed to be a software developer, unaware of the darker parts of the world. It was a huge gamble. </p><p>Just as I liked. </p><p>“As I said before,” I said, letting my smirk widen as I leaned forward, just an inch between our lips, happy to see her irises widen in excitement once more. “Saving damsels in distress is its own reward, my dear fiancee.” </p><p>“Thank you,” she gasped in excitement, with just a dash of guilt mixed in. She wrapped me in a fleeting hug before jumping up to her feet disappeared in another room before I could get a word in. When she came back, she had a ring box with her, but I was more interested in the slightly disheveled state of her clothing, enhancing her cleavage enough to give a hint of areola on her caramel-colored skin, filling me a desire to taste it. </p><p>The cleavage got even deeper when she fell on her knees in a mocking display of a proposal, her smile wide. “Will you be my fake fiancee,” she muttered as she flipped open the box, showing a very elegant platinum band. </p><p>“As you wish, my damsel in distress,” I answered, smiling equally wide. The situation was amusing, even with the looming danger. She put the ring on my finger before pulling a similar one from the other box, and was about to put it to her finger. I grabbed it before she could. “Let me,” I said with a throaty tone, one that worked well to trigger arousal. </p><p>If I was going to suffer being a fake fiancee, I was going to get some benefits. </p><p>I slid the ring on her delicate finger. She smirked with the satisfaction of her ploy being successful. She raised her phone, about to take a photo, when I grabbed her wrist to stop her. “We need to share a photo for them to see,” she explained, looking stern. “That’s the whole point.”</p><p>“I know,” I said with a shrug. “However, we need to look the part just to make sure your family buys the engagement. And considering we’re trying to play the part of the love of first sight, and we’re alone in a room…” I dragged. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, in a sudden onset of shyness that was completely genuine. “You think that if we look a bit more … disheveled, it would be more believable.” </p><p>I smirked, but rather than saying anything, I grabbed her wrist gently and pulled her onto my lap. I didn’t put a lot of strength, barely more than a tug, but that proved to be enough, she collapsed into my lap easily, her eyes bright with excitement as her hands dragged lazily on my chest. “Well, you’re right,” she murmured, almost a whisper. “And if we’re going to fake a relationship, we need to be comfortable in each other’s touches.” </p><p>I wasn’t an idiot, so I refrained from mentioning that she was already comfortable enough with our proximity, enough to trick any bystander. Why would I, when it finally gave me the excuse to taste her delicious lips? </p><p>When I pressed my lips against hers, I was planning to take it slow, but that plan was foiled when I felt her tongue probing against my lips, asking for entrance, something I was more than happy to grant. She slipped inside smoothly, exploring my mouth enthusiastically, far more enthusiastically than what was required for a seduction play. I couldn’t help but feel proud at turning the tables without breaking the cover, but that was a fleeting thought. </p><p>I focused on enjoying the way the kiss was slowly unraveling me. For that moment, I let myself go, no mission, no spy business, no dangerous mafia. At that moment, we were nothing more than a pair of attractive young people, and our biggest problem was being overdressed. </p><p>Sabrina proved that she was in the same track of mind, as she grabbed my shirt without even breaking the kiss, trying to unbutton my shirt, but for all her finesse, her fingers failed to complete the task immediately. She pulled back with a frustrated growl, and before I could say anything, she pulled hard, my buttons flying around in the room. Her Latino fever was burning thick, begging me to push down, to take her hard. </p><p>But I showed patience, not wanting to scare her. In a sense, seduction was like fishing, you didn’t want to pull hard before the hook was in place. That was why my hands stayed relatively tame, just caressing her back, determinedly avoiding her zipper even when her hands explored my naked torso aggressively and she tried to devour my lips. </p><p>A frustrated growl escaped her mouth just a minute later and she changed her position, ending up straddling on my lap, rubbing her entrance aggressively against my shaft despite the layers of cloth in the way. When her hips started to dance, I decided to help her a bit by pumping my hips, enough to extract a moan of her. </p><p>Interestingly, there was no hint of prepared seduction tricks in her, just pure, animal, desire, a complete twist, the kind that begged me to push her down and take her mercilessly. Pity that I could still sense a layer of hesitancy underneath, showing itself from the way she stiffened whenever I let my fingers caress over her zipper. </p><p>I wondered if I could break down that hesitancy to taste her caramel beauty… </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was a good moment, I thought even as I pressed the shutter once more. Katie was in my room, wearing nothing but stockings, garter belt, and stilettos, all pearly white further underline her beautiful innocence, perfect for her cute innocence. The fact that she was on her knees, doing her best to make me cum under a combined assault from her perky tits and her enthusiastic mouth made the situation even better, especially when her enthusiasm reached the point of smiling to the camera whenever I took another bunch of photos. </p><p>“You’re a spectacular student, Katie, and you mastered this part of the game perfectly,” I said, and she picked up speed even further even though she blushed shyly. “Now, why don’t you show me something else.”  </p><p>“Like what?” she murmured after pulling her head, her lips beautifully stained. </p><p>“That’s something you’re going to decide,” I said with a gentle smirk even as I cupped her cheek with one hand, making her blush. </p><p>“Um,” she murmured, her blush spreading even further. “I have something in mind, but…” she murmured, but somehow her words failing midway. </p><p>“Don’t be afraid of discussing your ideas, sweetie,” I said, as gentle as I could manage in such a moment. “I won’t get mad.” </p><p>She smiled prettily, her crush intensifying even further. “I was thinking that… Maybe I could…” she trailed, falling silent once more. </p><p>“Go ahead, sweetie,” I said even as I caressed her cheek once more, but this time, I kept my fingers on her skin, gently trailing down, tracing her neck first, then her shoulder and her arm. She stayed silent still. My finger down until they were around her wrist, then turned into a gentle hold. A pull later, she was sitting on my lap, her heat dangerously close to my shaft. </p><p>I continued caressing her body until she managed to cobble together an answer. “I was wondering, if that’s okay, can I give the orders today,” she whispered hurriedly, barely audible. </p><p>“Of course you can, sweetie,” I said, even leaning forward to steal a small kiss off her cheek. “And we can use Red as our safe word, in case you ask for something that makes me uncomfortable,” I added. When she looked uncomfortable, I continued. “Don’t feel pressured, it’s just a usual best practice. It’s actually better for you, so you don’t have to try reading my every reaction, trying to understand whether you’re doing well or not.” </p><p>She nodded cutely before standing up, and I couldn’t help but smirk. Normally, I loathed giving control in the bedroom —or out of the bedroom— but I was curious just how much Katie would be able to push. Watching her attempts would no doubt be enjoyable, like a little kitten trying to hunt a ball of yarn for the first time. A very sexy, appropriately-dressed kitten with legs to die for… </p><p>“O-okay,” she stammered as she took a few steps back, walking toward the costume table, before picking up a black bra, and a white mask. I wasn’t enthusiastic about her wearing more clothes, but I didn’t want to tell her anything soon after agreeing to leave control to her. “You’re not allowed to cum before my permission,” she managed to say without stammering, though her tone still cracked badly in the end. </p><p>“Of course, madam,” I answered, not commenting the way she ducked her head shyly. </p><p>“Lay on your back,” she ordered, and I did so, but from the way her stilettos clicked on the floor, I could hear that she was getting closer.  “Raise your arms,” she added, and when I did so, she used the bra she had picked up as an improvised rope, pinning them together. It wasn’t a good knot, I could have got rid of it in a moment, but her attempts were too amusing to interrupt. </p><p>The true pleasure started after she pinned my hands together. A blonde mess of hair hovered over my crotch as her lips wrapped around my shaft once more, moving up and down rapidly, though that joyful treatment lasted barely a minute. “Tasty,” she murmured, trying to sound confident but failing horribly. </p><p>Her attempts to play the femme-fatale might be cute and misguided, but the pleasure that spread through my body when she climbed on my lap and mounted me cowgirl style was pure delight. She tried to keep a confident expression, which was hard when her lips trembled vulnerably as she tried to swallow my shaft into her core inch by inch, her body still unused to the presence of such thickness. </p><p>Halfway in, she pressed her hands on my chest, and started moving her hips back and forth, smoother than I would have expected, but her shyness and tightness ruled out the possibility of another boyfriend, which meant that she probably rode a pillow to smooth her movement. </p><p>She was truly an exemplar student. </p><p>“Do you like it?” she murmured, trying to sound confident, a difficult task when her words turned into a moan halfway in. </p><p>“I like it a lot, madam,” I answered, trying to sound worshipful. “Your insides feel like heaven.” </p><p>“Good,” she murmured. “Then you’ll love this.” Then, just like that, she forced herself even deeper, hiding my full length into her tunnel. </p><p>“Your insights are spectacular, madam, and can only be rivaled by the silky touch of your treasure,” I said, playing along with her innocent approximation of domination. She smiled brightly at my compliment, her hips started to dance once more, triggering my pleasure. </p><p>“Tell me that I’m beautiful,” she moaned as she pulled herself up for a fleeting second before sinking back once more, trying to acquaint herself with my full length even though she trembled spectacularly every time she forced herself to take the full length. Her tits danced spectacularly as she trembled, begging for me to maul them until they were covered with my fingerprints. </p><p>Pity that my hands were tied. </p><p>Of course, her boundless joyride was not without its consequences. Suddenly, she tightened even as a fresh warmth enveloped my shaft. Combined with her sudden trembling, she was climaxing. Though I had to respect her determination, as even her arms trembled badly, threatening her with a collapse, she continued her attempt to stretch herself while using me as a toy. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she murmured absentmindedly, and I just smiled while she continued her ride. Soon, she looked at me in confusion and a little hurt. </p><p>I sighed. “I’m supposed to strictly follow your orders, which includes talking, remember?” I said, though I made sure to smile warmly to convey that it wasn’t an admonishment. </p><p>“Oh, right!” she said, once again blushing spectacularly. She reached for my hands, and with a pull, freed them. “Squeeze my tits, then,” she moaned. </p><p>“Your wishes, my command, madam,” I said even as I sank my fingers into her spectacular tits, squeezing and mauling, but otherwise staying passive. Her reaction was a series of wanton moans that made me glad that the sound isolation of the basement was decent. The last thing I needed was for Nicole to visit to check. </p><p>Explaining the naked presence of her step-daughter after an extended session with her might have been a tad difficult. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss when she suddenly stood up, leaving my shaft naked. Even worse was rather than changing positions, she stood up and walked away, catching me flatfooted. I didn’t expect to be left helpless in the middle of the task. “Close your eyes, and keep laying on your back,” she ordered, and I still followed her command, not wanting to make a liar out of myself, though the next time, I was going to punish her appropriately for that. </p><p>Soon, I could hear the sound of clothes rustling, interrupted by the occasional moan that tempted me to stand up and teach her about the dangers of playing with me. Still, I bit my lips and lay on my back, waiting for her to finish whatever she was doing.</p><p>I felt her presence hovering over me once again, though she was yet to skewer herself on my length, instead, rubbing her entrance against the crown, ignoring my needy throbbing. I couldn’t help growl impatiently, already cursing myself for my promise, something that became even more pronounced when she dismounted a minute later, once again leaving with the clacks of heeled shoes —though their sound was different than the stilettos. </p><p>“Open your eyes and stand up,” she ordered, her voice already disappeared in a gasp, and I did so, only to see Katie in a completely different dress. Her innocently-sexy garter belt and stockings were gone, replaced by a red leather corset and black leather boots that reached to the middle of her thighs. Moreover, her hands were pressing against the wall while her naked ass was raised invitingly, her face hidden under the sprawl of her smooth blonde hair. </p><p>I stood there, my erection throbbing with excitement, waiting for her next order. Several seconds passed in silence, temptation getting thicker by each passing second, until Katie turned her head, revealing a smile filled with desire. Apparently, during her change, she also replaced her makeup. </p><p>“What are you waiting for, come here and fuck me,” she ordered, trying to sound steady, but her voice crackled toward the end, especially the last two words. </p><p>“As you wish, madam,” I said even as I moved toward her with large steps, my arms around both sides of her as if I wanted to prevent her from escaping. I pressed the tip against her entrance, but rather than following my throbbing desire and pushing inside, I leaned into her ear. “How do you want me to fuck you, madam?” I said in a throaty tone, making her shiver. “Do you want me to fuck you gently, or do you want me to fuck you hard, until you can’t stand on your own feet.”</p><p>“Hard,” she murmured, and I leaned forward, locking her body between mine and the wall, enjoying the way she shivered against my chest. I put my hands over hers, pinning her in place with no hope of escaping for her. “I want you to fuck me fast and hard. Show me what you got, Stephen.” </p><p>“Your wishes, my command, madam,” I said even as I pushed my shaft deep into her mercilessly, sliding easily in her wet tunnels despite the tightening. A cry escaped her mouth as she managed to take the entirety of my shaft in one move. I pulled back, only to slam back once again, the sound of flesh hitting flesh echoing in the room. </p><p>She turned to catch my lips, digging in a frenzied kiss. I let my tongue slip into her mouth, exploring her tongue as the time rolled. “Harder, faster!” she moaned when she pulled back for a breather. </p><p>I said nothing, but I pressed my arms against the wall harder before pushing my hips forward in a renewed pace, the sound of flesh exploding like a gun, her cries following a second later. “How is this,” I said as I pumped her mercilessly, enjoying the way she tried to squirm against my presence, but unable to gather enough strength to break through my hold. As I ravaged her without bothering to limit myself, enjoying the way moans spilled from her bruised lips. </p><p>As the minutes rolled, her expression was losing its coherence, drunk with pleasure. “I’m reaching my limit,” I whispered into her ear. “Where do you want me to cum,” I said. “Your beautiful mouth, your amazing tits, or your bubble butt,” I said. </p><p>“None of them,” she moaned, and for a moment, I was afraid that she was going to ask me to stop. It would have been horrible no matter what I chose, I would either suffer blue balls, or I would break her trust despite my earlier promise. Luckily, her next words resolved my dilemma. “I want you to fill me to the brim,” she said. </p><p>That surprised me. If she asked that a few minutes ago, I had no doubt that I would have rejected her while explaining the dangers of doing so, or the fact that we were doing it without protection was risky enough. But now, still reeling the frustration of being ordered while my instincts were focused on my own impending explosion, while a sexy barely-legal beauty wearing a red leather corset and black boots asking for my seed… </p><p>“Is this what you wanted?” I asked even as I groaned, my shaft exploding into life, filling her to the brim in an instant. She moaned helplessly as my seed filled her core, trembling badly. </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned. </p><p>“Good,” I said even as I hugged her midsection before pulling out, letting an intoxicating mixture of her juices and my seed to drip on the floor. She moaned, but said nothing as I grabbed her body and carried her toward the empty portion of the desk and lay her there. “Now, it’s my turn,” I said even as I grabbed a pair of panties —which I had several laying around thanks to the fact that it was a studio— and stuffed her mouth, before pulling her hands to her back and binding them using a tie. </p><p>She moaned as I slipped two of my fingers into her entrance, pumping mercilessly, her slick entrance giving me no trouble. The following one was even more spectacular, however, when I slipped my thumb into her puckered hole, making her stiffen in shock. “Stomp your right foot if you can handle it,” I said, and her right leg moved, the sound echoing in the room. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as my fingers started a merciless dance, triggering her holes simultaneously while she tried to process the pleasure, giving all signs of yet another impending orgasm, especially when my erection returned to life and I replaced my fingers with it, my thumb still in her ass. She gasped and moaned, the panties in her mouth failing to suppress her beautiful voice. But even that was a pity, I decided before pulling it out, leaving my mouth free. </p><p>“Stephen…” she managed to murmur between her wanton cries. “Do it harder!” I smiled at her enthusiasm. It was one of the reasons I liked dealing with nerdy girls. It might take a while to convince them into the bed, but once their inhibition was broken, their curiosity drove them to embrace the new passions wholeheartedly. Her amazing tightness was just a bonus. </p><p>“As you wish, slut!” I said even as I spanked her ass with my free hand, my thump still teasing her puckered hole. Every slap on her supple flesh tightened her further, begging for him to fill her one more. </p><p>“I’m almost there,” she moaned as her body struggled under an unfamiliar wave of pleasure. </p><p>“Do you want me inside you again,” I asked. </p><p>“I want to feel you, fill me again,” she moaned, even the pretext of it being a lesson long forgotten as she struggled under my impaling. “Oh, oh, oh … OH!” she started crying, each louder than the last, making it impossible for me to hold back. When she clamped around with the telltale sign of climaxing, it was inevitable that I painted her insides white once again, sprouting boundlessly. </p><p>When I pulled out, she continued to lay on my desk, exhausted. Not willing to leave her in such an uncomfortable position even for a moment, I grabbed her in a bridal hold brought her to my bed before starting to work with the laces of her boots. </p><p>“It was amazing,” she murmured in a haze. </p><p>“Yes, it was,” I answered as I continued to undress her while also enjoying the view. Then, I decided to breach the important subject that I somehow ignored during sex. “About protection…” I started. </p><p>“I’m on the pill, I started after the accident that derailed our plan…” she answered, making me let out a relaxed sigh. </p><p>“Smart,” I answered. “It will help our lessons a lot.” </p><p>“Yes,” she murmured, catching my eyes even as she was exhausted. “Lessons,” she said while she widened her legs playfully. “You’re such a dedicated teacher.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said, plopping myself next to her after removing her boots, but leaving the corset on. I started kissing her neck. “And now, I’m going to teach you about the best way to cuddle after such a spectacular session…” I said, pulling her into a spoon. She murmured comfortably as I trailed her chin and neck with a series of gentle kisses…  </p><p>Even then, my mind was on the next session, wondering whether it would be possible to convince her to share a class with Madison… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had to suppress my annoyance as I pulled my RV in front of my childhood home, which I lived there as the only child of an ex-marine and a housewife, the same place I had abandoned when I was sixteen after a particularly bad fight with my father. It was hard to believe that it had already been a decade. </p><p>Looking back, it was inevitable. Both my father and I were dominant characters, though it reflected itself differently. As a retired marine, my father was obsessed with discipline and control. His home was his fiefdom, and he wanted to have the last rule on everything, raising me to follow the same disciplined lifestyle. He wanted to control everything in his fiefdom, the contents of our diet, exercise schedule, hobbies, even friends… </p><p>His reaction wasn’t hard to imagine when I declared that I wanted to be a painter, ruining his dreams of starting a military dynasty in the house. He tried to change my mind, I pushed back, which even devolved into fistfights on occasion, where I managed not to keep it from devolving into one-sided beatings, the strict exercise regime he forced on me working wonders in combination with my early growth-spurt. My mother’s meekness didn’t help any, and at the tender age of sixteen, I abandoned my home. </p><p>I disliked him, but didn’t hate him, because, ironically, it was the skills and discipline that was ingrained over me that allowed me to successfully fend myself. Thanks to his strict exercise routine, helped by my early growth spurt and chiseled chin, I looked like I was in my early twenties rather than like a minor, allowing me to get a gig as a bouncer in a seedy strip club, allowing me to get enough money for my living expenses and my art school—and a rather nasty knife wound. </p><p>The fact that his ridiculous discipline allowed me to draw my path was the only reason I started talking with him once more after he became a widow, though our contact was sporadic and rather cold. As a widow, however, his social contacts were limited mostly to his neighbors. </p><p>And our relatively mended relationship was the only reason I had agreed to his ridiculous request, take Anna —daughter of one our neighbors— with me to my cross-country trip after he decided to take a cruise trip with his neighbors. To be fair, not the only reason, three-grand they promised me as the rent for the month-long just to babysit her also played quite a bit of role. </p><p>What could I say? Painting was a costly career, especially in the beginning. </p><p>As I expected, I wasn’t a model of enthusiasm as I pulled to the empty driveway and honked. The driveway was empty, because my father and his friends had already departed for their cruise. I chose that moment, because just because our relationship was mended enough to ask for monthly calls didn’t mean that I wanted to start my inspirational journey with a useless fight. </p><p>When I honked, the curtain of the kitchen moved, revealing a blonde girl with thick glasses, waving panickedly before closing the curtain. At first glance, she was truly a nerd, not surprising considering I remembered her even when she was a little girl, buried under the books. In our brief call, she managed to squeeze in her impressive academic achievements and debate team victories.  </p><p>With a sigh, I stepped out of the car. I might be only allowing her to join me because of the rent I required, but I wasn’t asshole enough to make her carry all the stuff she required. Thanks to some of my previous girlfriends, I had a good idea about the humongous amount of clothing they would require in a month-long trip, though the potential loss of space annoyed me greatly. </p><p>I was already at the door, about to ring, when it opened, allowing me to take the first real look at my temporary roommate. She had a lovely face, I had to admit, but it was only my experience as a painter that allowed me to catch that, because of her absolute lack of makeup, combined with her stocky glasses that clashed horribly with the round, elegant lines of her face while also hiding the blue of her eyes. Her blonde hair was gathered in a tight ponytail, ruining the impact even more.  </p><p>Her clothes were in the same vein, a loose shirt and even looser sweatpants hid her figure. I remembered her as a little chubby thing, but it seemed that she lost a bit of weight, enough to make her need for a wardrobe change a true urgency, because the current ones reminded me of a sack. </p><p>Pity I had no intention of playing the generous roommate for her urgent need of a makeover.  </p><p>“Hello, Michael. Thanks for allowing me to come with you,” she said, quick enough to make me fear that her words were running away from a band of murderous marauders. “I can’t believe that I’m going camping with you for a whole month,” she continued after taking a deep breath. </p><p>She took another breath, but this time, I cut in, trying to ignore the sudden realization that my trip wasn’t going to be as calm as I was hoping. “Breathe, Anna,” I said, though still smiled a bit to blunt the damage, not wanting to break her before the trip started. The last thing I needed was her to suddenly change her mind, depriving me of the money that was promised to me. “How about you bring that to the RV, and I pick up the rest of your luggage,” I added, pointing at the medium-sized luggage that was standing on the side of the car, the only piece of luggage other than the oversized backpack on her back. </p><p>“That’s all of it,” she said, surprising me pleasantly, making me think that it might not be as bad as I feared. Then, unfortunately, she continued to speak. “Why? Do you think that’s not enough? But mom said that would be more than sufficient. Should I pack another one-” she spat rapidly until I raised my hand. </p><p>“No, that’s perfect,” I said. “It’s just that in my experience, girls tend to bring a lot of unnecessary stuff even for a short trip. Nice to see that you don’t.” </p><p>“I’m not most girls,” she said, surprisingly stiff and challenging as she spoke. Nobody reacted like that unless words touched a vulnerable spot. I decided to ignore the subtext, as I wasn’t paid enough to play the therapist as well as the driver and the landlord. </p><p>“Good,” I said with a smile, like I hadn’t heard an impressive number of girls claiming to be different confrontationally, thinking that insulting the rest of their gender would put them into a better position. Then, I grabbed her luggage, and started walking toward the car. </p><p>“Just a minute, I need to make sure everything is turned down!” she exclaimed before dashing inside, and came out three minutes later, breathing hard. I was already at the driver’s seat, engine running. “Sorry,” she said, and I waved it off. </p><p>“You can use the small cabinet next to the couch,” I said, pointing at the burgundy monstrosity that took most of the living area once opened. The RV wasn’t small, but it wasn’t exactly huge either. With the small bedroom on the back, separated from the rest with only by a thin curtain, and a miniature bathroom and a tiny shower, there was not enough room to move, especially when a corner held a large cabinet that I had installed specially to hold my painting supplies, especially the fragile ones like my canvases. </p><p>The road was empty as I drove out of the town, so, from the corner of my eyes, I watched Anna unpacking her luggage, which consisted of a lot of t-shirts and baggy sweatpants, as well as several white sets that she pushed deep into a separate section of the cabinet with a surprising hurry. Likely her underwear, the boring kind… </p><p>“It’s so exciting, a cross country trip with a real painter,” she murmured excitedly after finishing her organizational challenges, unaware that I was able to hear her. I had to bite my tongue not to remind her that I was a babysitter more than a friend. Still, I let it slip, slowly driving forward. </p><p>“So, what’s the first stop,” she asked with a smile as she sat next to me, an e-book reader in her hand. As a classical painter in an age where more and more artists were moving to digital space, I never enjoyed working on a screen, something that also affected my reading habits. Though, if that prevented her from filling my limited space with books, I was more than happy with it.  </p><p>“I don’t know,” I answered, and when she quirked her eyebrow, I explained. “I’m traveling to get away from the cities and to get inspired, so there’ll be a lot of long stops. I hope you have enough books on your little device.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have,” she said. </p><p>For the next few hours, nothing much was said. We talked, of course, but it was an idle chat that avoided anything substantial, mostly focusing on her excitement about her college life, which was about to start in two months. But there was a certain tone in her words, like she was about to visit a magical place that would solve her problems. Combined with her phone’s suspicious silence, it didn’t take a genius to understand that she had a rather shitty social life back in high school, and was hoping that college would solve a lot of it. </p><p>Too bad for her that the college would be more of the shit, but she would learn that soon enough. </p><p>It was supposed to be the end of the issue. I certainly had no intention of bothering to explain the reality to her. But things changed when I decided to take a little pit stop in an abandoned section of the forest, impressed by the way the red light of sunset spilling on the leaves. And just to make things perfect, it was far away from the civilization that we could spend the night without being bothered by anyone —and I did have a nice nine-millimeter pistol on the car, just in case I run into trouble that my fist wouldn’t be enough to resolve. </p><p>The complication that occurred, however, had nothing to do with threats. I was sitting on a nearby stone with a notebook in my hand, idly sketching the sight, pencils dancing in my fingers, my back against the trailer. For the majority of it, Anna sat next to me, idly watching me while she read, until she decided to stand up. </p><p>I didn’t pay attention to her, but soon, the sunlight dimmed enough to ruin my sketching, so I stood up, only to catch Anna’s reflection from the rearview mirror. At that moment, I faced two problems. First, I managed to do that the exact moment she was she was changing. Her shirt was thrown against the couch, and she was holding her bra in her hands, leaving her torso naked.  </p><p>Second, she had an amazing body. </p><p>I couldn’t help but lick my lips, feeling like a dirty old man —ridiculous considering I wasn’t even twenty-five yet—, while Anna raised her bra to her chest, stuffing her perfectly-shaped breasts in her bra’s tight grip. She must be bordering D cup range, so her bra couldn’t be exactly comfortable, I noted absentmindedly even as I felt my lips dry with a sudden onset of arousal. With her breasts hidden, my gaze slipped down to her waist, surprisingly smooth. </p><p>Apparently, her growth spurt worked wonders… </p><p>It was a pity that she pulled her shirt on a moment later, leaving with an urgent boner and a completely renewed view against my roommate… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Ten minutes after the ambush, we were ready to move, though our situation was improved significantly. I was finally dressed as well, even though it was pants only, the shirts were ruined thanks to my overpowered wind blade. “We need to start moving,” I said after I finished the preparations, feeling more comfortable dealing with the survival challenges the forest might provide us now that we had some decent tools. </p><p>“Yes, but where?” Lillian countered, still scared. “How can we know that they won’t be waiting for us at our destination,” she said. “Maybe I should send a message to my family, asking for reinforcements?” </p><p>Her worry was understandable with her mysterious kidnappers revealing a reach much deeper than we expected, though that made connecting to her family unsustainable as well. “I wouldn’t say no to reinforcements, but it’s almost certain that they have spies in your family, and our enemies are much closer to our location. If we give our location, I fear that we will face our enemies before they could arrive,” I said. </p><p>Lillian frowned. “Still, we need to do something. We have no money, no map, not even spare clothes. If we just continue to run, eventually we’ll get caught.” </p><p>“You’re not wrong,” I answered, trying to placate her. She was getting antsy, and while I was more than happy to spend a month or two in the depths of the forest avoiding my followers, I doubted that Lillian could handle it. Even though she was managing admirably for the moment, she was a creature of comfort. Even worse, unlike me, she wasn’t used to the mental pressure, so being constantly hunted would frazzle her, forcing her to make mistakes. I needed something for her to focus on, something to distract her. “How about if we send your family a message, asking them to send a force to a fixed location, so in two weeks, we can meet with them there.” </p><p>“Excellent idea,” she exclaimed gleefully as she gave me another hug. I decided to seal the hug with a short but searing kiss, even as my hands landed on her lithe bottom, cupping her ass under her short skirt. Since she wasn’t running around naked anymore, I needed to use my opportunities to enjoy her beautiful skin. While I kissed her, I watched Astrid from the corner of my eye, who looked at us with a scandalized expression and a large blush. </p><p>I would have liked to extend the kiss into a horizontal dance, but we weren’t in a condition to waste too much time. So, I suppressed my instincts forcibly and loosened my grip on her tight ass. She stopped the kiss a few seconds later. “We don’t have much time,” I explained. “Quickly, draw the runes and send the message, then we can move.”  </p><p>“Why don’t we send the message after we traveled a bit,” Astrid asked. “Wouldn’t it be better if they didn’t discover the bodies.” </p><p>“No,” I answered with a shake of my head, ignoring the smug smile Lillian sent to Astrid. “The bodies will be a good message for them, telling that their prey might not be as weak as they thought.” </p><p>“Doesn’t that mean that they will be better prepared?” Astrid asked. </p><p>“Yes, and that’s for our advantage,” I explained patiently. “First, they will be less enthusiastic in their search if they knew that a wrong step might end their life. And they will be forced to act in bigger groups, which will make their search more inefficient.”</p><p>They nodded before Lillian crouched on the ground, her expression twisted in concentration as she quickly drew several runes, her magic already flaring to stabilize. Astrid looked at her in no small amount of surprise, so much that she didn’t notice me walking toward her. “You seem shocked,” I said. </p><p>She jumped, surprised by my presence, which made her delicious curves jiggle, forcing the limits of her new clothes. She was blushing as she looked at me, but I didn’t let my eyes dip to her chest no matter how appealing the view. I gestured her to walk with me as we walked toward the nearby rocks to take a seat. The silent walk calmed her down. “I didn’t expect her to be this good,” she said with a grudging admission. </p><p>Her impression was justified, considering that until the moment, Lillian was doing her best to mess with her childishly. “Yeah, don’t let her fool you, under that vapid exterior lies a dangerous mage,” I explained. </p><p>“I’m sure that you’re very familiar with what lies underneath,” Astrid said, a mocking smile on her lips. “No wonder you’re traveling with her.” </p><p>“Nonsense, I’m helping her because I’m a kind individual,” I said with a mock glare, which melted into a smirk as I gazed at the bent-over figure of Lillian as she tried to complete her communication array. “However, I can’t say that I’m unhappy about the side benefits.” Astrid breathed out aggressively, showing her displeasure. I turned to face her once more, but this time, letting my gaze crawl over her body, devouring the contours of her body, which was under display thanks to Lillian’s exquisite tailoring. Her cleavage, in particular, was a spectacular gift to humanity, straining her top dangerously. “Yeah, I’m definitely not unhappy.” </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured, trying to sound angry but failing spectacularly as her whole body blushed, trying to imitate her striking hair color. I just smirked while waiting for her to gather her wits. “So, what’s the best way for us to follow,” I asked her. </p><p>“Depends on where you want to go. If we’re going to go to the nearest port city-” she started, but I cut her off with a wave. </p><p>“Definitely not,” I answered. “Any place with strong trade ties to Londinium is a bad choice. Or any small place with a strong gang presence. We still don’t know about the exact reach of the enemy, but they managed to surprise me twice. I’m not willing to take the risk for now.” </p><p>“Maybe we can ask help from one of the tribes,” she offered. </p><p>I shook my head. “No, that wouldn’t work. Since they already have power over your tribe enough to force a leadership change, it’s very likely that they have a connection to the other tribes. That one-time use flame rune Grundi used on us was not a simple thing to give away, and I doubt they would bother if they are trying to control just one tribe,” I explained, and saw the disappointment in Astrid’s eyes. It was clear that she was also aware of those facts, but still wanted me there. </p><p>I chuckled kindly before putting my finger under her face, and raising her head in an intimate pose. “I don’t appreciate you trying to manipulate me into your tribal battles,” I said in a kind, almost joking tone, but I also let my magical presence free for a moment, reminding her that I wasn’t playing a game. She blanched in shock, but I let the presence go just as quickly before patting her cheek playfully. “Now, do you have an idea where we can meet with Lillian’s family without falling into an obvious ambush.”</p><p>“Bibrax is the best place for that,” she said hurriedly. “It’s a city nominally under the Republic, but effectively, it's ruled by an alliance of the biggest Gallic Tribes. It’s not as rich as Alesia or other major cities, but it’s also close enough to the border to be ignored by most Romans.” </p><p>I smirked, remembering my history. The lack of interest by the Senate was inevitable, considering the last time they tried to expand their powers by invading across the Rhine, they had been ambushed by their enemies and betrayed by their allies, losing seven legions in the process. In the end, they had to go beg the Eastern Empire for help, no doubt much to the dismay of the stuffy nobles back in Rome. After that, it was no surprise that they were acting like their border to Germania didn’t exist. “Not a bad idea, but it’s a bit far away. How much do you think it’ll take us to go there?” I asked. </p><p>“Maybe three or four days if we use the river,” she said. </p><p>“No, that would be too predictable. Nor we could use the main roads. Assuming we use the forests and the wilderness, how long?” </p><p>“If nothing goes wrong, maybe two weeks,” Astrid answered. </p><p>I nodded. Two weeks were not bad. It still gave us a margin of error if we faced a dangerous monster another stubborn tribe. Moreover, the place was distant enough that even if my suspicion about the spy was correct, there were too many paths through the wilderness for them to really block it. We started talking on the logistics of the journey while Lillian focused on finishing her communication array. And since I was an opportunistic brute, I used the opportunity to flirt with Astrid, slipping occasional compliment or suggestive comment, making her blush and fret. </p><p>I had cut down the flirting when Lillian was about to finish her array, not because I was afraid of her response, but because I wanted her to think that it was Astrid that was coming on me. When she finished with the array and turned to us, she huffed loudly, unhappy with the distance between me and Astrid. Unfortunately for her, Astrid decided to react that by leaning forward and putting her hand on my forearm casually. </p><p>I acted unawares as Lillian walked toward us angrily, and was positively surprised when she arrived, the first thing she had done was to grab my chin and pull in me for a heated kiss, all the while glaring angrily at Astrid. After she pulled back, she sent a regretful glare at Astrid’s clothes, realizing that her little prank might have unintended consequences. </p><p>“Array is ready,” she said succinctly. “What should I tell them in the message.” </p><p>“Tell them to be in Alesia in twenty days, and wait for another message from you there,” I explained, and when Astrid looked at me questioningly, I explained. “Just because we have options to avoid doesn’t mean we can’t reduce the risk a bit more. They can easily take a riverboat from Alesia to Bibrax, and since it’s deeper in the civilized lands, they won’t be running the risk of ambush,” I explained. </p><p>“Are we going to Bibrax?” Lillian said. “That place is not that different from an overgrown village.” </p><p>“Yes, and that means that we won’t be bothering about it. Go and communicate the message, and don’t forget to destroy the array after. They will still detect the location, but every minute after that counts. We need to move very fast after that.” </p><p>Lillian nodded in understanding before walking back to her array, quickly composing the message, and destroying it after the message was sent. </p><p>Then, we started our hardy trek, picking a hardy pace. Astrid took the point, as she was the one most familiar with the direction, Lillian stayed in the middle while I took the rear, ready to respond against any danger. And if I was getting an amazing sight as their mini skirts fluttered in their hurried dash, giving me a visual feast, well, that was completely coincidental. </p><p>The first two hours were a frantic dash as we tried to put distance between us and our camp area. If we discovered too early, it would have ruined our plans. We took occasional breathers, or more accurately, Lillian took occasional breathers while Astrid and I made sure to lay several fake tracks and destroyed ours, making our followers' job even more difficult. </p><p>Lillian requiring several breathers was understandable, considering that unlike us, she wasn’t unused to extended physical exertion. Of course, that affected our fledgling group dynamics quite a bit. When Lillian asked for another rest, Astrid was ready to give her opinion. “How surprising,” she whispered while making absolutely no effort to keep her from being overheard, sharing a vicious smile. </p><p>Lillian was nonplussed. “Not everyone is a wildling that spends all their day running around in forests, some of us had more important things to do,” she countered, leaving Astrid to scoff angrily. I said nothing even though technically Lillian’s insult also hit me, choosing to watch them insult each other with a smirk on my face. It was good to have entertainment.  </p><p>After several attempts to insult Lillian, however, Astrid decided to take a different approach to annoy her, and walked toward me. “Marcus, can I ask for your help?” she asked demurely while also pushing her chest out. Her ploy was obvious, but the sight of her cleavage was sufficiently amazing —especially since it stuck on her sweaty body, revealing the contours of her spectacular breasts— for me to ignore her simplistic plot. </p><p>“Of course, Astrid,” I answered casually, earning a glare from Lillian. “Go ahead.” </p><p>“I’m feeling a slight pull in my leg,” she said shyly as she put her hand on her left leg, a place on the edge of her skirt, which, considering its length, meant it was quite high, enough to be classified as obscene. “Can you massage it a bit?” </p><p>“Of course,” I answered even as Lillian sent me an angry glare over Astrid’s shoulder. Not exploding into a wild cackle was a challenge, though. When I encouraged the rivalry between them —partially for my amusement, partially to distract Lillian from the morbidity of her situation— I didn’t expect to become the tool to resolve them, not that I was unhappy with the chance of putting my hands on the busty beauty without taking a single overt action. </p><p>At this moment, I was willing to believe that the gods loved me. </p><p>I sat down on a nearby trunk while gesturing her to close in. Astrid only did so after sending a smug glare to Lillian before strutting toward me. It wasn’t the most elegant walk I had ever seen, I had to admit, but there was a charm in her wildness, helped a lot by the way her breasts were jiggling at each step, making me gulp. I had no problem showing my desires overtly. The more heated the rivalry between them, the more enjoyment I would get. </p><p>Still, when I gestured her to put her leg on the same rock I was sitting, she hesitated, realizing just how compromising the position would be. Her stillness extended until Lillian realized her fear and made the mistake of scoffing dismissively, goading Astrid into action. She raised her leg on the side, which lifted her skirt and put me face to face with her underwear. It was more utilitarian than sexy, but still exciting. </p><p>“Now, take a deep breath,” I said as I put my hands on her thigh, one to outside at the point where she pointed, the other on her inner thigh, dangerously close to her most precious spot. She gasped, but I ignored it in favor of softly massaging her surprisingly soft skin considering her lifestyle, making me suspect that she had a magical skincare routine. I enjoyed the sight of her pale thighs as she squirmed under my touch, and whenever I raised my eyes to catch her gaze, her beautiful green eyes shone with desire, and her lips curled in confusion. All the while, Lillian was throwing daggers with her eyes. </p><p>That stretched for almost a minute before she opened her mouth. “Um, I think it’s okay now.” </p><p>“Maybe, but it’s better if we make sure,” I answered even as I let my fingers dig deeper into her flesh, the ones that on her inner thigh climbing even further, until the edge of her underwear. A little damp spot appeared in the middle of it, the best evidence that my tactics were working. </p><p>“I feel fine,” she murmured before forcibly pulling her leg away and took several steps back. </p><p>Lillian was still angry, but seeing Astrid pull back in panic, she let out an amused chuckle before moving forward and standing in front of me. She leaned forward, uncaring the amazing cleavage the move created —understandable considering we spent several days in our birthday suits— and caught my lips in a searing kiss. </p><p>The kiss was different than everything else we had shared. It was confident, aggressive, and most of all, violent. Her teeth sank into my lower lip hard enough to make me taste my own blood while her eyes burned alight with her satisfied jealousy. She wanted to act possessive. </p><p>I didn’t react, because, at that moment, all I could do was to suppress the sudden surge of violent instincts, begging me to teach the arrogant female about the cost of challenging the alpha. Worse, I was tempted to exactly that, not only to assuage my pride, but to push things until Lillian was crawling on the floor in ecstasy after her submission was complete, something I was sure that she would enjoy immensely. </p><p>I didn’t do that, because I was afraid that following those instincts at the moment would waste all the progress I had managed to accumulate. Instead, I let Lillian pull back and gave me a smug smile that conveyed her warnings. “Let’s move,” she said, meeting Astrid’s jealous glare with confidence. I let her arrogance slide, well, mostly slide as I landed a spank on her tight ass before we started moving, punctuating it with a smile when she turned to look at me. </p><p>However, when we started moving, I pressed my hands together before turning my magic into thunder once more. Sooner I could temper my magic, sooner I could punish her for her arrogance in a way we both would enjoy. </p>",

    "content": "<p>For a while, the silence was dominant in the cave while I gently cleaned Titania’s arm with a damp piece of cloth. I couldn’t help but feel excited as her arm was slowly freed from the ugly cover of dirt, leaving her alabaster skin, shining and supple after my healing treatment. I occasionally threw a glance toward her, but her beautiful gray eyes —lacking their usual hardness— avoided mine. </p><p>Understandable, considering she was being forced to receive nursing effort from a man she barely knew, and the huge crush she was starting to develop toward me definitely didn’t harm. “Are you comfortable?” I asked as I moved to the other arm, and received only a soft nod in response. </p><p>She stayed silent as I finished her other arm including the shoulder, then moved to her legs, starting from the middle of her thigh and moving lower, trying to make her more comfortable by respecting her boundaries. Or more accurately, acting like I was respecting her boundaries while applying the full range of massage tricks on her, helped by the fact that I had spent several minutes carefully healing her body with my magic, figuring a lot of its secrets in the process, sensitivities, blind spots, and how best to awaken her primal desire. </p><p>The first break in her tone happened when I finally reached her ankle. A gasp escaped her mouth, one that she quickly hid behind a cough. I acted unawares as my fingers caressed her foot, turning the intensity a notch as well. “May I ask you a question?” she murmured. </p><p>“Of course,” I said, once again trying to act unaware. I knew that she was asking for the question earlier than she intended, trying to cover for the idea. A good tactic, too bad it would not work against me. </p><p>“Why are you here, in Silver Spires?” she asked, her tone focused. It was good, because it reminded me of something I almost let slip during the last hour. She might be acting like a teenager with a crush, but she was still the head librarian that was strong enough to cut through an army, with the wits to back it up. I was lucky that I was dealing wither in her most vulnerable, exhausted, shocked, and devoid of mana. </p><p>“I wanted to be free,” I answered casually, deciding that it was the best answer I could come up with, close enough to the truth without revealing my biggest secret. And funnily, when I said it, it resonated in me more than a well-crafted lie. It was true, in the end. I was trying to get stronger, because I wanted to be free even if my unusual power source was discovered. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. I doubted that she didn’t understand my reason, but my fingers were digging into her soles in a determined assault, bringing her pleasure. And from the way she bit her lips desperately, it was clear that she was struggling to keep her reaction hidden. </p><p>“Well, the situation back home is complicated,” I said even as I turned my eyes to the cave entrance, my tone had a deep, husky quality, like I was struggling through a dark memory, playing the mysterious tortured hero. “At first, there wasn’t a lot of hope about my development, they assumed that I already hit my level cap when I was young, so I was sequestered like the family’s little shame. When I was old enough to understand the implications, I could have explained to them the truth, of course, but that would have put me back into the struggle for the family seat. At that point, I was already behind my rivals with no reasonable way to gain other’s support.” But even as I gave my dark monologue, I did my best to give her a mindblowing foot massage while acting absentmindedly.  </p><p>“Seems difficult,” she murmured, trying to sound serious, but failing to keep the shadow of the moan hidden. “Do you want to return there?” </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>I acted unawares even as I moved to her other foot. “Not exactly,” I answered. “It was not the best childhood, but I lacked a true understanding of the details. But there’s nothing for me back there even if I take the family seat, which I could easily,” I said, which was very true. With my current strength, it would take me less than a day to take the family seat, but why bother. The last thing I needed was to get stuck in the endless organizational meetings, border disputes, and other innate problems. </p><p>“And how come you’re in my school,” she said, even with the arousal and curiosity, a certain edge could be heard. </p><p>“When the opportunity came, my family enthusiastically shipped me to Silver Spires, hoping that I would kindly disappear from their view, unaware of my strength. I stayed, because the school gave me the best opportunity to get stronger. And before I knew, it was the only place I could call my own,” I continued as I intensified my massage, forcing a moan of her beautiful lips, of which I acted unawares. </p><p>“Is that the reason you’re fighting against the necromancers, that they are threatening your home,” she said. </p><p>“In part,” I answered even as I turned to her, with a bright smile on my face. “More importantly, I can’t let them hurt such a spectacular sample of beauty, can I?” </p><p>The blush that spread her face was spectacular. This time, I kept my gaze on her face, a teasing smile on my lips, as I climbed upward while cleaning her other leg. When I passed her leg, she was squirming helplessly, and when I arrived the upper part of her legs, enjoying the softness of her inner thigh. I wanted nothing more than parting them open, ripping off her underwear, and take her on the floor. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>Pity that it was too early for that. </p><p>Caressing her inner thighs with a torturous slowness was decent compensation for the lack of it, especially since she was reacting amazingly to my touch. She was even more inexperienced when it came to the matters of the flesh, I realized. “Let’s focus on your back,” I added as I gently grabbed her shoulder before gently flipping her over, the wet cloth dancing on her back. I would have liked to continue focusing on her thigh, but I want her to be completely clean before I tried my chance with the seduction. The last thing I needed was her to feel self-conscious about the state of her body in the middle of the seduction, ruining my chances. </p><p>I focused on her upper back at first, sliding under her bra strap repeatedly to hint her about the possible direction I might take. She managed to stay silent for a short while before a stubborn moan finally escaped her beautiful lips. “I’m not hurting you, am I?” I asked, fake-concerned. “I can reduce the pressure if you want.” </p><p>“No!” she answered, far to quick to be a nonchalant response, but she still tried to do that. “I meant, it’s better if you keep the pressure so that we can focus on our plan.” </p><p>“Of course, my lady,” I answered gallantly even as my empty hand trailed her spine gently, making her shiver. Her moans become commonplace once I arrived at her lower back, passing dangerously close to her buttocks. I cleaned the edges, but instead of her arousal increasing, she stiffened, so I let it slide for a bit. “Do you feel strong enough to sit?” I asked instead. </p><p>Her answer was a pointed, angry glare, trying to conceal the fact that she was feeling self-conscious. Understandable, considering her reputation and power. It was likely that no one had questioned her capabilities for a long while, certainly not something as simplistic as sitting up. I answered with a gentle but teasing smile instead. She avoided my gaze shyly and murmured. “I can handle it,” she said as she tried to push herself up her feet, only to fail spectacularly.  </p><p>“Nonsense, for the next few days, I’m your obedient and selfless servant,” I said even as I presented my arm to her, helping her to reach a sitting position. She did so, her arms crossed in front of cover her still-dirty chest, covered only with a bra. However, I caught a glimpse, enough to see her nipples pushing hard against the surface, telling her arousal. </p><p>Even when I helped her to a sitting position, she looked like she might topple down at any moment. As a gentleman, I could never allow such a disaster, so I sat behind her, her back pressing against my chest, my arms gently around her waist. “Isn’t it a bit much,” she managed to murmur as she turned her head to face me. </p><p>It was a mistake from her end, of course, because it brought our lips almost to a contact point, separated by just an inch, her panicked breath dancing on my lips. She was frozen, and I decided to use the opportunity to focus on her stomach, flat and fragile under my touch. She just stayed there, frozen, while I continued caressing her body, guilt and shock and enjoyment dancing on her face. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>I gently hummed even as the fabric I used to clean her beautiful body rode up, dancing just under her breasts. She didn’t react as badly as before but still stiffened, so I used a simple spell to clean the fabric before focusing on her neck and her face. The silence stretched as I slowly caressed her face, revealing her dainty, beautiful frame and her delicious lips. </p><p>She stayed silent for a while, before a gasp escaped her mouth. She was getting antsy. In a moment of inspiration, I decided to try something new. “You trust me, right?” I asked, and she nodded, though it was a hesitant one, waiting for the twist. I smirked as I raised my finger. “Suck my finger.” </p><p>“What!” she exclaimed, managing to shout in her exhausted state. “Don’t be ridiculous-” she tried to continue, but I silenced her by pressing my finger to her lip. </p><p>“Come on, you won’t be disappointed,” I said even as I dragged my finger along her lip, knowing that her shivers had nothing to do with the cold, not with my body draped around hers. She looked at me hesitantly, her heartbeat beating hard enough to be felt on my chest. Then, she took my finger between her beautiful lips, pouty enough to make a courtesan jealous. </p><p>Her eyes widened as I let a minuscule amount of pure, and shapeless mana from my finger, making her eyes widen in shock. She bit my finger in shock, luckily not that hard in her exhausted state, but still enough to hurt. I continued to release mana for a while before stopping. </p><p>[-157 Mana]</p><p>“What was that?!” she exclaimed, shock and euphoria on her face. </p><p>“Pure mana,” I answered, like it was a simple thing. In truth, it wasn’t. The only reason I was able to do was my rather impressive theoretical background combined with the expertise on three discrete branches of magic, giving me an extraordinary awareness of my magic. “How much mana did you recover?” I asked. </p><p>“Two points,” she answered, and I couldn’t help but frown. The idea was good, but the efficiency was too low. </p><p>“I spent over a hundred and fifty points,” I answered with a frown, making her smile fall as well. I was quick to console her. “That was just the first test, I’m sure that we can find a better way. Even if we can’t, it’ll still help your recovery immensely.” I sighed. </p><p>“Yes,” she said with a smile. “Your regeneration is really fast.” </p><p>“It’s a pity that that bonus is about to expire,” I answered, and she looked shocked. “Don’t worry, I can trigger it again, but not for now. The conditions are a bit tricky.” She nodded. “Are you ready to continue experimentation, I said even as I placed my finger in her mouth once again, this time, letting mana trickle slower, hoping for better efficiency. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the only thing I was doing. With her attention on my finger between her hot lips, and the mana flowing from it, it was the best time to move onto some sensual cleaning. The fabric dipped down on her torso once more, this time slipping until it collided her cleavage. She looked like she was about to complain, but I chose that moment to let a huge deluge of magic, filling her mouth, extracting a moan as well. </p><p>[-342 Mana]</p><p>[+400 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement.

Biomancy would have been useful, of course, and basic light was intriguing, but not as much as Tantric, especially when mana transfer triggered it. Under different circumstances, I wouldn’t have taken it, but enhancing Titania’s recovery speed was an advantage I couldn’t deny. </p><p>The rest, I could discover in the future. </p><p>So, I selected before letting my mana flow from my finger once again, the flow already more stable and more effective. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>[-121 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Tantric] </p><p>I looked at her brightening face, happy that she was too occupied to notice the sudden jump in efficiency. Even better, she was too distracted by the flow to care about my hand diving deeper into the sacred area protected by her bra until the wetness of the fabric became too distracting. She dipped her head down, realizing the presence of my hand in her cleavage, stiffening once more. Luckily, my finger was in her mouth, so I distracted her with another jolt of mana, earning a beautiful moan as a result. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>[-246 Mana]</p><p> [+4 Tantric]</p><p>It was amusing to see just how easy was to increase the skill proficiency with a large mana capacity, though not as amusing as watching the impeccable head librarian of Silver Spires squirming in my lap, betraying her utter lack of experience when it came to men. “So, tell me about yourself,” I asked with a flirty tone. </p><p>“I can’t, my secrets are dangerous,” she answered confrontationally, but as she stayed distracted by it, she failed to comment as I found her bra hook and releasing it with a flick, finally leaving it bare, limiting herself to a shy gaze instead.</p><p>“I need to have better access to properly clean,” I answered innocently before moving back to the main topic. “I’m not asking about your secrets, I’m asking about you. Tell me what you enjoy in your free time, what you don’t. What’s your favorite color, or what’s your favorite food.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured shyly, but also with a hint of confusion. “I have a great deal of responsibilities in my job, and my secret mission takes the rest. I don’t have the chance or the desire to explore.” </p><p>“What a pity,” I said even as I dragged my cloth down to her last untouched spot, hidden behind her panties. This time, she was very much aware of the destination, but did nothing to prevent me other than a trembling hand reflexively reaching before coming to a sudden stop, showing I wasn’t the only one that was feeling excited about the prospect. I continued speaking as I dragged her panties down, revealing her beautiful nether lips once more, neatly trimmed, while also giving her another dash of mana, the flow even easier than the previous time.  </p><p>[+400 Experience]</p><p>[-131 Mana]</p><p>[+3 Tantric]</p><p>“Do you at least masturbate,” I asked cheerfully at her even as I dragged the wet fabric on her most sensitive spot with torturous slowness, making her moan helplessly. </p><p>I wasn’t expecting much, but the answer still surprised me. “No,” she murmured. “Never.” </p><p>Keeping the question back took quite a bit of effort. I could have accepted that she didn’t masturbate often, as she was still enough around the school to do so. But to never masturbate, one needed to be seriously asexual, and from the responses she was showing under my hands, I was willing to diagnose that she was very sexual. </p><p>Which meant that it was something about her emotions or instincts being repressed. It was a wild guess, but it was definitely more believable than my power set, so who could know? </p><p>“Really?” I answered instead even as I threw the fabric to the side and placed my fingers to her entrance. “Then, let me have the honor of being the first one to teach you about true pleasure.” </p><p><br></p><p> [Level: 18    Experience: 153850 / 171000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 30</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 17</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 20</p><p>Speed: 15       Intelligence: 20</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 24</p><p>HP: 1386 / 1386    Mana: 963 / 1998        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p>Basic Tantric [10/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p>",

    "content": "<p>I could feel the Librarian’s eyes on me as I walked out of the cave, moving as fast as I could while I could still stay concealed. The biomancy-based detection trick I had figured earlier worked wonders, allowing me to avoid the horde that was circling around the cave. Their discovery of the cave was inconvenient, but also inevitable. After layering that many defenses, it was hard to hide. </p><p>The undead and the necromancers approached the cave in a disorderly way. The undead horde was as fresh as ever, but the necromancers were showing the signs of exhaustion, both mental and magical. Despite that, their confidence was obvious as they moved to their destination, thinking that their victory was a given. Even better, only around half of them were a part of the attack force. </p><p>I slipped through the cracks in their formation, then started searching for my target. I had arranged the defenses of the cave for a full assault, and with their numerical disadvantage, I doubted that they could crack it without sacrificing their resurrected monster horde, and since they think that they were in the cusp of victory, I doubted that they would be that wasteful. So, I was calm as I searched for my target, the leader of this little ambush. </p><p>I found him on the back of the formation, sitting on the shoulders of a bone dragon, raining orders to other necromancers. He sounded panicked, which was understandable. He seemed like a middle-management type, making it likely that his small army was a loan, or a part of his mission, and he had to explain the loss of so many high-level necromancers against two targets. I doubted anyone that ruled a band of necromancers could be classified as merciful. </p><p>So, his death was basically charity, I noted with a smirk as I stayed hidden just twenty feet away under the shadow of a rock, magically hiding my signature, waiting for the perfect moment to attack. I stood still as I watched him order a probing assault, mindless skeletons triggering the first layer of defenses before disintegrating among a flash of fire and earth. He frowned before calling the second and third waves, this time in different formations, minimizing the impact of the explosions but not giving them a chance to recover as well. The initial ambush was not a stroke of luck, I realized. He was really proficient when it came to tactics. </p><p>Too bad that he was wrong about the game we were playing. I waited until he was focused on talking with yet another necromancer, his attention split between the formation and the discussion, before I dashed forward, as silent as a shadow, my sword in hand. I was already behind him when I flared my magic, coating the sword with a thick layer of arcana energy, sharpening the edge to an unimaginable degree for a split second. </p><p>That split second was all I needed to decapitate him. His eyes widened in shock as the blood spurted, showing that, unlike my other target, he wasn’t a lich. Just to be sure, I drove the sword to his head and let out a thick rush of flames, bright enough to melt the sword while turned his head into ashes. </p><p>[-142 Mana] </p><p>The biggest threat was gone, but that didn’t mean that I could relax. The other necromancer who was getting orders stood frozen, unable to react for a moment. Then, he opened his mouth, whether to cast a spell or to call for help, I would never know, because I stuffed my melting sword into his mouth, silencing him forever. It wasn’t the simplest way to die, but also, they deserved it. </p><p>I grabbed the sack of the leader and checked to see whether the book was in there. Since it was precious enough to be bait, I didn’t want to risk it leaving back. I even flicked it open, but unfortunately, it was in an alphabet I had never seen before. Pity, as I would have liked to know what the book was about. </p><p>My assassination attempt wasn’t exactly silent. Most of the necromancers turned to face me, their hurried attacks cutting through the air. I responded to them with a deluge of magic missiles, it wouldn’t hurt more than sting, but after my previous displays, it would force them to the defensive. </p><p>[-43 Mana]</p><p>While they were trying to conjure shields, I dashed forward, hitting the group on the flank, using their allies as a barrier. Fire and earth and life energy flew from my hands boundlessly, forcing them to defensive, burning one or two of them. It was aggressive and wasteful, but defeating all of them was a pipe dream, the best thing I could do was to intimidate them enough to pull back while I regenerated mana once again. The assault took a minute, but draining me almost to the limit.</p><p>[-1300 Mana]</p><p>Just as I was planning to pull back, a bright explosion of light exploded from the cave. A huge ray exploded from the cave, cutting through the horde without losing a spark, and disintegrating two necromancers in the process. I looked to see the librarian standing at the entrance of the cave, her robe dancing with the wind, like she was a part of the legend. </p><p>I hoped that our enemies were too distracted to notice the paleness of her face. I knew for a certainty that she had used the last scrap of her energy in that spell, and was struggling to stand on her feet. </p><p>But after failing the ambush, suffering under a series of counter-ambushes, losing their leader, and pincered between two formidable mages, the morale of necromancers finally plummeted. One of them dashed away, and it seemed like the signal, because the rest started running as well, choosing different directions. They seemed to think that the best idea was to avoid our attention. To reinforce the idea, I started following the largest group, puttering them with fireballs which looked much more impressive than they were actually dangerous, even if it drained the most of my remaining mana. </p><p>When I returned to the cave entrance, I was met with a dangerous sight. Without the necromancers to control them, the undead horde was charging toward the cave entrance. Most were destroyed ignobly, failing to account for the traps, but one of the bone dragons was too durable, and had managed to break through it, attacking the librarian. </p><p>She managed to defend herself, but not without a cost. She was using flares of light to deflect the dragon’s claws. It was a simple spell, likely costing one or two mana for each casting, relying on her reflexes to work. But in her current state, even one point of mana was too costly, losing color with each casting. If I didn’t know any better, I would have mistaken her for a zombie. Her robes were ruined by the dragon’s claws, leaving bloody gashes behind. </p><p>I dashed forward as fast as possible, taking attacks of the zombies instead of delaying even for a second. Even then, I was almost too late. When the dragon swung its claw to a dangerous strike, she raised her trembling hand, but no light came out. There was no time to cast a spell, and I doubted I had the mana to deflect such a strong strike. I was running in fumes as well. I tackled her out of its way, taking a bad gash in my back in exchange. </p><p>[-264 HP]</p><p>The position I found myself in would have been rather romantic if it wasn’t for the bleeding, exhaustion, and the undead horde trying to kill us. When I met her eyes, however, I found dazed disbelief. The temptation was simply too much. I leaned down and stole a fleeting kiss, pushing a bit of color back to her face. </p><p>[Achievement: Seductive Stranger. Melt the heart of an icy maiden with the irresistible charm of a mysterious savior. +3 Charisma, +1000 Experience]</p><p>The achievement was a nice surprise, especially since the sudden boost in my charisma giving me a few points of extra mana and a dash of extra strength just when I needed it. I grabbed her and rolled away, the claw collapsing the area I had been holding just moments ago. When I stood up, I was holding her in a bridal hold, dashing as fast as I could while using the extra mana to connect the array once more. I managed to step into the emergency tunnel, but not before I received another painful gash to my back. </p><p>[-326 HP]</p><p>“It’s payback time, you bony bastard,” I gasped in excitement as I flared my mana, once again emptying my reserves. The rush of mana triggered an inactive node in the defensive array, and a second later, the cave exploded into a true cacophony. It was a pity that I couldn’t return to destroy the stragglers, but neither I nor the librarian was in a good state, and my mana regeneration perk was about to expire. Spending that mana for healing and saving the rest for emergencies was a better idea. </p><p>Thirty minutes later, we were far enough from the canyon that I started to feel safe. I couldn’t say that the risk was completely gone, but after the last disaster which cost them their leader and —hopefully— the most of their horde, I doubted that they would try to follow us. I would have welcomed her opinion about the next steps, but she was limp in my arms, exhaustion and wounds long caught up with her. I had taken a quick break to cure the worst of her wounds, but she was still spent. </p><p>My first instinct was to return to school, but that was not viable. She was in tethers, and we know for a fact that there were enemies in the school. Doing so would end in a nasty assassination. So, I started looking for a nice cave we could stay hidden. Luckily, even if the necromancers changed their mind and continued searching for us, it was easy to handle without the endless numbers of the horde to help them. </p><p>When I found a cave with a hard-to-notice entrance with a reasonably close underground water reserve —elemental magic was useful for more than just combat— my mana pool was almost completely full once again, so, it was very easy to carve several runes on the cave to hide us from the dangers, as well as regulating the temperature and cleaning the air. If I was going to stay in a cave, I’m going to make it as comfortable as I could. I even created a large pool in the middle by digging a small water reservoir, which was needed to clean our wounds. </p><p>My first focus was my damsel in distress, even though she had skipped the risky period. The sooner she recovered, the sooner we could act. Her eyes fluttered open when I lay her on the floor —softened as much as possible using earth magic— and looked at me with an expression of shock. “We’re alive,” she murmured, her whisper almost impossible to distinguish from the rustle of the leaves. </p><p>“Yes,” I said with a bright smile, bringing the full impact of my charisma and my seduction experience to the game, and I was happy to see another fleeting blush on her face. “You have performed amazingly, like an angel of vengeance, beautiful and bright.” </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured shyly, which surprised me quite a bit. It was hard to imagine the figure that intimated everyone with her sheer presence as shy. Though, considering just how comfortable she had been dressed in just an illusion, I ruled it out the general shyness, which meant my kiss truly had worked wonders in penetrating her defenses, though literally saving her life heroically likely helped. </p><p>“Now, for something uncomfortable,” I said with a soft smile, and she looked worried. “About your wounds,” I added, and her expression turned to panic. I let her stew in it for a moment before continuing. “I need to remove your clothes to cure you.” </p><p>The expression of shock on her face was spectacular. She looked like a teenage girl receiving her first catcall rather than the legendary mage ruled one of the most important locations for the civilization with an iron fist. “But…” she murmured, her exhaustion momentarily forgotten under the rush of adrenaline. She tried to stand up, but the only thing she was able to do was to shift in her place before the pain invaded her face. </p><p>“Yeah, that,” I said, trying to look equally shy at the prospect. </p><p>“Can’t you do it over the clothes?” she asked, her voice tiny. “The other healers do.” </p><p>“I’m not primarily a healer, and I can’t take the risk. I can try to bring you back to Silver Spires if that’s your preference, but…” I said, leaving it lingering. We both knew that returning back without the full recovery was a death wish. </p><p>“I don’t…” she murmured, her gaze finding my face once more, but her inquisitive gaze failed to penetrate the shy surface I was doing my best to reflect, leaving my dirtier thoughts inside. I watched as she tried to make a decision before sighing in defeat. “Okay.” </p><p>[Achievement: Meritorious Medic. Not all good deeds go unrewarded. +3 Wisdom +1000 Experience]</p><p>I had to hide my smile as the notification rang. Two achievements on the same day were definitely welcome, though I would say they were well-earned. I looked somber, because I was pulling a knife, her clothes were stuck to her body with blood and grime, and trying to remove them otherwise would have been more difficult. She said nothing as I removed her clothes with smooth and methodical slices, leaving her body clad in her underwear, though wounded and covered in dirt, it wasn’t exactly an erotic sight yet. The system seemed to agree with me, considering there was no experience reward. </p><p>“Now, take a deep breath,” I even as I put my hands on the biggest wound in her body, looking dangerous despite the scab, and let my magic flow. With the latest improvement of my biomancy skill, it worked even better than I was hoping for, her internal wounds disappearing one after another, her bruises leaving their place to beautiful alabaster skin, though still dirty. </p><p>However, as I continued to cure her, I sensed a certain emptiness, like something was missing. Then, I realized that I couldn’t feel her mana. It was suspicious considering it had been more than an hour since the last combat, and she must have recovered a bit for now. I decided to test her. “How’s your mana recovery?” I asked her. </p><p>“Still in progress,” she said, but I was still healing her, so it was impossible for her to hide her heartbeat picking up speed. I continued to look at her, still expecting an answer. “Is that really important?” she added. </p><p>“Might be, I’m not sure how it’ll affect your recovery,” I answered, which was partly true. More importantly, I wanted to learn why she wasn’t recovering yet. </p><p>She stayed silent for almost a minute while I continued to heal her, when, she whispered. “It’s a special ability of mine, I can overdraw my reserves until I hit negatives, but then my regeneration slows down until it climbs back to positives,” she answered somberly. </p><p>“For how long?” I asked, afraid of the answer, dreading the answer. </p><p>“The worst until now was three days,” she answered, which wasn’t the best answer to receive, but still manageable. </p><p>Then, I remembered the last scene, where she had overdrawn so much that she wasn’t able to cast even as a simple shield. “And, if we compare that time to now, how will it compare?” </p><p>Once again, silence ruled the room while I continued to heal her. “This is much worse,” she answered in the end, then, continued with a small whisper. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.” </p><p>I gently cupped her chin and raised her head until she was looking at my eyes. “Don’t worry, I’m here as long as you need me,” I said in a selfless, heroic tone. With the situation I found myself in, she was the only ally I could trust, and if I was going to stuck protecting her for a while, seduction was a good way to pass that time. </p><p>“I…” she murmured as a blush covered her body, even visible through the dirt. “Thank you…” </p><p>Her reaction was interesting. Combined with her power and her standoffish attitude, it might be that she never had to rely on others, at least to a degree of total helplessness, and she was reacting it in a very interesting way, promising quite a bit of enjoyment for me. I just smiled in response before grabbing a piece of fabric and drenching it in the small source of water I had created earlier. </p><p>She stammered once more as I pressed it on her shoulder, dragging gently, getting rid of the dirt to reveal alabaster skin underneath, making her shiver. “What - what are you doing?” she gasped, trying to look scandalized, but unable to keep her innocent arousal hidden, hinting her lack of experience. </p><p>“We need to clean you. Otherwise, you run the risk of infection,” I explained. </p><p>“But, I’ll be…” she murmured, unable to finish the sentence. </p><p>I spoke compassionately, though hinted shyness as well. “I know it’s hard, but we need to do that. We don’t know just how weak your body will be with no mana after all those wounds. What if you get an infection?” She still looked like she was about to argue, so I continued, doing my best to sound hurt. “You don’t trust me,” I stated despondently.  </p><p>“No! NO! I trust you,” she rapidly answered without even thinking, and rewarded by my best shy smile, unaware just how artificial it was. </p><p>“Okay, but feel free to tell me if you feel uncomfortable, okay?” I said before pressing the fabric on her arm. Then, I chuckled. </p><p>“Why are you laughing?” she asked, a bit cross. I had no doubt that she would have been crossing her arms pointedly if she could move in her own power. </p><p>“We still haven’t met,” I answered with a chuckle. At this point, revealing my name wasn’t exactly a big risk. “My name is Caesar,” I said. </p><p>“Titania,” she murmured, once again shy. </p><p>“A magnificent name for a magnificent woman,” I said, enjoying the way she blushed as I gently cleaned her arm. Maybe tending her as she got healed was going to be more interesting than I had assumed. </p><p><br></p><p> [Level: 17    Experience: 151150 / 153000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 30</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 14</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 20</p><p>Speed: 15       Intelligence: 20</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 24</p><p>HP: 1309 / 1309    Mana: 1321 / 1836        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p>",

    "content": "<p>I sat down on the opening, my eyes closed, forcing my magic to flow. I couldn’t help but frown as I realized that it had already regressed significantly since my tempering session on the boat, but whether it was the new normal or happened because I had followed my instincts during my steamy encounter with Lillian. </p><p>Then, the first lightning left my fingers to stab my other hand, the painful jolt distracting my thoughts, and soon, the rest of my attention was grabbed by the flow of my magic. I let out lightning bolt after lightning bolt, bright explosions filling my vision even through my closed eyes. Still, I had more important things to focus on, such as how my new magical core —my savior and my curse at the same time— was reacting to my forceful tempering. </p><p>The answer turned out to be not as bad as I feared. Compared to the first time, it was more malleable, responding to my pushes after a brief struggle, so much that I managed to attain my previous peak in just a few minutes. For a moment, I hoped that things would be easier. </p><p>Then, reality hit back once more. The resistance bounced back to its dangerous points when I tried to increase my command on my magic further, kicking like an unruly stallion. My new core started pushing more and more magic to my body without my explicit command, as if it was trying to make me fail. </p><p>“I’m going to show you,” I murmured as I opened my eyes for a moment, and used magic to set up a shield around myself, enough to hide both my magic and the flashes of lightning from outside, as well as any sound I might make. Then, I raised my hands in front of me once more, and conjured a lightning bolt with all the magic the dragon heart was forcing in my body. </p><p>It wasn’t the smartest idea, I realized even before the lightning bolt left the source hand, burning my skin in departure. On the contact side, it was even worse, charring the surface of my skin. A cry filled the opening. Only a second later I realized that the cry belonged to me, but I couldn’t do anything, because I was busy falling to the floor, shivering. </p><p>The pain disappeared almost as quickly as it appeared, my palm started recovering at a surprising speed. The charred pieces turned to dust and flew away with the wind, already replaced by soft and healthy skin. But I wasn’t able to examine the effect, because my new core decided to flood my body with magic once more, threatening me to be poisoned by my own magic. </p><p>“I need a better tempering method,” I murmured as I let the lightning free once more, this time from my right hand to my left. It ended the same, with me crying and falling on the floor with a burnt hand, only to recover a minute later. I repeated it once more… Then again… And again… </p><p>As the minutes turned to hours, the dragon heart still belching magic despite my attempts to resist, out of control. However, it wasn’t all bad, because all that painful attempts to purge and temper that excess magic finally allowed me to get a better sense of how to control my changed magic. I was yet to tame it by any sense of the word, so complicated spells such as runes were still an impossibility, but at least I had the confidence to cast targeted elemental spells without leveling the surroundings. </p><p>More importantly, I could feel that I was determinedly eroding the divide between mage and sorcerer. I was still far from deserving to be called a full-fledged, but I had also surpassed the limits of a mage. Even as my new core started to accept its situation —though that was hardly an accurate description for a mindless organ— and started abandoning its attempts to flood my body, I still continued my tempering forcefully. </p><p>With the enemies on my back, I needed my control to survive. </p><p>I continued my tempering session until the sun reached the apex of the sky, shining with an annoying brightness despite still being in North. I decided to stop, not wanting to delve too deep into my magical reserves just in case. I still had the raiders on my track, and more importantly, there was no guarantee that my tribal opponents would continue to be tricked by my strategy. They were the more dangerous opponents, as not only they had a larger army, but they had a much better understanding of the surrounding geography, meaning a lot of possible ambushes. </p><p>That in mind, I stood up, intending to walk back to the camp. Interestingly, despite the significant magical drain, once again I was feeling refreshed rather than exhausted, and stronger than ever. Curious, I decided to grab a nearby large stone, far heavier than anything I had managed to lift in my life. Much to my surprise, it was a bit difficult, but I managed to raise it. How interesting. </p><p>As I walked through the forest, I realized that my strength wasn’t the only thing that changed. I wasn’t feeling any pain from the stones on the ground or the scratch from the occasional bush, the marks they left disappearing in an instant. I had a better balance. Even my senses were noticeably sharper. I was pleasantly surprised at the changes, as while some sorcerers had mentioned such changes, none of them mentioned a change in such a high level. </p><p>Rather curious. </p><p>When I got nearer to the camp area, however, my attention shifted to something more immediate, Astrid’s angry shouts. I was still too far away to understand her words, but it didn’t feel like a war cry, nor I could feel any magical fluctuation from there. Since there was no immediate danger, I continued my leisure pace. Soon, her words started to become discernible. </p><p>“No, you dumb rich bitch, it still doesn’t fit,” shouted Astrid, her tone tinged with fury. Luckily, despite her anger, she wasn’t shouting as loud as she could, which would have pulled unnecessary attention to our location. </p><p>Unlike Astrid’s clear shout, I had to strain myself to hear Lillian’s response. “Let me look,” she answered, and continued a few seconds later. “Are you sure it’s smaller? I think we’re getting close.” I couldn’t help but smirk as I noticed the artificial tone Lillian was using. It was the perfect simulacrum of sincerity, something Lillian had only used when mocking her targets back in the school. </p><p>It was nice to see that despite everything, somethings never changed. </p><p>I had a good idea about what was going on, so rather than walking toward them openly, I sneaked forward, wanting to watch the amusing show that was happening, though entertainment wasn’t my only objective. I wanted to observe Astrid without my intimidating presence hovering over her like an ever-present threat. </p><p>Unknowingly, Lillian was helping me on the subject as well. Nothing like a bit of pointed needling from a bitchy blonde to make someone forget about the bigger picture, focusing on momentary annoyances instead. I used a particularly bushy tree as a cover to sneak into the opening, only to meet with a rather interesting view. </p><p>Astrid was standing dangerously close to Lillian, her posture threatening, her flame-red hair dancing in the wind. It would have been an intimidating sight if it wasn’t for the fact that she was dressed like a streetwalker, her body on display, her tight top barely more than a bra and her tiny skirt strained to the limit to contain her voluptuous body. Her skin was beautiful, even when colored with a number of tattoos that resembled runes, probably working as a focus for her magic. </p><p>Lillian had really pulled all the stops to mess with her. </p><p>Truth be told, Lillian’s clothing didn’t cover more than Astrid’s amazing ensemble, but unlike hers, Lillian’s lithe body wasn’t straining her new clothing as it would snap in a wrong move. And, considering she was completely naked before, even that was a huge improvement in terms of concealment. </p><p>And while I missed the sight of her naked body, after our last encounter in the water, I had all the confidence to divest her of her new clothing. Everything was well, or at least, I thought so, for a moment forgetting the trend my life was following </p><p>I was listening, entertained, as Astrid heaped insult after insult on Lillian’s incompetence while Lillian listened to her with an amused expression, enjoying her revenge. I didn’t get bothered by her relatively loud tone, trying to decide the best time to involve myself to the discussion to impress my new redheaded companion —the sight of her amazing body worked wonders in forcing me to update my plans— when suddenly, five men stepped into the opening, weapons drawn. </p><p>Tribals, I realized as I recognized their symbols with dismay. They were from the same group I had dealt with earlier today. I had assumed that they were properly convinced of my death after all the effort I had gone through. My fingers stiffened around my spear, about to dash forward, when one of them spoke. </p><p>“Astrid, you’re alive,” he said with glee, though his expression left no doubt about his darker intention. He wasn’t being happy because he was feeling friendly. However, the fact that he was surprised was telling, as if they knew about my ruse, they wouldn’t be surprised about Astrid being alive. </p><p>Maybe I should stay hidden a bit more to understand their aim, I decided. The girls weren’t combatants, but even then, they would be enough to keep such a small group at bay until I could rush to their rescue. </p><p>“Mani, that’s the girl, right?” said one of the others. </p><p>“Yes, she is exactly like in the painting,” the leader of the small group said as he looked at Lillian in appreciation. “We earned ourselves a big reward, guys.” </p><p>“Can we enjoy her a bit before-” one of the others started, only to receive a slap on his mouth. </p><p>“Idiot, you heard the orders. She is to be delivered a virgin,” whispered the leader, but my enhanced senses were ready to catch it easily. “And we can’t waste time. If we come across these sea worms, there’s no guarantee that they wouldn’t ambush us for the reward.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but frown as I listened to them, their words changing the landscape of the situation quite a bit. Not only they knew about Lillian, but they were also coordinating with the sea raiders that I had clashed with earlier, and they had orders to keep her virginity. </p><p>There were two probabilities, though I didn’t know which was worse. Either that the elusive captain of the pirates had strong alliances with the tribes in Germania, or there was a mysterious third party giving orders from the background. </p><p>It would be a lie if I said I didn’t consider silently pulling back and leaving Lillian to her fate, but it was just an idle consideration. After all, it wouldn’t have helped much. I had killed the captain’s familiar, a formidable dragon serpent, ruined his ship, stole his treasure, rescued his victim, and slaughtered his allies. </p><p>Feuds had started for much less. </p><p>“Do the smart thing and surrender, Astrid,” called the leader as he started walking toward the middle. I decided to interject, just in case one of the boys gets a lucky strike or so. </p><p>“Just what I was about to say,” I said even as I stepped into the opening. </p><p>“Who the fuck are you,” tried to say one of them, but the leader looked at me with suspicion for a moment, before his expression melted into fear. “You - you’re alive,” he stammered. “But the chieftain told me that you’re dead!” </p><p>“It’s good to be recognized,” I murmured with a dark smile even as I waved my hand, wanting to start the combat with a simple opening to disrupt their organization, and if I’m lucky, kill one or two of them. A wind blade appeared in the air, sailing in the air with an eerie silence. Their eyes grew, and they tried to raise their weapons to block. Unfortunately for them, it was the wrong choice to defend against it. </p><p>Unfortunately for me, I miscalculated the strength of the spell, so all of them died, leaving no one to interrogate, which was a pity because I would have liked to know whom they had received their mission from.  </p><p>Also, I took note not to train with anyone until I could get better control of my magic. </p><p>“Marcus,” Lillian exclaimed, shock and relief mixed in her tone as she dashed forward to hug me. She was rightfully scared, as the idea of being imprisoned by a bunch of primitives while she was unarmed and scantily dressed couldn’t be pleasant. Astrid, on the other hand, stayed locked in her position, her eyes wide with shock at my magical display. Unlike Lillian who had watched me kill a dragon serpent and breakthrough a sea blockade, Astrid only watched me defeat a bunch of overgrown idiots, nor did she know about the ease I had defeated the bear. </p><p>I let Lillian hug me for a moment, enjoying the pressure of her barely-dressed body on my naked one. I even leaned down and stole a quick but heated kiss from her ruby lips. When I pulled back, her eyes were shining with worship and excitement. After saving her once more, I didn’t doubt that I could push her down and steal her virginity without arousing the slightest complaint from her. </p><p>Pity that we were facing a bigger issue. </p><p>“Astrid, go over their items and see if there’s anything useful. Food, utility knives, bandages, money if they have any,” I said, then, after a moment’s thought, added. “And also check if any of their clothes would fit to me. Maybe a pair of shoes as well.” </p><p>“On it,” Astrid murmured, still in shock, but she walked toward the bodies, starting to work on them. </p><p>While she was busy with that, Lillian turned to me, but her expression was serious despite our proximity, alarmed by my call to action. “What’s going on, Marcus?” she murmured. “Why were they looking for me?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” I answered back. At this point, I didn’t even a guess about their identity, let alone how Lillian could work in their plan. “It's like a puzzle with half of the pieces missing, but it’s too far-reaching to be some kind of attempt toward your family. They are employing too many resources and have too many allies outside Britanium for it to make sense. There’s something dangerous afoot,” I explained even as I patted her shoulder kindly. She earned a bit of gentle affection after everything, I decided. </p><p>The way she melted against my body left me with an inconvenient boner. Pity that we didn’t have time to indulge that… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The dance of hesitance on Jenny’s face was a nice change from her normally confident expression, especially when she was trying to stand still, but unable to prevent herself from squirming. Not surprising, considering I had just challenged her to masturbate publicly. Jenny might be amazing between the sheets, comfortably rolling with anything Natalia or I came up with, but when it came to more irregular actions, she was much shyer. </p><p>Normally, that included the displays of public loving. If I had challenged her in a more crowded place, I knew that I would receive a genuine scolding, but I was betting on the fact that other than our stewardess —a sexy but nonthreatening blonde bombshell— we were alone. The fact that she was still raging to go after masturbation —she had been hard to exhaust even before the additional pregnancy hormones joined the fray to boost her desires even further. </p><p>I had no problems leveraging that situation for my tastes. I wanted my Jenny to be more adventurous, she deserved to be so with her amazing body… </p><p>“Do you think… But I can’t…” Jenny murmured after a while. </p><p>“It’s okay if you can’t handle,” I answered, but I made sure to keep a small smirk on my face to maintain the levity. “After all, not everyone has the courage.” </p><p>“You think so,” she murmured, trying to mirror my smirk but unable to keep the edge of hesitancy away. She might be a ball of hormones, but her hang-ups weren’t easy to overcome. </p><p>“Why don’t you prove otherwise,” I said, letting my smirk widen as I leaned forward, our lips separated by an inch, hers parted open readily to meet halfway. But I kept my position. “Only the brave girls deserve a reward,” I murmured in a throaty tone that I knew for a fact it drove her crazy, and burning her eyes alight with desire. I put a blanket on her lap, and pulled back. “Are you a brave girl, my little beautiful Jenny, or are you going to let your fear prevent you from having a perfectly innocent bit of fun…” </p><p>“I’ll show you, you bastard,” Jenny murmured determinedly, though, her expression failed to match the strength of her tone, flailing badly. I let that go unmentioned, because she was carefully spreading the blanket to her lap, meaning she decided to follow my direction. I licked my lips in anticipation as her hand disappeared under the blanket, struggling a bit before stilling, </p><p>An expression of fearful determination appeared on her face as her arm started to move, her lips pressed tight like she was afraid of an errant moan escaping, her eyes darting back and forth, making sure no one was there. “Keep your eyes upfront. You’re looking more suspicious this way,” I explained her kindly even as I caressed her shoulder tenderly. No need to spook her when she finally gathered her courage. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured as she turned her gaze to the widescreen, acting like her attention was on the movie. A good idea, if it wasn’t for concentrated expression and glassy eyes, enough to arouse suspicion. Luckily, we didn’t have to hide anything. </p><p>I watched her move, but I noticed her movement range was still limited. Suspicious, I moved my fingers under the blanket, exploration showing that she was still wearing her tight shorts, her hand jimmied inside. “Come on, honey, your jean shorts are too tight for your fingers to have a range of motion. You won’t enjoy it until you get rid of them. </p><p>“But what if she comes with drinks,” she asked fearfully. </p><p>“You’ll still have your blanket,” I reminded her. “And this is first class, there’s no way she could say anything even if by some freak chance, she notices something,” I said, misrepresenting the chances of Tanya noticing something while simultaneously removing the negative consequences. It was a straightforward manipulation, but Jenny was in a particularly vulnerable state with her arousal. </p><p>She looked like she wanted to continue arguing, but I was ready to distract her. My hand already under the blanket, it wasn’t difficult for me to slide my hand to the side until my fingers were digging into her inner thigh. She gasped in shock, and I just smiled in response. She was coming around the idea. “Are you sure?” she still asked. </p><p>I decided to give the answer in a better way. I leaned forward with intentional slowness, my lips already parted, ready to smother hers. She looked hesitant, but that didn’t prevent her from leaning forward, her lips shining with arousal. We met in the middle for a surprisingly chaste, lingering kiss. The situation was a bit more erotic, of course, considering her hand under the blanket suddenly picked up the speed. I let the kiss linger, boosting her arousal further and further, so, when I slid my hands under the blanket and grabbed her short, she raised her bottom, easing my job a lot. </p><p>Free from the tight restrictions of her short, her fingers quickened significantly even as her back arched, our lips still locked together. Her tongue darted out, meeting with mine in the middle for a heated battle, her ability to keep a lid on her moans compromised. My hand free from its task, I was free to explore her amazingly fit body to my heart’s content, but I stayed limited to the kiss. </p><p>The moment was about breaking her taboos, not fulfilling my immediate desires. </p><p>When I pulled back, she let out a soft whine. “Please, don’t go,” she whined, her beautiful eyes shining with desire. </p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” I explained. “But you can’t expect me to miss the incredibly sexy sight of your single-person game. It’s a milestone.”</p><p>“Do you really think it’s sexy?” she murmured shyly. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement at her sudden burst of insecurity, making her look adorable. Adorable enough to eat. “Sweetie, are you kidding me?” I said, the desire in my tone genuine. “You’re a sexy redhead goddess, and watching you bravely owning your sexuality is one of the sexiest scenes in my life,” I explained, stretching the truth a bit in the second part. Yes, she was amazingly sexy at the moment, but not enough to get a seat in the hall of fame. </p><p>“Just one of?” she said, flirtatiously. </p><p>“Well, it’s a difficult competition,” I said, and she frowned a bit, clearly not appreciating to be compared to other girls and coming short. I continued before jealousy soured her mood. “There’s the time where I watched my seed dribbling out of your exhausted body after a six-hour marathon, or the day we spent in the private bathtub after I spent the whole day pampering you while you mewled like a little kitty, or the time…” I continued, her blush intensifying at each passing second. </p><p>“Really,” she murmured, blushing further as I reminded her some of our more spectacular memories. “How about now?” With that, she pulled the blanket to the side, giving me a glimpse of her hand caressing her entrance, straining her flimsy underwear significantly while her other hand landed on her chest, teasing her breasts over her shirt and bra. </p><p>“Much better,” I answered as I leaned back a bit, my gaze firmly on her body, my shaft in full mast once more despite the spectacular blowjob I had received minutes ago. “But how about if you give me a better view?” </p><p>“That will be too risky,” she said, and for a moment, I felt disappointed, thinking I might have read her level arousal wrong, then she continued.” I need something to compensate for the increased risk, what’s in for me?” she added, and I smirked.</p><p>“How about a nice reciprocal gift in return,” I said as I pulled my zipper down while I kept my eyes locked in hers. Her breathing quickened further, showing her excitement at the idea, her fingers only a second late to follow their direction. When I struggled to free my raging erection from my pants, she raised one of her legs a bit enough to give a much better glimpse of her entrance. “Excellent view,” I said even as my hand started trailing my shaft, my eyes drinking the sight. </p><p>“Maybe even enough to get into the hall of fame?” she murmured shyly, desire dancing in her eyes. </p><p>“Almost,” I answered, and she frowned for a moment. I used the opportunity to lean forward and grab her panties, their fragile fabric unable to resist my pull for a second before ripping apart. I wrapped the fabric on my hand, using it to masturbate, her wetness clear against my skin. She stood frozen. “Now, it is,” I answered. She trembled in fear and arousal, trying to close her legs for a moment before I warned her. “You don’t want to lose your glorious spot in the hall of fame, do you?” I said, and she trembled once more, but her legs stayed wide open, her fingers alternating between circling her clit and sliding inside. </p><p>“You’re a bad, bad man,” she murmured, but even if she was feeling cross, it was hard to maintain anger while she was steadily climbing toward an orgasm soon after a previous one. </p><p>“Are you complaining?” I countered with a challenging smirk. </p><p>“No, not at all,” she answered as she pushed her fingers deep into her entrance, her ecstasy climbing more and more, tempting me for more. </p><p>I decided that it was time. “Do you need any assistance,” I said even as I leaned down and grabbed her feet, pulling it to my lap before she could react to it. She looked a bit put off, but when I started rubbing her soles with my empty hand, complaints melted quickly in lieu of a fresh rush of desire. I caressed her soles repeatedly, trying to force her loudly as she drove quicker toward her orgasm, but she bit her lips determinedly, keeping it hidden. She even threw a smug smirk at me as the orgasm hit, her body rocking silently. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, her distraction was all I needed. While her attention was focused on combating the temptation to cry, she was too occupied to understand the implication when I grabbed her wrist and pulled her onto my lap. I didn’t push inside her no matter how much I wanted to, as that was something she was going to be done in her own volition. Still, I could feel her wetness on my shaft as she moved up and down, triggering my arousal. </p><p>“What are you doing!” Jenny exclaimed loudly, loud enough to arouse attention, she tried to stand up, but my arms were already around her waist, preventing her from standing up. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, I need a bit of help from you, it shouldn’t be a problem, right?” </p><p>I had a feeling that, if it wasn’t for the after-effects of the spectacular arousal she had just gone through, I would have received a sharp negative. Instead, she turned to face me, her expression wavering. “But, wouldn’t Natalie be angry about it?” she asked. </p><p>“It’s not that different what we have been doing moments ago,” I said. “You just need to caress me a bit to make me climax easier.” She still looked undecided, so I put my hand on her hips casually before trailing toward her inner thigh, my touch awakening her arousal once more. “Come on, Jenny, you owe me that much,” I added in a pleading tone, trying to push a decision to her. </p><p>However, before she could answer, she stiffened because she saw Tanya walking from the other end of the corridor. I reacted much quicker, grabbed the discarded blanket, and pulled it on her lap, hiding her nakedness from the sight. She looked at me, panicked, because my erection was forcing the blanket to make a tent between her legs, making the situation extremely obvious.</p><p>“We need to hide this, quick,” I reminded her.</p><p>“How?” she answered panickedly. </p><p>“How do you think?” I answered, giving her a glare, but didn’t make a move to actually make her move. After all, if worst came to worst, I knew that Tanya would act like she didn’t notice it. However, Jenny didn’t know that, and the sudden rush of embarrassment and the panic from the risk of being caught impaired her rationality quite a bit. </p><p>It took everything I had not to break into a snigger as she raised her hips for a moment, though the heat that covered my shaft as she lowered herself was a good distraction from it. I tightened my grip around her waist, and when she sent me a nervous glance, I nodded reassuringly. </p><p>Then, Tanya was here, carrying two drinks and some light snacks. “How’s the flight? Any updates?” I asked Tanya cheerfully while Jenny tried her best to act nonchalant, but betrayed by the thick blush that covered her body.  </p><p>“Nothing noteworthy,” she answered. “We are on schedule, and will take two more hours before we’re at the destination.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I shifted in my place, which, considering Jenny was still on my lap, pushed my shaft even deeper into her core. She looked at me angrily, but from the way she clamped around me, I knew that despite her protests, I wasn’t the only one enjoying the moment. Not surprising, considering that she decided that taking it fully inside was the best option to hide our situation. </p><p>The way Jenny stiffened on my lap while Tanya played the food on the tray was spectacular. Luckily, she was distracted by her own situation, because she failed to notice Tanya’s spectacular cleavage —two buttons open, leaning forward, bra absent— therefore didn’t get suspicious. I winked at Tanya in a moment of eye contact, and she blushed further. </p><p>Meanwhile, I decided to amp up the challenge for Jenny as well. One of my hands was under the blanket, close range to her clit. A push later, I was circling around her sensitive spot, adding another layer of arousal to her game. She tried to look at me angrily, but she was helpless. The authenticity of her anger was in doubt as well with the desire burning in its depths. </p><p>“Can you please get me a glass of fresh pineapple juice, urgent,” Jenny said, trying to send her away, which would give her the opportunity to gather the situation. Smart, but I was one step ahead of her. Her shorts were dangling around one ankle, so while Tanya walked away —with a rather excessive sway on her hips, I noted with interest— I stepped on it so when she tried to stand up, it stayed in place. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she started, but I had no intention of letting her finish her frantic statement. I grabbed her ripped panties and stuffed them to her mouth before pushing her forward. She pressed her hands against the next seat, which gave me the perfect access to her bottom. </p><p>Her moan was muffled as I slid inside her, invading her insides in a display of dominance I usually tried to keep away from her, saving it for Natalie. “The sooner we finish, the less chance we get caught,” I explained to her even as I slammed inside her again and again, her hips rising to follow the demand. Soon, her moans rose enough that I had to keep my hand on her mouth, preventing her from alerting the rest of the plane.  </p><p>I was caught flat-footed by the sudden shudder followed by her walls clamping around my shaft, finally triggering a climax of my own. Her legs trembled, but before she could stumble, my arms were around her midsection, and I pulled her back with me as I sat back down, once again pulling the blanket on, my shaft still inside her. </p><p>Truth be told, I was slightly afraid about the consequences, but when I pulled off her panties from her mouth, the only thing that left her mouth was an appreciative mumble. “That was … amazing. Now, I can understand the big deal about the mile high club…” </p><p>I snorted, not bothering to inform that it was far superior to the usual fare. After all, why would I, when she was mine, and was going to experience the high-quality version again and again… She had no need for the mediocre stuff. As she slid down to slumber, exhaustion catching up with her, my mind was on how best to leverage Jenny’s loosening sensibilities. We had a full night in the hotel alone, and I wanted to use that to the best of my ability. </p>",
