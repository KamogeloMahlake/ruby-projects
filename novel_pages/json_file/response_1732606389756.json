    "content": "<p>“God damn it,” I growled even as I threw the work hammer to the side, grabbed my spear, and moved aside. The last thing I expected was to be attacked by a gargantuan monster, tall enough to tower over me in a suffocating manner. </p><p>A desperate dash was not exactly the ideal way of measuring, but roughly eyeballing it, I measured it to be somewhere around two hundred yards tall, and about forty yards wide. An absurd size, reminding me of a battleship rather than a land animal. </p><p>A beast of that size shouldn’t have been possible without being crushed under its own weight, particularly as an insect … but then, I was in a pocket dimension, using magic to hunt giant corrupted monsters. </p><p>It was three years too late to talk about what was possible or reasonable.  </p><p>I turned my attention to more practical concerns, trying to understand its physical capabilities. It was huge, yet, despite its size, it reacted to my escape with shocking speed, adjusting its charge. Without the Fleeting Step, I would have ended up between its mandibles. I was glad I didn’t have to test the durability of my armor in such a way, not with the way the ordinary anti-corrosive iron from the hydroponic garden snapping under its weight. </p><p>I didn’t optimize the metal I used on the garden for durability, but even without it, it would have tanked the attack of an ordinary giant insect with limited damage. Yet, against the gargantuan variant, it wasn’t able to resist the slightest. </p><p>Worse, as it drifted closer, the air I breathed gained an acrid quality, like I had forgotten to replace my silver air filter after using it for an hour. And, since that bitter smell got more intense the closer the beast got, it was easy to assume that the beast radiated some kind of intense corrosive aura. </p><p>The speed at which the distant trees wilted confirmed my theory. </p><p>Dodging didn’t mean my problems were over. As I moved away, I was attacked by the other monsters. The burrower variants burst out of the ground, and the fliers fell down, trying to suffocate me, while the giant ones charged. However, there was something unusual in their approach. </p><p>Up until now, during every single encounter I had, the beasts had been attacking me recklessly, always picking the closest path possible with the exclusion of everything else. This time, it was different. The fliers circled around me in confusing patterns, the giant ones attacked in a way that forced me to a certain direction, and the burrowers did their best to block my path as they burst out of the water. </p><p>They were showing tactical acumen. It was elementary, but due to the numbers they attacked with, it was still effective. And, as if the situation wasn’t complicated enough, their new tactical awareness meant that they could ignore the fear effect that was spread by the trees. Combined with the rapid destruction of the metal platforms under the mandibles of the gargantuan monster, the defenses I had created for myself were being destroyed with incredible ease. </p><p>In response, I drew my sword and released several ranged mana attacks, each attack cutting through several flying bugs before dispersing. As I did that, I jumped on the back of one of the giant monsters, using it as a platform, which prevented the borrowers from tangling with me. </p><p>Five ranged attacks were all I could throw out before my Mana drained completely. There, I switched to my spear, one hand slashing with ease. At the same time, I used my feet to roughly crush the mana-dense shells of the slain beasts, using the opportunity to replenish my mana. </p><p>Luckily, their tactics were not only elementary, but also rigid. As I jumped between the giant monsters, the attacks of the swarm slowed down, and their movement shuffled in a manner that could be called confused. </p><p>The gargantuan one didn’t appreciate it, doing its best to turn to face me. </p><p>Luckily, for some reason, the mist around it was gone. It was similar to the effect of the trees in terms of the end result, but the process was clearly the opposite. In practical terms, the trees repulsed the mist, while the gargantuan beast was pulling it toward itself, devouring it, similar to using Meditation in a Mana-dense location. </p><p>I circled around it, leveraging its most obvious weakness, which was its turn speed. However, calling it a weakness was a stretch. It rotated remarkably well for a monster that was the size of the warship. Even with my improved Fleeting Step, taking advantage of that required me to stick close to it. </p><p>And, the closer I got, the more disgusting the smell started to get, warning me that my filter was reaching its limit. </p><p>I couldn’t help but shiver even as I split between circling around the beast and dealing with the swarm, afraid to imagine dealing with the gargantuan beast without my long list of advantages. I stayed away from its attacks even as I focused on thinning the swarm, focusing exclusively on the fliers. </p><p>Whenever I filled my reserves, I used Mana attacks to whittle their numbers, or I switched to spear. Reducing the tactical complexity of the situation before I tested the endurance of the titanic insect seemed like a good idea. </p><p>However, despite my successful focus on fliers, the swarm showed no change of pattern, suggesting that their new tactical acumen was not only elementary, but also quite rigid. Another welcome change.</p><p>Only when the density of fliers reached a point where I could ignore them, I jumped on top of the gargantuan beast. The moment I stepped on its back, my lungs started to ache, its corrosive aura surpassing the limit of my filter. </p><p>[-6 Health]</p><p>It did not matter. I stabbed its back with the spear, first without covering it with mana. It sank well enough. Unfortunately, the beast was far too large for it to be effective. The sword reacted in a similar manner. Neither result surprised me. I switched to my hammer. </p><p>It was time to show it how a Blacksmith fought. </p><p>I brought down the hammer, using the mana attack I had designed based on my Quake attacks, depleting all of it in one attack. </p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>A large part of its shell shattered, and for the first time, it let out a sharp sound, one that I recognized as pain. It was good, but the even better part was the burst of mana that spread as I shattered its shell, allowing me to replenish my mana in quick order. </p><p>Its mana was far more dense in what I called tainted energy, but my Cleansing Meditation skill allowed me to separate the two efficiently, allowing me to replenish my mana as I delivered another attack … and another. </p><p>I had a feeling that the battle against the gargantuan beast was supposed to be an incredibly difficult battle. And, without the gear I had created with my Epic Skill, which allowed me to resist its corrosive aura almost completely, it would have been. </p><p>Even the iron I tagged as anti-corrosive proved to be only corrosion resistant, the broken remains of the platforms darkening and rusting at a shocking speed. Instead, it turned into a steady, almost tedious, process, not unlike another forging session. My hammer landed again and again, using its mana against itself. </p><p>Its shell recovered from the damage, but not at the same speed I could damage it, slowly weakening under my attack. </p><p>Yet, even with all my advantages, an hour after I started, I was still attacking against it. If it wasn’t for the weakening of its corrosive aura as its shell got more and more damaged, I would have to retreat back to the fourth floor to replenish my Health. </p><p>Instead, I stayed on top of it, steadily destroying its shell and the flesh underneath, my hammer landing on it again and again … until the beast stopped moving, and burst into a sudden blast of light. </p><p>The sudden disappearance of the beast meant I found myself falling down. My limbs clenched in fear as I found myself in free fall, barely able to pay attention to the movement of the light. It gathered into a point, almost like it was about to turn into a skill stone, but when I got near, it turned into light back again, and infused my body. </p><p>It was a weird, ephemeral sensation, like there was some kind of connection between me and the land around me. It didn’t last long, but when it faded, it left me with a nice surprise. </p><p>My range of vision had just doubled. </p><p>“So, it makes the gargantuan beast a dungeon boss,” I said to myself even as I started dealing with the remaining swarm. It wasn’t exactly a big surprise, as the length of the battle, along with all of its abilities, suggested that to be the case. </p><p>But, confirmation was always welcome. </p><p>I went back to the fourth floor, as I was exhausted, both physically and mentally. Not to mention, I needed to replenish my Health. </p><p>When I arrived on the fourth floor, I was greeted by a very welcome surprise. My vision range wasn’t increased by three more yards as I had feared but directly doubled. Excited, I returned to the earlier floors, and realized that the same pattern held true. </p><p>I gulped, realizing its importance. An expanded range of vision would be useful while exploring the fourth and fifth floors, but it wasn’t what excited me the most. </p><p>No, that honor went to the tactical flexibility provided by the ability to see more than the other people in the dungeon. It would solve my biggest fear, which was to be ambushed. </p><p>Maybe I should see if I could tempt the attacks from more dungeon bosses before I went back. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment I stepped on the fifth floor, I was greeted with pain. It wasn’t sourced from an attack — not for the lack of trying, as every inch of me had been surrounded by monsters. Flying insects, giant monsters, armored ones, crowded enough to cut each other’s path. </p><p>No, it was the very breath I had taken that had hurt me, burning my lungs like acid. </p><p>[-17 Health]</p><p>That wasn’t the only source of pain, as the moment I stepped in, I found myself in waist-deep water, and the amount that slipped burning like acid. Luckily, I was prepared for that, and jumped on the metal wagon I had created. That way, not only did I not have to fight buried in waist-deep water, but I was also safe from the underground attacks. </p><p>I appreciated it. While the underground attackers weren’t any stronger than the others, their attacks came from a different vector, forcing me to pay attention to them as well. The situation was complicated enough, with my vision dropping to almost three yards. </p><p>Things would have been far more complicated if my armor couldn’t just shrug off all the ranged attacks. I danced with my spear in hand, the improved alloy easily piercing even the armored shells thanks to the blue glow sticking around the weapon. </p><p>I stayed on top of the wagon, fought with a speed I had never done before as I pushed my Rare skill to the limit, not even finding a moment to grow a plant. The monsters were simply too many in numbers. Maybe I should return to the fourth floor to replenish my Health, to avoid a dangerous situation. It was difficult to count, but I might be killing a dozen monsters every second.   </p><p>But, before I could make such a move, I was greeted by a very welcome notification. </p><p>[Level 40 -&gt; 41]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>That was enough reward for the first expedition, I decided as I jumped through the gate, returning to the fourth floor, to adjust my plans. </p><p>The first thing I did was to open one of the silver containers to consume a dense nutrition bar, replenishing my Health. The fact that the very air of the dungeon was dealing damage to me was not something I had expected.</p><p>I couldn’t help but shiver as I imagined what would have happened if my weapons and armor weren't immune to corrosion. Would have they just melted away and left me defenseless against the monster horde, all the while the very air itself burned my body. </p><p>Yet, even as I processed all the ways I had gotten close to the dungeon, one thing was clear. The dungeon was not unlike a puzzle, with each level increasing the difficulty, but one that was easily dealt with as long as one learned the appropriate lessons from the earlier floors. </p><p>The only problem was that I wasn’t entirely sure I was learning the ‘right’ lessons. Even as my skills improved, which unlocked new, more complicated recipes, every single one of them had been designed for usage by individual warriors. Not even a siege weapon, let alone anything more complicated. Even the carts and other logistic items were not included. </p><p>“No time for such pondering,” I spoke aloud, disrupting my own train of thought even as I stood up, ready to prepare for the second invasion. As much as I wanted to return to the base and create a few plans, I needed to confirm a few more details about the fifth floor. </p><p>However, first, I needed a mask. Luckily, I had already experimented on the poison while I was trying to isolate it, and knew two things about it. Silver worked well to neutralize it, and so did heat. </p><p>Fashioning a breather based on those two principles wasn't too difficult. The silver part was trivial, and even the heat part was not too difficult. I just made sure to heat up the outer layer and add an insulating layer in between. </p><p>I made the silver part detachable as well, so, if needed, I could always use my sole magic skill to heat the mask back up. I didn’t see that coming up, but there was no harm in being prepared. </p><p>“Now, the tedious part,” I said even as I went back to the fifth floor, once again resisting the pile-up of the monsters. My breathing was once again uncomfortable, but this time, not every breath resulted in a loss of Health, so I chalked it as a success. </p><p>So, I stood on top of the war wagon, fighting against a veritable horde, their corpses piling around before they disappeared periodically. They presumably left skills behind, but I didn’t have the time to check the waters for those. </p><p>None of them were able to touch me, but that didn’t make their presence any less intimidating. As I fought against them, I started to understand why dungeon breaks were such a dangerous subject even more viscerally. </p><p>Alone and wearing the appropriate gear, the insect monsters were not a threat despite their great number. After all, there was a limit to the number of beasts that could attack me at once, and the disparity in equipment and mobility prevented that from turning into a problem. </p><p>Yet, I could easily imagine the same amount of beasts overwhelming the defenses of the town with ease. I sighed even as I continued to fight, dealing with the endless swarm I had triggered. Thrice, I needed to return to the fourth floor to rest, and during one of them. I went back to the second floor to check the dungeon hunting. </p><p>I was still afraid of a sabotage attempt from the other guilds. </p><p>During the third trip, the numbers in the swarm finally started to lessen, but it wasn’t the only pleasant surprise. Another pleasant notification appeared.  </p><p>[Level 41 -&gt; 42]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>“Finally,” I cheered when I killed another beast, only for it not to be replaced by another attacker. At least, not a melee one. The ranged attacks continued to rain over my armor, but they were easy to shrug off. </p><p>I could have moved to hunt them, but instead, I returned to the fourth floor brought back a large sapling, and used Nurture to grow it.  </p><p>[-96 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Epic) 96 -&gt; 97]</p><p>Soon, I was looking at another towering tree. The additional notification was welcome. However, the moment I pulled back, the tree started to die, which showed that the same tree wasn’t able to resist the corrosion of this level. </p><p>“That’s not good news,” I muttered. Exploring the fifth floor without the assistance of the trees was not acceptable. </p><p>Luckily, its degradation was not instant. So, I quickly raised six more trees, surrounding the gate with a nice field, which finally expanded my vision. It was a welcome change, as it meant I wasn’t fully blind. </p><p>With the expanded vision, dealing with the ranged attackers was easier. The only problem, I had to periodically cure the trees. The expanded vision was worth the trouble, and the occasional points I received from the skill were well worth it. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no chance that the trees would survive in my absence, which was not acceptable. I needed a more permanent solution. </p><p>However, before I started that, I made several quick trips between the fourth and the fifth floor, using the excess iron to create a raised metal platform surrounding the gate, not unlike a pier. </p><p>Constantly walking through corrosive mud was not my idea of a good time. Only after I had finished setting up the area, I turned my attention back to the trees. I was tempted to try using Epic Nurture to somehow increase the poison resistance of the trees. I knew that was possible, as some of the farmers had that as a Perk. </p><p>But, after helplessly trying that for half an hour, I paused, realizing the obvious pitfall I had fallen into, constraining myself to the System because of convenience. </p><p>Why not use a technological solution, one that many startups had been trying to implement on the scale before the Cataclysm.  </p><p>Hydroponic farming. </p><p>I created several huge metal boxes, and filled them with soil from the fourth floor. Then, I set up another steam engine to pump water through silver heated filters, weakening the poison considerably. </p><p>The anti-corrosive floor meant that the roots of the tree couldn’t grow just as deep, but that deficiency was easy to deal with using Epic Nurture. Which meant, an hour of effort was enough for me to create ten layers of trees, allowing me to set up a base successfully. </p><p>Once that was done, I scooped the skills from the water. Every single one of them was Epic, and none of them was currently usable for me. </p><p>I stored them back on the fourth floor before returning to the fifth floor, spending most of my time working on my base. After all, with the way things were, trying to explore the fifth floor was not exactly a time-efficient action. </p><p>Especially since I couldn’t simply spread the trees. </p><p>However, my plans had been disrupted when the dungeon mist had suddenly split into two. </p><p>Revealing a gargantuan insect, charging forward! </p>",

    "content": "<p>“[Nurture (Epic) 109 -&gt; 110]</p><p>I sighed as I used another concentrated dose of swamp poison to further push Nurture to a higher level, earning twenty more points in the process. However, that was not the only thing I gained. As the proficiency of my Nurture skill passed one hundred, it experienced a qualitative improvement, allowing me to choose between growth and other options like better fruit yield, stronger structure, and other features. </p><p>It was not helpful for the task next in line, which was to create a path of trees toward the possible direction of the fifth floor that would also function as a mining path, but eventually, it would be useful. </p><p>There was never any harm in more utility.  </p><p>My process of exploration was direct. First, I created a huge mining cart, and temporarily added a simple lever so I could use it directly. Ultimately, I wanted to add a steam engine to make it easier to pull, but that could be delayed until it was necessary. </p><p>Then, I forged a huge number of railway tracks, which was easier to do once I created a casting system similar to the one I had used for the arrows. The Epic grade Forging skill allowed me to handle it even faster thanks to the increased mana control. </p><p>A realization hit me. “I don’t actually need to create trees all along the path, do I?” I said excitedly. All I needed was to bury those tracks under the swamp, which would allow me to find it without creating a giant path of trees that would be visible. </p><p>That didn’t mean the effort I had put into Nurture was useless, as I still needed the roots of the trees to solidify the ground under the tracks enough that my tracks wouldn’t simply sink down, not to mention keeping the insects away was a critical step while I used the steam engine when I eventually brought the base to its new location. </p><p>Not to mention, considering the number of times I had to go back and forth, running without worrying about monsters would be useful. </p><p>However, It also meant that, once that was complete, I could cut the trees to prevent the others from easily discovering my new base. It was particularly important since I had managed to turn the other guilds into a potential enemy when I refused their offer to establish a cartel. </p><p>Once preparations were done, I finally started moving away from the dungeon gate, laying a new railroad, with two layers of trees on each side of the path, with Epic Nurture allowing me to raise these trees in seconds. </p><p>As I moved deeper, I was also doing two additional things. Every time I laid a track, I checked the ground for iron ore. I had discovered a few deposits with five percent purity, but I just marked them before moving forward instead of excavating them. I was hoping for a higher purity. </p><p>At the same time, after every ten rails, I crushed several shells in the separator, then, released the tainted energy, triggering yet another monster swarm. That way, I was able to check the monster density and direction, which allowed me to adjust the route slightly, always going toward the direction where the monsters were the thickest. </p><p>As an added benefit, I was able to test my newest spear. It was amazing. Be it Mana or Health attacks, all flowed smoothly, allowing me to kill even the giant insects from a distance with one blow. </p><p>“I need to forge a whole set for myself,” I said. I was thinking of not only weapons, but also a thick full-plate armor set that increased my safety factor significantly. “No, two sets,” I added as I realized that I still needed to wear my old armor outside. I could modify the inner layer of the armor, but the outer layer had to stay the same. </p><p>I could probably get away with one sword as long as I made it look identical to the looted sword I carried with me. </p><p>***</p><p>Just like that, I found myself lost in another routine, and a week passed, where I split my attention between exploring the dungeon deeper, forging myself a new set, and repeatedly visiting the first two floors to keep an eye on my growing guild and make some preparations for some unfortunate eventualities. </p><p>The exploration part was a modest success. Since the fourth day, I was getting attacked by the flying insects at an increasing frequency, which gave me the hope that I was going in the right direction. Unfortunately, considering my process of exploration required me to constantly lay down rails, it was slower than I’d have preferred. </p><p>For that reason, when I discovered a new iron deposit near the railroad I was creating, I created a simple steam engine to move my old base. The move took less than I expected for a simple reason: While I carried the forging equipment and other sensitive items, I left most of the iron behind. </p><p>I used that iron to create an underground chamber filled with various weapons, from iron javelins to a sealed iron tunnel with several half-complete traps that required a touch of Mana to be completed. It was a good mixture of an escape tunnel, a safe house, and an underground fortress that I could use defensively. </p><p>Having near-unlimited anti-corrosive steel was useful for more than one purpose. </p><p>The concept was nice enough that I built another underground base on the third floor, but kept the entrance buried, just in case I had to deal with assassins again. </p><p>Of course, while working on all of that, I had constantly visited the outposts, and even started sleeping at the fort on the second floor. At the surface, it looked like overconfidence, as a dungeon could be a dangerous place, but for me, it was much safer than the town, especially since the first version of the guild building was already complete, and I didn’t have an excuse to sleep at the headquarters without raising some problematic questions. </p><p>Not to mention, we didn’t have enough people to defend both locations, so prioritizing the dungeon was the obvious decision. </p><p>However, what took the most time was forging my new equipment that was based on the new capabilities of my Epic skill. It took a week for me to create a full set of armor, modify the other one that I was wearing outside, and create three weapons. The hammer, in particular, took a lot of time due to it requiring a lot of metal, but considering how important the hammer was to deliver a devastating amount of damage to any insect I might face on the fifth floor that might be armored enough to shrug off my other attacks, I didn’t want to take a risk. </p><p>I liked my new weapons. Unfortunately, while that intense session of forging took almost half of my time, it only contributed five points to my Mana Forge skill, which was absolutely glacial compared to my old progress. </p><p>On the other hand, my Epic Nurture was growing leaps and bounds. It was already nearing a hundred and ninety, which was significant progress considering its nature as an Epic skill. The poison distillation setup I had was working well enough. </p><p>I was already working on the design of a second one, though this time, I would probably integrate a better filtration mechanism, and a more decent centrifuge, aiming for at least ten thousand RPM. </p><p>The last thing I did was to practice the Floating Step despite my distaste for flying, as the deeper I went into the dungeon, the more critical my traveling time was getting. Luckily, I had found a workaround when I was working on my metal safe houses. As long as I practiced it in an enclosed space, the Floating Step kept me from flying upward. </p><p>It resulted in some very painful collisions, but that pain was much better than actually floating into the sky like a balloon with a snapped string. I was yet to make as much progress as I had wished, but even with limited gains, I was able to make the Fleeting Step faster. </p><p>It was worthwhile as the distance I needed to travel across the fourth floor increased more and more.  </p><p>“Too many things to do —” I started to complain, only to freeze when I met a very welcome view. A sudden, glowing gate, right into my vision. </p><p>The fifth floor. </p><p>While it was an exciting prospect, I didn’t rush immediately. I started by surrounding the gate with five rings of trees, just in case there was a nasty surprise waiting for me on the fifth floor. </p><p>One that followed me. </p><p>However, that was not the extent of my preparation. On the railroad, I had been dragging a large cart that was filled with iron tracks. With my tools, turning the remaining iron into some kind of war wagon that was covered with iron spikes was not a difficult task. </p><p>I could use that war wagon as cover, a platform to climb on, or even a safe box if necessary. </p><p>I pushed the box, and followed in. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I arrived at the first floor — as usual carrying a huge cart filled with shells to the brim — everything that was required to move to the second floor was already in place. I saw several carts filled with construction materials, escorted by workers, which meant the second-floor encampment could be built even faster. </p><p>I didn’t arrange any of them. It must be Harold who handled it all, which was fortunate. I walked further, only to see Harold talking with someone. His posture suggested that whoever he was talking to, wasn’t pleasant. </p><p>“What’s going on,” I said even as I approached. </p><p>“Sir. We have a representative from the guilds gracing us with their presence,” Harold said, but his distaste was clear. </p><p>“Speak,” I said. </p><p>“Honorable guild leader. I’m just here to deliver you a letter,” he said as pulled an envelope. </p><p>“From whom?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s from a few other guilds that are looking to establish a local chapter in the dungeon, sir,” he said as I opened the letter. I didn’t need to fake a frown as I read the long and meandering letter. On the surface, it was just asking for an informal dinner where the guild masters could meet and discuss strategies, to be hosted in the town in a few days.  </p><p>However, reading between the lines, there was another message, one that was not particularly hidden. It suggested that I keep the dungeon operation light until we could have a meeting. </p><p>While there was no other explicit mention of their plans, the intent was obvious. They wanted to establish a small cartel, one that could pressure the town into giving them a higher share of the profits. </p><p>“Tell them that I will attend the meeting,” I said. The nameless messenger smirked while Harold frowned. I turned to him. “Start working. We have to start building the outpost on the second floor. The sooner we start, the sooner we can start making a fortune,” I added loudly. </p><p>Just like that, their expressions changed. “Sir,” the messenger started, but froze when I looked at him. </p><p>“What, do you want me to give up a fortune just because of a letter,” I said. “I’m not here to make a pittance.” </p><p>“I’ll deliver that message, sir,” he said before he turned and left. </p><p>Harold said nothing as we watched him move away. I could see him tense, and I didn’t blame him. I wasn’t feeling too different. In a more ideal world, I might have actually accepted their offer and maintained a low-key position. </p><p>Unfortunately, at this point, my wagon was firmly hitched to Maria’s side. A part of it was I owed them. Not all of their assistance had been intentional, but without their initial help, my life wouldn’t have been so easy. </p><p>Though, even ignoring that, supporting Maria was clearly the better option for me. They not only represented my only source of income, but they provided me unrestricted access to the dungeon, one without many uncomfortable questions being thrown around. Those two advantages were the cornerstone of my incredible development, and I wasn’t ready to give them up.</p><p>Unfortunately, this meant that we had made some very determined rivals that would benefit from our failure.  </p><p>“We should reinforce the security, sir,” Harold said. </p><p>“Do that. Feel free to invest eighty percent of the profit back to security. And, purchase anything Eleanor is willing to give up based on credit.” </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit daring, sir? If anything goes badly, we might lose most of our income.” </p><p>“No risk it, no biscuit,” I replied confidently. Admittedly, it was a significant diversion from my earlier attitude, as I was hoping to get a nice egg’s nest in case, but the latest transformation of my skill had changed my mind. </p><p>That qualitative improvement meant that, one way or another, I would make money in a way that wouldn’t be ruined by a new dungeon drop. A few extra golds I would be getting from the dungeon had suddenly turned useless. </p><p>It was a nostalgic feeling, one that I had lived through before. Back then, it was a trivial algorithm for a dating app that had unexpectedly given me a fortune that had allowed me to focus on my work rather than pandering to every little boring old man who thought themselves to be geniuses just because the university needed their donations. </p><p>And, this time, it was the Forge skill that gave me an opportunity for financial independence, the kind that not only allowed me to not have to worry about my personal income, but also research grants. </p><p>The irony was that both options — mathematical sociology as a discipline, and Blacksmith class — had been treated as useless options that could never be used to make a living by society. </p><p>Sometimes, stubbornness paid off. </p><p>I let my mind linger on the other things as I watched Harold organize the operation. The temporary construction workers were already separated into teams, but, to my surprise, only sixty crossbowmen split from the group. I would have expected him to pick more. </p><p>I asked about that when Harold walked to me once again. “They are the ones I preliminary picked for the guild, sir.” </p><p>“The reason?” I asked, more out of curiosity than anything else. </p><p>“They are the only ones that show the mixture of initiative and the obedience we need,” he said. “I thought it’s better to expand a bit slowly rather than hiring people that would wash out after a few days.” </p><p>A good point, but I was curious about his rationale. “And, you know that, how?” </p><p>“I was a marine before the Calamity, sir. A sergeant, to be exact. It helps me to see who will stick out and who won’t.” </p><p>“A good point,” I said. ”But, it must be hard to see the country you have fought so hard for disappearing into nothingness.” </p><p>“Nothing I could do, sir,” he said before he started explaining exactly how he picked up the candidates he had chosen. </p><p>The ease with which he had dismissed the value of his service and his country was interesting, mostly because it was a widespread phenomenon. I had tried to study that during my first days, but unfortunately, it was more of a psychological study than a sociological one. During the first days, I had just assumed it was the sheer impossibility of the Cataclysm breaking the old world order irrevocably. </p><p>But, now that I had discovered the Peace Field affecting every single town, I couldn’t help but wonder if there was any external reason for people so easily abandoning their old-world allegiance and higher concepts. </p><p>And, if there was one, whether it was accidental … or intentional. </p><p>I sighed even as I shelved that track of thought as yet another topic that I would look into when I had time. Or, as it exceedingly became likely, if I had time. The number of research topics I wanted to explore was getting more and more bloated. </p><p>I missed having doctorate students whom I could throw those low-priority questions at. Maybe I should start looking for a similar arrangement now that I had the necessary resources. Maybe I should pay a visit to one of those research institutes that kept rejecting me and poach a few people. Poaching their best members with excessive payment would have been a fitting payback.  </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to create a recruitment roadmap that doubled as a revenge plan, I had other things to focus on. Things that might not be as important in the grand scheme of things, but were certainly more urgent. </p><p>With the decision made, I focused on questioning Harold about the general direction for his recruitment and the security protocols as we walked toward the gate that connected the first and second floors. </p><p>And, I added a few twists of my own. </p><p>“Really, sir? Don’t you think large silver murals on every wall are a bit excessive? It would take several tons of silvers at the minimum. It won’t be easy.” </p><p>“Showing off wealth helps display confidence,” I said. “Not only do I want silver, but also I want you to cover the inner chambers with gold.” </p><p>I could see just how bewildered that request made him. I didn’t blame him, trying to make a dungeon fort pretty in such a gauche way was not a good statement. Unfortunately, the real reason was too important to reveal. </p><p>My Observe perk could only be used through metal. Silver and gold were much better than iron. Covering the walls with ugly murals would mean that, with little effort, I could establish an impressive scale of security.   </p><p>Not to mention, having a near-unlimited source of silver and gold around would certainly be useful at some point. </p><p>“That’s enough strategizing,” I said even as I stood at the dungeon gate. “It’s time to fight.” </p><p>“Shall I go first, sir,” Harold offered. </p><p>I thought about letting him do so in order to see his potential, but I decided against it. In a world where individual combat capability was the most important asset, a leader had to lead from the front to have even the slightest hope of fostering loyalty. </p><p>Even if the enemy was a bunch of insect monsters I could swat as easily as mosquitos. </p>",

    "content": "<p>[Mana Repair (Rare) 293 -&gt; 297]</p><p>“Well, that was straightforward,” I called even as I finished forging a very intricate silver-gold sword that gleamed densely with mana. To my surprise, improving Forge hadn’t required anything particularly clever. I just needed to forge various types of pure gold equipment and push the skill higher and higher. </p><p>That way, I was able to bring both skills to the threshold before dawn, even when I took multiple breaks to show my face upstairs, making sure everything was going well. </p><p>During the forging process, the only change I made was to stop bleeding into the molten metal. Unlike the earlier bursts, the denser Health I learned thanks to Nurture was easier to control, staying in the metal and allowing Mana to latch on easily. </p><p>That, combined with my steam-powered Mana crusher providing a Mana density that could hardly be matched outside, allowed me to rapidly push Mana Forge near the limit in less than eight hours. The ability to monopolize a dungeon floor was certainly an incredible opportunity. </p><p>It had been a shockingly efficient process, even when I didn’t neglect to improve my Repair skills in the process. Currently, both skills are at the edge of improving. </p><p>“Let’s just hope improving them again won’t be too hard,” I muttered even as I forged another weapon, this time pushing Forge to its edge. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 299 -&gt; Mana Forge (Epic) 1]</p><p>The sensation of improving a Class Skill was much smoother than absorbing an external skill stone, but that wasn’t because it contained any less information. The biggest thing, the Forge skill came with its own way of condensing Health, one that was different from both Nurture and combat skills. </p><p>It was closer to Nurture when it came to feeling, but with more viscosity. It felt heavier and moved slower. The differences were noteworthy. The modified energy worked far better to bond with the metal. And, more importantly, it was under the direct control of the skill, meaning the improvement in the skill quality was incredible. </p><p>But, all this improvement came with a very unfortunate side effect. Just like it had been the case for the previous mana attack trick, its effectiveness to improve had dropped considerably. Luckily, that was not my only trick. </p><p>While the skill was at one, it only contained the recipes for copper. Instead of forging them again and again, I once again used Nurture to imbue gold with mana, pushing my skill forward once again. It wasn’t as rapid as the previous attempts, but it was rapid enough. </p><p>Unfortunately, its effectiveness stalled when I finally reached a hundred and unlocked the proper forging recipes for pure gold. A big problem, but I preferred to focus on the benefits first.  </p><p>For one, I learned that the different types of metals actually required slightly different types of Health to maximize their potential benefits. It also meant that there might be other ways of using Health that created some unusual patterns. </p><p>That was a research direction that required far more than just a day to explore comprehensively. </p><p>Worse, I was afraid that it was too much for one person. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in a position to hire people, not without opening a dangerous box that I might not be able to close back up. </p><p>I repeated the same effort with the Mana Repair, and soon, both my class skills were Epic Grade. Interestingly, unlike Meditation, the skill name didn’t change. I had a feeling that, just like the Perks, it changed by the actions leading to the improvement. </p><p>Unlike External Skills, Class Skills seemed to have a memory for the actions leading to their improvement. </p><p>[Mana Repair (Epic) - 101 [Advanced Observe]</p><p>Mana Forge (Epic) - 102 [Advanced Creative Forging, Mana Control]]</p><p>However, even as I looked at the incredible development of my skills, I had a frown on my face. My trick of forging with the environmental mana had stopped working even when I was working on gold. </p><p>The reason for it was simple. Epic Mana Forge didn’t just have a method of condensing Health, it had a way of condensing Mana as well. From a certain point of view, it was excellent news, as it allowed me to forge incredible weapons. </p><p>Like the tiny spearhead in my hand, which was a unique iron-silver-gold alloy, based entirely on the new condensed Health and Mana I was able to utilize. It was superior to anything else I had in my possession. Not only was the material stronger and more flexible, but it also maintained an absurdly sharp point that could pierce through a rock without using any Vitality or Mana to reinforce the attack, and the thin wings it had on the side had an edge sharper than anything I had forged previously. </p><p>These attributes alone made the weapon incredibly valuable, but those paled compared to its real features. It enhanced the impact of Vitality and Mana attacks to a shocking degree. Not only was it easier to use those attacks, but also the damage was stronger than I was able to forge previously. </p><p>Several times stronger. </p><p>However, despite all the newfound advantages, its inability to use environmental mana was a deadly drawback. It meant I had to stop, absorb the Mana, deplete it back in just two blows, and repeat the process. It meant repeated pauses while working. </p><p>And, for the tiny spearhead I was holding, I had to stop almost two hundred times, which had extended the time of forging drastically— and this new method of forging was hardly time-efficient in the first place. Even the tiniest weapon I could think of took almost three hours to make. Forging a sword would take a full day, and I couldn’t even imagine how long it would take to put together an armor set. </p><p>That timeline didn’t annoy me from a practical perspective, though. I was sure that this tiny spearhead I was holding would go for an absolute fortune if sold in an auction. It would probably be enough to buy the dungeon I was currently in. </p><p>It was a bit of a stretch, but I was confident in my assumption. I had already used Observe on Eleanor’s sword back when I was learning the Vitality attack from her, and it was not made of anything that could compare to what I had in my grasp. And, Eleanor was rich enough to be a minority investor. If she was able to purchase something made of my alloy, she would have. </p><p>Knowing her, she would never turn away the opportunity to purchase a better sword. </p><p>More importantly, she was part of a large family, and worked as a bodyguard for one of their core members. I suspected that the family purchased a sword like that for her if it was possible. Meaning, either they didn’t have the access, or it was valuable enough not to be given to a guard. </p><p>Either way, it meant I needed to be even more careful. The previous ones, I was afraid of revealing because I didn’t want them to affect their profits. However, my new creation was of strategic significance. </p><p>That kind of importance could get assassins involved, and not the ragtag bandit Thomas had sent. Professional ones. </p><p>Admittedly, my experiences with Assassins were limited. Most of my knowledge came from the Pre-Cataclysm era, when I had temporarily joined a government project as a consultant. While my role as a sociologist was merely peripheral, I still had to go through a weeklong training to avoid assassinations due to regulations. </p><p>The number of ways someone could be assassinated was truly shocking, and that was before magic turned into a part of the world, adding thousands of other methods. “I wonder if there’s an Assassin class,” I said with a deep sigh, but stopped wondering. </p><p>Ultimately, I was not ready to reveal my secrets before I got a better understanding of the landscape, and that hadn’t changed. </p><p>Unfortunately, the need to keep a secret wasn’t my biggest problem. No… My biggest problem was a simpler one. </p><p>It would take a long time to improve Mana Forge to its limit. </p><p>I lost the ability to rapidly improve my skill by forging hundreds of weapons in quick succession. I had tried a few tricks, but the moment recipes with gold appeared in the skill, none of those worked. It seemed that I had to use the methods in the skill to forge the weapons. </p><p>And, even the simplest weapons were requiring tens of thousands of mana to be forged. I would be lucky if I got a skill point in three hours, and it would probably get more challenging as I improved. </p><p>“How quickly one gets spoiled,” I sighed, mocking myself. A month ago, I was happy to increase one proficiency point in less than a month. </p><p>Now, I was turning my nose to improving my Epic skill because a day would mean improving it only in single digits. I was still hopeful that platinum would benefit me the same way gold did, but I needed to work harder to get my hands on some. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe I could figure out a way to automate a portion of the process, or try to see if the more dangerous dungeons contained materials that could allow me to bypass some steps. </p><p>“Let’s shelve Forge and Repair for the moment,” I ultimately decided even as I started forging myself a collapsible spear shaft, steel with a gold core, though it was made with the old methods. </p><p>Since I had already created myself a superior weapon, there was no harm bringing it around for safety. And, once that was done, I went upstairs. </p><p>I wanted to be there for the creation of the outpost for the second floor. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I left the dungeon with another cart, accompanied by five hundred farmers and ten guards who were about to join the operation. Part of the cart was filled with the crossbows Maria had purchased for me. </p><p>Unlike what she had thought, I wasn’t particularly disappointed with the situation. While I welcomed the extra income the expanded hunting operation might grant me, at this point, I could leave the dungeon naked, and I would still consider the expedition to be a huge success. </p><p>At this point, Maria needed it far more than I did, meaning she had to be the one to visit the various towns and purchase crossbows. And if I needed it … I could always try to figure out a way to create a composite bow. </p><p>My Skills didn’t include woodwork, but that didn’t mean that I had to stay incapable of it. All I needed was to figure out how to make a half-decent bow part out of wood, and the rest could be made entirely of metal. </p><p>As for bowstrings, purchasing them was still viable. The guilds might purchase all crossbows around the nearby towns to pressure Maria, but purchasing all of the bowstrings was a move of a completely different scale. </p><p>Of course, the cart didn’t only contain the crossbows, but also several sealed empty boxes. The gold Maria had brought wasn’t a part of it, as I decided to just turn it into a thick plate and wear it under my armor. Considering its importance, I didn’t want to take any risks. </p><p>It was possible, while three hundred pounds of gold sounded incredible, from a pure volume perspective, it wasn’t too much. If liquified, it would be around one and a half gallons. It was heavy, but my Strength allowed me to carry it easily. </p><p>Admittedly, once I arrived at the dungeon, it proved to be an unnecessary precaution, but better safe than sorry. I led the crowd to our outpost, which had grown even more in my absence. “Sir,” Harold greeted, followed by a quick summary of the operation. </p><p>The performance was decent enough. I could identify several points that I might have done differently, but I ignored the temptation of turning into a micromanager and let him deal with those details, only adding a few strategic commands, both in terms of how to handle the old operation, and how to expand the new ones. </p><p>“Should we expand to the second floor?” he asked. </p><p>“Not yet. But, make sure to identify the best performers, and let them join the guild directly. Twenty of them for now,” I said, and passed Harold twenty Rare Nurture skills. </p><p>“We’re trying for the class upgrade, sir?” he said without any prompting. </p><p>“Yes,” I said, unable to help but sigh, realizing that it was not a feature that was particularly hidden like I had first assumed, at least, not three years after the Cataclysm. It was probably a bigger secret when I still had the money. “Just make sure to pick good candidates. Calm, smart, ambitious but not too ambitious. Most importantly, smart enough to keep their mouths shut about secrets.” </p><p>“Perfect foot soldiers, I got it,” Harold said. </p><p>I nodded. After all, he wasn’t wrong. While I had no intention of letting the ones Harold picked learn my true secrets — even Maria and Eleanor wouldn’t be able to touch house secrets, let alone Harold or the people he picked — letting them operate on the second floor already required revealing some secrets that were best kept under wraps. </p><p>I didn’t expect those secrets to be kept away successfully. Even without magical means like a camouflage ring, there were too many ways to dig out secrets, including simple bribery. </p><p>However, there was a difference between an ambitious recruit selling secrets for several gold coins, and an arrogant one bragging to everyone after a night of drinking. I couldn’t prevent the former, but the latter was easier to deal with. </p><p>“Excellent. Make sure to work them hard. Tomorrow, we’ll start building an outpost on the second floor,” I told him. </p><p>With that, I left him to organize the operators while I immediately rushed to the fourth floor. The first thing I did was to remove all the gold from my armor, and place it into the forge. It was tempting to start working on forging gold items immediately, but I turned my attention to the poison refinement setup. </p><p>With some poisonous mix already gathered on the sixth tray, I had an easy way to push Nurture to the limit. It merely took half an hour, and the poison at the fifth tray had been enough. All I needed was to repeatedly poison and cure a tree. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare) 196 -&gt; 200]</p><p>[Perk Options — Bountiful Growth / Efficient Harvest / Lingering Tend] </p><p>I picked Bountiful Growth, spending a few minutes to test its effect. It helped me to grow the trees far faster. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t even begin to understand how it affected the original setup. And, without understanding, I couldn’t reverse engineer it. A great loss. I might have done so if I had a few months to delve deep into the secrets of Nurture. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was simply not an option.  </p><p>Instead, I pulled one of the skill stones I couldn’t have deciphered before, and smiled at the notification. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Epic)]</p><p>I absorbed it. What followed was not exactly pleasant. I had absorbed many different external skills, which gave me a general sense of what to expect. However, the sensation of absorbing an Epic skill was still more unpleasant than I had expected. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare) 200 -&gt; Nurture (Epic) 1]</p><p>However, the reward was worth it. “Let’s try it,” I said even as I moved toward a tree that was completely grown and touched its bark, trying to use only one point of Health, wanting to understand the differences. </p><p>[-5 Health]</p><p>To my surprise, I wasn’t able to use one Health. A few more attempts showed that the least I could use had turned to five health, and it only increased in multiples of five. </p><p>That was not the only difference. The Health, for the lack of a better term, felt different. In a way, it was similar to how Vitality attacks had changed the form of the Health, but instead of turning solid and sharp, it transformed almost the opposite manner, soft and docile. </p><p>The difference was interesting. The impact, however… </p><p>“Incredible,” I gasped even as I watched the tree grow after one continuous burst of Health. </p><p>[Nurture (Epic) 1 -&gt; 14]</p><p>Due to the poisonous nature of the environment, I wasn’t expecting to succeed at growing anything before I visited the third floor and pushed the skill to a certain, high level. To my surprise, it worked better than I had expected. </p><p>Some more practice with Health showed that I could still use the old form of Health for Nurture, but it had no effect on improvement. </p><p>I raised several trees. The effectiveness of the skill had grown further, and I slowly lost the necessity to improve the amount of Health I used by multiples of five, but I was still unable to drop it lower. Even more surprising, the growth of the skill had stalled barely at its forties. And, even after I had started using the six different intensities of poison I had collected, I wasn’t able to reach a hundred.  </p><p>[Nurture (Epic) - 92]</p><p>However, that inability didn’t mean failure. Even with Epic Nurture barely below one hundred, I was able to grow trees effortlessly, both in terms of time, and in terms of Health required. Epic Nurture was more effective when dealing with the corrupting influence of the poison water, meaning the trees could grow far more cheaply without being restricted by the swamp, allowing me to explore the region faster. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the only benefit I had derived from my Epic skill. While Rare attack skills had various Health-based special moves, they all worked in similar manners. Epic Nurture allowed me to work with Health in a completely different manner. </p><p>After an hour of practice, I was able to create that denser variant of Health more smoothly, and it had some interesting implications, particularly for Fleeting Step. Some experimentation later, I was able to create a variant that allowed me to move smoother. </p><p>When using the softer variant of Health, the movement wasn’t as fast, but it was far more flexible. With those benefits combined, it was obviously the correct decision to improve Nurture. </p><p>Too bad I couldn’t improve my other skills to Epic before I reached level fifty, which was why I hadn’t focused on hunting beasts for Epic skills. Even with my skills maximized, I still needed a hundred points in my stats to be able to absorb Epic skills. </p><p>But, with the prospect of my class tempting me, I decided not to hurry up when it came to leveling up. </p><p>Not before I pushed Forge to Epic level. </p><p>Or, maybe more. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Code red sixteen,” Harold shouted, and the hunters immediately released their arrows before retreating, while all the farmers currently in the garden retreated into the first layer, each grabbing a spear as they climbed the walls. </p><p>A few more orders, and the outpost was ready to face a vicious swarm. </p><p>A successful drill. </p><p>“Very good,” I shouted. “Speedy response, and excellent work. You can return to your jobs.” </p><p>Harold gave several orders before he approached me. “How was it, sir?” he asked. </p><p>“Good, but it can be better. Make sure to continue practicing, especially with the new intake. I don’t want them to die halfway.” </p><p>“Understood, sir,” he replied. “By the way, the carts you have asked for are already here. Would you like to see them?” </p><p>I nodded, and he brought me inside the second wall, where three different carts were waiting for me. The cart portion was done well, but the same couldn’t be said for the connection between the pedals and the wheels. </p><p>It looked like I wasn’t the only one struggling with the more mechanical aspects. It was workable, but in a way, it struggled with the same problem most of my equipment did, high-quality material used to replicate smart design principles. </p><p>It looked like I either needed to find someone that was trained as a mechanical engineer, or start studying the mechanical engineering aspects more seriously. </p><p>Before I could leave the outpost for another trip, a guard had called. “You’re here, sir Arthur. Excellent. Lady Maria requests you for a meeting.” </p><p>I looked at Harold. “Make sure that everything goes well. Make sure to add another pool to expand the gardens, and handle the shift change,” I said. “Also, be extra alert for the possibility of sabotage when I’m not in the dungeon.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” he responded. I nodded. I appreciated Harold’s efficiency. He was competent enough to rely on for a lot of things. </p><p>I ditched the guard, not wanting to lose too much time moving at a slow pace. While I couldn’t improve Nurture to the degree I wanted, it didn’t mean I had nothing to do. If nothing else, I could try to get more Epic skills. While I probably couldn’t activate Quake Hammer before my Strength reached a hundred, making preparations wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>Then, there was the issue of the iron ore deposit about to be depleted. I could recycle some of the equipment like the old experimental devices if needed, but I much rather find a new one. </p><p>Just like my primitive poison refining setup had shown, I didn’t know when I would suddenly need a lot of iron for another step. Not to mention, as the arrow consumption increased, I would need more and more of it. </p><p>The trip back to town was not eventful. I used the facsimile of the Fleeting Step I had long learned thanks to the Perk guiding me, and merely ten minutes later, I was at the town. To my surprise, Maria was not at the headquarters, but at the outer town that was going through rapid construction, watching the show. </p><p>“Impressive, right?” she asked. </p><p>“It certainly is,” I said, but truthfully, I wasn’t sure. Yes, watching the people juggle weights measured in tons through direct application of their physical might was impressive, but it couldn’t rival what we were able to achieve before the Cataclysm had destroyed our technology. </p><p>Even before, I felt that we had been too hasty to abandon that path, and my own experience in the dungeon had only confirmed it further. Yes, the skills were amazing, but that didn’t mean we had to give up on the benefits of the scientific method. </p><p>We watched the show silently before Maria waved her hand, and created a bubble to block sound. “I have good news and bad news,” she said. </p><p>“Let’s start with the bad,” I said. </p><p>“Alright. We were only able to get three hundred more crossbows.” </p><p>“Really?” I asked, surprised. “It was not a problem I expected to encounter. Was it Thomas?” </p><p>Maria sighed. “This time, no. We underestimated the guilds that are trying to get involved. They swept the market and purchased all of them. A few of them are trying to sell them with absurd markups, while the others want us to sell them arrows.”</p><p>“Still, buying all of them…” </p><p>She shrugged. “Crossbows are rare weapons to begin with. Often, magic or melee are the better options. Moreover, most archery classes prefer a bow. They are much more efficient.” </p><p>“True,” I said. “Still, altogether, it’s not too bad. The first problem is a bit annoying, but could be acceptable depending on the markup. If they want to purchase arrows, it’s even better. I can even sell them to you in bulk, and you can resell them. However, just note that my stocks are not infinite, so don’t sell them cheaply,” I said. </p><p>“But, it would reduce your profits.” </p><p>“Not necessarily. As long as I can add a little profit to the sale, I should still be making enough to sustain the guild. Don’t forget that I’m only earning two silvers from each shell, which is just above my cost. As long as you sell it for two silver coins, I’ll be making a small but sustainable profit. And, I doubt that even if you’re willing to sell, an agreement can be done in a few days.” </p><p>“True,” she said with a chuckle. “They are pushing their luck a lot, thinking that we have no choice but to fold to their demands just because most guilds are not interested in a weak dungeon that’s too far away from the trade routes. We’re lucky that the System shop that accepts the shells is not too far away.” </p><p>I paused. “I recommend searching for alternative System shops that might purchase those shells. Now that the production issue is solved, it’s the best point to exert pressure from.”  </p><p>She looked tense. “Do you think that will work?” </p><p>“Maybe. Better safe than sorry,” I said. Silence stretched for a moment while she considered my words. “So, what’s the good news?” I asked. </p><p>“The silver delivery is arranged. Five tons. Moreover, I managed to get almost two hundred pounds of raw gold for you to experiment with, though I had to pull a few favors. I even went to the trouble of bringing the gold with me. The silver will be delivered with the next caravan.” </p><p>“That’s excellent news,” I said. “How about raw platinum.” However, even as I asked that, I wasn’t very hopeful. She would have mentioned it if she had managed to acquire that. </p><p>“Unfortunately, we failed to find any,” Maria responded. “The price at the System shops is simply too high, all the platinum had been long sold. That’s true for the gold as well. You’re lucky that using gold as decoration is back in fashion, so it’s not impossible to find.” </p><p>I nodded. While the absence of platinum was a bummer — I was looking forward to using it to push my skill forward aggressively — the gold delivery was excellent news. I should be able to create a setup that would allow me to push it to the limit, which would hopefully trigger another evolution. </p><p>I needed that before I reached level fifty. The opportunity for a class upgrade was simply too valuable.</p><p>“Speaking of the dungeon, is there a way to trigger class upgrades for Farmers?” I asked. “I have a few Uncommon and Rare Nurture skills I collected while exploring. I wouldn’t want them to go to waste.” </p><p>“You can, but I wouldn’t recommend it,” she replied. </p><p>“Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Not really worth the effort,” she said. “Even if you use Rare Nurture for class upgrades, the results are underwhelming.” </p><p>“How bad?” I asked. </p><p>“One point of Strength or Dexterity for every five levels bad,” she said with a shrug. “Not exactly worth the effort.” </p><p>“And, how about pushing the skill to the limit,” I said. </p><p>She shrugged dismissively. “Who would go through all that trouble,” she said. “Ultimately, Nurture is the cheapest Rare skill you can find on the market by far, merely going for a few gold coins. Also, Rare skills grant better perks.” </p><p>I thought about asking for more, but I could see that she was already getting bored. I decided to end that talk. “It’s disappointing. Still, even a point every five levels is useful, at least for the ones I hire for my new guild. At least, I could do some proper hiring. No need to waste time.”  </p><p>“Your call,” she said, utterly uninterested. </p><p>“How about a chess game or two before I returned to the dungeon,” I offered, and her disinterest was replaced with a smile. </p><p>”Perfect. But only a few games. I have a lot of work as well. B3,” she said, starting the game with an unconventional opening. I responded, and our discussion had shifted away from the dungeon operations. </p><p>I was happy with her lack of interest in the potential of the Farmer class. Once again, her bored answers allowed me to understand what was common, and what was not. Just the confirmation that Rare Nurture could be used to give them Strength or Dexterity was valuable enough.</p><p>It meant that I could help them improve their class without raising suspicion.  </p><p>Dexterity would make it so they can use Basic Shot more efficiently — too bad the Common variant required Perception — while Strength meant that they could actually use Combat skills. In this dungeon, especially, having a Hammer skill could be a lifesaver against a swarm, as I knew from first-hand experience. </p><p>Especially if I armed them with weapons of my own making. Together with some stronger crossbows, they could actually operate independently on the third floor safely, opening a lot of interesting possibilities. </p><p>Of course, while she dismissed the value of letting Nurture develop naturally, I wasn’t exactly sure. My meditation had evolved automatically, maybe due to the adverse conditions. It meant that the setup I had created to increase the concentration of poison from the swamp could be used to make their skills evolve as well, maybe even unlocking better classes in the process. </p><p>However, that couldn’t be used without a basis for trust — and before I understood just how big of a secret it was. </p><p>Between the first and the second games, I decided to ask her another question. One that I couldn’t ask the guards without ruining the identity of an experienced dungeon delver. “Quick question. Is there any way to see more through the dungeon mist?” </p><p>“Without spending a lot of mana, or spending a fortune on alchemical boosters?” she asked. I nodded. “No, not for this dungeon,” she said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“In other dungeons, you can always travel to the last floor to kill the domain creatures, which gives you a crystal. This crystal, when absorbed, allows one to see farther through the dungeon mist, but with the way the fourth floor is, it’s not really a viable path,” she said. </p><p>“Can’t you just use the crystal from a different dungeon?” I asked. </p><p>“No, that’s unique for each dungeon,” she said. </p><p>I nodded, adding that to the topics to be researched. </p><p>But, that was for the future. </p><p>Tonight, I had another date with my skills, to see whether my Mana Forge or Nurture would reach Epic first… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Before I started experimenting, I visited the first floor to show my presence and keep the area secure, again with a cart filled with shells. This time, there were no surprises. The defensive walls were sprouting at an impressive speed that would make a Roman legion proud, while the others were already in place. </p><p>Everything was perfect. All I needed was to purchase more crossbows, and the corner of the first floor would belong to my budding guild. I could probably take over all of it, but expanding into the second floor was the better option. </p><p>If I took over the first floor and made a lot of money, it would either push the other guilds away completely or encourage them to explore the lower floors to make money like I did. Neither option was good for my objectives. </p><p>I returned to the fourth floor, my mind already churning on how to improve Nurture. The pattern of improvement was simple. I just needed to use the poisonous variant of the energy while I used my Nurture skill. </p><p>It was a simple plan, but there was one practical challenge. The only reason I was able to push the growth of the Nurture was the poisonous nature of the swamp water, which allowed me to push it further. However, just like any other challenge from the System’s perspective, its improvement effect dropped off significantly after a certain point. </p><p>I tested to see if the tainted energy worked as a better poison. Unfortunately, it did not. </p><p>“Let’s start doing some chemistry experiments,” I said. When it came to chemistry, I knew even less than material science. The latter, I worked hard to educate myself after the Calamity, and working as a Blacksmith for three years gave me a lot of practical experience. </p><p>Chemistry, I knew nothing about. I couldn’t even start guessing if the poison was some kind of organism or disease, a type of metal poisoning, or some kind of magic effect that bypassed the easy methods. </p><p>“Luckily, that doesn’t mean I can’t learn,” I said. It was the whole point of science. Experiment and learn. </p><p>And, with the abundance of materials available, setting up the experimental setup was easy. I thought of three easy directions. Boiling, straining, and spinning. Three easy methods to get a general idea about the direction I should follow. </p><p>Boiling was straightforward. I just needed to get a container full of muddy water, boil it, and see if the evaporation concentrated the poison. Considering the number of open fires I had in place with the blast furnaces constantly running, preparing the necessary environment barely took a minute. </p><p>I even set up an angular metal plate over it to catch the steam and direct it to a secondary container, just in case the poison component moved with the steam. </p><p>While that boiled, I forged a number of metal sieves, each with different mesh sizes. For a few of them, I even went to the trouble of creating hexagonal gaps in case it had some kind of mana effect that would be affected. </p><p>Hexagon patterns didn’t help, but the material choice did. Using silver somehow reduced the poison effect, while iron, even the anti-corrosive variant, didn’t destroy it. </p><p>Third, I created a centrifuge. At least, a simple variant. The top-tier scientific centrifuges before the Calamity could rotate over a hundred thousand times per minute. I knew that, because I remembered one of the geneticists bragging for a whole meal about getting a grant to purchase one with an RPM of over two hundred thousand with some other specifications as well, with a price tag of over a million dollars. </p><p>Instead, even with my skills helping me, I was lucky to reach 300 rotations per minute on my current device. While my forging skills helped me to handle the material challenges, the real challenge came from the mechanical aspects. It was not as straightforward. </p><p>Still, it should be enough to work. </p><p>Once my setup was complete, I ran a set of experiments, which gave me three inputs. First, boiling destroyed both the fertilizer effect and the poison, leaving something closer to pure water. Not enough to drink it, but then the setup wasn’t exactly designed for pure isolation. </p><p>A more rigorous distillation setup might have given me pure water. Not exactly critical under the circumstances, but nice to know in case of an emergency. It meant that even if I got lost, I wouldn’t die from thirst. </p><p>The second set of experiments was simpler. Using sieves was somewhat helpful. It wasn’t exactly perfect, as the material on both sides contained both fertilizer and poison effect. The ground particles had worked more as a fertilizer, while the water acted as a poison. </p><p>I still put both materials on the centrifuge, which allowed the dirty water to coalesce even further. Once again, the water part carried the poison part. However, separating it from the water didn’t exactly make it more potent. </p><p>I created several large iron trays, and poured the water into a thin layer to make sure it evaporated faster, and kept that tray away from the flame, barely bringing it to a low simmer.  Not enough to boil it, but enough to hasten the evaporation. </p><p>That was the closest to the flame. The others, I kept farther away to better understand the impact of the heat. </p><p>And, once I set those trays and left them to evaporate, I went upstairs once more, dropping another thousand shells and watching the operation a bit. Then, I went to the second floor, and five minutes later, I returned with a broken cart and picked a new one. Maybe it was slightly paranoid, but considering Thomas killed more than a hundred people in his latest attempt, I didn’t consider it below him. </p><p>It was better to keep any potential spy guessing. </p><p>Once I returned to the fourth floor, I started experimenting with the water in the trays. The damage to the plants confirmed that evaporation was a good way to increase the poisoning effect on the plants, but heat somewhat damaged the process. </p><p>“How fun,” I muttered. The effect of the heat made the creation of poison water difficult, but not impossible. Luckily, I had the steam engine to provide constant motion. </p><p>First, I created a huge water reservoir, made of entirely metal, with an adjustable sieve at the bottom. It had a channel, which constantly dripped water into a centrifuge powered by the steam engine, which rotated at around 400 RPM. As the centrifuge rotated, the particles moved toward the edge, but spilled only when the water amount had turned too much. </p><p>Meanwhile, there was a small gap at the center, which allowed the purer — poisonous — water to flow to another channel, which led to multiple, layered trays that collected the water. Each layer, except the bottom one, had a Pythagorean cup setup, meaning water had been collected slowly in a layer, and once it reached a certain height, it started to drain until it reached the minimum level. </p><p>Not too different from using a hose to drain a gas tank. </p><p>And, to complete, there was a ventilator attached to the steam engine, creating wind to enhance evaporation speed. </p><p>As each layer evaporated, the ones at the lower layers started to gather denser poison. That way, the process was sustainable without constant supervision — other than cleaning the sieves occasionally — giving me a selection of poisons of different concentrations to choose from, which I could use to improve my Nurture skills. </p><p>Since I needed to improve my Nurture ability quickly, I built the tray system larger than necessary. It consumed almost fifteen metric tons of corrosion-resistant iron, with each tray spreading almost a thousand square feet, which was the size of a decent three-bedroom apartment. Connected to each tray, there was a reservoir that didn’t drain even when the suction setup was triggered, allowing me to get a sample from whichever layer I wished.  </p><p>As I worked on adding more trays to the bottom, the first layer reservoir and the tray had been filled, and the tray section had been drained thrice, while the second reservoir had collected a decent amount. </p><p>Unfortunately, the evaporation process required some time, meaning I needed to work more.  </p><p>“Let’s try it,” I said even as I scooped a small bucket from both the first and the second reservoirs. And, I used the first one on a mature tree. </p><p>[-48 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Rare)  97 -&gt; 99]</p><p>“Not bad, but it could be better,” I said even as I took a cutting from the tree, and grew a new one. </p><p>[-123 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Rare)  99 -&gt; 106]</p><p>“Much better,” I said even as I repeated it a few times. The poison from the first layer lost its effectiveness at just above a hundred and thirty attempts, while the second one kept me going a bit more. When I finished, my Nurture skills had developed significantly. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare) - 152]</p><p>It was promising. Once the fourth reservoir had enough poisoned water, I should be able to complete it, but I had no intention of breaking the setup once I completed it. After all, since each layer constantly evaporated, it would take longer and longer for the lower layers to be filled with water. </p><p>Without a doubt, the Epic variant of the skill would require even more potent poisons. </p><p>There was another benefit of keeping the setup. It could be used to rapidly increase the skills of the other Farmers, which might actually unlock better variants if we pushed it far enough. Maria had already confirmed that class upgrades were not a secret. </p><p>However, I didn’t know if there was any difference between doing that through skill evolution and skill stones. Testing that with a few volunteers might actually help. However, at this point, I couldn’t do that with the eight thousand farmers currently working. I had already rocked the boat enough for the moment. </p><p>Once again, just because it was an open secret for the powerful families didn’t mean I could reveal it without putting a target on my back. </p><p>Well, another target. </p><p>“Patience,” I said even as I moved toward my mining pit to crash some more ore, refilling the ore feeder for the blast furnace. However, I noticed that the deposit was running out. </p><p>It was good that I was planning to start an expedition once I improved my Nurture skills to the limit. Since I was going to create a path with the trees, adding some rails and a small, steam-powered engine to bring back the ore wouldn’t be too difficult. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I stepped through the gate to return to the first floor with another cart holding five hundred shells, I met with a welcome sight. The small outpost had progressed far more than I had expected. </p><p>The internal fort I envisioned was already completed with solid bricks, perfect enough to suggest the involvement of a specialized class, and the second ring was already half complete. And, that wasn’t even the only change. Nearby, there was a pool that was almost ten times larger than what I had dug that was also considerably deeper. From that pool, a half-completed water canal stretched deeper.  </p><p>As I drifted closer, I started to be able to capture more details. Soon, I came to an expanded tree plantation, with almost a hundred saplings in place, though the growth of the new ones was much lower. Those changes were based on my orders, yet, the progress was surprising. </p><p>Then, there were the ones I didn’t order. The first thing that surprised me was the number of people in the camp. When I left, there were exactly fifty-five people there. But, as I approached, I could easily count a hundred, with more out of my view. </p><p>Most of the new additions were Farmers. The number of hunters and reserve forces was leveraged as fifty. And, with all of them committed to the hunt, their hunting efficiency was high. A few people were running into the deep, only to return with two or three monsters chasing them, their movement too fluid for them to not have Dexterity. </p><p>Once the monsters they brought along drifted into the range, the crossbowmen took them down. </p><p>The extra runners weren’t the only additions. Outside the second wall, there was a second team of farmers, growing an orchard of fruit trees, with smaller plants like tomatoes spread in between. Outside all, there were twenty guards defending the encampment. </p><p>While I took in the changes, Harold approached. He silently gestured to the cart, and the workers rushed forward to take and empty the cart. “An excellent haul for an hour of work, sir. Almost half of ours,” he said. </p><p>An obvious way of underlining his success, but I could see that he was tense. The reason was obvious, the development of the outpost was outside my orders, and he was afraid that I would disapprove. “Good work,” I said, removing that fear. “How are the contingency plans coming along?” </p><p>He paused. “T-they are in development, sir,” he said. As he said that, he glanced at the extra guards that were standing around, implying that the security was not in doubt. </p><p>“It’s good that you prioritized the development, but don’t do that at the expense of security. Once you finish the second wall, start drilling the emergency plans. I want to see something impressive when it’s time to change shifts.” </p><p>“I will do that, sir,” Harold replied. </p><p>“I like people that show initiative. Work for me well, and you won’t be disappointed. Just make sure to protect anyone that works for us, and don’t shortchange them for their efforts,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said. His desire to argue against the second part was apparent, but he kept his mouth shut. I had a feeling that my reputation for needless generosity was proving useful. </p><p>With that done, I didn’t say the farm that was growing food. It was working well, and considering the constant consumption of the farmers to raise the dungeon trees, having a local source of food was a good idea. Especially since we would soon have hundreds of farmers around. </p><p>“Continue the operation. I want to check the tree plantation,” I said even as I walked toward there. </p><p>“Sir,” farmers called, treating me like royalty. It annoyed me, but considering the alternative was dealing with constant assassination attempts, I decided to keep quiet. I ignored them even as I checked the base, wondering if I should raise the trees to their maximum height. </p><p>Having the ability to see more than fifty yards would have made the challenge of running the farm easier. However, it would also require a lot of alchemical boosters, which I currently lacked. And, for the moment, it was better if people didn’t realize the benefits of the water from the fourth floor mixed with the giant insect shells. </p><p>At least, not until I could move my forging base to the fifth floor. </p><p>I said nothing even as I used my own fertilizer to quickly trigger the growth of the trees on the plantation. It consumed half of the water, but provided enough trees to sustainably support a thousand crossbowmen I envisioned as long as farmers continued to tend to them. </p><p>Farmers watched my performance, split between fascination and jealousy. I wanted to talk with them, but I was afraid that talking too much would reveal some of my secrets. “Continue,” I said with a gesture instead and went back to Harold. </p><p>“I need a better cart, something I can work with pedals,” I said. “Though, make sure that it stays simple, I need to be able to fix it,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir. I’ll work on it immediately,” he said. </p><p>“Not you. You have a more important task. Delegate it to someone else,” I reminded him. “Actually, delegate it to three different people, and let each of them bring one. A good way to pick trusted workers, right?” </p><p>“You are wise, sir,” he said. It was a bit excessive, considering I just wanted an excuse to have three different designs I could examine for my own eventual take. I could have done it myself, but it would be a loss not to use resources when available. </p><p>“Good. They don’t have to be perfect, just make sure I can move on it faster,” I said. </p><p>With that, I once again left the growing outpost behind, thinking about my next step. </p><p>Moving to the fifth floor. </p><p>Asking for the designs I could work with pedals was a part of it. After all, if it could work with pedals, it could work with a steam engine powering it, meaning I could bring most of my base, including the metal paneling, at once. I could maybe even uproot a few trees if I could properly put it in place. </p><p>Combined with some kind of rail I could lay on its path and collect once the cart passed, such a model seemed to be viable for a one-time move. </p><p>Ambitious, but achievable. All I needed was to find the dungeon gate leading to the next floor, which wasn’t exactly easy, especially alone. The dungeon mist had reduced the visual range to twenty yards, and the fourth floor was huge. I didn’t know the exact size, but considering the third floor was somewhere between thirty and forty miles from one end to another while the first floor was merely ten miles, even my most conservative guess was around fifty miles, and eighty miles was not out of the question. </p><p>“And, can I travel to it repeatedly even if I discovered it,” I thought even as I considered the possibilities. The first three floors had unique cliffs, rocks, and other features that could be used to navigate, but the fourth floor was not like that. </p><p>It was difficult to separate one pile of wet dirt from another, and even worse, it was not exactly stable. Unfortunately, the only method I currently had in mind would increase the chance of discovery much further. I needed to decide which was more important in the short term: Discovering the fifth floor, or keeping my forge hidden on the fourth floor longer. </p><p>“The fifth floor,” I decided even as I once again moved deeper into the fourth floor, using the mana separator, once again using it to trigger a monster wave, this time using Breeze Spear to get used to it in combat … while, of course, not using the perk I had received. </p><p>The increased number meant that the dead monsters were piling up larger and larger. However, as much as the prospect of getting an Epic skill was exciting, it wasn’t my priority. My plan was simpler. I knew that, once the previous floors were filled with monsters, some of them started to spill to higher floors. </p><p>Four times, I repeated the trick, going in around my base in a circle, but all those attempts failed. </p><p>Either there weren't any different types of monsters on the fifth floor, or I was too far away from the gate leading down. Since my experiment already showed the existence of other types of monsters, I was more inclined to believe it was the latter. </p><p>Though, either way, it needed to be tested. I needed to get deeper into the dungeon. And, the fastest, most secure way was to create a path of trees going deeper into the dungeon. </p><p>While that was a viable path, it had two disadvantages. If someone stumbled upon its existence, it would lead them right to my base, but it could be handled by leaving some gaps and false trails. It would still be a risk, but considering the other guilds were yet to send their main forces, the time was the safest for it. </p><p>Once they took note of the money my guild was making, they would inevitably send more forces, and some of them would inevitably explore the dungeon. As long as they were willing to spend money, corrosion could be defeated. </p><p>By using sufficiently strong equipment, if nothing else. The corrosion effect was strong, but it lost its effectiveness against better equipment. </p><p> I needed to discover the fifth floor before that happened. Whether to move my base deeper, or just to visit and level up further — hopefully — was to be seen. </p><p>However, that brought me to the second problem. Currently, I had only one method of traversing the dungeon. Creating a line of trees that was miles long. And, it would be a slow and laborious process… </p><p>“Unless, of course, I decided to upgrade my skills,” I said as I looked at the three identical skill stones, their glow more intense than all the Rare ones. Epic skills, and while I currently couldn’t see which skill they were, considering the drop rate, they were certainly Nurture. </p><p>And, I just needed to push my current Rare variant to its limit before I could explore its abilities. </p><p>“It’s experimentation time,” I said to myself. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 51</p><p>I had a large smile on my face, flipping and playing around with a coin in hand, using Observe to examine it. There wasn’t anything other than perfectly aligned microstructures inside the metal, surrounded by a complicated enchantment I couldn’t even begin to comprehend. </p><p>However, this time, my aim wasn’t to solve anything. I just wanted to push Observe to its limit, to get a better understanding of what was going on. It had been easy to empower the spear attack and the Fleeting Step. Ultimately, it was an external object. </p><p>The Observe Perk wasn’t as clear-cut. I didn’t even know where to target. The object I was observing? My eyes? My brain? The latter two, in particular, weren’t exactly easy concepts. I still remembered how close I came to killing myself when I had tried to reverse Meditation. </p><p>Pushing a burst of life energy that I had modified blindly to a weapon was one thing, my brain was something else. Still, even with the risks, it was hard to ignore the temptation — </p><p>My thoughts were cut short when I arrived at the gate and saw two people waiting. From the way their posture shifted, I guessed that I was the target. I shifted my shield slightly while I looked at them at the same time, trying to see what was going on. </p><p>Unfortunately, due to the dungeon mist blocking my view, when I saw them, they were already forty yards away. Not exactly a dangerous distance, but not safe either. </p><p>“Hello, friend,” one of them called loudly, their weapons in hand. It wasn’t exactly a friendly call.  </p><p>I didn’t bother hiding my sudden tenseness as I looked at the two. I vaguely remembered seeing them at the dungeon, hunting monsters with a relatively decent success rate. They were not weak. However, unless they were hiding their power very well, they weren’t strong enough to threaten me. </p><p>Even with what I had revealed to the public — a strong warrior, capable enough to start his own guild — it shouldn’t be enough for the two to target me. Then, there was another problem. How did they know I would be at this gate? </p><p>It wasn’t the one I used in the morning. I chose to use different gates, as it made cleaning them easier. Then, why were they waiting here, where it was more dangerous, instead of ambushing me when I appeared on the other side. </p><p>It was already suspicious before one of them touched a ring, a thin line of mana appeared, and went through the door. </p><p>“So, what’s this about?” I asked, staying in place, trying to decide what to do. The message explained how they were at the gate, as obviously, they were just on the lookout. </p><p>“Since you are lucky while hunting, we thought that you might share some of your riches with the less fortunate,” one declared, trying to sound confident, but unable to hide his tenseness. </p><p>I didn’t need to read his tone perfectly to understand what was going on. This was a premeditated ambush, one that had nothing to do with the shells, or a mere payout of sixty gold coins. While that sounded like an incredible payout at face value, they had used an object that was capable of sending messages across dungeon floors. </p><p>While I wasn’t exactly familiar with the high-end magical item market, even the cheapest communication devices were measured in gold coins, which was the reason the world once again relied on letters and parcel delivery for communication. </p><p>To send messages between dungeon floors, which were famously isolated, would be expensive. Prohibitively so for two robbers who were weak enough to restrict themselves to a low-level dungeon with a hostile environment. </p><p>Meaning, they weren’t here for the cart. Still, it required one last test. “Fine, take it. I don’t need any trouble for measly sixty gold pieces,” I said as I started walking away, though I picked a diagonal route so that their target would be obvious.</p><p>“Hey, wait,” they said and started to move toward me, but before they could pick up speed, I was already running back. However, I didn’t run away. </p><p>No, I had a different plan in mind. Whoever planned the ambush was targeting me, and running away meant that I would be blind. Instead, I deliberately took a wide circle, the Fleeting Step allowing me to move easily. When I arrived at the gate, they were still searching for me in the mist, too loud. </p><p>I ignored them as I put the camouflage ring from my pocket, and put it to my finger. However, I remembered how the slight glow allowed me to discover its previous owner, and also hid behind a rock. Also, the camouflage effect was hardly flawless. It wouldn’t fool anyone with Perception if I waited out in the open. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to ignore the fact that I might end up taking another life. It was not the first time, and I was just trying to defend myself, but it was still an uncomfortable thing for me. Waiting for them to arrive while the two desperately searched for me made it even worse. </p><p>It felt more like cold-blooded murder than self-defense, and not for no reason. There was neither a judge nor a jury that would classify what I was about to do as self-defense, claiming that I had ample time to retreat. The legal system was long gone, along with the other conveniences of modern civilization, but for three years, I refused to embrace the Wild West mentality. </p><p>I would have retreated … if it wasn’t for my most recent discovery about the so-called peace wards. I could feel in my bones that their existence was a bane to humanity, but I couldn’t simply rely on past laws as my personal ethical framework. </p><p>But, I was also aware of how bad of a slippery slope it could be. A complicated question … one that I failed to resolve when six people stepped out of the dungeon door, only to see a full cart, but no sign of fighting. </p><p>The way they dressed was interesting. Their armor looked poor, and they were carrying a sword and a wooden staff, like they were here to hunt in the dungeon. However, the way they walked showed that they felt no danger from the dungeon. </p><p>“What’s going on?” their leader shouted while one of them split from the group, moving to deal with an approaching insect. </p><p>“Sorry, sir. He turned out to be a coward. He escaped,” the lookout shouted, and the leader started shouting about incompetence. However, seeing that the two lookouts were alive, their alertness had dropped significantly. </p><p>The two returned, and the leader chewed them up. Meanwhile, I carefully watched the one dealing with the monster, trying to get his measure. It was not a simple task, but as I watched him bisecting a charging monster easily, I could make a few guesses. </p><p>The first was his sword skill. With my own sword skill near the peak, I was able to read it relatively easily. It wasn’t exactly an accurate call, but it was at least a Rare one, with the potential to be even better. However, from the smoothness of his actual delivery, I would guess his proficiency wasn’t too high. Merely in the twenties if it was Rare, potentially even lower if it was even better.  </p><p>Something I could use to my advantage. The higher the proficiency of a skill, the more it helped its user deal with more complicated situations, something I knew from experience. </p><p>I stayed hidden, now observing not the one dealing with the stray beasts, but the others. </p><p>Right now, with the distance between me and them, there was no benefit of charging forward. Whether I let them go while staying hidden or wanted to attack, time worked to my benefit. </p><p>Also, if I was being honest, I wanted one of them to confirm that they were here to kill me. Killing people was a more difficult decision than killing mindless monsters.  </p><p>I waited and watched, trying to see where they had come from. The leader was clearly not too experienced, as he was wasting time chewing out failure when he could chase me. Of course, it would be the wrong move with me hidden behind them, but he didn’t know that. </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention to their weapons. Unlike their armor, their weapons were works of art. Smooth, made of an alloy I couldn’t recognize immediately, and clearly enchanted with something far fancier than a commonplace enchantment like Sharpness. </p><p>Not the kind of weaponry a bunch of bandits who wanted to make a quick buck would carry, which further confirmed a ploy. Technically, they could be here to make me an offer, but at best, it would be the kind that came with the dreaded ‘or else’ statement. </p><p>“Alright, just find him and kill him. I’m sure he went to the nearest gate,” the leader called soon enough. I smiled darkly. At least it solved my ethical dilemma. </p><p>I watched, waiting for them to act … and maybe learn how they discovered my identity.</p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 52</p><p>I watched silently as the group shuffled about. “How should we split?” one of them asked. </p><p>“Call me leader, you arrogant swine,” the leader responded, which gave me a clue about the state of their group. They had not been together for a long time. “Just for that, you have to go and find him alone.” </p><p>“You can’t be serious. You think you’re my owner just because you got hired a day before us?” </p><p>“I’m the only one that has an Epic skill,” the leader declared smugly. “Do you want to come and test it?” </p><p>I listened to them carefully, trying to understand what was going on. They were an interesting choice for a group of hired muscle sent for an assassination mission where someone level seventy had failed before. Though, maybe they had — rightfully — assumed that the steward had only died because of his carelessness, and a team of thugs would be able to kill me based on sheer numerical advantage. </p><p>But, if it was the case, they were clearly not briefed fully. </p><p>I wished that I was wearing the silver alloy set I had forged for myself. I left them below to keep under the radar, but it was clearly a mistake. I would have been feeling far more confident if I were wearing weapons that would hold against them. </p><p>Ultimately, as long as they split, and I can ambush the remaining ones, I would be able to deal with them soon enough. </p><p>“Leader, maybe we shouldn’t be taking it lightly. I don’t think he’ll be happy if we fail. It would be bad if he blames you for this moron’s idiocy,” one of the others intervened, showing common sense to deflate the tension. </p><p>I respected that attitude. Too bad it marked him as a priority target. The last thing I needed was someone calm and calculating to help. </p><p>“Alright, he can take the two idiots here,” he said. “Since they failed their only task, they can redeem themselves. He will be slowed down by the monsters, so you can catch up easily.” </p><p>They argued a little more, but I wasn’t able to hear all of it, busy slowly retreating. I kept the camouflage up until I was safely in the mist, and after that, I shifted my location, using Fleeting Step to look for a nice ambush location, merely two hundred yards away from the dungeon gate. I knew the general direction they would be taking, and finding them would be easy. </p><p>I just needed to follow the sound of fighting. </p><p>Still, I was happy that I cleaned the immediate surroundings, or, even with Fleeting Step, I couldn’t have avoided the monsters without making too much noise. </p><p>Once I found a nice ambush spot, I activated the camouflage ring once more, waiting for them to pass under me, shuffling slightly to make sure I would be merely a few yards away from them when I was forced to drop the camouflage field. </p><p>To make my job even easier, they were arguing as they ran, not paying enough attention to their surroundings. </p><p>I waited until they passed me and then attacked, targeting the one with the Rare skill first. To his credit, he managed to react to my assault in time, far faster than I had expected. His Dexterity score must have been amazing. </p><p>Unfortunately, he tried to parry my hammer strike with his sword. </p><p>[-50 Vitality]</p><p>My full-powered attack taught him the disadvantages of doing so immediately. His sword didn’t break, but merely deflected. He tried to throw himself to the side, but it was too late. It might have been different if he was wearing armor that matched his sword in quality … but he did not. </p><p>The other two weren't even able to react. Technically, a hammer was considerably slower than a sword in combat, but that was only true when comparing the skills of equal rank and proficiency. They died just as easily. </p><p>“Hey, morons, what’s going on?” the leader shouted. I frowned, unhappy that they had caught on to the fact that something was wrong. A mistake on my part, but I didn’t have the time to regret it. </p><p>“A monster swarm. We’re surrounded, and the idiots are already dead,” I shouted back, hoping that the panic would cover up the fact that I didn’t sound the same. At the same time, I grabbed one of the bodies and dragged it away. </p><p>It was a hasty plan, but not a terrible one. It was clear that they had been gathered together recently, and their hiring was obviously a hasty job, meaning that they weren’t used to their tactical acumen.</p><p>I took the sword, his cloak, and his pouches away, but touched nothing else. I threw the body to the nearest monster that was in a relatively concealed spot, and retreated more, gathering and agitating monsters near a hundred-yard radius, but killed none, deliberately turning them into a swarm. </p><p>Then, I once again ditched them by climbing up a steep cliff using the Fleeting Step. Once again, I activated the ring, watching them from high up. </p><p>“I can’t believe you broke another vial. You’re a disgrace,” the leader shouted. “I’ll make sure to deal with you.” </p><p>I had no idea what that vial was other than what I could derive from the context. I pulled open the pouches and found one bottle that was glowing with energy. I didn’t know how it worked, but a quick tap on the glass confirmed that it was breakable. </p><p>I threw it to a distance, right at the edge of my field of vision. A small flash of mana spread, and then I was hit by a subtle smell. Just like that, the monsters started gathering wildly. My eyes widened, wondering what would have happened if I used that on the fourth floor. </p><p>Maybe it would have gathered enough monsters to give me an Epic skill. However, at that moment, I was more than happy with wasting it. One against five, each with Rare skills with the exception of their leader, who had an Epic skill, was not a favorable confrontation. </p><p>I would take any advantage I could. The monsters rushed toward them, accompanied by the sound of fighting. Some of the monsters started to attack me despite my concealment. </p><p>“That’s a problem,” I said as I started running, ditching them. However, the smell of the potion they had used to trigger the swarm was still enough to make them chase more than they were used to. </p><p>Once again, I circled their approximate location, and once again prepared to attack them from behind. Ultimately, it was my best chance. </p><p>When I found them, they were already dealing with the monster wave, careless enough to spread so that they could deal with the monsters more smoothly. Currently, only two of them were visible due to mist. A mistake, one that I could truly leverage thanks to my newly discovered trick of enhancing Fleeting Step with Health.</p><p>As much as I wanted to, slowly getting close to them under concealment was not an option, as it wasn’t effective against the monsters. </p><p>Instead, I moved forward as smoothly as possible, using my newly acquired sword against the monsters to avoid making loud sounds. Though, it was certainly a smooth experience, both the quality of the sword and the enchantment made the task even easier. </p><p>Notably, even with its apparent quality, it still degraded as I killed the beasts. It was considerably slower, but it still did. </p><p>“Finally, you’re here,” one of them began talking as he caught me from the corner of his eye while I approached even closer, the cloak and the sword enough to disguise myself as my past victim. I walked closer, keeping the cloak tight around me. </p><p>Before I could kill the two, I entered the field of view of the third one. It was the one that I identified as the smart one. “He’s an imposter!” he shouted. The speed he noticed despite everything suggested he had perception. </p><p>A big problem. Luckily, without proper armor, they couldn’t just ignore the monsters and regroup. I caught up with the first one before they could. With our weapons equal, the proficiency difference proved deadly.</p><p>Before the others could arrive, I had already decapitated him. “Quick, gather together,” the calm one shouted, recognizing the threat. It was too late. I switched to my hammer even as I used the enhanced version of the Fleeting Step for the first time. </p><p>Covering twenty yards in an instant, making a loud noise in the process. </p><p>[-7 Health]</p><p>“He’s not a warrior, but some kind of rogue!” he shouted. </p><p>It was interesting. Not the part that he assumed I was a rogue, as he clearly misread the Fleeting Step. The interesting part was that he assumed that I was a warrior, and not a blacksmith. But, the implications of that, I could think about later. </p><p>He tried to defend himself, but he wasn’t ready for me to switch to a Hammer. And he was certainly not ready for a full blow. </p><p>[-50 Vitality]</p><p>Lack of information was always deadly. Health was useful against monsters, but against people, it wasn’t as effective unless it was paired with a strong set of armor to protect the vitals. Health wasn’t enough to recover from a body shattered into minced meat. </p><p>While the leader, with his Epic skill, was the biggest threat, I hunted the remaining three first, their unfamiliarity with the insect monsters making it a smooth achievement. The way they fought against in the midst of the insect swarm belied their unfamiliarity. </p><p>“You think you can fight against me? I own an Epic skill. I’m untouchable,” the leader shouted as I attacked him. </p><p>“Good point,” I shouted back even as I moved back, looted the four fallen ones out of their weapons and pouches, and retreated with a loud fanfare, using Health-Enhanced fleeting speed quickly several times. </p><p>At this point, the swarm had grown big enough to exhaust him. I retreated back to the gate, listening to him fight even as I forged myself an iron spear, using the benefits of my advanced Forging to my benefit. It was a thick piece of bulky garbage, but it didn’t look like it. It looked like something a king would use during a parade. </p><p>One with a nasty surprise hidden inside. </p><p>I worked on it until the sound from the insect swarm started to lessen, then, I rushed forward. “You again,” he growled, but his eyes widened as he saw my ‘amazing’ spear, glowing blue. “A magic spear!” he gasped in fear. </p><p>So, when I threw it against him, he treated it as a deadly plague. That was the other problem with skills. While they gave perfect combat advice, that advice relied on the perception of the user. </p><p>A deep, crackling wave of vitality energy gathered around the sword as he countered the spear, which shattered into pieces. It wasn’t a deadly explosion, nothing more than thin metal shards. </p><p>It was enough to make him close his eyes in panic. I closed the distance with another burst, one last hammer blow enough to bring the fight to an end. </p><p>I pulled his body from the middle of the swarm in case I needed the evidence, and I continued to kill the monsters.</p><p>I needed to come up with a convincing story. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 53</p><p>I barely came up with a reasonable method of action once I was done dealing with the swarm, which took more than strictly necessary as I continued to rip their broken shells even as I dealt with the last few monsters.</p><p>Technically, that part was not necessary to sell my story, but I didn’t want to waste the opportunity to bring a lot of forging material back to the guild. While I didn’t need them for my experiments anymore with my new setup, there was no harm in having them. </p><p>I could still use them to run experiments at night. More importantly, they would give me a convenient excuse to explain any sudden development I might achieve.  </p><p>Of course, bringing all of it out meant that I couldn’t hide what happened from Eleanor, but luckily, that was not a good strategy in the first place. Most of the details, I had no problems revealing. The only tricky part was to explain how I managed to deal with five people with Rare skills, led by one with an Epic skill. </p><p>Ironically, the shells — both intact and fragmented — came in handy when delivering my story. A little story of arrogance, and how they started fighting about who would get what I had collected. So, they only sent one to kill me while the others continued to argue. </p><p>Then, a shield attack broke one of the vials while we fought, triggering a swarm. Their unfamiliarity with the swarm allowed me to pick them off one by one. </p><p>It was a good story. I even had the evidence … in the form of a half-filled vial. </p><p>Naturally, I kept some for myself. The moment I was sure that the swarm wouldn’t spill upstairs, I rushed down to the third floor, hiding one of the swords and two and a half vials there. And, while I was there, I even forged myself a sixth fake one just to keep the evidence complete. </p><p>Unfortunately, whatever they had used to communicate was a single-use device, and the enchantment was gone, leaving only an ordinary ring behind. </p><p>“A good story, but it needs one last touch to be believable,” I muttered even as I pulled my new sword, using it to kill the straggling monsters, mana dancing around the blade. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 79 -&gt; 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Stout Defense / Determined Swing] </p><p>I completed the progression, because a skill at the limit, alongside a Perk, would make the story of taking them down more convincing. Not to mention, as an added benefit, the exciting life-and-death struggle against the six enemies while being trapped in a swarm was exactly the kind of thing that might push me to my limits. </p><p>As for the perks, I picked Stout Defense. While the idea of having another attack perk was not exactly unappealing, my experience with Fleeting Step had changed my mind. The auxiliary abilities were certainly useful as well. </p><p>Stout Defense was a complicated thing, almost the reverse of Fleeting Step, which focused on enhancing mobility. My new perk seemed like it would allow me to stand against blows that would have otherwise sent me flying. However, it was just a feeling, as it was difficult to test it without an enemy. </p><p>Monsters would have made a good sparring partner to test it, but only if I was wearing my anti-corrosive set. Otherwise, their mandibles would just cut through my shield. Truthfully, even with an anti-corrosive set, it would be troublesome to practice. However, I still wanted to. </p><p>The special abilities were too convenient to be ignored. </p><p>“I was lucky those idiots didn’t have their skills any higher,” I said. None of them even used any special attacks, which made it likely that they hadn’t brought their new skills up to twenty-five. </p><p>A stupid enemy was a beautiful gift. </p><p>“A lot of work,” I grumbled as I walked to finish the last step, which was collecting the broken glass from the vial. Extra supporting evidence wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>Once that was done, I finally stepped through the gate, pulling a cart that was filled to the brim with shells behind me. The only reason it didn’t collapse was the few modifications I had added. The good thing was that there weren't a lot of monsters around the gate. </p><p>It was weird, as with the delay, it was already nighttime, which meant the hunting operations should have ceased. Of course, while the dungeons weren’t affected by the day-night cycle — at least, to my knowledge — with the current number of operators, it didn’t make sense to work in multiple shifts. </p><p>And, for the current setup, a certain number of teams working at the same time was critical, or the monsters started to group together, making the process cumbersome. </p><p>So, the sudden decreased density was troubling. I didn’t abandon the cart, but I was ready to do so in case of trouble. Fleeting Step gave me the confidence to retreat, but not enough to feel safe. </p><p>The realization hit when I arrived at the fortress that was defending the dungeon entrance, only to find a scarred mess. The walls were still in place, but I could recognize the deep marks in the stone. </p><p>“Halt,” the guard shouted. </p><p>I removed my helmet. “It’s me, Arthur,” I shouted, giving the fake name I used, which I was willing to admit was an homage to the famous King Arthur. </p><p>“Wow, you’re alive,” the guard responded. “Impressive achievement. Especially with all the load.”  </p><p>“Well, I got locked in a swarm. I had been fighting for hours,” I replied. Together with the signs of insect bites on the walls, I was starting to get a good idea of what had happened. The door opened, and I walked in. </p><p>Was I feeling a bit tense? Certainly. But, I still entered for one reason. If my assassins could control the fort, they wouldn’t have bothered to set sentries at each gate.</p><p> I was trying to find the best way to grill him, when a familiar figure burst in, but her exhaustion was clear. “De — Arthur. You’re alive!” she gasped, her relief clear. </p><p>“Yes, but it was a close call. I have a lot to tell —” I started, only for another familiar figure to walk from the mist. This time, one that was not as welcome. </p><p>Thomas. </p><p>The slight delay in his step was one of the two things he showed when he saw me, which would have already been enough for me to guess. But, his gaze lingering on the sword, with an obvious tint of recognition, was even more clear.</p><p>Not that I needed anything to be suspicious. The words of my attackers had already revealed that they were there to assassinate a guild leader and not a blacksmith. That had surprised me when I first heard it, but seeing the state of the fort, I had a good idea of what had happened. </p><p>They triggered an artificial monster wave. It was nowhere near enough to destroy the fort, but it probably killed most of the hunters, especially if they were caught unawares. </p><p>It was a transparent ploy, which was why I said nothing. Eleanor was not stupid, and there was no chance she wasn’t suspecting Thomas. And, she was more direct than me. The fact that he was alive meant that we couldn’t touch him.</p><p>“So, this is your friend that’s … brave enough to set a guild in this godforsaken town,” Thomas said, with clear distaste toward either my apparent age — I looked in my late forties with the bushy beard and the few silver, bleached hair mixing with the black — or the fact that his assassination plot had failed. </p><p>Eleanor’s expression twisted in anger for a moment before it smoothed. “I don’t see how that’s any of your business, Sir Thomas,” she replied, managing to keep her tone mostly smooth, then she turned to me. “It’s good that you’re alive. Follow me.” </p><p>“Wait a second, Eleanor. I want to hear it as well. I want to know how you failed in such a spectacular manner. I still need to report it to the family, along with the disappearance of the steward.” </p><p>“The latter is not my problem, Thomas. You have already questioned all the guards under your Charisma, and they confirmed that he left. I can’t be responsible for the security of any visitor,” she said, then smirked. “Especially since someone had taken all the family guards for a more important mission. Maybe you should explain that to the family head.” </p><p>Thomas didn’t look happy with the accusation. “Maybe I should interrogate him as well, just in case,” he said, and a familiar pressure landed on me. Charisma. </p><p>I hated it, but I was happy to note that, compared to the last time, it was much weaker. Previously, I wasn’t the target, yet I froze helplessly. This time, despite being the focus, it was just all of my instincts shouting at me to obey and kneel. </p><p>Being on a higher level helped significantly. Charisma was incredibly useful, but as a tool for subjugation, its effectiveness dropped significantly. </p><p>Admittedly, it was far from something easy to ignore. It was still a primal sensation, begging me to kneel just to avoid the feeling. If I tried to fight against him, it would be an incredibly difficult thing. It was why people with Charisma were treasured and feared in equal measures. </p><p>Yet, a chuckle escaped my mouth. I couldn’t help it. The fear effect felt too familiar. </p><p>It was a weaker version of what I felt whenever I tried to fly. </p><p>Thomas immediately pulled his Charisma at my reaction, his expression showing abject terror. At the same time, his two guards stepped forward, like they wanted to defend him, while Eleanor stood in front of me. </p><p>“I’ll report your failure to the family again, Eleanor. You can’t rely on hired help,” Thomas said as he turned and left, the two guards followed, keeping themselves between me and Thomas. </p><p>I watched them, not making a move. </p><p>Wondering what the hell had just happened. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 54</p><p>“Follow me,” Eleanor said, and we started moving toward the gate. </p><p>“What should we do about the body? It belongs to the attacker,” I said. </p><p>“Anything incriminating?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing except this,” I said as I showed her the bottle, not trying to hide it. </p><p>She frowned even as she opened her hand. “A lure potion,” she said even as she examined it, then put it in her pocket. The pieces of glass were taken by the guard. “Follow me,” she repeated. </p><p>I did. I had enough presence of mind to keep my mouth shut about the sixty gold I was supposed to get from the shells. Everything had its time and place. Eleanor had dragged me to a room and pulled some kind of gem, which radiated a soft blue glow.</p><p>Suddenly, all the voices from outside ceased. “No one can hear us,” she said, her voice the most serious I had ever heard. “Now, what was that?!” </p><p>“What was what?” I asked. She looked angry, but I opened my hands in surrender. “I genuinely don’t know. We have too many things to talk about. The death of hundreds of people, the lure potion, the fact that I managed to deal with six dangerous assassins, the fact we had to let that monster go despite it being obvious he had done it?” </p><p>“None of them,” she said, her tone getting more and more serious. “It’s about how you rejected the weight of his Charisma. Only people of higher levels can do that. So, either someone trained you for a long time to resist the effects, or you have been lying about your level —” she started, only to stop. </p><p>Probably because I looked shocked. I had no idea why it was such a big deal. But then, I knew very little about the secrets of Charisma. “Wait, can resisting Charisma be trained?” I asked before I shook my head. “Sorry, scientist reflex. To answer your question, I didn’t resist the effect. I was scared shitless.” </p><p>She didn’t seem convinced. “What about that laugh? It was obviously not a fake. No one can really act under Charisma. It must have been genuine, or Thomas wouldn’t have bought it!” </p><p>“Wait, can he read my mind?” I asked. </p><p>“No, but he can sense your emotions,” she said, looking even more confused. </p><p>I chuckled again when I realized exactly what had happened. She was starting to look angry. “Sorry, but I promise you, you’ll find it amusing as well,” I promised. </p><p>“I doubt it,” she replied frostily. </p><p>I couldn’t help it. I started giggling. Realizing that after everything, potentially the biggest part of my problem had been solved by a misunderstanding was funny … in a hysterical sort of way. “You know how I’m … kind of tense when flying,” I asked. </p><p>“Frozen in terror,” she said. </p><p>“Yeah, being under Charisma reminded me of that. With the stress of everything, I couldn’t help but find that amusing.” Eleanor looked at me as if trying to see if I was lying. I couldn’t help it, I started to laugh even more. Absent-mindedly, I recognized it as not genuine amusement, but a hysteric release of shock. “Good … that … you … silenced …” I said, trying to speak. </p><p>I collapsed, laughing. </p><p>She watched me like I was crazy, but soon, she started giggling as well. I didn’t know how much time we spent, laughing like a couple of crazy people. I didn’t know how much time passed before we managed to calm down. She shrugged just as much, which was understandable. She was probably even more stressed. At least, I succeeded. She still needed to explain her failure to Maria. </p><p>Though, from what I had seen, Eleanor would have been beating herself far more than Maria would admonish her about an external sabotage. </p><p>The pressure did weird things to our minds.</p><p>“So, my involuntary giggle made him assume that I was a higher level than him,” I asked once we finally managed to calm down. She nodded. “But, why did he escape?” </p><p>“Using Charisma like that is an insult. You can challenge him to a duel for it, especially if he did so publicly, and I was there as a witness.” </p><p>“And his level is?” </p><p>“A hundred. It’s a known fact that he’s trying to pass the threshold. He just lacks the necessary resources” she said. </p><p>“People need resources for that?” I asked. “Do I need to prepare anything for level fifty?” </p><p>“No, only level hundred requires resources,” She said. </p><p>“What kind of resources?” </p><p>“I don’t know. Family secret,” she said. “Apparently, it differs from class to class. But, it’s well known that they are expensive. It’s why we bet everything on this dungeon. Otherwise, we can’t buy them for Maria once she reaches level one hundred.” </p><p>As much as I was tempted to question her from about six different directions, most of it related to the level hundred threshold and why it required resources, but I forced myself to focus. “So, they believe that I’m over level hundred, that’s a problem,” I said. “I doubt that I can fake it.” </p><p>She pondered for a moment. “Maybe not. Thomas doesn’t exactly have a reputation for bravery. We can probably say that you are at level hundred, but you’re unlucky enough to have a Militia class, it’ll be believable.” </p><p>Militia was probably the weakest class that was still classified as one. It only received three stats, evenly distributed between Strength, Dexterity, and Vitality. Of course, they compensated for this somewhat by having one melee and one ranged combat skill, which they could upgrade to their preferred weapon with a Stat stone. </p><p>It gave them much better combat flexibility compared to classes like Blacksmith with higher base stat gain, making them much more preferable as guards and other roles.  </p><p>As my own experience had shown, Perks mattered. A lot. </p><p>I thought about accepting it, as it would make my situation more secure. That way, I could develop safely … but would it be truly safe? It had been a close call. “No, let’s not explain it further,” I said. “Maybe even let the guards gossip how Thomas had been scared of me.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” she said. </p><p>“Yes,” I said. “I prefer if he doesn’t send any more assassins. Today, I survived by sheer luck,” I said. </p><p>“Good, that was about to be my next question,” she replied. “How did you survive a group of assassins? I doubt they were weak.” </p><p>“Luck and incompetence,” I replied. “Mine, and theirs, in that order.” She looked intrigued, and I gave her a long, detailed tale of my imaginary fight. It was more or less what had happened, but some details like using the lure potion had turned into an accident, which allowed me to kill the first one and take their much better weapon, followed by a tough battle where I pushed my sword skill to the limit. </p><p>Including my ability to halfway copy a vitality attack; one with a corresponding tale of how close I had come to death before inspiration struck.  </p><p>“Show me,” she said. </p><p>“Sure. But, I don’t need to tell you we have to keep it a secret, right,” I said. Knowing the Rare skills would come with one at twenty-five proficiency, and how combining it with a Perk helped, it felt like a good compromise. </p><p>With her bias for sword skills, she would have no trouble accepting it. Not only that, but it would also explain the rapid development I planned to show once I upgraded to Rare skill. </p><p>The best part, while it was an impressive achievement, it was nothing more than a pointless gimmick from her perspective. I even had planned a long explanation where I would reveal my Rare Nurture skill and how it had helped me to control my Health.</p><p>She didn’t even ask that, accepting my achievement as a display of my talent. “What a waste it is that you ended up as a Blacksmith,” she sighed deeply. </p><p>“And what a waste we don’t have time to spar,” I said, happy to end my story without any hard questions. </p><p>“Yes, I have a lot of things to do,” she said. “Who would have guessed that bastard can get his hands on pure lure potions.” </p><p>“I’m guessing it’s the thing in the bottle,” I said. “What exactly is it?” </p><p>“A controlled substance, made from a recipe,” she said. “The function is simple. It radiates a smell that draws the dungeon monsters at a certain radius to a target, depending on the dose and amount used.” </p><p>“I’m guessing it’s not usually used as a full bottle,” I said. </p><p>“No, usually, it’s used as a diluted mix,” she said. </p><p>“But it’s not forbidden,” I said. </p><p>“No. They are not really a risk to any mature dungeon operation,” she said. </p><p>“Because there are not enough monsters to create a swarm in a dungeon with continued hunting,” I said. </p><p>“Exactly,” she said. “Of course, we were supposed to have sentries preventing exactly that, but with the family guards gone, we’re already overextended. Still, I should have been prepared. I just didn’t expect that bastard to be vicious enough to kill that many people just to take over the command. That’s my mistake,” she said. </p><p>She didn’t seem particularly torn up about the deaths, and more about them representing her failure. </p><p>I didn’t like it. I wanted to blame her, but it wouldn’t be fair. She was fighting for a long time, and during that, she clearly saw a lot of death, to the point of losing her sensitivity to it. It was just how the human mind worked, so I couldn’t even blame the System for it. </p><p>We got used to it in order not to go mad. </p><p>She sighed. “I need to go and visit the caravan, to talk with Maria. We have a lot of work to do to keep the guilds investing in the area. But, some of them would try to pull back. Do you mind staying here tonight to keep an eye on the dungeon? It should be over, but I’ll feel better if you’re here as well.” </p><p>“Sure, just keep it in mind when I need a favor,” I replied, acting like the ability to stay in the dungeon without raising suspicion was not something I wanted in the first place. </p><p>Especially the alternative meant staying in the town, which didn’t feel as safe with both Maria and Eleanor gone. </p><p>“Deal,” she said as she squeezed my hand. </p><p>“However, I can only promise help about the monsters. I won’t get involved with the guards. That can get complicated if there’s a spy among them. I need to stay aloof if I’m to convince people I’m really strong. Maybe I can hunt some more monsters. I’ll be even faster with my new Perk,” I said.  </p><p>“Good point. But, don’t tire yourself too much. We still have to spar once I return.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I followed her out. </p><p>She had only one track of mind. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 55</p><p>While I was asked to stay in the dungeon, I didn’t have command over the guards. However, I also went to a secret meeting with Eleanor after the crisis. She left in a hurry and I stayed back. It meant the guards had no idea exactly where I stood. </p><p>Thomas running after a confrontation with me complicated things further. </p><p>It was a problem because they didn’t know what they were supposed to do if I gave them an order. Of course, in a fair world, it wouldn’t matter, but life wasn’t fair. Making a wrong choice meant that they would be blamed. </p><p>“Don’t worry. I’m just here to keep an eye on things, and make sure that there’s no accident from the second floor,” I said, which simultaneously comforted them and explained my disappearance. “Just give me a new cart, and record the old ones,” I said. </p><p>“What should we do with the broken ones?” one asked. </p><p>“Just pack them and send them to the town. They’ll be useful for my guild,” I said. “Also, pass me a cart.” </p><p>“Do you need swords, sir?” one asked. </p><p>“No, those should keep me going for a while,” I said, pointing at the multiple swords I had on my waist. It was wasteful to use them against monsters, but luckily, it was not a problem for me. Their only use was to explain why I wasn’t coming back with a lot of destroyed weapons. </p><p>With that done, I left, dragging my cart away, and preparing myself for a sleepless night. “Well, maybe I can take a nap on the fourth floor if it gets unbearable,” I muttered, amused by the unexpected benefit. But, otherwise, skipping sleep for a night shouldn’t be too hard. </p><p>I was used to it. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to go to the fourth floor and start working, I didn’t disappear immediately. Just in case, I wanted to show myself a few times first, in case there was a spy that would pull another trick. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t waste my time. Instead, I pulled one of the swords, using Observe to examine the sword. It was a good opportunity to multitask, as not only was I curious about the secrets hidden inside a higher-grade weapon, but I would also be able to finally test Observe properly. I had been running around since I upgraded it, which meant I wasn’t able to test it properly. </p><p>A part of that delay had been a lack of need. Pushing myself to the limit while producing that gold alloy to trick the System had given me enough of a boost that just listening to the System directions and relying on Creative Forging to adjust the designs had been easier. </p><p>Technically, I had used Observe while building the atmospheric steam engine, but it was more about checking the macro details that even Analyze could have caught. Hardly a way to test the limits of my new perk. </p><p>More importantly, I was excited to learn the secrets of a weapon from the System Store. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to start with something radical, I ignored that instinct. Instead, I started with using Repair, trying to get the path to Repair the weapon. </p><p>There was none. </p><p>It was not a surprise. The reason I was able to repair the other weapons was that the Sharpness enchantment was simple enough to be ignored while repairing a simple weapon, but even the more complicated bronze mana-alloy weapons I had been initially hired to mend required Warm Blow as a prerequisite. </p><p>I had basically bypassed that requirement by doing the repair manually. From the System perspective, what I had been doing was cheating. </p><p>Clearly, for the more complicated enchantments, the Mana Repair variant wasn’t enough, and I needed one — or possibly multiple, considering I wasn’t receiving a suggestion — perks. </p><p>I had Mana Control, which was enough to bypass the enchantment and work on the metal without breaking the spell structure, but Repair skill didn’t know that. They both might be Class skills, but the perks weren’t transferrable. </p><p>A pity. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean I couldn’t restore the weapon if I wished to do so. One trick was even obvious. I could strip one of the swords from its enchantments, and replicate the damage on the other one, then use it as a cheat sheet. </p><p>An absurd solution that was too cumbersome to be useful in any situation that wasn’t exactly specific. “Well, not so absurd,” I muttered even as I chuckled. Ultimately, what I had been planning to do wasn’t too different. I would strip the enchantment, essentially ruining the sword, then destroy it repeatedly in different methods. </p><p>Just a more comprehensive version of the first model. </p><p>I had to, because as much as I wished, the weapons couldn’t be repaired the same way. The differences between different materials; not just completely different ones like bronze and iron, but also two variants of the same main alloy. </p><p>Problems started at the base material level. Mechanical properties alone had many subsets. Just the ability to deal with external force had many categories of measurement, brittleness which defined the likelihood of shattering without deformation, hardness which defined its surface strength, fatigue which was about resisting repeated and long-term force, tensile strength was about the maximum force that could be applied, resilience which defined its ability to absorb energy while bending… </p><p>They were all about the ability to deal with external forces, and it wasn’t even a comprehensive list. There were manufacturing properties, the way it reacted to heat, and chemical features like reacting to rust or other external attempts.</p><p>Those features had changed wildly between alloys, meaning working with a new alloy without the System’s assistance was an incredible study. </p><p>They weren’t exactly a problem for me for two reasons. First, I had been relying on the System suggestions a lot to compensate for any problem. Second, I wasn’t exactly trying to maximize the potential of any alloy. As long as it was workable, I would be happy to use it. </p><p>After all, it didn’t matter whether a fork was made of silver or steel. As long as one avoided making one out of glass — at least, ordinary window glass — it would work.</p><p>Unfortunately, all those details meant that I needed to learn how to repair each weapon type from scratch. Some, like the case of bronze weapons, were doable. Meanwhile, it would likely not be really useful for more complicated, unique weapons. </p><p>And, in the case of the weapon I had in my hands, it was a bit more complicated. I had only six numbers, which wasn’t really enough to make it worth the trouble of learning. I could forge pure weapons that could surpass their enchanted performance as long as I was willing to spend the time. </p><p>Unfortunately, bringing them out in public without a source to explain their existence was troubling. I didn’t want Eleanor to be suspicious. While I trusted her about most things, I had no intention of testing her when selling me out would solve Maria’s problem.  </p><p>It meant I had to spend time learning about them. </p><p>For the next hour, I used Observe, focusing on learning the nature of the weapon without the benefit of the skill. It was an iron-silver mix, and there was too much silver, enough to compromise the integral structure and base strength of the metal.</p><p>As for other stabilizing materials used, they were a mystery. I could break the enchantment to find out what they were … but, I could also go with a simpler route instead. </p><p>“An anti-corrosive plating.” It was a rough solution, one that would undoubtedly reduce the quality of the swords even more, even weaken the enchantment, but I didn’t care. The whole point was to explain why I could kill thousands of beasts without borrowing bronze swords to Eleanor. </p><p>Technically, I could have claimed the same without adding the plating, but this way, I could lend the other five to my future guild members without it being suspicious.  </p><p>It wouldn’t have convinced any spies Thomas had, who would have known about the issue with the swords he had armed his assassins with, but it wasn’t too much of a problem. If he continued to believe that I was near a hundred, new swords weren’t exactly a problem. </p><p>I only needed to go to the trouble to convince Eleanor. </p><p>I spend the next hour at the first level, slowly adding a layer of coating to the sword. Since it was a process that was more reliant on mana than heat, I didn’t bother going down to the fourth floor. The dungeon was kind enough to give me all the supporting material I needed, and the iron, I could always take from the cart. As for silver, I used the fake sword I had brought with me. </p><p>The experiment lasted almost two hours, and the only reason I was able to do that was the Mana Control Perk, allowed me to slowly detach and reattach the mana links between the enchantment and the metal. </p><p>Even then, the first one was almost a spectacular failure. The enchantment lost the link with the metal, which turned completely useless. The enchantment was still there, just useless. </p><p>The others, I had various levels of success with. But, the real success was that I got more familiar with Observe. Not enough to dare trying to overcharge it, but still satisfyingly so. </p><p>“Customization for the win,” I muttered even as I walked toward the fort once again, wanting to show myself for one last time for the evening, casually mentioning how the assassins were kind enough to grant me weapons that worked excellently in the dungeon, knowing it would be eventually reported to Eleanor. </p><p>I had some real experiments to run. It was time to get a better understanding of Mana and Health. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 46</p><p>“Time to return,” I said to myself serenely, and started walking back. </p><p>Of course, I knew it was not true acceptance. However, once the heat from the realization was gone, I was able to put it back into the pile of things I would deal with in the future. It was a big disaster, one that could potentially change the world, but it wasn’t something I could deal with blindly. </p><p>And, the first step was to confirm that it was actually the situation. Admittedly, studying it wouldn’t have been too easy. Even the simplest experiment I could think of, which was to give two groups some kind of tricky problem that was disguised as an IQ test, required me to access at least a hundred people, and hold experiments in two different locations. </p><p>Observing the new town was not an option, as there were too many variables to come to a conclusion. Maybe if I had the data from at least a hundred new towns, and a proper computer to process it —</p><p>“Not the time,” I said. While it was tempting to spend the next month coming up with fascinating observation methodologies that might solve my issue, it would have been ultimately counterproductive. Even the cheapest setup I could envision required a lot of money to run. More importantly, it would have been too obvious. </p><p>There was one important question about the peace fields: Whether they were intentionally there to control the society, or if that was just a side effect. As much as I wanted to dismiss the first option as a crazy conspiracy theory, I couldn’t. And, until I could, I didn’t have the luxury of experimenting freely. </p><p>I was even happier that I hid my Mana Forge and Mana Repair after this revelation. </p><p>Instead, I needed to use the opportunity to experiment with environmental mana. We wouldn’t stay here for long, and I had already wasted most of my time. It would be even more annoying if Eleanor wrapped up her business with Rosie. </p><p>Luckily, I could always use the excuse of getting inspired about sword technique if she was angry. It should mollify her. </p><p>Meanwhile, I found a nice concealed corner, leaned against a rock wall, and started using Meditation to gather mana. </p><p>To my surprise, it was slower than using the monster parts to refill my mana. Considerably so, but it didn’t take long for me to understand the reason. I barely ran the technique for a minute before the Mana density around me had dropped considerably. </p><p>That hadn’t been a problem with the monster parts. I could always shatter more. </p><p>I stayed like that, absorbing more and more mana, while the density around me continued to drop.  Reaching back up to three digits took more than fifteen minutes. There were certain ways to increase Mana density, that much was common knowledge, but guessing how effective they would be was something else. </p><p>”Alright, that explains why mages don’t stick around in small towns,” I said. That fact alone had changed multiple plans I had about my future. However, that didn’t mean my experimentation was over. Instead, I broke a few silver coins even as I dug a pit and snapped a few branches. </p><p>I was just about to reflexively reach into my pocket when I remembered I had a more convenient way of creating fire. And, casting a spell was faster than slowly releasing it back. </p><p>I raised my hand, ready to lose a hundred mana. </p><p>[-68 Mana]</p><p>“Alright, that was interesting,” I muttered even as I noticed the relatively small drop in the number. But, I didn’t need to think about the reason. </p><p>Even as the spell was in progress, it started pulling Mana from the environment as well, faster than I could manage with my meditation. Not only that, the spell had actually gathered faster, almost four seconds rather than full five. </p><p>Interesting concept. </p><p>It also explained why they couldn’t defend the town with Maria. I had assumed that it had been just the cost of Mana regeneration items, but clearly, it was also about resource efficiency and casting speed. </p><p>“Ignore the implications,” I said even as I threw the broken silver coins into the fire and melted them, and bled on them with my Health, followed it with mana. </p><p>[-85 Health]</p><p>[-9 Mana]</p><p>“It doesn’t work,” I muttered even as I had attempted a few times. But, the same experiment that had allowed me to create a Mana alloy for the first time didn’t work when there was some Mana in the atmosphere. </p><p>Even following the System recipes were harder, forcing me to isolate the environmental mana. It was doable, but even that was slower. An environment without external interference was much better. </p><p>I stayed in the concealed spot for one more minute, draining my remaining Mana in the form of a Mana Blow. For that, environmental Mana had no impact. Mana simply stuck around the blade until it lost its cohesion.</p><p>I practiced until I had made enough progress to support the excuse for my sudden inspiration. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 73 -&gt; 76]</p><p>Then, I paused, thinking if there was any other experiment I needed to run. I did not. </p><p>But, I had an observation I wanted to make. On the way back, I drifted near one of the farms that supplied the town with most of its fresh produce. </p><p>“Hey, this is private property,” someone warned as I walked toward the nearest tree. </p><p>“Don’t make a big deal. I’m feeling peckish,” I said. He looked ready to fight, but when I flipped a silver coin his way, he was quick to change his attitude. </p><p>I went to the nearest tree, and snapped an apple. Meanwhile, I just wanted to examine the tree from close up. The tree was draining some Mana from the environment. Very slowly, probably not amounting to more than a point every hour, but looking carefully, the movement was clear. </p><p>A stronger evidence was the greenhouses deeper into the farm. Unlike open fields, they had multiple guards around them, who wouldn’t have appreciated my presence, no doubt. However, I didn’t need to get closer. Even from a distance, I could see the way Mana gathered toward the building. </p><p>They likely had some kind of enchantment to increase Mana density. </p><p>Of course, I watch not just the greenhouses, but also the way some of the night workers operated, trying to get  a better sense of the process of farming. I didn’t learn anything other than Mana also playing a significant role in farming, but it was a good exchange for a silver coin. </p><p>Also, the apple was delicious. </p><p>When I reached the door, the guards didn’t allow me inside because of the curfew. I could have mentioned Eleanor’s name and entered, but it made a good excuse for my disappearance, so I just shrugged and walked back. </p><p>While I didn’t think I could avoid stepping into another peace field forever, I didn’t want to do that. Not before I could properly process the realization that I had been magically drugged for years. Though, the scariest thing had been the effects. </p><p>And, how easy it had been to excuse any stupid decision, staying in the town and working obediently, waiting for a convenient break rather than doing everything I could. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t some kind of fear that kept me away. I knew that, after three years of exposure, another night wouldn’t be harmful. However, going back into the town also meant talking with Rosie.</p><p>And, that woman was far too sharp to deal with such a thing. </p><p>I wanted to browse some of the Basic and Common skills I wanted, and maybe purchase a few of them, but it wasn’t critical enough to force myself. For once, I decided to be lazy and indulgent, rather than being drugged to behave so. </p><p>While waiting for her, I pulled my sword once more to practice, this time without killing the monsters. It was still more relaxing than calming exercises and ordinary meditation. I hated sitting around doing nothing. </p><p>Eleanor returned almost an hour later, and when she did, I was much calmer. “Hey, where were you?” she asked. </p><p>“Sorry, I know I was supposed to be joining you, but I had been hit by a sudden bit of inspiration,” I said, trying my best to sound excited. “It increased by three whole points, reaching seventy-six.” </p><p>Luckily, Eleanor was far more excited about the prospect to question the tone of my voice. “Wow, that’s amazing news!” </p><p>I was strangely glad when she drew her sword and charged at me, and we started sparring. It was even better than practicing, as it forced me to focus fully. We sparred for almost twenty minutes before she reluctantly pulled back. “I still have a meeting at the camp about the construction of the second layer of the town. We need to go back,” she said. </p><p>“Alright,” I said. “How was the meeting?” </p><p>“Typical, filled with more bean counting than I’m happy with; but we do what we must,” she said. </p><p>“And, how did Rosie react to my situation?”</p><p>“She didn’t,” Eleanor replied, which surprised me. “Since you didn’t come, I assumed you changed your mind about revealing that to her. We can go back and tell her if you want.” </p><p>“It’s not really that important,” I said. “We can always meet the next time.” </p><p>“But, it means that you flew for nothing. I know how you … don’t like flying.” </p><p>“That’s true,” I said, amused by her attempt to tiptoe around my almost crippling fear of flying. “But still, I benefited from the visit more than I expected. It’s worth it.” </p><p>“You’re right. Three points of proficiency in a couple of hours, particularly when it reaches seventies, is no joke. It’s worth a little distress.” </p><p>It was not what I meant, but I wouldn’t have corrected that even if I wasn’t intentionally trying to mislead her. Instead, I joined her on the griffin. </p><p>For the first time in my life, I was actually looking forward to flying. Any distraction from the shocking revelation was welcome. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 47</p><p>When the next morning arrived, I moved down the dungeon with a renewed passion, dragging the cart with me at full speed, not even slowing down by anything but the giant monsters. I left the smaller ones behind. </p><p>I didn’t even sleep a wink after my revelation, still trying to process the potential implications of the peace field. A naive part of me was telling me to reveal the truth to the public and trust people. Luckily, that part had been battered even before the Calamity, so it was easy to silence. </p><p>Of course, the real reason I was able to silence it was having a better path, unlike pre-Calamity world, where trying to convince the masses to support me so that I could start working on the problem, with vague hopes of finding definite evidence to prove my conclusion was my only option. </p><p>Which then would have triggered a decade long political battle where utterly idiotic politicians mangled the truth just to score cheap points.  </p><p>The System offered an alternative: personal power. </p><p>“Talk about an unhealthy coping mechanism,” I muttered as I killed yet another monster that stumbled right onto my path, and stopped next to the forge, which was still on the third floor. I dropped everything there, changed to my silver anti-corrosion set, and passed through the gate, ready for a fight.</p><p>A fight that hadn’t arrived yet. The monsters circled the tree line I had created, looking agitated — or at least, that was what I assumed was something like anger, insects were not exactly easy to read — as they circled the tree line, appearing right at the edge of the expanded range provided by the trees.</p><p>However, they were closer to the bodies of the tree than they were the day before, which meant that the effect might be temporary or include other limitations. </p><p>“Still, even if it’s temporary, a forge could be set on the fourth floor. It’s just a matter of picking a nice spot,” I said, speaking to myself. </p><p>But, that meant that I needed to make a decision. The spot on the third floor was more than enough as long as I wanted to use it as a personal forge. I had already forged everything I needed, and even if I wanted to improve something, I could keep the forge buried until I decided to do so, along with the chopped wood from the temporary plantation. </p><p>Temporarily, it was alright to keep it on the third floor, but once the town had reached its full capability, things would be different. Sooner or later, someone would want to scope the area and see if there was something useful. </p><p>Which meant that I couldn’t keep my forge out in the open, let alone expanding it further to produce more equipment. Which, I needed if I ever to make enough money to purchase more expensive skills and help others grow. </p><p>Technically, I could set a forge somewhere else. Finding a nice cave or another spot in the wilderness to set a forge was an option, so was setting one up under the guild’s name, but both options had problems. Setting one in the wilderness would mean that the logistics would become more of a challenge. Meanwhile, one under the guild would have spies poking around it sooner or later. </p><p>In comparison, having one on the fourth floor had neither of those problems. The only challenge was to bring metal inside, but even that could be solved by melting the rocks with iron content I had detected. Collecting them would be a hassle, but not to the same degree as trying to smuggle a few tons of metal inside. </p><p>Even my cart trick wouldn’t be sustainable once the scale reached a high enough level. Luckily, silver was much easier to smuggle, as the alloy still required a relatively tiny amount. </p><p>“That means I need to discover a spot rich in iron,” I said. Inspect Perk from Repair could be used to examine rocks to see their metal content as long as they had more than a certain percent, and a quick test showed that Observe was even better. </p><p>Unfortunately, it required a touch … or did it? I couldn’t help but remember the way Maria used Identify, with a line of Mana stretching toward the target. </p><p>“Maybe I could replicate it,” I said as I quickly forged myself several thin silver-iron tubes, trying to expand the sense of Repair. To my surprise, it worked, but after six feet, the amount of details I could get started to drop significantly. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I started expanding the test, creating a tube as thick as my thumb, with a hollow center, which was the limit of getting any kind of detail. </p><p>I heard the existence of skills for this exact purpose. Unfortunately, all but the Basic one required Perception, and I doubted the Basic version was worth the attention the purchase of it would bring. I might change my mind if I couldn’t find anything for the next two days, but for the moment, I decided to limit myself to my newfound solution. </p><p>If I could find a decent iron deposit on the fourth floor, everything would be dandy. If not, I could decide which strategy would be the better option. </p><p>However, as I pulled my trick, I couldn’t help but wonder if I could use Observe on the movement of Mana, trying to get a better sense of what was going on. All I would need to do was to create a thinner tube and push the Mana through it. </p><p>It wouldn’t come close to being perfect, but anything was better than the fizzled perception I had. While Essence allowed me to sense it, the Mana was more like a blob with fuzzy edges. </p><p>Hardly enough to make a judgment. </p><p>I was tempted to push that on top of my to-do list. To start understanding the secrets of Mana was just that important. Unfortunately, there were a lot of things to do, including finding an alloy that interacted with Mana the way I wanted it to.</p><p>That alone was a task that might potentially take days, not to mention it was hardly the only challenge in my plan.  </p><p>“Focus on setting up the logistics first,” I muttered even as I grabbed the thin tube, and pushed it to the ground. I didn’t fear it breaking, as Mana alloys were extremely strong. </p><p>Just to see if there was any possible deposit, I spent twenty minutes checking the third floor, but I wasn’t able to find any. If there was, it was either in a deeper spot, or more localized. </p><p>Then, I went to the fourth floor, and started using the stick every ten steps, covering the area around the gate. I wanted to understand the nature of the area, but in the process, I discovered that the depths of the dungeon had a limited amount of iron. </p><p>It wasn’t high, less than a percent. It meant, a pound of iron would require more than a hundred pound of ores, and that assumed I could extract all of it. However, it was still good news. Especially since I carefully went through the entire area, and discovered two types of underground plants that reminded me of potatoes, and a new type of dungeon crystal.</p><p>A new type of crystal represented the possibility of developing new alloys, making it incredibly valuable for my purposes. And, while the underground plants weren’t immediately valuable, the fact that they were able to survive in the weird environment of the bog was promising enough. I could potentially use these new plants to push my Nurture skill further even if I couldn’t find any use for them. </p><p>I put them in the sample bag before I started moving once more.  </p><p>Once I left the protective field of the trees, I picked a direction, started the exciting life of mineral prospecting, interrupted by waves and waves of monsters, enough to raise a lot of people to a new level. “Nice,” I muttered as I found my first inferior deposit, which contained a mere five percent iron density. I quickly dug a pit there, mostly as a signpost so I wouldn’t miss it, and continued to go deeper. </p><p>Once again, half a mile later, the dungeon door disappeared behind the mist. I pushed half a mile more just in case before I returned, and started repeating the same thing from a different angle. Ideally, I wanted to set up the forge where the dungeon gate wasn’t visible. </p><p>The harder it was to discover, the better. </p><p>I walked back and forth, killing monsters in the process. However, even as I spent half a day killing giant monsters, there wasn’t a level up, nor was I able to discover any usable skills. I still piled them on top of each other, trying to get Rare skills, but I either got ones that were incomprehensible, or I got another Rare Nurture. </p><p>Still, I continued. It was a tedious task, but persistence was a virtue. And, I didn’t want to settle on that deposit with five percent content. Especially since it was already close enough to the gate, which made it a troubling target. </p><p>Then, I discovered a nice rocky outcropping, one that would be more defensible than anywhere else. I started searching its immediate surroundings more carefully, and soon, I discovered a lovely deposit, one that reached almost ten percent iron content. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I said. I knew that such a purity would not be even treated as a mine outside, but I didn’t care. Once again, its value was relative. </p><p>My luck must have turned, because one of the skills reacted. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Quake Hammer (Rare)]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered. Any other skill, I might have delayed absorbing it, afraid whether my Mana trick would be able to push it to the next level, but a Hammer skill was different. With the way it synergized with Forge, I would eventually raise it to its new limit. </p><p>It was an excellent test target. </p><p>Especially since I had two more skills that were extremely useful for combat.</p><p>However, despite my excitement, I still returned to the third floor first. No need to get distracted in the most dangerous spot I could currently access. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 100 -&gt; Quake Hammer (Rare) 1]</p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 48</p><p>Once I absorbed the Quake Hammer skill, I didn’t immediately start using it. Instead, I sat down, legs crossed, like I was about to meditate, my hammer on my lap, processing the new set of information the skill had brought about. </p><p>Just like Hammer of Might, Quake Hammer was an offensive skill that relied greatly on the concept of one deadly blow, but it left its user open to retaliation if the attack failed. That, I was familiar with from Hammer of Might. Assuming they would have a similar development pattern, the skill would have some defensive maneuvers as it improved, but ultimately, it didn’t matter much. </p><p>Because, if needed, I was confident that I could employ Fleeting Step to avoid most of the danger the current dungeon might provide. </p><p>Time that I spent running around was paying off. </p><p>“First, let's give ordinary practice a whirl,” I said as I stood up, and swung the hammer several times, merely following its suggestions, even though it had many issues that could easily be fixed. Understandable, as among all the techniques I had, Hammer of Might had seen the most use. </p><p>Learning was much easier when there was a magical force correcting every mistake one might make, but that wasn’t it. I also had two other techniques for different styles, and learning them had allowed me to understand my new skill even better. </p><p>Well, at least as far as how to move my body. The fighting skills used the power from the Stats in a way that defied physics — or, at least, the classical understanding of it — which was not something I was able to learn. </p><p>At least, not yet. </p><p>“Still, every little bit helps,” I said as I continued attacking the air, doing my best to correct the moves based on my old understanding of Hammer of Might, though I mixed some tricks from my two other styles wherever I deemed appropriate.</p><p>As usual, the reward only arrived once I stopped. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 1 -&gt; 26]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I said, but my words weren’t about the improvement. It was certainly welcome, especially since it gave me a better way to improve stronger skills than mere repetition, which meant I wouldn’t be helpless even if the Mana Blow trick stopped functioning as a cheat. </p><p>No, my interest was a new attack that had been unlocked. I swung my hammer, targeting the nearest rock. It didn’t break, but shattered. </p><p>[-10 Health] </p><p>“My first proper attack,” I realized even as I repeated the attack four more times, trying to get a sense of what it was. </p><p>It felt like an enhanced version of the Shattering Blow perk, but with additional benefits. The greatest difference was a rush of vitality, wrapping around the hammer head as it landed, giving it an incredible destructive power. </p><p>It was similar to Eleanor’s ranged attack, but unlike hers, mine didn’t have the ability to modify the intensity of the blows, or use it as a ranged tool. Whether those features would reveal themselves as I improve the skill, I didn’t know. </p><p>Though, if I were the bet, I would have said the first one was far likelier than the second one. A ranged hammer attack didn’t seem intuitive. </p><p>But then, it wouldn’t be the first time the System defied common sense. While the attack seemed effective, it wouldn’t be too useful on the fourth floor. I could already kill the giant monsters in one blow, and more importantly, I couldn’t use my Health as a disposable tool down there easily. </p><p>I still didn’t have a way to bring food or other things without them degrading in a few minutes. </p><p>“Vitality attacks are a problem for the future,” I said even as I moved to my next test, and used a mana blow. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 26 -&gt; 27]</p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>“Alright, that’s bad,” I said even as I started moving to the forge. While improving one point of skill with one blow seemed like an excellent improvement, the skill was still merely in its twenties. This meant that, for a Rare skill, mana blow wasn’t as much of a cheat as the previous stage. </p><p>Meaning, no easy push to the peak unless I found a new method — another experiment I added to the list rather than starting immediately, as it was something I could work on during the night. I just needed to stand in front of the forge while testing the hammer technique. </p><p>I decided to use most of the silver I had brought to create a brand new set of foreign equipment  instead: tongs, hammers, chisels, two sets of anvils. The small portion, I had left for further experiments. After that, I used the remaining iron to forge a cart made purely of anti-corrosive alloy. </p><p>Wasteful, but I had a lot of things to carry around, including trees. I couldn’t simply carry them. After everything had been done, I dug a nice hiding spot that was concealed with a rock, and put the old set there. There was a chance they would be useful. </p><p>Then, I created a smaller hiding spot near the gate to put my food, my old equipment, and the other stuff I had to leave on the third floor to protect them until I could find a storage method that protected from the corrosion aura. </p><p>Another item for my ever-growing list. “I need a bunch of doctorate students to make them deal with the nonsense —” I started, then reflexively corrected myself as I smiled, remembering how angry the others got when I phrased it like that. “No, give them valuable learning opportunities.” </p><p>I sighed wistfully, missing the times I could spend my time locked in a room, working on a particularly tricky model for a month straight. Running around killing monsters and building stuff might be something I turned out to be proficient at — with the System’s extreme help — ultimately, it was not what I desired to accomplish with my life. </p><p>I was just doing that to create an environment for my research. Just like how I had to deal with a bunch of old men whenever I needed another grant. </p><p>“It’s still better talking to a grant committee,” I growled even as I stepped into the gate. Given the choice, I always preferred a giant army of insect monsters over a grant committee. For one, they had a better personality. </p><p>I didn’t drag the cart forward immediately. First, I snapped a healthy looking branch from the tree, and moved toward the spot I picked for my forge. </p><p>It died halfway. </p><p>“Not good,” I said even as I went back, wondering what to do. I couldn’t simply uproot a tree… could I? Of course, I could also create a line of trees that led directly to the spot, but it would take too much time. </p><p>Carrying a tree was easier. </p><p>With that in mind, I first went to the forge spot and emptied the cart. I knew the monsters didn’t attack inanimate objects unless their density had reached a certain point. Still, I spent half an hour cleaning its surroundings. </p><p>A part of it was collecting the material. I needed the shells from the large beasts to boost the growth of the trees. Also, it gave me a chance to improve my Hammer skill by using the old trick of chaining mana blows. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) - 81]</p><p>Unfortunately, even when killing giant monsters, its cheat-like ability started to lose its effectiveness. I could probably push it to a hundred with a week of dedicated effort, but that would be the limit. Of course, for anyone else, that improvement would have been nothing less than a miracle, but for me, it was not worth the effort. </p><p>Assuming, of course, the situation didn’t change radically. </p><p>However, just because the development had stalled below the old skill didn’t mean that I was unhappy about replacing my old skill. The existence of the Health attack alone would have been worth it, as it opened a brand new research avenue for me. </p><p>Then, there was the difference between the Rare and Uncommon skills. Even without the special attack, the Rare skill outperformed my old one significantly. </p><p>It was an unexpected benefit to use the hammer skill as a mining tool, but I wasn’t complaining. I dug a bunch of pits, and filled them with broken pieces of shell, and topped it up with my strongest fertilizer mixture. Then, I went back to the giant tree, uprooted it completely and put it on the cart. </p><p>Even with my strength, dragging it had been a chore. Luckily, as I dragged it, the monsters avoided me. A good benefit, though not one that was worth the effort. I still had to use Health on the tree multiple times to keep it alive. </p><p>Hard work, but certainly satisfying, I thought as I looked at the giant tree hovering proudly. Next, I started picking nice branches that could function as cuttings, and started boosting their growth. After the first time it finished, I realized that I had to make a lot of trips just to eat and replenish my Health. </p><p>I forged a small silver box from the remaining silver, making the best anti-corrosive metal I could achieve. Maybe it would work. I tried that, because otherwise, I would have to spend my time going back and forth just to replenish my Health. </p><p>Air-tight silver box worked somewhat. The next time I opened the box, I found the food starting to show signs of degrading, but it was still edible. However, the moment it connected with air, it started degrading even faster.</p><p>So, I modified the box even further. It was essentially a lunch box with multiple air-tight compartments. Not enough to maintain the food overnight, but just enough to keep my Health up while I explored the fourth floor. </p><p>“Now, let’s get to work,” I said. I had a lot of work to do if I wished to be done before noon. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 49</p><p>Setting up my new — and hopefully more permanent — forge took half of my available time. However, it was certainly worth it. Three layers of trees surrounded it to give me a perfect vision of my surroundings. </p><p>There was even a small farm where the root plants I discovered had been growing en masse. I hoped to use them to replenish my Health. However, I was yet to eat despite feeling the intense vitality it contained, because I still needed an expert to confirm that it was edible and not poisonous.</p><p>System allowed Health to solve most problems, but it didn’t solve every single ailment.  </p><p>And, setting the encampment came with its own reward. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare)  92 -&gt; 97]  </p><p>However, as much as the plants that surrounded my farm were an incredible achievement, it was nothing compared to what laid at the center. </p><p>For once, the main forge was sitting on a raised platform made of iron-covered stone, giving it an elegant feeling. The only reason it wasn’t a full wall was that it would have blocked my view. Even when working, I didn’t have the luxury of staying hidden. </p><p>Instead, I forged a few metal sheets that I might raise in case I’m doing something particularly sensitive. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t know how to make corrosion-resistant glass. Ultimately, Forge and Repair were both focused on metal, limiting the available information I could access. While I was confident that I could figure out a way, glass wasn’t exactly on top of my list of required materials. </p><p>No, that honor went to discovering a lesser variant of the corrosion-resistant material. Well, more accurately, finding a version that was simple enough that I could argue that I discovered it through sheer repetition. </p><p>Too bad I never had a common variant of the Forge high enough to know whether a recipe was included there. If it was, revealing it wouldn’t have any risk. </p><p>Technically, that also meant that my experiment might be unnecessary, but I decided to conduct it nevertheless. Even if it turned out to be useless, it would be a good test run for the experimental procedure so that I could perfect it before I could start with my real experiment. </p><p>My desire to test how various metals and alloys interacted with mana in my desire to understand mana better. </p><p>Currently, I had merely one small shelf, made of pure iron — as the wood didn’t resist corrosion once it was cut out of the tree. Each shelf had a chart — once again an iron sheet — for me to take note of the experimental details and results. </p><p>Even a small shelf used up a lot of material, but I was happy with it. Ideally, I planned to make a hundred of such shelves. After all, a proper experiment required thousands of samples. </p><p>To be able to produce all of it, I needed a lot of material, hence the existence of the thirty-feet blast furnace sitting on the low ground, to refine the iron ore into pig iron. It wasn’t a design from the System. Instead, it belonged to me. </p><p>I didn’t know why the System didn’t have it. Maybe it was a part of a different class, or maybe the System disdained even the simplest type of mass production — I wasn’t exactly exaggerating when I called System the wet dream of Objectivists. </p><p>Either way, I had to design blast furnace myself completely. Luckily, the working principles of a blast furnace were simple. Create layers of iron and coke — purified coal — and burn starting from the bottom. Iron melted and gathered at the bottom, while the waste products floated up. </p><p>However, in medieval times, raising iron to melting temperature couldn’t be achieved by open flames. Hence the blast furnace. It not only used bellows to pump air, but also had a huge chimney, creating a suction effect. </p><p>Combined, they were barely able to raise the temperature to the necessary level. Luckily, for me, neither bellows nor coke was necessary. Thanks to their intense vitality, the wood from the trees would burn intensely enough. </p><p>Which was good, because making a bellow was very difficult when one was restricted to metal only, without any elastic materials to make things easier. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered even as I moved toward the open pit with a raised hammer, ready to gather more ores. Then, I paused, my mood slipping a bit. Despite my attempts, there was already a layer gathered on top. Clearly, there were some water leaks from the bottom, and the more I dug, the worse it would get. </p><p>A pump was necessary. </p><p>“Or, maybe a steam engine,” I muttered with an amused smile, mostly because the first steam engines had been used to pump water out of mines. The world had changed, but the problems stayed the same.  </p><p>Admittedly, a simple pump would be enough for a surface deposit. Combined with my Strength, it would be far more efficient than a steam engine. Not to mention, it would consume a couple of tons of iron to build. </p><p>Wasteful and pointless, but I couldn’t help but admit that the allure was there, especially if I could link to a conveyor belt to free me from the task of going back and forth. </p><p>“Actually, that might not be a bad idea,” I said. The world had abandoned the existence of steam engines because they were not worth the cost. People with Strength could easily use simple pumps for free, and even the simplest alloy was expensive. </p><p>Even the simplest steam engine that could survive in a post-Cataclysm world would cost enough to be measured in gold coins, while the same thing could be achieved in paying someone less than a silver a day — which would probably be cheaper than the fuel it consumed. </p><p>It was not for no reason the production had been stuck to a feudal balance. Especially since, if there was a need for automation, magic was there to compensate. </p><p>However, it wasn’t out of a principled stance that I wanted to build a simple steam engine. I had a simpler problem. I didn’t have time. </p><p>It didn’t matter that a steam engine wouldn’t be as efficient as me. My current power was still a secret, and I needed to find a way to free myself from simpler tasks if I ever wanted to scale up the production. </p><p>It would be hard work, but when the alternative was to hire people and trust them to keep it a secret… </p><p>“First, let’s start producing iron,” I said. Ultimately, the whole plan depended on an abundance of iron, measured in tons; which sounded a lot, but considering the pre-Calamity world measured the yearly production in billions of metric tons, it wasn’t as impressive. </p><p>“I wonder if this is the first iron mine in this new world?” I asked myself. Technically, it was possible. After all, the outside world was filled with excess metal, especially when it came to simpler stuff. Why bother going through all that trouble when scavenging was easier?</p><p>I sighed, ignoring the problem as I raised my hammer, ready to shatter the deposit under my feet. Of course, traditionally, a pickaxe was a much better tool to deal with semi-solid rock, but I had a different plan. </p><p>[-10 Health]</p><p>The hammer hit the rock, and about a cubic foot of material had shattered into small pieces. It wasn’t the typical way the rock should behave under such an attack, but the life energy that surrounded the hammer worked wonders. </p><p>A cubic foot of material didn’t sound too much, but considering the material density, it certainly was. Iron was a relatively dense metal, almost eight grams of density, which meant four cubic feet of iron weighed about a metric ton. </p><p>Of course, the raw material wasn’t as dense, but even with it, and the low purity ratio had been factored in, a cubic feet of raw material should give me almost twenty pounds of iron. It was all I could steal from a cart without things getting suspicious. </p><p>There was a reason I spent my precious time creating my current setup. </p><p>Ten blows had been enough to fill the blast furnace for the first few layers. I dragged the cart up, but before going to the furnace, I stopped to chop down a tree. </p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to prepare fuel beforehand, as the moment I cut the tree, it started rotting. I tried to make charcoal, but it didn’t prevent the process, meaning I needed another experiment just to have long lasting charcoal. </p><p>However, I ignored that necessity as I created the layers, and lit it on fire, once again using my fire bolt. Wasteful, but since it was holding a skill slot, there was no harm experimenting a bit more.  </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>I watched as the flames covered the open mouth of the furnace, and a slow wind started to pick up. Soon, the bright red drops of iron were already gathered at the bottom of the bellows, the heat hitting my face hard. </p><p>If I was still below level ten, I would have taken a step back. Instead, I watched proudly as a dark smoke started to rise from the top, along with a sharp, disgusting smell that suggested it was contaminated by a great amount of sulfur.</p><p>Meanwhile, the molten iron glowed brightly as it dripped down from the tap at the bottom along with the slag, finally adding some color to the opening, gathering in the large crucible. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered despite everything, including the disgusting smell. It was the first step of success. </p><p>Then, I turned and walked back to the mine. </p><p>I still had a lot of material to excavate. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 50</p><p>“Beautiful,” I repeated as I looked at the forge area, still feeling surprised by the change I was able to achieve in less than four hours. The huge blast furnace was still spitting out fires, but was at its last batch. At the same time, the number of iron shelves I built had reached more than a hundred, though the number and sizes of their sections varied. </p><p>Some of them even had iron doors in case I wanted to isolate the samples from the environment. It was a poor substitute for a sterilized environment, but it was good enough. </p><p>Still, it was temporary. The next step was to dig down to create a basement for those materials, but I delayed that a bit. After all, I was already digging a huge pit to mine the iron ore. It would be easier to use that rather than trying to dig a second pit. </p><p>However, while those changes had been nice, the real source of pride was the steam engine that sat on top of another iron platform, sputtering as it consumed the last of its fuel. The more I dug, the more water seeped into the resulting pit, so I had to make the pump faster than I had been initially planning. </p><p>As a result, it was a simple atmospheric water engine, an early type of steam engine famous for being inefficient. It had a huge cylinder, which was filled with hot steam to rise to the top, and once that reached the top, it triggered a switch, which cut the steam feed. Another flip opened, spraying some cold water to cool down the steam. Condensing steam created a vacuum, and atmospheric pressure dealt with the rest. </p><p>Then, it repeated the cycle. </p><p>It was inefficient and bulky, but it was also mechanically simple enough that I was able to put it together in mere minutes. </p><p>And, inefficiency was easy to deal with thanks to the intensity of the fire. Too bad I would have to redo the whole setup to add a separate condensing chamber and a flywheel tomorrow, which would require a complete redesign, which would allow me to add a crank to connect to the feeder of the blast furnace, automating that part as well. </p><p>I didn’t do so immediately, because I needed to check the designs. While I knew how such an engine worked conceptually, the exact mechanical details weren’t as clear. And, like anything else mechanical, the System was utterly helpless. </p><p>“There is always a gap between the theory and the application,” I muttered even as I walked away. I still had some time to experiment, but not without sacrificing hunting time.</p><p>Today, I wanted to increase the number of shells I collected to fifteen hundred, which would give me a revenue of sixty gold, which would give me the necessary money to build a modest residence and hire some guild members. Technically, I could get away with hiring something like twenty members, and build an elite team that could generate me some income, but I didn’t want that. </p><p>No, I needed to hire as many people as I could manage. The more crowded they were, the more nonsensical tasks I could slip in — like coming up with some designs for a steam engine. </p><p>Trying to build a tech base was not a one-person job. </p><p>Maybe I should look into hiring farmers in bulk. Not only could I give them a better living, but it would also give me a way to use the excessive number of rare Nurture skills I had while giving me an excuse to move a ludicrous amount of carts around. </p><p>I doubted that I would be able to make a profit, but I didn’t really care. </p><p>I went back to the third floor and used the extractor to start hunting. First few, I killed using my sword, pushing the skill even further</p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon)  79 -&gt; 91]</p><p>Admittedly, by increasing that much, I was playing it a bit risky, but the promise of a Rare skill that I could publicly use was too valuable. Especially since I was confident in my method of improvement. </p><p>“Speaking of methods,” I muttered even as I switched to the spear, and started pushing my health through its heft, trying to replicate the Vitality attack without the assistance of the skill. I pushed merely a point or two, trying to shape it. </p><p>Every time I killed an insect, I tried to use that attack. And, I failed. Again and again. </p><p>From a certain point of view, what I had been doing was a waste of time. It wouldn’t take long before I would upgrade both skills to rare, which would give me superior Vitality attacks. However, that was the exact reason I had been trying to do so. </p><p>The Vitality attack from the hammer was even more complicated than the Mana Blow from Forging. And, even  Mana Blow, I wasn’t able to properly reverse-engineer. If I ever wanted to discover the trick behind Vitality attacks, I needed better insights. </p><p>“First, the movement,” I said even as I paused, trying to put together the impression of the two energies. From what I could tell — from my extremely limited perception — Mana behaved mostly like a gas, though there were aspects where it behaved more like a liquid. </p><p>Except for the times it reached certain geometrical patterns and suddenly solidified, which was what enabled the delivery of the Mana attacks. </p><p>Of course, that was just how it reacted in Mana Attacks using the weapon as a medium. I didn’t have the slightest idea what actually happened while casting a spell. </p><p>In comparison, Health was more consistently liquid, but the feeling it gave differed between uses. When it was used for healing, it flowed almost gently. When used as a part of the Nurture, it had a slow, sluggish feel, almost like tar. </p><p>When used to support an attack, it felt more like mercury, rapid yet heavy at the same time. The feeling of my hammer attack and Eleanor’s ranged attack had been similar enough. </p><p>However, it differed at the point of trigger. Mana simply dispersed after the attack — whether it vanished or simply took a form I couldn’t perceive was another question — while Vitality, for the lack of a better term, burned. </p><p>However, it wasn’t a sense of burning life flames. Maybe implosion was a better descriptor, but ignition still felt more accurate. However, regardless of the term, the process was clear. The energy dissipated, turning into the effect of the attack. </p><p>At least, that was how the Quake effect worked. The Health spread into some kind of shatter pattern, then at once, ignited to shatter the target. Combined with the blow from the hammer, it shattered the target perfectly.  </p><p>“Maybe that’s what I’m doing wrong,” I said even as I stood up, ignoring the slight delay it would cause. Ultimately, I was trying to replicate the feeling of a hammer attack with a spear. And, as much as the scientist inside me wanted to argue that it shouldn’t matter, considering the way the System worked, it likely did. </p><p>And, since a hammer attack required that smashing effect, maybe I should try to lean into a piercing concept — </p><p>“I’m a moron,” I muttered even as I slapped my head. I had missed something even more obvious. Yes, a spear method of delivering damage was piercing, but my variant was also about movement. Both the Perk I chose, and the name of Swift Spear implied it. </p><p>I closed my eyes as I ran a few steps, using Fleeting Step to change directions rapidly, climb a steep hill, and even make a few pointlessly complicated dancing moves, replicating a ballet routine perfectly. And, the more I repeated it, the more I realized the distinct concept of the Fleeting Step. </p><p>Just like the Vitality attack from the Hammer Art carried a sense of earthquake. </p><p>“I hope I won’t blow my feet off,” I muttered even as I used Fleeting Step again, but this time, I pushed that mercurial variant of Vitality to my feet. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>Pain hit me. </p><p>Yet, I laughed, simply because of the source of pain. It wasn’t my legs like I feared, but my head. I wasn’t able to compensate for the sudden burst of speed and lost my balance. “Again,” I muttered as I stood up. </p><p>For the next twenty minutes, I stumbled around like I was reenacting a drunk scene from a terrible comedy. Yet, every repeat only made my smile bigger and bigger. I might not be able to stand on my feet, but it didn’t change the fact that I was able to imitate a Vitality attack, and did so on something that was not actually an attack. </p><p>I was able to use it … somewhat. It allowed me to burst forward in a straight line, but it was certainly loud. Also, it was hard to maintain balance if I tried to push over twenty yards. </p><p>“Let’s see. What’s the core of a spear technique? A quick, merciless piercing attack,” I said, trying to focus on that concept, trying to imitate the shape of Mana as I used a chisel to stab the nearest stone. My spear sank deep.  </p><p>“Success,” I chuckled. Of course, it wasn’t the fact that I was able to stab through a rock, which I could have done before. No, the proof was the ragged, uneven edge. </p><p>Then, even in success, I froze. Since I could somehow empower the movement perk with life energy, could I do the same with other perks. </p><p>Like Observe? </p><p>I could feel my heart beating with excitement. If that was possible, the implications were incredible. </p><p>It looked like I knew exactly what I would be doing tonight. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once the battle was over, I brought the Burning Ice cultivators back to the Misty Mountains, but only to put them in charge when I brought out a much larger team, making sure all of them got some experience against demonic cultivators as I attacked any base I could find. </p><p>It was a dangerous move, but I had to. The moment the first group was destroyed, the other hidden groups revealed themselves, hastening their plans. </p><p>Luckily, my increased abilities meant that I was able to set up bases of Forest Dance across the wilderness between the kingdoms, providing me with enough Qi to spread my detection formation, allowing me to catch those groups before they could succeed. </p><p>Uprooting the demonic cultivators was a risky task, but the Providence reward was worth it. There were two benefits to it. First, it strengthened the Burning Ice Symbol significantly, which allowed me to poke and prod its structure without fearing whether it would be destroyed. </p><p>The ability to touch it without fearing total destruction finally allowed me to reverse-engineer its structure, helped by the latest batch of abilities I had received. </p><p>It was an interesting mixture of painting, calligraphy, and other things, but to my surprise, it was made of not paint, but some kind of crystallized essence. The reason it was able to grow and recover was because of it. It wasn’t exactly a living thing, not even as much as a random tree, but it wasn’t exactly an object either. </p><p>More interestingly, the more Providence it collected, the faster it absorbed the surrounding Qi, which made its function as a spiritual pillar far stronger. Its providence was being drained continuously, but it clearly had a limit, which was below the collection as the martial artists continued to hunt the demonic cultivators. </p><p>Either the damage it sustained slowed the transfer, or the one that designed it never imagined it transferring that much Providence at once. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, it allowed me to see the interaction between Providence and Qi over the symbol. It was fascinating. The Symbol gathered Qi, and Providence … for the lack of a better term, held it together by acting like external strings. </p><p>It was an interesting process. I still didn’t understand how it was achieved, but it allowed me to adjust the alchemical trees I had created, increasing their ability to connect with the martial artists. </p><p> Once I enhanced every alchemical tree — which directly strengthened the martial artists and improved their land reclamation speed — I decided to finally follow the path created by the providence, deeper into the misty mountains. </p><p>But, not without some preparations. The first thing I did was to gather all the teams that had been hunting demonic cultivators. Without me, I was afraid of them being driven into a trap. I didn’t want them being followed to the base. </p><p>And, without me to put the blocking formations, it was too likely. </p><p>Once that was done, I had spent a day refining batches of poison, reinforcing the defenses of the Zaim Kingdom and Markas in particular…</p><p>And, started a long trip… </p><p>It was an interesting experience. The flying ship cut through the mist like a blade through silk, with a silence that belied the potential power. I had nothing to do but gaze out, formations allowing me to see through the mist further than I could have with my own eyes, its shifting and swirling blanket unable to cut my view. </p><p>It was the first time I was going so deep, and the sight of didn’t fail to impress me. The deeper I got, the more interesting it got, along with the density of Qi. Said density wasn’t enough to supply my ship unless I established some truly huge formations, but it was enough to enhance the wildlife. </p><p>There were forests of spirit plants, with hordes of savage beasts, far stronger than the ones that were found inside patrolling the area. Their strengths were significantly higher than I expected. Some of them could challenge Foundation Establishment cultivators alone … and that was without including their habit of attacking in hordes under the control of the mist.  </p><p>No wonder sect cultivators were reluctant to explore deeper, and let the itinerant cultivators sacrifice themselves instead. </p><p>If there was one big disadvantage the Qi cultivators had, it was endurance, something I understood even better after the latest burst of techniques I had received. Once their Qi depleted, it took somewhere between days to weeks to recover — and for certain Golden Core cultivators, it might even extend to months depending on the spirit vein they could access. </p><p>“Let’s enjoy the ride,” I said to myself soon after, enjoying the untouched depths of nature. Soon, a lake appeared, its waters a deep, iridescent blue that shimmered like liquid sapphire, filled with wildlife. The surface of the lake was smooth and unbroken, reflecting the pale light of the moon that struggled to break through the clouds above. </p><p>It was beautiful enough that I stopped to set a camp, watching the faint outlines of creatures swimming beneath the surface, graceful and serpentine. </p><p>I wondered if any of them was the elusive dragons that the cultivators and martial artists alike loved to refer to. I was tempted to explore, but I already had too many things to worry about to spend time on it. </p><p>Maybe on a day when I could enjoy the Freeloader System. For the moment, I limited myself to watching them from a distance, captivated by their glimmering scales. </p><p>Then, I continued my travel, slower than I would have liked because I wanted to conserve Qi, and a dark forest replaced the lake. It was a scary location, its trees twisted and gnarled, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. The air above it was thick with an aura of decay, and the beings that filled it were equally horrifying, moving in with a slow, deliberate pace, confident nothing would touch their poison-filled bodies. </p><p>The forest was a place of nightmares, yet it was still natural rather than some kind of demonic experiment gone awry — as far as I could tell from such a great distance. Ironically, I was even more tempted to dive down and explore, curious whether my Alchemy could unravel all its secrets. </p><p>But, I was a man with a mission. The ship continued to fly, leaving the forest behind, and the mist thickened once more, hiding the world below in its swirling depths. I leaned over the railing, enjoying the strange beauty of the mist. </p><p>Yet, as I continued to go deeper, I noticed a shift. It took a while for me to realize what had changed. It wasn’t the air, nor it was the Qi. </p><p>No, it was the Providence that changed. </p><p>The difference was impossible to miss. After one point, it stopped being a calm, steady presence, and started churning like a storm. </p><p>“No, not a storm, but a caged beast,” I uttered, feeling a chill in my soul. I had always known that whatever going on in the mist was not normal, but to give that feeling. </p><p>It scared me, enough to make me consider whether this trip was a good idea in the first place. Luckily,, before I could change my mind, I had drifted to one area. </p><p>A snow-covered volcano. It was enough of a visual clue that I didn’t need to check the Providence clue back to the center. As I approached, I let the spectacle wash over me, impossible yet awe-inspiring. It stood defiant against the landscape, a massive, jagged spire thrusting upward, piercing the sky. The volcano spewed out magma constantly, yet the snow and ice sustained their presence despite the heat. </p><p>As I got closer, I could see the signs that the magma was fresh, as if it had been dormant just weeks ago … an interesting timeline that overlapped perfectly with the timeline of my little project. </p><p>I wanted to observe more, if it wasn’t for an unexpected development. A huge flying ship, radiating with power, appeared from behind the mountain. Good thing, I didn’t need to guess about their intention. </p><p>The giant ray of Qi attack targeting me was enough of a clue! </p>",

    "content": "<p>Merely ten minutes later, I was on the deck of my flying ship, hidden behind an illusion formation and waiting. Underneath me, lay a city built atop a sharp cliff, easy to defend but hard to reach. </p><p>The wilderness at night was eerily quiet, but not enough to alert the guards. While their numbers were high due to the general unrest, their attitude was lax. Maybe it was their martial cultivation that made them courageous. Even the weakest guard was at Skin Refinement, but the majority was already at Bone Forging, mixed with not an insignificant number of Connate martial artists. </p><p>Before the war, it would have been a shocking force in any city, especially one smaller than Markas, but as the war progressed, the forces supporting the cities received more and more support from the forces that supported them — be it cultivation families or sects — turning the existence of higher ranking martial artists a common sight rather than semi-legendary existences. </p><p>And, I knew they were pushed higher with pills rather than improving naturally, as I was too capable as an apothecary to miss the signs of forced breakthroughs, induced by people not capable — or caring — enough to maintain their future growth. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the damage from the forced breakthroughs that prevented them from noticing the approaching threat, but something simpler. </p><p>Arrogance. </p><p>Every single one of those guards of the walls had broken two realms at a minimum recently, which made them overconfident. It meant that, they were unaware of the dark shadows that were approaching the city. </p><p>And, they had no excuse, as the approaching attackers were not the demonic cultivators, but a group of martial artists they had raised. The martial artists they raised were nothing more than bandits they had collected before I discovered their presence. </p><p>Admittedly, the number of bandits was nowhere near enough to take down the city, but I had a feeling that it didn’t matter, or the demonic cultivators wouldn’t have been waiting nearby, their numbers higher than I expected. </p><p>There were almost fifty of them, but the only three I had followed were at the peak of Qi Gathering. The rest was still in the early stages, and showing signs of being itinerant cultivators. </p><p>I turned my gaze toward another hiding spot, one that held a hundred young women, each strong enough to contend against Foundation Establishment cultivators, let alone the ragtag army. Yet, I couldn’t help but feel worried. After spending months — before and after I had let them switch to Burning Ice — teaching them, I couldn’t help but feel responsible for their life. </p><p>Not the same way I felt responsible for Aisnam and Pearyin, but more like a teacher. After all, despite all the layers of obfuscation in between, I was still their teacher and their general, and with that, came a sense of responsibility. </p><p>I trained them well. And, tonight, they would need every ounce of that training.</p><p>I had to admit, the demonic cultivators had chosen this night well. The moon was hidden behind a thick veil of clouds, allowing the bandits to rush toward the city without being noticed even if the guards were as careful as they were supposed to be. </p><p>It was the time to throw a wrench in their plans. I took two simple actions. One, I created an illusion of a noise. “Enemy attack. Everyone on the walls,” a shout without a source alerted the guards, who then started to ring the bells and shout as they had been taught, unaware that they were the only ones who heard the first shout. </p><p>The second action was a little flare of Qi, giving the Burning Ice team the order to move against the cultivators. </p><p>I had done that deliberately. This way, not only my team would prevent the demonic cultivators from accessing the city, but also it would effectively switch the ambush. As for bandits, it was the responsibility of the guards. </p><p>After all, what I was looking for was not a fair fight, but a proper field test. The first that was against the cultivators. </p><p>I didn’t plan to hold it against the sect cultivators, but I wasn’t complaining about it either. I moved the boat closer, still invisible. </p><p>“What’s going on!” several weaker demonic cultivators, who had spread as scouts, shouted before their voices had been cut short. I looked at their bodies with absolutely no pity. From their aura, I could feel that they had already sacrificed hundreds of people for power. </p><p>The way they were dressed reflected that. Their robes, black and crimson, seemed to absorb the little light the moon was able to generate from behind the clouds, and their masks were grotesque enough to show they were not trying to hide their true nature. </p><p>At least, not tonight. </p><p>The hundred-strong team moved deeper with a speed the rest of the cultivators were unable to match, mowing through their numbers with a contemptuous ease. The cultivators that they faced couldn’t even begin to match my army. </p><p>So, I shifted my attention to something else. The response from the Heavens. </p><p>It was … spectacular. I had expected that killing demonic cultivators would have counted as a good deed, but I wasn’t ready for the scale. Just by killing a weak demonic cultivator, they were able to get almost as much as what they collected dealing with regular bandits and other scum since the time they had started. </p><p>It was still a drop in the bucket compared to what Forest Dance collected … but considering the growing number of martial artists that were a part of that particular path, it was an inevitable conclusion. </p><p>As the fight started to turn, the three leaders tried to escape, only to realize they were trapped by a formation. </p><p>“We can’t escape,” one of them said, looking shocked. “A formation is here.” </p><p>“Why are there second-grade martial artists here,” another replied, and suddenly, I was glad that I was eavesdropping. The ease they recognized the Blood Essence realm martial artists was telling. “I thought they couldn’t return back to this world without destroying their cultivation.” </p><p>“Maybe they have artifacts to block the detection of karma,” the other replied. </p><p>“Impossible. They are worth a fortune. There’s no way—”</p><p>“Not if he’s the one that’s betraying us. I told you it’s a mistake to trust an inner sect disciple. We should have —”  </p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” the first one cut in. “Regardless of who sent them, it’s clear that they are here to deal with us. And, they went a long way to remove any evidence. We need to decide what to do.” </p><p>As they discussed, I considered capturing them, but I decided against it … for two reasons. First, I had more urgent things to do than trying to catch an inner sect disciple of Kartpa Valley. Considering the clannish behavior of the cultivators, they would never even consider the words of an outsider. And, that was assuming any information I would collect from them would be accurate. </p><p>As my own adventures suggested, tricking people with disguises was trivial. </p><p>Then, I wasn’t sure if I could keep them hidden. It was one thing to take people that assumed to be dead prisoners, but three of them were a part of a conspiracy, and the masterminds behind them would inevitably search for them. </p><p>I had no idea who was behind them, and their exact capabilities. It was the same reason I was reluctant to just destroy the base for the Everdawn martial artists. I</p><p>I was starting to feel like I was in a room filled with domino tiles, with one wrong touch creating an avalanche… </p><p>I hated the feeling. </p><p>Yet, instead of doing anything, I watched the first batch of my students, a team of five, battle with the three demonic cultivators, suppressing my desire to intervene. They were ready for a fight, but my sense of responsibility interfered with it. </p><p>However, it was a challenge to do when one of them had been injured with a cursed dagger, radiating an aura of decay that spread through her body. Since she could survive the damage, I focused on something more important. </p><p>A message from one of them, telling their contact that they had been attacked by second-grade martial artists. I let that pass, but just delayed it by five minutes, something that was possible because he used a talisman. </p><p>I had been planning to let that go … when I felt a little tug, followed by an inspiration. Changing a portion of the message. I modified the message, so the attack was pointing at Everdawn Martial artists. </p><p>It was inevitable that the other members of the conspiracy would start searching, potentially triggering a hidden war between the two groups. I would have never done it on my own, but the tug from the Providence was too clear. </p><p>Unfortunately, that scared me even more. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I retreated back to Markas once the mystic land had collapsed, but it wasn’t an escape. No, it was just a momentary retreat until I could come up with a new strategy. </p><p>But, my heart was still beating hard, still trembling at the risk I had taken. It was the most impulsive decision I had ever made. It had been profitable. With hundreds of disciples shouting their biggest secrets to desperately ruin my chances to get the big reward, I had managed to learn everything that covered the basics of cultivation, from mainstream activities like smiting, to more niche aspects like puppet-making and soul attacks. </p><p>Even as I activated them one by one, expanding my understanding of every single cultivation topic I could imagine. Well, everything that could conceivably be learned by a bunch of outer disciples. Luckily, every single one of them seemed to have a side vocation, probably as a way to earn resources to support their cultivation. </p><p>The idle commentary I had heard while working showed that their life was more similar to a college student who was desperately trying to pay for their tuition fees by working three jobs and trying to keep their grade average up at the same time. </p><p>Ironically, that seemed to help them reveal their secrets. Desperate not to lose the opportunity, they spat everything. </p><p>Including, some demonic techniques! </p><p>My eyes widened as multiple demonic techniques filled my mind, just the knowledge alone was enough to make me sick. There were many methods to cultivate there, the kind that could bring any cultivator to Golden Core in a matter of weeks assuming enough resources.</p><p>Resources being humans!</p><p>I shivered in disgust even as the understanding of those techniques became a part of me just like everything else. Yet, I couldn’t help but wonder why I had them. </p><p>Had some of the outer disciples learned only fragments of it, unaware of its true nature, and I received the complete version? Or, where they preparing to use them as a last resort to break through, willing to commit unspeakable evil just to live a few years more. </p><p>If it was the latter, it meant the cultists teaching around suddenly stopped being my biggest priority. Worse, now that I knew what such demonic techniques did to their victims, destroying not only their bodies but actually torturing their souls, I couldn’t just ignore it. </p><p>“Ignorance is truly bliss,” I muttered, the realization enough to make me revisit my perspective on not killing people. For the first time, I felt like I could kill. Luckily, I didn’t need to. I had thousands of Blood Essence Realm martial artists, looking to stretch their newfound power. It would be a good test for their abilities, not to mention a good way to gather some Providence.</p><p>I doubted that the Heavens rewarded people who casually tortured the souls of the millions. </p><p>Yet, even as I made the decision, I couldn’t let it wonder about what it meant. The fact that they shouted the demonic techniques to me despite the risk of getting caught meant that, it might not be as big as a taboo among the cultivators. </p><p>Maybe it was like taking steroids as a college athlete. Yes, it was forbidden, but whenever I saw another athlete taking it, I just acted like I hadn’t seen anything rather than being a snitch. Yes, it was a bad idea to compete with steroids, as it eventually came out — unless one could access really expensive designer ones, but they were outside a college athlete’s budget — but some students’ circumstances justified it.  </p><p>Trying to intervene was a good way to get ostracized back then. </p><p>It wasn’t impossible for the outer disciples to have the same attitude. Worse, everything I had seen about them showed that they treated mortals slightly more valuable as bugs, meaning the moral weight of killing millions didn’t matter to them as much as the side effects of the demonic techniques. </p><p>“Disgusting,” I growled even as I finished absorbing every single technique I had collected and started working. While the existence of the demonic cultivators was disgusting, it wasn’t as critical as refurbishing the mystic land and adding a second floor. </p><p>Luckily, my expanded techniques meant that I could position the first fake layer as the hall of the palm. First, I started forging several artifacts to act as pillars of my formations. Up until now, I had been building my formations directly linked to the spiritual vein. While it meant it was strong, it also had some critical limits. </p><p>Mixing my newfound ability to forge with alchemy, I was able to fashion several very handy artifacts, both as storage and as a way to empower the attacks from the formation. </p><p>Too bad those storage items required to be huge to store any meaningful amount of Qi, which meant I couldn’t fill my ship with it. Qi Gathering grade techniques, even after bypassing Perfection, had their limitations. </p><p>Once I completed my preparations, I returned to the mystic land, the cultivators around it acting in panic. There were already a dozen Golden Core Cultivators around, carefully poking and prodding, but the state of their clothing showed that my alchemical traps were working excellently. </p><p>“Cheating is fun,” I muttered, trying my best to feel amused even as I started my very expansive underground construction process. First, I added seven more outer halls, namely sword, saber, spear, staff, bow, fist, and kick. Added to the palm, it reached eight, covering the main categories. </p><p>In those seven other halls, I spread around in a circle, like it was an outer circle. Then, inside them, I added four more halls. Formations, alchemy, artifact forging, and talismans. Four main crafting arts. Each of them had tests similar to the combat techniques, and once again, it was forbidden for anyone but Qi Gathering cultivators. </p><p>Then, at the center, I put another room, one that was for ‘real’ inheritance. It was an empty room, but with the number of protections I had piled around, no cultivators would think that it was empty. I was hoping that dangling such a reward would prevent them from acting invasively. </p><p>Then, I added another, even bigger prohibition, one that made the whole structure shake the moment a nascent soul cultivator approached it … I was able to do so thanks to Kartpa alchemy, though it required a bit of unorthodox thinking. </p><p>The sheer presence of a Nascent Soul cultivator triggered a reaction from the Providence. It was unnoticeable to weaker cultivators, but for the others, it was near impossible to hide. And, my Alchemy knowledge allowed me to fashion a few items to feel the general approach, and make the whole formation shake and tremble. </p><p>At least, that was how it worked once I recycled them through Janassa, turning them into much stronger items. However, I did that only for the most critical pieces, as even to produce the tiniest Nascent Soul Grade items, the Providence around me had dipped noticeably.  </p><p>It was not a trick that could be replicated often. </p><p>Hopefully, it would be enough to intimidate them. </p><p>It took a week for me to put together everything, and that was with me spending every single hour working without sleeping. But, when combined with the parts I had improved thanks to Janassa’s unwitting assistance, I had something that would hold against even an expert Golden Core cultivator. </p><p>At least, as long as they tried to follow my restrictions to open it carefully, and not smash it with brute strength. </p><p>“Finally,” I muttered as I moved away. Unfortunately, halfway in, I had felt one of the formations I had triggered. One that I had set across a wide area … where I had followed three cultivators that were responsible for my demonic techniques. </p><p>They weren’t the only ones who had given me demonic techniques, but it was the only group that was exclusively made of demonic cultivators. Technically, only one of them had used it as a weapon, but now that I was an expert in the techniques, I could see the signs easily. </p><p>And, that allowed me to see that, the number of demonic cultivators among the outer disciples was suspiciously high among Kartpa Valley disciples. Not exclusively, and not enough to be the majority, but around ten percent was still a scary number. </p><p>The three of them weren’t the only ones I had been following, but they were the ones that acted most suspiciously. Just to make their intentions more suspicious, all three of them were near the limit, to be kicked out of Kartpa Valley if they failed to break through. </p><p>I had already placed a hundred Burning Ice Blood Essence cultivators in the area, and isolated the whole region with formations, in case they acted while I was busy with something I couldn’t interrupt, so technically, I could just stay away, but I still wanted to go there.</p><p>Just because I had their main cultivation technique didn’t mean that I could predict every little trick they possessed. My presence might mean the difference between the success and the failure in case they were able to reveal an unfortunate surprise. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Going to the second floor and leaving the operation alone was deliberate. While I wanted to set up a sustainable hunting operation, I didn’t forget the real reason for it. Money was nice, but it was still a side benefit. A space I could freely experiment in was the part I truly valued.</p><p>Yes, I could stay there to improve the camp far faster, but the more I stayed with them, the more dependent on my orders they would become. It was another lesson I had learned from my old career as a professor, trying to lead the doctorate students. I might be able to answer their questions far faster than they could come up with on their own, but that meant they couldn’t solve problems on their own. </p><p>I needed them to operate independently. I deliberately added the task of designing emergency drills to Harold, as a challenge and a test. After all, I needed someone to deal with the guild operations, and he seemed to have the right mixture of deference and initiative. As an added benefit, it was someone trusted by Eleanor enough to be put in a position of command. </p><p>Amusingly, I was the only guild leader who would classify that as a benefit. In the end, guilds and the town had a complicated relationship, a mixture of both economic and military forces. Hiring one of the guards would reveal a lot of secrets that a guild would have liked to keep hidden. </p><p>Information asymmetry was a more dangerous weapon than any sword. </p><p>That was not the only disadvantage of my operation. Technically, by letting the operation develop in a way that didn’t require me to solve the problems directly, I was potentially creating competitors. Now that I had revealed the arrowheads, it wasn’t impossible for someone to reverse engineer it — or, failing that, start purchasing similar equipment from System shops to test it. It might mean some of my guild members splitting to build their own guild. </p><p>Luckily, that was not a concern for me. The more guilds operated in the town, the stronger the town would get, which meant I could operate more freely. And, if I really wanted to make money, I could easily sell it to other guilds. </p><p>With the ability to mass produce, it would be much easier. </p><p>While it was not a problem for me, it was one for the other guilds. I didn’t know how bigger guilds handled that risk. Eleanor had mentioned that there was some kind of method that the bigger guilds had to prevent it, but even she didn’t know too much about it, making it a difficult solution to implement. </p><p>“It’s hunting time,” I said even as I rushed to the fourth floor at full speed. There was a reason for my hurry. Now that I had established a guild, I was responsible for it. I didn’t particularly care for the efficiency of the operation, as I could already make the necessary ammunition en masse, which meant that, even with all the potential problems, it would still be profitable. </p><p>Their security, on the other hand, was a completely different matter. Even without possible interference from Thomas, the other guilds wouldn’t be happy to see us succeed. And, the dungeon was a dangerous place. </p><p>My presence could easily intimidate them, but if I made a habit of staying away from the base for a long time, they might start to get ideas. It meant I had to show up often, preferably with a random pattern, to make sure they couldn’t plan around my absence. </p><p>For that, Fleeting Step helped, but I couldn’t help but wonder if the advanced version of Swift Spear included an even better variant. </p><p>So, when I arrived at the fourth floor — switching to my best set in the process — I stopped by the base just enough to get my crusher, before I moved to the other side of the second ring, which I created to capture the beasts. There were already a lot of giant monsters, but they weren’t enough for my purposes. </p><p>I tightened my grip over my hammer, crushing a few shells to replenish my mana completely. Then, I opened the box, triggering an artificial monster swarm. Then, I killed thousands of monsters, my hammer moving like I was in front of an anvil, not bothering to remove their shells, knowing that it affected the skill drop rate significantly. </p><p>I was glad that I had long learned to use a weaker version of Fleeting Step without the assistance of the skill, as it allowed me to stick to using Hammer while I dealt with the horde. It was critical, as without the vertical mobility it gave me, allowing me to climb on the monsters with ease, I might have ended up buried under their bodies.</p><p>The utility of mobility was difficult to overstate. For once, I was glad that the Stats were not very well defined. While every Stat had a role based on the class, Blacksmiths received Dexterity to improve hand-eye coordination, but it also increased footwork and general flexibility as well. </p><p>It was certainly beneficial.</p><p>As I killed thousands of monsters, I made sure to leave them in piles of fifty, which guaranteed the drop of a Rare skill, their shape and glow making them easy to distinguish. Unfortunately, that ease didn’t apply to the content. </p><p>After an hour of steady hunting, I managed to collect a hundred skills, and sixty of them were Nurture. Of the remaining forty, I had two more Quake Hammer and the rest was incomprehensible because I lacked the prerequisite stats.</p><p>“Frustrating,” I said even as I created another pile of monsters. It truly was, especially since I couldn’t level up no matter how many monsters I had killed. I wondered if the other types of monsters could help me level up. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to experience that. Maybe if I could find the fifth floor — </p><p>My thoughts had been interrupted by the new skill stone that appeared, which gave me exactly what I needed. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Breeze Spear]</p><p>The moment I got that, I went back to the base and absorbed the skill. At this point, improving a Rare combat skill was something I had already optimized. A composite spear to allow me to use mana attacks in ranged form was all I needed. </p><p>It took me barely twenty minutes to improve it to the peak of nothing. I was happy to note that Breeze Spear was even more reliant on mobility. Combined with what I had learned from my Fleeting Step, it allowed me to move even faster. </p><p>[Breeze Spear (Rare) 197 -&gt; 200]</p><p>[Perk Options — Floating Stride / Hurricane Stab / Mercurial Dodge] </p><p>“Please no,” I gasped even as I read the Perk options. One in particular caught my eye:. Floating Stride. I wanted to ignore it and choose Mercurial Dodge, but in the end, I still chose it. The ability to move faster was exactly what I needed. </p><p>“Surely not,” I said, trying to convince myself, but the moment I used it, two things happened. I lost a hundred health. </p><p>And, my skill took over my body and I jumped. Soon, I found myself floating twenty yards in the air, my body clenched with fear. The fear was intense enough to forcibly disturb the control of the skill, and I landed on the ground with a loud crash, the metal armor and the metal floor creating a very explosive sound. </p><p>“That wasn’t so bad, right?” I asked myself. “Merely twenty yards, and even landing on a metal surface didn’t damage me. Harmless.” </p><p>Unfortunately, my amateurish attempt at self-therapy didn’t work as well. I still sat on the ground, my hands trembling badly while I breathed in and out, trying to stave off a panic attack. Doing that with my skill should have felt safer than relying on a griffin or a plane. </p><p>After all, I trusted the skills enough to deliberately trigger a swarm of monsters consisting almost exclusively of giant insects and fight against them. Why couldn’t I trust them to give me a vertical jump ability of twenty yards, with some kind of floating mixed in? </p><p>It was only rational, right? </p><p>Unfortunately, as much as we wanted to believe otherwise, we were not rational creatures. Hell, as a sociologist, I made a living out of studying how that shaped our society. </p><p>It took five minutes for me to even stand up. “I’m so glad I need to visit the first floor,” I said to myself even as I went back, the attacking monsters were merely a nuisance. Once I was on the second floor, I started hunting, once again using the mana trick to quickly kill the monsters and remove their shells with one hit. </p><p>Ideally, I should have been trying to integrate the Floating Stride into my moves. It was an excellent time. Instead, I relied on the movement trick I developed based on Fleeting Step, unable to bring myself to repeat it. </p><p>I remembered my old therapist likening facing my fears to fighting monsters. It turned out that she was wrong. </p><p>Fighting with monsters was easier. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Not bad,” I called twenty minutes later, examining the tiny orchard we had created, though speaking out loud was mostly for the benefit of the new hires, as they still looked skittish. </p><p>After all, the orchard was underwhelming compared to what I had created, there were merely ten trees, and only one of them was as tall as me. Nine of them were smaller. I could have triggered their growth just as easily, but the water we had brought was mostly gone, and the rest was earmarked for the next experiment.  </p><p>Technically, Nurture was incredible enough to force their growth even without water and other nutrients, but then it would have slowed down enough to be completely pointless. </p><p>“Next, break a branch, and heal it with Nurture,” I said. Alchemical fertilizer Maria had allowed the tree to generate a new branch, but it was slow progress. My mixture worked much better this time since the tree was strong enough to handle the poison. </p><p>“T-three points,” one of the farmers gasped, looking shocked, while all the others looked regretful. </p><p>“Don’t worry, all of you will have a chance to improve your skill to at least twenty-five,” I said, underselling the potential significantly. Luckily, improving a common Nurture skill was hardly extraordinary. </p><p>People did not try to optimize it, because there was no strategic value to it, not when Farmers were the cheapest talent in the market. </p><p>I thought about offering them one of the Rare nurture skills, but I decided against it. While it might be the cheapest Rare skill, it was still a rare one, and I didn’t have hundreds of them. Keeping them for the ones that I eventually wanted to hire was a better option. </p><p>Once the branch was ready, turning it into a crossbow bolt was easy. I already had the device to cut it into the perfect shape, and plugging it in place was just as easy. More common arrows would have used some special glue, screws, or another solution to make sure the connection stayed secure. Since our arrows would shatter at one attempt, there was no reason to risk it.</p><p>As for fletchings, fashioning one out of wood was enough. It wasn’t the ideal material, but it didn’t need to be. With the mist in place, we were only trying to hit targets at thirty yards. Even without a skill, that was an achievable target. </p><p>With a skill guiding the attack, against a monster that only charged at a straight line, missing was harder than hitting the target. And, with the material of the arrow especially effective on them, it was inevitable.  </p><p>“Now, try and see if you can pull the bow back,” I said. Unfortunately, without Strength, only two of them were capable of it, and both of them struggled for almost a minute. I made a note to put together a simple device to assist it. </p><p>“No matter,” I said even as I quickly cocked every crossbow, the pressure as light as a feather under my touch. “Harold, leave one direction free and come here,” I said. “You’re responsible for reloading the crossbows.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said, but I was able to catch his slight dissatisfaction. It might be a while since I had to deal with a bunch of overeager doctoral students, but I knew exactly how people looked when they received a task they disdained. </p><p>A problem that was best nipped in the bud. “Look, they are still a bunch of people with no combat experience. I need someone excellent to command them from up close, someone that can keep them alive.” It helped that I was being honest. His role wasn’t exactly glamorous at this point, but very important. </p><p>Harold had the necessary common sense to manage the situation. </p><p>“I won’t disappoint you, sir,” he said. </p><p>I nodded before I returned to the front line, where five farmers were looking scared and excited while they held the crossbows. “A-are we really going to kill monsters, sir,” one of them asked, like he still couldn’t believe it. </p><p>I didn’t blame him. Dungeon access was an expensive luxury. Well, at least ones as smooth as our current one, with an open, straightforward surface. Based on what I had collected, the really dangerous ones — the ones that were even more hostile than the fourth floor — worked in reverse, with guilds getting paid to control them. But, those were not relevant for Farmers. </p><p>“Yes,” I said. I thought about mentioning that I planned to give some of the profit as well, but I kept my mouth shut about it. No need to overwhelm them. </p><p>We waited a bit, and soon, an insect drifted forward. All of them shot at it at the same time, and two of them missed in a hurry. Still, three bolts were enough to kill the insect as they shattered inside it. </p><p>It wasn’t a coincidence. I had already tried it before, and anti-corrosive material functioned akin to poison for these monsters. It penetrated through the armor only due to its unique properties, shattering in the process. And, the pieces worked like poison, because they were made from the shells of the giant variants.  </p><p>“I … leveled up,” one of the farmers gasped. </p><p>“Good, but next time, wait until it gets into thirty-yard range before shooting, and use your skill properly. Also, don’t shoot at the same time, but take turns. No need to get too excited.”  </p><p>“Now, bring the crossbow to Harold, and pick a new one,” I said, and watched them kill the monsters as they got near. </p><p>“Should we extract the shell,” one of the others asked. </p><p>“It’s not urgent,” I replied. “I don’t want you to start extracting before you put on armor. I don’t want friendly fire,” I said. </p><p>I let every single of them kill a few monsters, before I asked another question. “Is there anyone that’s still below level ten?” I asked. No one answered, but their smiles were a bit silly, like they were drinking. I didn’t blame them. The sensation of leveling up was fascinating, especially in the lower levels. And, for people who were unlucky enough to receive Farmer class, it was even more incredible, as most of them weren’t even level five. </p><p>They might be receiving only one Vitality and nothing else, but it still meant twenty Health points, and faster conversion of food, both critical for their farming abilities. Also, I was observing them. While the lack of stats meant that their outward potential didn’t match what others were showing, Vitality still gave them a general improvement. </p><p>For example, they were able to load their crossbows without assistance. It was still slow, so using the guards as a chain was still better, but I was hopeful that it would turn unnecessary soon. At least, for the current ones, which were pretty much the weakest on the market. </p><p>I would still need to figure out a solution if I were to ever upgrade them. </p><p>I didn’t allow them to start collecting before every single one of them donned the armor, and got used to moving in it. Luckily, the System design was lightweight, ergonomic, and adjustable, making the process easy. </p><p>Only then, I allow them to start collecting the shells, the extractors working just as well as a hunter using his skills. “Excellent work,” I said even as I started assigning tasks. “Now, we’re going to have five teams. Hunters, construction workers, farmers, arrow makers, and a reserve force. To start, fifteen will be hunters, and ten will be in the reserve force.” </p><p>“What is the job of the reserve force, sir?” a farmer asked. </p><p>“For the moment, collecting shells and making sure crossbows are loaded. However, in case of a swarm, I want you to be able to distribute crossbows to everyone while you all pull back to the fort.” </p><p>“A swarm. Is that likely, sir?” another asked. </p><p>“Maybe,” I responded. “But, it’s nothing that can’t be handled as long as we build the keep. And, with me here, there’s no need to fear any swarm,” I explained. </p><p>I waited until the farmers started operating, and soon, they started collecting shells. The numbers were not particularly impressive — well, by my standards, as I had no doubt that they would easily surpass any other guild’s output with ease — but it didn’t bother me. </p><p>After all, it was just a proof of concept, one that had worked. The first floor of the dungeon wasn’t teeming with monsters, so the number of monsters that chose to attack us was the main limiting factor. It would change once I was confident enough to let them roam without supervision, and it would get even better once I let them establish another fort on the second floor. </p><p>As the hunting team and reserve team spread around the base, the guards stayed back, doing nothing but watching with their swords in hand. </p><p>“It looks promising, sir,” Harold said as he got near me. “But, wouldn’t it be better if we can find hunters? That would be far more efficient I think.” </p><p>“Sure, as long as you can find me a thousand hunters in less than a week, we can do that,” I replied, and his eyes widened. </p><p>“A — a thousand, sir,” he gasped. </p><p>“A thousand, for each shift, rotating with eight-hour patterns,” I added, which made his eyes widen. </p><p>“I … I don’t think that will work, sir,” he said, looking reproachful. “Not unless Lady Eleanor allows you to monopolize the first floor, and even then, it won’t be efficient. There’s a limit to the number of monsters. Maybe a thousand in total, rotating in three teams?” </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, I didn’t know the dungeon only had one floor,” I responded. His eyes widened as he realized what I was talking about. And, once pointed, he didn’t question it. After all, the biggest challenge on the second floor was the presence of the ranged attackers, easily destroying armor and weapons. </p><p>Crossbows had better range. </p><p>“What’s next, sir,” he asked. </p><p>“Three things,” I said. “I want you to arrange for professionals to build a two-layered defensive encampment around the warehouse. Nothing too tall. Just five feet would be enough, but make it thick so that monsters couldn’t chew through it easily. I want another wall around the dungeon gate in case of an emergency.” </p><p>“And, the third one, sir?” </p><p>“I want you to come up with various scenarios. Assassination, monster swarms, fighting with other guilds, each solution prioritizing the lives of the guild members over material savings. And, make sure to train everyone on how to respond.”</p><p>“I won’t disappoint, sir,” he said. </p><p>“I hope you won’t,” I answered even as I grabbed the empty cart, and walked toward the gate leading to the second floor. “Now, you take the command while I go and hunt on the second floor.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>The rest of the night had gone well. I even had a chance to catch a short nap. One that barely lasted three hours, but it was all I could get sleeping in the dungeon. </p><p>Once that was done, I went to the third floor, piled everything into a new cart — which included a small batch of fertilizer mix — and went back to the second floor, then the first floor, deliberately using the gates at the opposite sides. The gate was a good place to camp. It was away from the operations, while it was also fitting to expand the operations between two floors. </p><p>When I arrived at the first floor, I found Harold, along with fifty farmers, each holding a crossbow, practicing with targets they had set in a corner. “Good initiative,” I said to him. </p><p>“My pleasure, sir,” he replied, while the rest of the Farmers looked settled into their roles. </p><p>“Take four guards with decent Strength, and follow me,” I said. “You’ll be responsible for the defense of the new camp.” That was not a part of the agreement I had with Maria, but sometimes, it was better to ask forgiveness than permission. </p><p>Not that they would have refused. Our deal was heavily skewed to their favor — something deliberate on my part — while five guards were nothing they couldn’t give up. </p><p>I wanted them for two reasons. First, they would be responsible for cranking the crossbows until I could make a device that could handle it, but, more importantly, they were there to prevent any possible harassment from other guilds. </p><p>The guards might have refused, but my reputation for generosity proved useful. Instead of trying to get away from the task, the guards were competing for the opportunity. And, the best part, they still worked for Eleanor. </p><p>No other guild’s freelance work would have been treated as such an advantage. Admittedly, I would have shared that opinion a week ago, when I was trying to scrape funds for my experimentation, but the current situation wasn’t the same. </p><p>“Gather together, and don’t make too many sudden movements,” I warned the farmers. “We will protect you, but if you panic and run away, I can’t guarantee your safety.” </p><p>Then, I left the command to Harold, who was far more capable when it came to handling things while another guard started pulling the cart I had brought. Meanwhile, five of the farmers were dragging a large, wooden water tank with wheels, which was necessary to slowly grow the trees.</p><p> I took the point, killing the monsters with a slash while I used the extractor — the old, clumsy one made of bronze — to remove the shell.</p><p>“Watch carefully, you’ll be doing that as well,” I warned them even as we slowly traversed for a distance. </p><p>It was a good chance to show the process and remind them about my capabilities at the same time. The Rare skill flowed even more smoothly, enough to fascinate them. I was so lucky that Thomas had sent his assassins without proper time to practice, or my fate could have been different. </p><p>“We’re here,” I said as we finally arrived at the spot I had picked as my guild’s permanent camp. The epicenter was just a hundred yards away from the dungeon gate leading to the second floor. Meaning, we didn’t have to deal with it currently, but as we expanded, the small fort could grow to take it in, with a corresponding defensive structure on the second floor. </p><p>With the ability to easily produce arrowheads, it should be easy to scale up. I just needed to purchase more crossbows. </p><p>The rigidity of metals didn’t allow me to make a bow out of them entirely.</p><p>“Now, I want you to be responsible for the camp security while I handle the construction,” I said to Harold and the guards while I passed them five swords I took from my assassins, which I had modified further. </p><p>“Sir, are you sure?” Harold asked as he grabbed the sword, his expression wide. “These must cost a fortune.” </p><p>“They are valuable because I won them in battle,” I responded. “So, I won’t be happy if they leave the camp.” </p><p>“Wouldn’t it be better to use them to hunt directly,” he asked. </p><p>“Not unless you’re confident you can kill two thousand insects a day,” I responded. His widening gaze told me that it was not exactly a viable strategy. It wasn't a surprise. Any guard that was willing to join a new dungeon where they could only level up to thirty — well, forty was the absolute limit, but that was hardly efficient — wouldn’t have a valuable class. </p><p>And, getting Rare skills wasn't exactly easy, even with my setup. It required piling multiple giant monsters, and then it needed to give a combat skill rather than Nurture, which seemed to be the most common skill stone. </p><p>“Still, wouldn’t it be better to find five elites and rely on the swords to finish the dungeon?” </p><p>“No,” I said, but I didn’t bother explaining further, maintaining a sense of mystery. “Just kill any beast that gets near,” I said. The guards looked hesitant. “Don’t bother trying to keep the shell intact. Just cut them, and shout if there’s any sign of a swarm,” I said.  </p><p>I cracked open the first metal container, one with farming implements and other construction tools, though they were made of more ordinary alloys. “Now, grab a shovel, and start piling the dirt to the side,” I ordered while I started digging a deep pool, which not only started to agitate the nearby monsters but also the farmers. </p><p>“Sir, shouldn’t we be responsible for manual labor?” one of them asked hesitantly. </p><p>“It’s faster this way. Just grab a shovel, and start piling them to the side. I want a square, with twenty yards on each side, to my left.” For now, it was just a slightly elevated ground where the crossbowman could stand. </p><p>It was small, but once completed, it would function as intended. </p><p>Once the pool was deepened enough to easily hold all the water we had brought, I let it pour. It was not the ideal way, but since it was going to be a temporary one, it should function well enough. </p><p>Sometimes, good enough is all that’s needed. </p><p>“Now, who has the highest farming skill,” I called. They looked hesitant. “Anyone with Farming above twenty-five,” I asked. None of them raised their hands, but their regretful expression showed that they were not happy about it. “Fifteen?” I asked. This time, three people raised their hands. </p><p>While that number was low, I couldn’t blame them. After all, didn’t I suffer from the exact same thing when I was trying to improve Repair and Forge? </p><p>Production classes required a lot of resources to improve. And, if they were valued enough by their previous employer, they wouldn’t have accepted Maria’s offer to come to a mana dead zone. </p><p>“Good, how about Perks,” I asked. While asking about the Perks might be considered invasive for the combat classes, production classes didn’t share the same concern. Particularly the Farmers. “Tend,” two of them answered. “Resistance,” the third one answered. </p><p>“Alright, all of you, come here,” I said even as I pulled three potted bushes I had brought from the third floor. I wanted to see how their abilities stacked. </p><p>For two of them, I put some alchemical booster and watered them well. At the same time, I used some of the broken shells that the guards had collected in the process to the base of the plant. For the third plant, I didn’t add any alchemical boosters and assigned the one with Tend to it. </p><p>“Now, I want you to use thirty Health on the plants,” I said. They did, looking exhausted in the process. </p><p>The two plants only got slightly greener, while there was no reaction with the one without an alchemical booster. </p><p>“I … I gained a point of proficiency,” one with the Resistance perk gasped. One of them with Tend shared the same expression, while the one without the alchemical booster looked disappointed and fearful at the same time. </p><p>“No need to panic, we’re just testing,” I said. “Go and eat something,” I said even as I called two more with Tend perk. “Now, I want you to spend all of your Health to keep the plant alive,” I said. Then, I added a few drops from my alchemical mixture. </p><p>The plant died, while the two who tried to save them looked shocked and guilty at the same time. “We’re sorry, sir —” they started, their panic obvious, only to fall silent when I gestured. </p><p>“Don’t panic every time,” I said. “We’re just trying something here. Now, is there any improvement?” </p><p>“No, sir,” they said, which didn’t surprise me. A dead plant was a clear-cut failure, and skills rewarded success. It might have been different if they could have improved the plant until they stopped feeding Health, but even as they used the skill, the plant died. </p><p>“Should we set a Nurture circle, sir?” one of them asked. </p><p>“Nurture circle?” I asked. </p><p>“We pick a plant, add a lot of fertilizer, and use our Health one after another to enable the growth. It’s the fastest way to grow plants.” </p><p>“Interesting, but we don’t need to waste time on it for the moment,” I said. Instead, I uprooted one of the bushes, and put my hand on the other. “Just set a bucket chain.” </p><p>“S-sir. Too much water without a Nurture circle would kill the plant —” he started, only to gasp when I put my hand on the bush, and fed it with my Health. </p><p>[-42 Health]</p><p>The difference between Common and Rare Nurture showed a difference. I didn’t spend any more Health than they did, but the bush not only grew, but it also transformed, its misshapen branches straightening as it turned into a tree. </p><p>It was good, but not as good as using the poisonous water from the fourth-floor swamp. </p><p>The farmers around me froze, gasping in shock as the newly apparent tree had grown to an incredible size. “You have Nurture, sir?” Harold asked, shocked, who was close enough to watch the show.</p><p>“Of course, you never know when you’re going to need some emergency food in the wilderness or a dungeon,” I answered. </p><p>“Well…” he started, but I could see the hesitancy in his face, often when people were about to say something extremely insensitive. I guessed that there was some prejudice about warriors ‘wasting’ a skill slot. </p><p>“We can talk about it later,” I said. “Now, you bunch look like you have a question.” </p><p>“S-sir. If we’re not needed to grow plants, why are we here?” one of them stammered, no doubt afraid to be discarded. I hated the way poverty and discrimination ground people’s will into dust. But, fixing it would be a slow process. </p><p>Especially since the people in power preferred it to stay that way. </p><p>“You’re here to kill monsters, of course,” I responded. “Why do you think you’re training with the crossbows,” I said. The shift of emotion was fascinating. “But, you can’t start leveling before we finish growing these trees. Now, buckets!” </p><p>This time, they moved at a fascinating speed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I first stopped by the fourth floor to bring a large cart filled with iron ores. These ores would be used for all the necessary materials, which came in three main categories. Namely, armors, weapons, and various other implements — farming, construction, shell removal, and arrow making. </p><p>The function of each category was obvious. However, their design was not straightforward. As long as I had the silver, I could easily forge fifty copies of my armor that would keep them safe from anything that the first three floors could throw at them. But, that was not an option because of the nature of my cover story. </p><p>While everyone else should believe that I was getting deliveries from an enigmatic delivery company, Eleanor and Maria were aware of the truth. So, if I armed the Farmers with a high-quality silver-iron mana alloy set, they would catch on that something was wrong. </p><p>Luckily, that level of defense was not exactly necessary for the first and second floors, considering they would be armed with crossbows. It just needed to survive one or two attacks from the monsters. </p><p>Instead, I decided to use a design from the System: a loose plate armor, which should be useful against both insects and human threats without hindering their mobility too much. I had used the design from the skill wholesale, without making even the slightest change. </p><p>These sets of armor were similar to those that could be purchased from a System Store. Yet, it was something an ordinary Blacksmith should have been capable of, as long as he spent a lot of money and consumed a lot of materials to improve his Forge skill, which should keep Eleanor and Maria from asking too many questions. </p><p>Creating fifty of them in one night was a bit excessive, but I could always claim that I had spent the last week doing that. However, those fifty armors were barely worth a few gold coins when purchased from the System store, so there would be no such questions.  </p><p>There was a reason people didn’t care much about Blacksmiths. The System Store always had better and cheaper alternatives. </p><p>Unless, of course, one decided to be a little unconventional. </p><p>Of course, the desire to make them look like System store purchases wasn’t the only reason I stayed loyal to the design of the skill. Using the skill directly meant that I could forge the armor far faster. A part of it was the high proficiency, making the earlier steps easier. The other part of it was the skill guiding me on exactly how to use mana to bypass many steps, from the alloy structure settling crystals, to proper cooling. </p><p>It was hard to keep track when I could easily forge an armor in less than a minute. An absurd speed that was only possible because the material wasn’t mana alloy. Forging those still took far more time. </p><p>However, speed wasn’t the only reason. Quality played a role as well. While I was able to come up with a lot of specialized designs, from a more generalized perspective, they were still extremely inferior. </p><p>The same was true for the first set of spears I had designed. They were made of the same iron alloys I used on the armor, which would work well against any threat, including humans. </p><p>Once that was complete, I went to the fourth floor, but I didn’t immediately start forging arrowheads. It would be faster for a day, but considering the amount and the scale I required, I didn’t want to spend an hour every day wasting my time on repetitive work. </p><p>Instead, I created myself a nice setup. It had three steps. First, in a large cauldron, I would mix molten iron with the dungeon crystals and finely ground giant monster shell — which I could hunt en masse believably thanks to my improved sword skill — while I used my mana to stabilize the process, giving me the necessary raw material. </p><p>After that, I would pour the mixture onto a large tray, with arrow-shaped holes in it, with a lid that overlapped. Together, they functioned like a traditional sand casting. Of course, in that traditional casting, sand was used, because the molten metal would meld together. </p><p>Then, I put that tray into specialized shelves to cool down, and worked on a second tray.  </p><p>For that, I covered the bottom layer with a layer of sand, so it could be separated easily, and the top part could be pulled. Once I did so, the arrowheads came as one connected sheet. To deal with that, I designed a huge scissor, made of composite structure. It allowed me to use an oversized mana blade to cut the arrowheads from the bottom. </p><p>The system was still primitive, but only the first part required me to use the Mana Forge skill. </p><p>As long as I had the materials ready, I would be able to forge tens of thousands of arrowheads at once. </p><p>The ability to use Mana during forging was just as big of a game changer as using it during combat. Too bad I couldn’t sell my products openly without turning myself into a target. If I could, I would have just moved to a city and worked from the safety of a proper workshop rather than in the middle of a dungeon with a permanent corrosive mist that destroyed everything that wasn’t designed for its unique nature. </p><p>Once the arrows had been completed, I brought them to the third floor before sealing them inside identical iron boxes, to be used in the morning. </p><p>With that, most of the preparation had been completed. </p><p>The next task was simpler. I finally opened the box Eleanor had brought for me. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Blade of Retribution (Rare)]</p><p>It was a domineering name, which was the only thing I knew. When I asked Eleanor about it, she had just smirked playfully and asked me to trust her. I chose to do so, particularly since it wasn’t exactly as critical of a decision as she might have considered. </p><p>Ultimately, for me, a sword was a supporting weapon at best. </p><p>Of course, there was no reason for Eleanor to sabotage me, particularly through an expensive tool like a Rare skill. I had no idea about the current state of the skill market, particularly when it came to the more expensive skills. </p><p>Without thinking any longer, I accepted. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 100 -&gt; Blade of Retribution (Rare) 1]</p><p>After the discomfort had disappeared, I once again grabbed the fragile composite sword with gold filling, designed for ranged attacks. A few mana attacks were enough to push the skill to a high level. </p><p>[Blade of Retribution (Rare) 1 -&gt; 79]</p><p>As the information flowed into my perception, I started analyzing the merits of the fighting style, and the first thing I could say was that Eleanor had picked well. The sword was truly excellent for a Blacksmith who decided to embrace the blade over the hammer. </p><p>In a way, it was not too dissimilar to Stalwart Guard, as it relied on defense and strong counterattacks, relying on the pairing of a shield and a sword, but there were significant differences as well. It was optimized for a bigger, almost oversized sword — though it could still function well with a smaller one —  and it was more mobility-dependent than Stalwart Guard. </p><p>I had to admit, even without the advantages that came from the tier upgrade of the skill, Blade of Retribution was a much better style. Stalwart Guard was better for fighting as a part of a small team maintaining formation while relying on the shield. Blade of Retribution was more reliant on mobility and footwork. </p><p>It was even better for my case, as my Dexterity was higher than an ordinary Blacksmiths', which meant I could fight better. </p><p>“Now, to improve, or not to improve,” I asked a tree. Unfortunately, it didn’t answer, leaving the decision to me. The decision was tricky. Improving meant that I could defend myself better, particularly against public threats where I might be reluctant to show my Quake Hammer. </p><p>And, it wasn’t just another assassin I was thinking of. If I were Thomas — or, one of his advisors — I might have bribed a few other people to find a reason to fight me. Unfortunately, for a warrior and a guild leader, there would be times I couldn’t refuse such challenges, particularly if they were nonlethal. </p><p>Not without raising a lot of questions that are best left unasked. </p><p>Alternatively, I could have kept my improvement slow, which would be more convincing to Eleanor. In the first half, I could claim that it was the learnings from the Stalwart Guard, but anything above a hundred would be a harder sell. </p><p>A tough decision, indeed. Though, I had to admit, even the ability to ask such a question was a luxury in the first place. It was only my systematic approach and my extensive preparation — mixed with some considerable luck — that had allowed me to ask such questions in the first place. Anyone else had to improve the old-fashioned way. </p><p>It was easy once I figured out the trick behind it … but then, I wasn’t exactly sure that was the case. I claimed the same when I was eleven and started learning college-level math questions on my own. </p><p>In the end, I decided to maximize the skill. On one hand, failure meant I needed to find an excuse to give Eleanor, while on the other, failure might mean death. “I just have to refuse duels for a week or two,” I decided. Hopefully, exhaustion and being busy setting up my guild would be a good excuse. She should be busy as well. </p><p>Even if we were available, I could still try to sandbag the duel. It would be hard, but the closer our skill level, the more believable it would be. </p><p> In the end, anything under a month to max out a Rare skill would be suspicious, so I didn’t even bother to try. </p><p>Instead, I spent an hour practicing everything that was granted by the Rare variant to make sure I had a good handle on what it offered below a hundred, before I went near the trees, and started targeting the insects with the ranged mana attacks. </p><p>Those ranged attacks were significantly worse than just cutting them directly, but the fragile blade couldn’t handle it. And, the aim wasn’t to kill them, but to maximize the attack. </p><p>[Blade of Retribution (Rare) 196 -&gt; 200]</p><p>[Perk Options — Strike of Retribution / Swift Step / Unbroken Guard] </p><p>“Difficult choice,” I said even as I read the available options. Strike of Retribution and Swift Step were both equally appealing. In the end, I decided to choose the Strike of Retribution, which turned out to be a ranged vitality attack. </p><p>It merely consumed forty Health, and delivered a smooth cut. I was happy with its existence. </p><p>But, even as I practiced, I realized that I neglected to check one important piece of information. I didn’t know if Perk Reset stones worked on higher-tier skills. </p><p>“Another problem for the future,” I muttered even as I started working on a new sword design, my new Perk already teaching me new things. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I stayed with the Farmers while the raffle was being prepared, and watched while the schedule was set. I even made a copy of it in the view of everyone. I had no intention of checking the schedule of eight thousand Farmers, but just having that opportunity would intimidate some with bad intentions. </p><p>I didn’t have the time to micromanage them, so such subterfuge was necessary.  Then, I left, leaving the task of arranging the operational details to Harold. I needed to rely upon him a lot for this task.  </p><p>There was a benefit to handling the management of the Farmers through Harold. It was a well-known fact that not being seen too many times helped reflect a sense of authority, which was why even the generals before the Cataclysm didn’t fraternize with the rank and file, but it wasn’t the reason I didn’t stay with them. </p><p>No, I had a simpler reason. I had a lot of work to do in the dungeon. </p><p>Since I had officially mentioned to Eleanor that I would be building a forge in the dungeon, I needed to do so. For that, I would have to set up another forge, this time in a hidden corner of the second floor, maybe dig a cave for it. Admittedly, I had no intention of actually using that forge. It would be entirely for show. </p><p>I just needed a location for Eleanor if she wanted to visit. </p><p>Meanwhile, I would be splitting the actual task of forging the required materials between the third and fourth floors. The armor and the spears I planned to forge had to be made on the third floor, as they would be made of ordinary materials, and just staying on the fourth floor would destroy them. </p><p>Luckily, the arrowheads would be corrosion-resistant, so I could handle their forging on the fourth floor. </p><p>It was important. Unlike the armor sets and spears, I would be forging an absurd number of arrowheads, and on the fourth floor, I could use the steam engines to make the process even faster. And, the less time I spent on routine tasks, the more time I would have to explore the fourth floor without people getting suspicious. </p><p>I was glad that I had revealed part of my subterfuge to Eleanor and Maria. Not having to hide everything from them meant that I could do much more. Just the fact that I could bring sealed boxes in and out of the dungeon was a game changer. </p><p>“Now, the hard part,” I muttered as I left the town behind, and started walking the road between the dungeon and the town, alone. I wasn’t walking because I was suddenly unafraid of another possible assassination, but because I was afraid of them. </p><p>It was a simple bluff. The thing that was keeping me safe was Thomas’ erroneous belief that I was above level hundred. Even if he suspected that there had been something wrong with using Charisma, he would still believe that I was near that point. </p><p>It would make assassinating me the worst way to sabotage the town, especially when Maria and Eleanor were around. Luckily, my earlier stay in the dungeon could easily be explained as staying to protect the dungeon rather than trying to stay safe.</p><p>“I just hope he’ll think like that,” I said even as I left the road and started to walk in the wilderness. Naturally, many wild monsters attacked, but they were not even a challenge to my Stalwart Guard, let alone my Quake Hammer. </p><p>With its proficiency at its limit, the skill was truly amazing. For example, I could confidently face a team of assassins even if they chose to attack together. I wouldn’t, of course, not if I had any other choice. Why should I have suffered a brave last stand when I could easily ambush the enemy? </p><p>If it wasn’t for my confidence to defend myself — or at least, escape — I wouldn’t have dared to walk into the wilderness. After all, there was a chance that Thomas could ignore all the reasons that made me a bad target and attack me. </p><p>“Now, let’s get to work,” I said to myself even as I found a small cave and entered it. After killing the monsters inside, I paused for a moment and used my Cleansing Meditation to absorb the mana they let out. </p><p>[+15 Mana]</p><p>Monsters outside didn’t have that much mana in them, so killing almost thirty of them barely gave me fifteen points. No wonder mages didn’t want to live here. However, I noticed something interesting, which was only possible thanks to Cleansing Meditation. </p><p>The monsters outside also had a minute amount of tainted energy. Not as intense as the monsters in the dungeon, and likely not the same kind. But, it was an interesting detail. However, it wasn’t the time to explore that. </p><p>I started digging a tunnel through the dungeon floor, my Strength allowing me to handle that task at a quick pace, especially when I could use Vitality attacks against any rocks. Using mana would have made things easier, but I wasn’t entirely sure that I had no one following me. </p><p>I traveled almost a thousand yards like that, and, at my point of exit, I used the camouflage ring to walk another three hundred yards, found a new cave, and repeated the pattern twice. </p><p>Once I finished that, I modified the surface layer of the armor completely. The shape, the patterns, everything. Luckily, I had long designed my armor to be two-layered, with the top layer only there as a distraction, so it worked well enough. </p><p>I even created a new, large spear to give my alter ego a different identity. Of course, it was not actually a spear, but a hollow tube, which I used to check for mineral deposits. Luckily, iron oxide was easy to recognize. And, since I was merely searching for something with around five percent purity, rather than above fifty percent like any sane commercial operation would, I was able to find enough material to forge my boxes. </p><p>Not having the necessity to carry boxes of iron helped. </p><p>The reason for my complicated travel plan and disguise, which included even some material sourcing, was simple. Once I started arriving with the mysterious metal boxes, people would start looking for them. I needed a reasonable excuse. So, once I was deep in the wilderness, I used the ores from the surrounding area to create a simple, sealed metal box that was larger than my body. </p><p>The box had two features. On its surface, there was a stamp, with the text of Mystery Delivery. And, inside, there was another stamp, with the phrase ‘Better luck next time’. The trick was simple. Once I started arriving at the dungeon with boxes that were supposedly filled with treasures, people could start looking for them. </p><p>I created those boxes as a simple trick. Once I buried enough of them, it would give them a good idea about the method. My secretive supplier would bury hundreds of boxes around, and supposedly inform me about the correct delivery. </p><p>For that reason, the boxes I forged were nothing I couldn’t do when my Forging was merely at ten. After all, they were merely decoys. </p><p>That, along with my growing reputation as someone supposedly at or above level hundred, should be enough to deflect the attention. </p><p>For the next eight hours, I went deeper and deeper into the wilderness, using Fleeting Step to move faster than should have been possible, leaving boxes in the hilltops and valleys, each far away from one another, creating a very complicated treasure hunt. I could have done so without much fear because the monsters in the mana dead zones weren’t as dangerous.</p><p>Of course, that should make living in mana dead zones a better option. It meant the area was more secure. However, the economic disadvantages created by a lack of environmental mana — like the fact that we needed almost ten farmers just to support one warrior operating in the dungeon — were obvious. Then there was the even more important fact that leveling was difficult. </p><p>Technically, both could be bypassed. Unfortunately, the security was not always guaranteed. It was safer under normal circumstances, but not during exceptional events. There was always a chance of a dungeon break from an undiscovered gate, or a monster horde could drift near while they were migrating.  </p><p>There was a reason that our current town had many expensive and rare siege weapons. </p><p>Well, that, and the nighttime was still dangerous. </p><p>Once I had arrived near the dungeon, I modified my armor back to its previous state, once again using mana allowing me to bypass some cumbersome steps. I created ten of those delivery boxes, and even created a fully metal cart I could pull along, and arrived at the dungeon. </p><p>In front of the dungeon, there was a line, where the guards were carefully patting down every entrant to make sure there wasn’t anyone smuggling dangerous lure potions or other items of sabotage. </p><p>“Hey, why’s he not being searched? He’s bringing that much stuff inside —” one of the new arrivals questioned. A guard silenced him by poking him with the end of a spear. The others in the line were quick to get the message. </p><p>I deliberately acted arrogant and aloof, different from my attitude around the guards. With my fake identity getting more and more complicated, the less interaction I had with the others, the more I could maintain that. </p><p>The guards said nothing even as I brought a huge delivery into the dungeon. I moved at a leisurely pace, ignoring the people trying to follow me without being too suspicious. After all, they didn’t dare to follow me to the second floor immediately. And, the moment I arrived at the second floor, I demolished the cart and the boxes back into ingots. </p><p>I used Fleeting Step to disappear into the dungeon mist, making it impossible for anyone to follow me even if they were inclined to do so.</p><p>I had a full night to forge everything I needed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The meeting didn’t end after we agreed on the details of my guild. There were still a lot of small details that needed to be determined. They were unrelated to me, and most of it was exhaustingly monotonous like the town layout and patrol schedule, but I stayed. </p><p>Having even an unofficial say in the town's development was too important to be ignored. Since I seemed to have been defaulted into the management of the town, I was happy to embrace it. </p><p>Once the meeting was done, we split. Eleanor went to meet with the guards to arrange the new patrol schedule, trying to make sure there would not be any problems. Maria flew to the nearest city to purchase as many crossbows as she could carry on a griffin along with some alchemical fertilizers. I didn’t need it since I had a better alternative, but I had requested some in order to have an excuse for keeping those plants in my possession.  </p><p>Meanwhile, I stayed at the headquarters for a while, writing notes on how to improve Repair quickly, then forging a set of weapons in increasing complexity that could be damaged and repaired at the same time. </p><p>They should be able to use that combination to quickly push their Repair skill to forties, which, combined with the Warm Blow perk, would allow them to repair the enchanted weapons. I didn’t write down my own Repair trick, instead derived a full set of simpler tricks that could be used with Warm Blow.  </p><p>The situation was complicated enough without another Blacksmith stumbling their path into Mana Forge. </p><p>As for the recruitment, I asked the guards to handle that, and ask for volunteers. Knowing how the warriors could treat the production classes, I made it very clear that I needed volunteers, and not coerced farmers. </p><p>If none of them wanted to join me in the dungeon, which was possible considering the danger, so be it. I could always find a different method. I wanted to improve, but not through forced labor. </p><p>Not when I could finally do something about it. </p><p>Once I stepped out, I found a sergeant I was familiar with from the dungeon waiting for me, but I couldn’t remember his name. Luckily, my new status meant that not remembering people’s names wasn't treated as something rude. “What was your name, sergeant? Sorry that I’m bad at names.” </p><p>“Harold, sir,” he said. I wondered if it was his real name, or if he was one of the people that changed theirs for a more old-timey feeling. But, I didn’t ask. It would have been pointlessly rude. “The potential recruits are waiting for you, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Where are they?” I asked. </p><p>“They are at the farm. I thought bringing a crowd here might be too much.” </p><p>“A crowd,” I asked. “You remember what I said about no coercion, right?” </p><p>“Of course,” the sergeant said, looking surprised. “I actually had to turn down bribes to bring them forward,” he declared. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “I would have thought that Farmers wouldn’t have been willing to risk themselves in a dungeon.” </p><p>“Not when you offer them double what they are already getting.” </p><p>“What?” I said. “I thought I offered them only a silver a day, with performance bonuses?” </p><p>“Yes, double what they are making,” Harold said. “We offer them half a silver, plus food and residence. Honestly, Lady Maria’s offer was already generous enough. Apparently, they had almost fifty thousand farmers respond to the application, so they were able to pick the best.” </p><p>“What about the danger?” I asked. I had known that farmers were struggling, but not to the point of moving to a potentially dangerous new town. </p><p>“Well, some of them. The money is already more than what they earned in the city. After removing costs, they are lucky to earn a silver a week in the city. Most barely break even,” the guard explained. “More importantly, it’s hard to level up in the city. They have to save for months to get access to even the simplest dungeon.” </p><p>“So, my offer to work in a dungeon…” </p><p>“Frankly, you can probably find volunteers that would work for free. It’s a waste of silver,” he said. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said. “No wonder they didn’t even ask about how much I will pay for the bonus,” I said, which made the guard skip a step. “What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“The performance bonus? That’s more money?” he asked, surprised. </p><p>“Well, yes. What did you think it was?” </p><p>“I thought it would be the right to kill monsters so that they can level up,” he said, surprised. “That’s the traditional way. The opportunity to be protected by someone at level one hundred while doing so…” </p><p>I frowned. I knew that the situation with the Farmers was bad, but I had clearly underestimated the extent of their plight. </p><p>“I didn’t know that,” I said. Suddenly, I realized that my offer of letting them hunt monsters with ranged weapons was more attractive, enough that I could probably make them pay for the privilege through weeks of physical work. </p><p>Not that I had any intention of actually doing that. What was the point of such cruelty? Just to keep salaries low? It was like the worst parts of capitalism and feudalism mixed in to create an unholy abomination. </p><p>Humanity… somehow always capable of making a bad situation worse. Even when there is no need. </p><p>I said nothing as we left the town, and started walking toward the farming center, where the farmers were working hard to tile the land and plant, leading the horses. The part nearest to the town was being turned into an orchard, while the more distant parts were being tiled to the beast land. </p><p>With the beasts pulling the plows, the process was fast. While Farmers only had Vitality as a stat which didn’t give them the ability to deadlift half a ton with ease, it was still enough to raise their endurance to an inhuman degree. They tiled the land with a steady pace, showing more enthusiasm than I had expected. </p><p>However, as I came closer, I realized that their steady work had a frantic edge, and I could already hear a few whispers about the guilds leaving the caravan to go back. They were probably assuming that some of them would be fired and sent back. </p><p>Admittedly, it was a realistic fear. Without my intervention to save the finances, Maria was already considering delaying the payment, and firing some of them to reduce the cost was the logical next step. Especially, with the number of guards gone, it would be a reasonable setup. </p><p>“The volunteers for the dungeon, gather around,” the sergeant shouted. “Sir Arthur is here to make the selection for the team that’ll join his guild.” </p><p>The workers froze before they all started to gather, already pushing each other. “Anyone that creates a commotion will be disqualified. I don’t want a stampede!” I shouted, which had been enough to freeze them. “No running. Walk calmly, and don’t push each other.” </p><p>Even as I shouted at them, I didn’t blame them. I knew exactly where they were coming from. It wasn’t even two weeks ago that I would have been a part of a similar group. Not for a silver coin, maybe, but five coins would have made me just as desperate. </p><p>While they gathered in a calmer manner, I climbed on a rock so that they could see me, and looked at Harold. “Listen to the rules well. I don’t want any guard violating them either,” I warned him. </p><p>“Understood, sir,” he said enthusiastically. </p><p>Machiavelli might have had a dubious reputation for his statement about it being better to be feared than loved, but his book had another, lesser-known quote that was certainly true. If one could arrange it, it was best to be loved and feared at the same time. </p><p>Luckily, the inherent threat of someone level one hundred — even if it wasn’t exactly true — and my new role in the inner circle handled the fear part, and my generosity worked well for the loved part. </p><p>“I’m sure the guards had mentioned what I want to do. I need people who will accompany me to the dungeon. I have already arranged with Lady Maria, so I can borrow you for a day or two before you return to your tasks,” I said. “Since we have that many volunteers, I want to make a few changes.” </p><p>“I’m willing to work for free—” one of them shouted. </p><p>“I’ll pay a silver as long as I can spend five minutes hunting in the dungeon!” another one shouted. </p><p>“I will —” </p><p>That looked like it could turn into a stampede. “Enough. No commotion,” I shouted. While I didn’t want to act like a jerk, trying to explain something to eight thousand people at once was not an easy thing. That was why I didn’t explain the exact details of the offer. They seemed to be ready to kill each other for an opportunity to visit the dungeon and kill a few monsters after a full day of work. </p><p>I didn’t want to see what they would do if they learned the job was to kill monsters from a safe distance. </p><p>From a pragmatic perspective, I could have easily convinced them to work for a pittance, or even sign some very punishing debt contracts, which I could easily enforce because of my direct contact with the management. I had no doubt that many in my place would have done exactly that. </p><p>It was pointless. I paused for a moment, which both allowed them to process the importance of the moment, while also giving me a chance to adjust my recruitment plan. My initial plan was to just hire the volunteers to join my guild, but I decided against it. </p><p>Not only could it turn messy to give them the opportunity, but it was also a waste. The higher their level, the less benefit they would get from killing monsters. I expected them to reach level fifteen quickly, and progress to twenty-five at a reasonable pace, only to be stalled during their class upgrade due to the lack of mana. </p><p>I decided to level up all of them. While it might slow down setting up my operation, it would give Maria a bunch of farmers who could work longer and produce more food. Selling it back would have been cumbersome, but it would mean the town could grow without expanding the number of farmers, which would be a bonus. </p><p>And, I doubted she would have a problem with increasing the self-defense capabilities of the farmers. Giving them both Stab and Shoot, which was produced in the dungeon, would make things very easy. </p><p>I just needed to prepare a set of armor for all of them so they didn’t die in an accident. </p><p>“Now, let me explain the rules. We’re going to set up a small raffle, and every volunteer will have a number. We will be rotating the dungeon workers, so all of you will have the opportunity to level up. The ones that impress me in the dungeon will have the chance to join my guild directly for even more payment. But, anyone who risks their fellow farmer’s life in the dungeon will lose that chance. Safety first!” I warned. “Feel free to change your mind if that’s not attractive.” </p><p>No one answered, their enthusiasm growing. I was about to stop when I realized how people could act when faced with such opportunities. “There will be no buying and selling your places in the line, and anyone that tries to force others to give up their place or anything else, I’ll deal with personally,” I warned. </p><p>Then, I pulled my sword as I jumped down, cutting the huge rock I had been standing into smooth pieces with a few Vitality attacks. </p><p>Sometimes, the best way to avoid punishing anyone was to show the power to do so. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Eleanor didn’t say anything material until we were once again riding the griffin. </p><p>“I didn’t miss the sensation of flying,” I said, grabbing the saddle tightly. </p><p>“We can walk if you want,” she offered. </p><p>“No. I like being assassinated even less,” I replied. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” she said. “It was our mistake. It won’t happen again.” </p><p>I nodded. That promise was worth nothing, but I appreciated the intent behind it. “So, how was the recruitment?” </p><p>“Good,” she said. A one-word reply was not out of the ordinary for her, but I was able to catch a chipped tone, which meant it wasn’t particularly good. </p><p>That would have put a smile on my face if we weren’t currently mid-flight. Unfortunately, it took something far more incredible than the prospect of great riches to put a smile on my face while I was being tortured by the fact that there was no solid ground under my feet. </p><p>I kept my mouth shut as we covered the short distance between the town and the dungeon. I wanted to close my eyes as well, but the ability to catch a glimpse of the caravan that approached was too important to neglect. </p><p>It was a significant crowd, more than I had expected. Even a rough head count suggested at least ten thousand people, maybe even more. However, their subpar equipment — along with Eleanor’s dissatisfaction — suggested that there weren’t many elites among them. </p><p>Once we landed, we immediately walked toward the headquarters. Some distance away from us, I could see many blacksmiths going on a building that was no doubt the new forge, but this time, there were many more guards. </p><p>My failed assassination — the first one — had taught them the importance of security. </p><p>Maria was in her office, with a dark expression on her face. It immediately turned into a shocked expression, which was followed by a giggle. “D-Devon?” she asked, shocked by how I looked. I didn’t blame her. The thick beard and long hair looked ridiculous, but it was a good disguise. “You look … distinguished.” </p><p>“The word you’re looking for is old,” I replied as I sat across from her. Technically, my action was a little presumptuous for the medieval culture people were insistently pushing. A week ago, it would have earned a very disapproving glare from Eleanor. Two weeks ago, Maria would have punished me with second-degree burns. </p><p>Neither of them even blinked, showing how much progress I made in turning myself into a critical part of the town management. It was good, as that was the only reason I was willing to stick around a location where I was facing the risk of assassination. </p><p>“As much as I want to mock Devon for his horrible beard, we have more important things to talk about,” Eleanor said as she sat next to us. She didn’t wait for an invitation either, though it was more about the relationship between Eleanor and me. She was a stickler when it came to propriety around the other people, and the fact that she was willing to relax near me meant a lot. </p><p>Their trust might have made me feel bad for tricking them, but luckily, I was able to come up with a method that would actually help them. </p><p>“True,” Maria said, with sadness back on her face. “All but six of the guilds have pulled back from the agreement, and of that six, five of them had reduced their investment.” </p><p>“Only that annoying woman is willing to stay. She even promised to increase her investment,” Eleanor said, talking about Rosie. </p><p>“What about all those people?” I asked. </p><p>“Support staff,” Maria replied. “Almost eight thousand of them are Farmers, and most of the rest are the various classes here to build the second wall, secure the farms, and do other support work. We barely had three hundred people to join the dungeon, meaning it was only a hundred and fifty teams. Slightly more than what we had before Thomas proved what a monster he is. And, almost half of those teams work for Rosie.”</p><p>“Is it a problem?” </p><p>“Somewhat. They are low-leveled, so it’ll take a while for them to get into the rhythm.”  </p><p>“We can’t support the town with that much operation. We couldn’t before, and we certainly cannot now.”</p><p>“Really, that many Farmers?” I asked. “That’s surprising.” </p><p>“Not really,” Eleanor replied. “The current batch of food we have came from the city, and they are dense enough to make logistics not a problem. But, we can’t keep importing food. Maintaining such a long trade route through wilderness is next to impossible.” </p><p>“That, and it’s really difficult to grow food on a mana dead zone,” Maria completed. “Even in the mana-rich areas, the best farms rely on mana-gathering wards to feed the plants.” </p><p>“I didn’t know farmers could use mana,” I commented, acting unaware of the secrets, which would allow me to ask follow-up questions. </p><p>“They can’t, but the plants absorb it. The poorer the environment, the more Health they need to grow the plants. At one point, they spent more Health than they could get from the food, making it a problem.” </p><p>“I see,” I replied. “Can’t we use some of them to plant trees in the dungeon, then? I’m sure it’ll be helpful.” </p><p>“We tried, but alchemical fertilizers are required to do anything in the dungeon, and they are too expensive to be used in scale, especially in a hostile dungeon environment like a desert.” </p><p>I wondered if it was Eleanor and Maria’s inexperience that was making them miss the obvious solution of mixing them by hand and experimenting, or was it the dependence on the System that made people ignore the common sense solutions? </p><p>Admittedly, both were possible. </p><p>As much as I wanted to let them talk a bit more to despair so that they could appreciate my solution more, I decided to give them an alternative. “Actually, I might have a solution for you?” </p><p>“Really?” Maria had gasped. </p><p>Meanwhile, Eleanor smiled. “Yes, I forgot about that,” she said as she turned to Maria. “Our sword genius here can actually kill a thousand monsters in a day. While it’s not enough to keep us going, it should be enough to bridge the gap. As long as we delay the promised payment for the Farmers, and delay a few payments, we should be able to work until we hire a second batch.”</p><p>“But, what about the Blacksmiths,” Maria replied. “We need Devon to train them, so that they can learn how to repair the swords the same way.” </p><p>“We need to cancel that plan,” Eleanor said. “It’s a waste for a sword genius to waste his time in the forge. He needs to spend his time developing his Rare skill,” she said. </p><p>“Rare skill?” I interrupted. </p><p>Eleanor passed me a small box. “Surprise,” she said, her smile wide. “Finish learning it, and I’ll do my best to find you an Epic one.” </p><p>Maria seemed to be unhappy about that. But, why, I didn’t know. My best guess was that she didn’t like Eleanor changing her plan without consulting, but even that was sketchy. Maria trusted Eleanor more than that. </p><p>“Actually, I have a better plan. One that not only solves both our problems but can actually increase the dungeon production significantly. However, I need you to trust me on how to handle it,” I said. Both turned toward me. “I have discovered a way to make corrosion-resistant material.”</p><p>Their shocked gasps were a thing of wonder. “That changes everything. If we can arm everyone with swords made of them —” </p><p>“No, that doesn’t work. The material shatters quickly,” I said, quickly cutting that path. “But, it’s good enough to make arrowheads.” </p><p>“So, are you going to teach it to the other blacksmiths,” Maria asked. </p><p>“No, we can’t do that,” I said. “Whatever family dispute you have leading Thomas to sabotage you, it’s clear that he’s determined to pull something even harder. If we reveal that we can forge arrowheads that could be used in the dungeon, he might escalate.” </p><p>“What’s your plan?” Eleanor asked, but from her gaze, I could see that she was already convinced. And, I was sure that it had nothing to do with the plan, and everything to do with my melee performance. </p><p>“What would Thomas do if I occasionally received a box from the outside, filled with arrowheads,” I asked. </p><p>“He’ll do his best to find the delivery and rob them,” Eleanor said. </p><p>“That, or he’ll find which System Store you’re purchasing the arrowheads from, and bribe them to stop doing business with you,” Maria added. </p><p>“And, it means, he won’t have that much time sabotaging the camp,” I said. “However, I need both of you to swear that you’ll never reveal I’m the one forging them. Not even to the rest of your family. Let’s just maintain the fiction that I’m an old warrior friend. I don't want to die to an assassin’s blade.” </p><p>“That’s a good idea,” Eleanor accepted. Technically, I didn’t know just how sensitive that ploy was, but I wasn’t willing to take the risk. “But, how are you going to forge them?” </p><p>“Easy,” I said. “I’m going to set up a forge in the depths of the second floor, and forge them there. The boxes will only have the raw materials. As long as you order the guards not to search me, it’ll be enough.” </p><p>“That sounds good. What about the blacksmiths?” Maria said. “We still need them to repair swords.” </p><p>“Easy,” I said. “I will write them some notes, as well as forge you a set of weapons from bronze ingots without enchantment. They can use it to quickly level up their repair. Just don’t forget to have them sign better contracts this time.”  </p><p>“Sounds good —” Maria started, but Eleanor interrupted. </p><p>“We can’t afford it,” she said. “We’re already deep in red, and mana alloys are expensive.” </p><p>There, I smiled, ready to deliver the big stuff. “What if I sell the intact shells to you for two silvers each,” I said. It would have been a terrible sacrifice on my part if I hadn’t been earning far more from the dungeon itself. </p><p>“Really?” she asked. “And, will it be profitable at that level? We don’t have many sharpshooters.” </p><p>“The recipe I discovered requires some silver, so no. I still need you to purchase it for me secretly. I won’t be able to break even, but I should be able to keep going as long as I spend half a day hunting,” I said, which was another lie. Using an iron alloy would be more than enough for the arrowheads, and I certainly didn’t lack that. </p><p>But, I needed an excuse to bring piles of silver inside the dungeon, so a little lying was inevitable. Especially since, the more profitable I made it for them, the less incentive they would have to try to get the recipe and teach it to other blacksmiths. </p><p>“And, everyone will think that we’re paying you four silver, so we can earn more money than people expect. It will give us an edge during the auction.” </p><p>“You can even tell that we have a deal, and you’re purchasing the shells from me for five or six silvers,” I said. “That way, it’ll be more believable that I’m a level hundred.” </p><p>“Good idea, professor,” Maria said. “Too bad you’re still garbage at chess.” </p><p>“I’ll defeat you one day,” I responded, more than happy to play into her enthusiasm and entertain her. </p><p>“That still doesn’t solve the problem of recruitment,” Eleanor interjected. “We need to have a lot of archers.” </p><p>“No, we don’t,” I said. “I just need permission to recruit among the farmers while one of you went to the nearest town and purchased a lot of crossbows for me.” </p><p>“But, they still need the strength to pull back.” </p><p>“Not if I hire a couple workers with Strength only tasked to rearm the crossbows,” I replied. I was confident that I could figure out a small device that could figure it out, but no need to overwhelm them with too many ideas at the same time. </p><p>Maria looked at Eleanor, and they shared a pointed glance showing agreement. </p><p>Just like that, my first step to monopolize the dungeon was complete. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 41</p><p>“What are you doing?” Eleanor asked the moment she entered the forge, her gaze immediately locking on the device in my hand. </p><p>“I’m trying to find a way to get the shells off the beasts faster,” I said. </p><p>The moment I said that her interest faded. “Already trying to make your guild more profitable,” she said, but I could sense a hint of disdain in her tone. I didn’t exactly blame her. Hunters were production classes just like Blacksmiths, but, unlike us, they had a reason to actually be outside. </p><p>That meant that finding Hunters above level twenties was far easier than finding high level Blacksmiths, which meant they didn’t need to deal with the same problem. And, unlike Warriors, they would be more than happy to work in a low-risk, low-pay dungeon. In a world where skills could increase by killing monsters rather than working for years, the value of labor was not much. </p><p>And, more importantly, unlike Blacksmiths, Hunters would be arranged by the guilds, meaning it was not her problem. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I said. “It’s just a good way to test the elasticity of the metal while I work on trying to discover something that can resist the corrosion. It helps me focus,” I said even as I pointed at the various materials that were cluttered about, trying to convince her that I was focused on helping them. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she noticed the fresh sign of experimenting. I had used those to improve Nurture, but she didn’t need to know that. “How was your first proper day as a guild master? Anyone suspicious?” </p><p>“No. The story about an old friend deciding to set up a new guild works well enough. Altogether, very believable. The weapon change especially helped. No one should suspect a genius swordsman to be a blacksmith.” </p><p>“Genius? Someone’s feeling arrogant. Come, we need to solve it.” </p><p>I chuckled as I followed her. Her desire to have another spar was transparent. I wasn’t complaining. Not only did I want to impress her, but also watching her fight was interesting. I might always learn something from her. </p><p>I still couldn’t figure out how to use a mana attack with my sword. It would have been very helpful. </p><p>This time, she brought me to a sparring room, and threw me a wooden sword and shield. She just grabbed a sword. “It’s going to be painful, isn’t it?” I asked. With a real, enchanted blade, she had to hold back. With a wooden sword, she didn’t have to. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” she replied. </p><p>“Well, no pain, no gain,” I said as I positioned myself, focusing on the technique. While being beaten painfully was not my ideal midnight activity, I wasn’t exactly complaining either. Sparring with her would be a good way to figure out a few new tricks. </p><p>At least, it wasn’t as ghoulish as constantly cutting myself to bleed on metal, which had been the method I used to push Mana Forge and Repair. </p><p>“Attack first. I want to see just how much you have improved,” she said. I attacked, not bothering to hold back the slightest. After all, for that reason, I hadn’t pushed my Stalwart Guard to the sixties. Her eyes widened as she took a note of my improvement, which was the only sign of distress. Her blade still easily blocked everything without even taking a step. </p><p>It felt intentional, so I started to rely on my shield more than it would have been reasonable in another situation. “Fine,” she growled as she took a step back, then lunged forward. </p><p>Her sword lashed, but I managed to avoid it … barely, and only by somehow mixing the Fleeting Step into the mix. It allowed me to avoid her attack. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 58 -&gt; 59]</p><p>It was a fascinating feeling. It felt like something clicked for a second, before disappearing. And, it was equally clear that the System had acknowledged it. It was very difficult to improve skills through sheer practice, especially after pushing them higher. </p><p>Her eyes widened once more. “That’s not a part of the Stalwart Guard,” she said. </p><p>“I guess not. It was just a stroke of inspiration,” I replied. “I tried to copy the way you moved, and it … worked. </p><p>“You truly have talent. Too bad you’re not a warrior,” she said. “Still, once you reach level fifty, I’ll gift you a Rare skill.” </p><p>“Is this what’s needed to use Rare skills?” I asked. </p><p>“Indirectly,” she said, and I looked at her. “Unlike uncommon ones, where you just need to have the Stat in question, rare skills have higher Stat requirements. Not all of them are the same, but the ones that are worth using usually require a hundred at their Primary stat. There are very few strength-based styles that would fit your style well.” </p><p>“That would be excellent,” I said as I nodded, more than happy with the prospect of a hard-to-get Rare skill that would fit well with my style. Especially since it would just replace the Stalwart Guard rather than occupying a new slot. </p><p>“One condition. I want you to bring the proficiency to at least eighty before you reach level fifty.” </p><p>“I think I can bring it to a hundred,” I replied, deliberately acting proud. After all, since the aim was to impress. </p><p>She just snorted, clearly not believing it. I didn’t blame her. If I hadn’t been abusing the way skills overlap, there was no chance that I could even get close to it. What followed was an hour of non-stop sparring that had been as intense as I had feared. I tried to mix Fleeting Step in as many times as I could manage. </p><p>It didn’t work as much as I wanted, but considering the impressed expression on her face, even that was exceptional. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 59 -&gt; 66]</p><p>“Actually, you might be right. You are learning even faster than I expected. You might reach a hundred, easily. Maybe I shouldn’t wait until you reach fifty.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“When you push a skill at Common or above to its limit, it gives you a perk,” she said. “Usually, it’s not worth going through all that effort for an external skill, but there’s a benefit. When you have a Perk, it brings the requirements down for the next tier skill. That way, either you can get a Strength focused one early, or go with a different Rare skill.” </p><p>I made a show of looking surprised. “Then, wouldn’t it be better to learn the Common skill before upgrading it step by step?” </p><p>She chuckled. ‘Unfortunately, no. Upgrading a skill through a skill stone resets it,” she said. “The perk goes away.” </p><p>“Even for class skills?” I asked as it was not my experience. “Not that it’s really relevant for us poor Blacksmiths.” </p><p>“Yes, even for them,” she replied. Interesting, as in my experience, the Perks stayed. However, maybe there was a difference between making the skill evolve directly and using a skill stone. </p><p>Of course, even if that Perk disappeared, I wasn’t exactly willing to write it off as a loss. It still taught me a lot. </p><p>I decided to change the topic. “I’ll still try to bring it to a hundred. It teaches a lot,” I said. “Do you mind if I use the other floors to practice?” </p><p>“Go ahead, if you think you can handle it,” she said. </p><p>“Of course, I can,” I replied. “Actually, why don’t I clean the gates for you. I can easily deal with the giant ones. After all, I have a hammer to slowly break their legs.” </p><p>She frowned. “Are you sure? Ranged attacks can be troubling to deal with, especially with the corrosion effect.” </p><p>I smiled. “That’s easy. I just need to make a shield out of stone to defend myself against the ranged attacks. Then, I can just discard it and make a new one.” </p><p>“Still, it can be dangerous,” she muttered. “Try to defend against this,” she said as she took several steps back. I waited, expecting her to pick some stones or other ranged items. Instead, she had raised her sword. When she brought it down, some kind of energy cut through the air, targeting me. It was a thin, weak blade. </p><p>I raised my shield to block it. Before it even landed on my shield, she attacked again, this time moving slower. I defended myself to the best of my effort, doing my best to rely on dodging rather than blocking, which got even harder as she started moving around. </p><p>“Alright, you can defend yourself,” she cleared. “You just need to be careful if there are multiple giant insects on the third floor. It’s not likely, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.” </p><p>“Good point,” I replied. “Still, having stronger enemies should help me to raise my skill faster. And, once I do it, I can take over keeping the gates secure. I owe you one, and you’re too busy to waste a full day there.” </p><p>“You would do that?” she asked. </p><p>“Of course. As I said, I owe you,” I replied, acting like having access to lower floors wasn’t a treasure for me. “However, I’ll need the maps for the second and the third floor. I shouldn’t get lost.” </p><p>She nodded. “Easy. Now, let’s spar some more.”</p><p>“Before we start, may I ask what that attack was? Some kind of mana attack?” I asked, despite knowing it was not the case. I wasn’t able to feel any mana in her attack. Yet, it was somewhat familiar. </p><p>“No, it’s a special attack from a class skill,” she said. She didn’t mention the perk name of the skill name, clearly intending to keep it a secret. </p><p>“How does it maintain its shape without mana?” I asked. </p><p>“By using Vitality, of course,” she replied, which surprised me. I didn’t even think that such a thing was possible. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “Do you mind if I examine how it works from a close range?” </p><p>“How?” she asked. </p><p>“I think I can use my Analyze skill to properly examine it,” I replied. I wasn’t faking my enthusiasm. While it was a big request since it potentially touched the secrets of her skills, the possibility of learning from it was more important. </p><p>“Alright, but never reveal anything about it to anyone else.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I stood next to her, and grabbed the hilt together with her, my fingers over hers to catch the movement of Vitality. She froze, and I noticed that her face was red. For someone of her level to be exhausted, she must have had a tiring day. “Go ahead,” I said. </p><p>“A-alright,” she stammered as she swung the sword. Meanwhile, I kept my eyes closed, using my best to stretch my Advanced Inspect to the limit to carefully examine the way the sword shifted. The way Vitality had been shaped inside the sword had been fascinating. </p><p>The best part, unlike the complicated patterns of mana, it was easy to understand … well, relatively. At least, I had a rough idea after she had repeated it a dozen times. </p><p>“I think that’s enough,” she pulled. “I … I have a long day tomorrow.” </p><p>“How about the spar?” I asked, but she was already walking away. </p><p>“I’ll just take a rain check,” she replied and walked away. </p><p>“Whenever you want,” I called, which was a completely genuine reaction. </p><p>Why shouldn’t I be, when that meeting had solved three serious problems at the same time. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 42</p><p>As I walked through the third floor of the dungeon, I felt even more enthusiastic. I wasn’t able to see Eleanor in the morning, but thankfully, she hadn’t forgotten to drop the maps of the first three floors. </p><p>She even marked the doors to the fourth floor — with a note warning me to stay away for my safety — which meant I didn’t need to search the entirety of the huge area. And, that area was truly huge. Almost thirty miles in radius. Combined with the limited visibility, it would have been torture to search through it. </p><p>I truly needed it. After realizing that my plans of setting a forge on the fourth floor were more infeasible than I had realized, I decided to move my small forge to a new spot. And what better location than the gate that was farthest from any entrance. </p><p>Having a real map made moving easy, and I was strong enough to pull everything — including the large crucible — with me easily. This time, knowing I had to move, I brought it with me. </p><p>I didn’t need to leave the cart on the first floor after taking over the gate protection and maintenance. And, having the cart with me, I didn’t need to waste the material from the beasts I killed, piling the broken shells into it. </p><p>When I arrived at my destination, I picked a hilltop a mile away from the gate leading to the fourth floor. After some effort to set everything at the forge, I started digging a small pool not too far away from the gate, and covered its bottom with anti-corrosive metal. It was a thin layer, but it should be enough to maintain it. </p><p>Then, I forged two large buckets, but I didn’t bring them with me. </p><p>Instead, I changed into my combat set, took the spear and hammer with me, and jumped through the gate. After experiencing the sudden onslaught at the other gate, I was prepared for the challenge. However, being prepared didn’t make the challenge easier, particularly since I had been doing my best to rip the broken shells. </p><p>I needed a lot of material for my setup to improve Nurture. </p><p>Since I wasn’t trying to push through the monsters, I filled my oversized buckets before going back, carrying some of the stuff. Several trips later, I had enough water to swim in if I wished, which meant I could experiment as I wished. </p><p>I filled one of the buckets with the best fertilizer with the least poison I was able to come up with, and brought it near the forge. Behind the hill where I set up my forge, there was a small deep valley. One that was perfect for growing an experimental orchard. </p><p>“Let’s try it,” I said as I set twenty cuttings from half-dead shrubberies, and fed the first one with a drop before flooding them with enough Health to satisfy the requirement of the skill. </p><p>[-22 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 34 -&gt; 35] </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, happy to see a response from the System. I was even happier to see that the sapling had grown considerably, sprouting almost two inches. Not exactly a great amount, but considering it only took a smidgen of health and a drop of poison-fertilizer, the growth was incredible nevertheless. </p><p>While using dungeon water allowed the dungeon plants to grow outside, the actual growth was next to negligible compared to what I had achieved inside the dungeon.</p><p>I repeated the process even as I grabbed one of the vitality-dense bars I had brought along — this time with enough presence of mind to leave them on the third floor — to replenish my Health slowly, once again amused that a Blacksmith could increase the skill level faster. </p><p>[-410 Health] </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 34 -&gt; 49] </p><p>Still, whenever I repeated it, I focused on the sensation of Health leaving my body, doing my best to get familiar with it. I had already been planning to learn how to use Health directly, to see if I could push Repair and Forge higher by using just silver — as finding a sufficient amount of gold to forge weapons seemed to be a challenge — and Eleanor’s attack had only intensified that desire. </p><p>It was a dangerous world, and having an extra weapon was always welcome.</p><p>After several rounds, my Nurture had stabilized in the mid-fifties. Which would have been an easy pattern. </p><p>Instead, I returned and mixed another fertilizer, this time both the poison and fertilized effect stronger. However, for this batch, I also mixed the purest fertilizer I could manage. After playing around, I realized the best way was to use a stronger poison effect. </p><p>While, at the same time, giving the plant enough material to trigger its growth. </p><p>“It can’t be that easy,” I muttered as I replicated the same process with a sapling I had brought from outside for this exact purpose. It … died. </p><p>Terribly. </p><p>“Not a surprise. It doesn’t have any inherent resistance,” I muttered. “Maybe if it’s stronger,” I said. I used some water from outside I had brought for this exact purpose and carefully enhanced its growth. Soon, I was looking at a sapling that was two feet tall and looked far healthier than the others. </p><p>It cost me almost ten minutes, and three hundred Health. And, it didn’t even increase my skill. </p><p>Then, I used the cleanest dungeon fertilizer I had discovered. One drop had been enough to make it wilt helplessly. I tried to reverse it, which cost me even more. </p><p>[-219 Health]</p><p>To make it even more annoying, there was no skill improvement. </p><p>“Alright, it’s clear that the dungeon plant has some kind of resistance to the poison aspect,” I determined. The mechanics were no doubt interesting, but I didn’t have the equivalent of Repair to properly analyze it.</p><p>“It looks like the theme of the day is pointless repetition,” I said even as I increased the number of saplings. Soon, I was feeding them with stronger and stronger fertilizer first, pushing them to a certain size before I poisoned them. </p><p>My Nurture skills climbed higher and higher. Then, noon arrived. I had depleted the small pool I had created, but it was not for nothing. I had reached my glorious point of success. </p><p>“Beautiful, “ I said even as I looked at my small, unambitious tree plantation. None of the trees were taller than my height, and they were the ugliest little things I had ever seen with crooked branches and thin, listless leaves. </p><p>But, it represented two things. One, unlimited fuel for my forge. </p><p>Two, another beautiful experiment. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) - 72] </p><p>“Let’s see if you’ll be able to survive the poison,” I said even as I used the shovel to carefully uproot it from its place while I stuffed my mouth with some extra food. Then, I brought the tree next to the gate. </p><p>I left the tree behind as I went down, killing the monsters around the gate — their presence wasn’t as intense, but I still had to kill several giant monsters. Then, I broke their shells into a mixture of small and big pieces and picked a small spot near the gate that wasn’t submerged in water. </p><p>The wet mulch wasn’t too difficult to dig.</p><p>Then, I returned to the third floor and brought the small, ugly tree I had brought with me. The moment it arrived, it started to wilt. </p><p>I immediately put my hand on its surface, pushing as much as Health as I could manage in short bursts. </p><p>[-42 Health] </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 72 -&gt; 74]</p><p>Unfortunately, despite that, the tree started to wilt rather than grow. I repeated the attempt multiple times, each attempt slowing down its demise to some extent. But, ultimately, it ended up as a dead, dried tree, and my current health was insufficient to resolve the issue.</p><p>However, while it was a sad loss, there was a great benefit to it as well. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 99 -&gt; 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Growth / Harvest] </p><p>“Excellent,” I muttered even as I went back to the third floor, once again going back and forth until I had refilled the pool. Not only that, but I had also added a hundred more saplings to my little tree plantation. </p><p>With the skill already at its peak, I was able to grow those saplings far more efficiently, both in terms of Health required and time. Raising a small orchard didn’t even take enough time to reach midday. </p><p>Now, it’s time for another forging experiment,” I said. I cut ten of the trees and used them to create a nice cozy fire, capable of easily melting and cleansing the limited silver I had. </p><p>This time, I tried to engage Nurture to push Health directly to the molten metal, followed by slowly feeding mana. It worked enough to hold the material. Unfortunately, suddenly, it was my speed of releasing mana that was a problem.</p><p>“Luckily, it’s not a big problem,” I said as I looked at the large pile of broken shells, each representing an incredible amount of mana I could directly use in the form of a mana blow. Especially since the new trees had been able to burn brightly enough to release the mana from the shells completely. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I said as I rapidly started to forge the smallest silver daggers I could manage, using the poisonous dungeon water to quench them, and then destroying them just as quickly. </p><p>Now that I wasn’t trying to ration the mana I was able to use, the skill started to rise rapidly once again. </p><p>When it was past midday, I was looking for a beautiful new text. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 99 - 100 ]</p><p>[Perk Options — Modify / Masterwork / Rapid Forging / Mana Control (Mana Manipulation) / Durable] </p><p>If there was a further variant of Creative Forging, it would have been a tough choice. Without it, Mana Control was the clear option. Maybe, with that, I might break the limit on my sword skills. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to try that, improving Repair was more important. So, I forged the strongest, most mana-dense silver dagger I could manage before systematically destroying and repairing it until the skill reached its limit. </p><p>I didn’t even have to think before I chose to improve Advanced Inspect, as it was still my single most important Perk. </p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) - 104 [Observe] </p><p>Mana Forge (Rare) - 102 [Creative Forging, Mana Control]]</p><p>“Beautiful,” I celebrated, ignoring the temptation to tinker with them even more. With the materials in hand, I had already reached the limit. For the next stage, I needed gold, probably in bulk, and likely even more mana than I could get from the broken shells of giant monsters. </p><p>So, as much as I wanted to play with them more, I decided that it was time to fight some more. </p><p>However, not before I completely reforged everything. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 43</p><p>Forging a completely new set of gear had been an exciting prospect. Even if the skill didn’t give me a better variant of the anti-corrosive alloy with some silver mixed in, the difference between sixty points and a hundred points was incredible enough to make it worth the effort. </p><p>After all, such a radical jump didn’t just bring with it more materials, but completely new techniques to use. Some of those techniques revealed new ways to use Mana to manipulate the underlying material, while the others were purely physical methods like folding the metal more and more to manipulate its crystallization structure. </p><p>However, I didn’t choose to forge the best weapon that was offered, for one simple reason: It required a long and delicate forging process, requiring me to turn the metal into a sheet before folding it back again and again for hours for every ingot. </p><p>While it would have made the resulting weapon considerably better, I didn’t have a week to forge a weapon and a month to forge a piece of armor. </p><p>No, a set that used most of the silver I had while still being forged in under one hour was the best option. I compensated for some of the weaknesses by using an excessive amount of mana, while the others stayed in place. </p><p>Even this was only possible thanks to Creative Forging and Mana Control, a combination that allowed me to bypass a lot of restrictions inherent to these techniques, though the quality suffered significantly. </p><p>I wondered just how incredible my weapons would have been had I chosen the Masterwork path, but it was just an idle curiosity. Ultimately, my new set was more than enough to handle the challenges offered by this dungeon, and that was all that mattered. </p><p>“Still, it had been an interesting experience,” I muttered as I spent ten minutes, and used the last of the available silver to make the shell removal device I had been trying to make. It worked beautifully, but it was not commercially viable. </p><p>Simply because it was too precious. The device I had envisioned last night had many moving parts out of necessity, and they didn’t work very well. Instead, what I forged was essentially three small thin knives with an absurd elasticity and even sharper edges, perfect to scoop under the shells. </p><p>Unfortunately, its materials were too precious, which would be suspicious. </p><p>“I can always keep it with me while showing the prototype,” I decided. </p><p>I needed the money it would bring. </p><p>Technically, with my current abilities, there were far better methods of making money. I could go and start forging mana alloys in a mana-dense location. I didn’t know how much a silver mana alloy would go for, but ten gold coins for an ingot was far below the actual price. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t know a way to do so without suddenly becoming a ‘guest’ to one of the stronger families. After all, I didn’t just offer rare resources, but a chance to replicate, which was the kind of thing that needed to be monopolized to maximize its impact. </p><p>“Hunting insects is more than acceptable,” I decided. Maybe I could try something better once I believed myself to be strong enough, but I still had a lot to do before that step. Even with all the things I had solved, I was still three years behind schedule. </p><p>Even as I started walking toward the fourth floor, I started thinking about how to close that gap. The most urgent step was obvious. Before reaching level fifty, I needed to find a way to improve my class skills to the next stage. </p><p>Which, in turn, would give me a better class once I reached level fifty. Hopefully. </p><p>Of course, I couldn’t exactly experiment blindly. Even with the Mana variants of my two skills, I had a solid direction of where to go. I had worked with mana alloys, and Maria had helped me by infusing mana into the metal. Even then, only the coincidence of being in a mana dead zone allowed me to make that jump. </p><p>For the other possible improvements, I needed direction. </p><p>For direction, I needed information. </p><p>And, for information, I needed money. </p><p>“Let’s hunt,” I said, even as I delved into the fourth floor. I had achieved a lot, but I still had some time. And, I wanted to see if the improved equipment helped me against the giant insects. </p><p>The short answer, it did. Immensely. </p><p>Before, I still needed to use a combination of spear and hammer styles against giant beasts, climbing on top of them before using the hammer. It wasn’t slow by any means, taking less than ten seconds. </p><p>But, the difference between ten seconds and one blow was too much. Suddenly, I was able to push the spear art to the limit as I ran through the bog without even slowing down, each blow killing a giant insect. Most of the time, I didn’t even bother changing my path to kill one of the smaller ones. </p><p>The increased speed had paid off greatly. When I finished the time I had allocated to pure leveling, I had already improved further.  </p><p>[Level 38 -&gt; 39]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>[Level 39 -&gt; 40]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>On the way back, I shifted to the sword, trying to replicate the mana attack. </p><p>To my shock, it took only three tries for me to succeed … somewhat. It was a combination of a minute amount of silver conducting mana better than I had expected, my new Mana Control perk allowing me to control the flow better, and a greater understanding of how to shape it to get an approximation of a cutting edge. </p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>I stopped using the sword once the skill proficiency reached the low seventies, which I had accomplished easily by killing a dozen insects. I slowed it down, once again trying to stay within reasonable bounds. </p><p>With my spear and hammer skill in place, the only function of the sword skill was to impress Eleanor. </p><p>However, as I passed near the dried remains of the tree I tried to raise, I decided that I still had time for one more experiment. And, with the small plantation in place, even if Rare skills proved harder to improve than I initially assumed, I could always go the slow way. </p><p>I went back to the third floor, once again refilling the small pond. Then, I grabbed the Rare skill stone, and absorbed it. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 100 -&gt; Nurture (Rare) 1]</p><p>“That’s a big drop,” I muttered even as I started using the rare variant, trying to see how it changed, trying to compare it with the other variants. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was that it was far more effective when it came to dealing with the poison aspects, easily cleansing it from the sapling with a little bit of mana. That had been incredible enough, but also the growth effect was more pronounced. </p><p>Then, there was the final result. The saplings that had been enhanced by the Rare variant looked far more healthier. Its branches were smoother and thicker, and the leaves were brighter. It actually looked like a tree rather than a sorry excuse. </p><p>The only disadvantage was that the skill was slower to grow. The poisoned tree trick had been able to push the old skill to eighties easily, while the Rare variant slowed down at below fifty. Though, considering it was functioning better at that level, it was hardly a drawback. </p><p>“And, it’s not like I don’t have a method to handle it,” I said even as I uprooted another tree, refilled my health by eating — glad that my Vitality made that process even faster — and went back to the fourth floor. </p><p>“Let’s see how long you’ll be able to survive,” I said as I buried the tree that was as tall as me. I injected it with a burst of Health. </p><p>[-22 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Rare)  42 -&gt; 46] </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, and repeated the trick, curious just how much I would be able to push it before it died … but it didn’t take long for me to realize I had made a slight miscalculation. </p><p>The rare variant was better at dealing with the poison aspect … to a significant degree. Which meant, the tree wasn’t slowly corroding, but actually growing, a pattern that had started to get more and more obvious. </p><p>Ten minutes later, I was looking for a giant tree that hovered above me, taller than twenty yards. An important detail, because I could see its branches without being blocked by the dungeon mist. Interesting. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare) - 82]</p><p>“How curious,” I said even as I walked back, only to realize my vision range still included the tree. Only when I walked back, I realized that, effectively, there was a second bubble around the tree, which overlapped with mine. The moment I walked away sufficiently, the mist blocked the way. </p><p>Since I needed to keep things going, I moved back, wanting to add seven more trees around the dungeon gate. Having a better vision around the gate would have made my life much easier. </p><p>Raising seven more trees allowed me to raise Nurture back to nineties, which took another half an hour. A nice surprise. Another surprise followed soon after. </p><p>The insects avoided the fully-grown trees. </p><p>Another fascinating little detail. </p><p>“Incredible,” I said, but while I wanted to play around, it was also true that I needed money. A lot of money. For that reason, I went back to the third floor, and used a combination of shell extraction device and the new silver spear with great efficiency. </p><p>Thanks to the device, it took less than a second to extract the shell without damaging it, which was an incredible activity. Extracting a thousand shells took barely more than an hour, traveling took more than the task itself, and even then, it wasn’t much. </p><p>The third floor was teeming with monsters, which gave me more than enough prey. I might have even extracted more, that would have been suspicious even with the extraction device. </p><p>With that, I piled everything onto the cart, and started going up. </p><p>When I arrived, the guards looked at the cart with a shocked expression. “Wow, that’s an … incredible haul. Particularly since you’re alone.” </p><p>“Nothing too much,” I replied even as I smiled. “A good friend of mine made this for me. It’s a bit of trouble to maintain, and I paid a hundred gold for it, but it’s worth it.” It was not without reason I gave such an absurd number. It needed to look like something that was not affordable. </p><p>“Really, what does it do?” the guard asked. </p><p>“It helps extract the shells,” I said. “Also, I was lucky to find a swarm or two, and a few good Samaritans were kind enough to exchange weapons with me so I didn’t have to return every hour.” </p><p>“Wow, really,” he said.</p><p>“Of course,” I replied even as I raised my sword, and told a quick story about how I achieved it while also showing my sword skills. An explanation … and if someone was having some thoughts, a warning. </p><p>When I left the dungeon, I was thirty gold coins richer. It would have been thirty-two, with some spare silver, but the extra, I left as a tip. </p><p>Well, I let them record as such, at least. Currently, they weren’t paying with coins, but giving some kind of credit, which could be used for services. It had to be redeemed in the town, after all the expenses from repair fees to guild rent had been paid. </p><p>Still, a reputation for generosity wouldn’t harm. Especially when, tomorrow, I would probably borrow at least twenty swords to make things more believable, which was technically against the rules. Everyone could borrow three swords, and had to bring them back in an acceptable condition to get a new one.</p><p>Getting twenty swords would eat into my profits even more, but I didn’t need Eleanor to start wondering if I discovered some kind of resistant alloy this early on. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 44</p><p>When I returned to the town, enthusiastic about testing the limits of the improved core skills, Eleanor was already waiting for me. This time, she didn’t say anything even before she drew her sword and attacked. </p><p>“Good evening to you as well,” I called even as I drew mine and countered her attack, even parrying hard enough to push her back. </p><p>“I thought that it’s better to check whether you’re slacking,” she said even as she attacked again. I countered her easily. This time, it was less about her holding back, and more about where we were fighting. A tight corridor, which was far more advantageous for Stalwart Guard. </p><p>Of course, that advantage wouldn’t be enough for me to win against her if she started fighting seriously, but the fact that she had to take me seriously in the first place was enough to show how much I had grown. </p><p>We fought for two minutes before she pulled back, clearly satisfied. I barely added ten points since our spar, but considering the increasing difficulty of upgrading a skill, it was still incredible. Believably so. </p><p>“I heard that you managed to hunt a lot of insects today,” she said. </p><p>“Yes. Trying to take them in one blow is a good trick, especially with the stone shield trick,” I replied. “The second floor is not as hard as I had initially feared. Giant ones are even easier to deal with a hammer. Though, it was hell to maintain the little contraption I made. I had to repair it maybe twenty times.” </p><p>“That’s what you get for trying to rely on machines rather than proper skill,” she said. </p><p>I strongly disagreed with her absurd statement. No matter how convenient the skills were, it was not an excuse to not to attempt recreating technology in some way. However, I kept my mouth shut, not wanting to annoy my boss … or was she technically my business partner. Maybe a client? </p><p>Then, I shrugged. Regardless of her exact title, she represented my access to the dungeon. I could humor her. “Unfortunately, I need the money to recruit when the caravan arrives. So, unless you have a couple thousand gold coins you want to lend me without interest, I have to play with these devices.” </p><p>“Good point,” she said. “I would have, but I have put everything I have to bid for the dungeon along with Lady Maria. We even borrowed some from the family. Or, I would have done that easily.” </p><p>I thought about asking her just how much it cost, but I held my mouth shut. Being too nosy was not a good idea. “Any plans for the night?” I asked. </p><p>“I need to go back to the town,” she replied. “I have another meeting with that b — Rosie. Do you want to come?” she corrected, her tone signaling that they weren’t getting along. A change from the earlier attitude. My best guess, Eleanor was getting annoyed at Rosie’s business acumen. Not that I blamed her. </p><p>Rosie was a dangerous opponent across the table. </p><p>“Depends,” I said. </p><p>“On what?” </p><p>“On how much Rosie actually knows about the dungeon, and how invested she is in its success,” I said. “There’s no way a beard and a new skill would make her believe that I’m a new person.” </p><p>Eleanor nodded, clearly not having considered that. “She is the one that found us the suppliers for the skills, and she was the one that found the new blacksmiths. Also, she invested a lot in her new guild here. Don’t you trust her?” </p><p>I paused for a moment, considering. Before, I would have said that I trusted her immediately. While she had always looked out for herself, that was not a bad quality in a dangerous world. She had a reputation for sticking to the deals she made.</p><p>I knew that intimately. When I was still using her to collect data about the surrounding towns, I had carefully analyzed the data she provided to make sure it was not fake. Faking data, even with people with Intelligence, was not an easy job, especially against me. </p><p>After a decade of reviewing papers for various journals — a terrible, thankless part of academia — I was pretty familiar with how fake data looked. Just to be on the safe side, I even ran some statistical analysis to make sure everything was acceptable. </p><p>While it was not conclusive evidence, it was a strong positive mark to her case. Combined with her significant investment to the town, it was fair to assume that she could be trusted … with my identity. Not anything else. </p><p>Especially since there was a good chance that she would be moving here to operate her new guild. Revealing my identity was easier than playing hide and seek. And, with her being aware of my identity, I could start making purchases through her once again. </p><p>The best thing about it was that she was too used to my weird purchases, so a few potentially risky subjects should just go under the radar. </p><p>“Fair, let’s go,” I said, hating myself that I was actually volunteering to fly. However, I needed to do so, because I had too many things to do in the town. I wanted to buy new skills, experiment with environmental mana, and even see if I could hire some people to work for me.</p><p>Then, I froze, remembering an important fact. “Actually, do you have anything that can block Identify?” I asked. “We don’t want anyone checking my class.” </p><p>“Good point. Wait here,” she said as she brought me a bracelet. “Be careful, though. It doesn’t last long. Only activate when you’re suspicious, and turn it off once the situation passes,” she said. </p><p>“How does it work?” I asked as I looked at the ugly gold bracelet with emerald and ruby studdings. </p><p>“Just hold it in your hand and focus, it’ll trigger,” she said. “But, be careful. It’s an active enchantment, and it’s already mostly drained. It can probably last only for ten more minutes.” </p><p>“Alright,” I said, ignoring the temptation to just start examining it. I tried that on the camouflage ring, only to end up disappointed. The ring itself was a boring Mana alloy, and everything was done with Mana. </p><p>Which, it had a limited amount of, with no way to refill — at least no way I could figure. </p><p>Still, it didn’t bother me, I had a good feeling that I could actually block someone’s mana if they tried. I just needed to be careful if someone tried to touch me, and that was it. The bracelet, I just needed as an excuse. </p><p>“Let’s go,” she said. I nodded, </p><p>Merely ten minutes later, I had been cursing that decision as I grabbed the griffin, scared out of my mind.  I had been a passenger on Eleanor’s griffin twice, and both had been pleasant experiences — as far as it could be when one flew on top a giant mutated bird with a stupid lion legs that couldn’t even manage to flap its wings smoothly; an opinion I held with absolutely no bias. </p><p>Unfortunately, one of those trips had been between the town and the dungeon, which was a very small distance with constant patrols keeping the wild monsters away. During the other trip, we had Maria dealing with the monsters with her flame attacks. </p><p>Without her, Eleanor was the one to handle them. In melee range. </p><p>It wasn’t the monsters that scared me. I trusted Eleanor to handle them, and even if I didn’t, I could have used Stalwart Guard to protect myself. </p><p>No, it was the fact that our Griffin had been dealing with most of the attacks, which made it jerk and twist, worse than even the worst turbulence. Without strength, I wouldn’t have been able to hold on. </p><p>Eleanor said something, but I wasn’t able to process it as my ears rang, spots appearing in my eyes. I recognized the panic attack easily. I took deep breaths, but it didn’t work. </p><p>I closed my eyes, repeating myself that I wouldn’t actually die if I fell. With Health to recover from, a fall from terminal velocity wouldn’t be deadly unless I landed on my head. Unfortunately, that didn’t work any better than repeating the plane accident statistics in my mind had before the Calamity. </p><p>It was torture. </p><p>Not even the sudden change in environment as we entered a mana rich atmosphere had helped me. When we landed, I threw myself on the ground, my legs trembling badly. “Are you alright?” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I answered, not even in the mood for a lie. </p><p>“Come on, let’s bring you to the town,” she said even as she presented her arm. I grabbed it, and let her drag me toward the gate. However, halfway in, my shakes started to disappear. </p><p>Faster than I was used to. It was not normal.  </p><p>“What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“We have just stepped into the peace zone,” she said. </p><p>“Peace zone?” I asked. </p><p>She paused. “I sometimes forget that you don’t really know a lot about big stuff,” she said. “Is it possible that you forget that I even said that?” I didn’t even bother answering her. </p><p>“Alright, but keep your mouth shut. It’s a small addition to the formation of every town. It radiates a weak calming effect to prevent stress build up, making sure people don’t go around fighting every day. However, the effect is too weak to actually stop people if they are aware, so it’s not exactly announced. Too bad we can’t really afford it for our town yet. They are cheap, but in our case, we can’t afford to supply it with mana.” </p><p>“A reasonable precaution,” I said, glad that I had the excuse of being sick to explain the utter disgust in my tone. A permanent calming effect, affecting my mind. Constantly in the air. </p><p>I couldn’t even begin to explain why it was a bad decision to keep people under a constant mind-altering effect. Even assuming that there was no side effect — debatable — one thing had been scientifically proven. </p><p>A certain amount of stress played an important role in any kind of innovation, or drive to succeed. </p><p>Looking back, I couldn’t help but wonder if it explained why I had lost three years of my life, limiting myself to sending applications while trying to collect some meager data rather than doing … anything else. I had always assumed that it was just my old world habits. </p><p>But, was it? </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 45</p><p>As I followed Eleanor, I did my best to ignore the giant question about having something called calming field over every single town. I failed. Somehow, it nauseated me worse than that horrible flight experience. </p><p>I tried to ignore it, but failed. Something was bubbling inside me. For the first time, I wanted to feel like raging. Worse, now that I knew that there was something to look for, I could feel that anger draining out of me slowly. The weaker my anger got, the smoother the draining had become. Soon, even though I knew what to look for, I couldn’t identify the effect. </p><p>I couldn’t handle the idea. </p><p>“Actually, do you mind if I go kill a few monsters? It’ll calm me better,” I managed to squeeze between my clenched teeth. </p><p>“I understand the feeling. Go ahead. I’ll be at the Broken Tankard,” Eleanor said. </p><p>I nodded thankfully before I turned and started walking away. The darkness, I welcomed as I moved away from the town, ignoring the road, which was safer — but not safe — as I cut directly toward the nearest woodland. </p><p>It was one of the hunting areas maintained for the low-leveled people, with an hourly access fee. At least, during the day. </p><p>It was too unpredictable during the night. Exactly what I needed. I wanted to destroy things without being observed by anyone. For the first time in my life, I wanted to lash out and destroy. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was the reason for my state, obediently sending applications to the new research groups without taking initiative. </p><p>One of the guards shook his hand. “Hey, buddy. You can’t come here during the night —” he started. </p><p>I just threw him a gold coin. An abject waste of money, but I didn’t want to talk with him. With my hands shaking with anger, I didn’t know how he would react. </p><p>“Alright, but if you have any problem, I didn’t see you,” the guard said as he put the coin into his bag before walking away. </p><p>I ignored that as I delved into the forest, my blade dancing to cut and skewer any monster that was stupid enough to come close. I moved deeper and deeper, killing more and more. It didn’t make me any less angry, but gave me a sense of control, enough that I could start processing my anger.  </p><p>While the idea that I might have wasted three years of my life was a horrible realization, it wasn’t the reason for my rage. </p><p>Not even close.  </p><p>I was furious, because having a calming field effect going on constantly was nothing less than a true disaster. Of course, there were many reasons it was a horrible disaster, like potential impact on brain chemistry, but on those, I didn’t know enough to make a judgment call. </p><p>I could only make a certain judgment from the perspective of a sociologist. And, that judgment was clear. </p><p>It was a disaster, which had the potential to be worse than the Calamity itself.  </p><p>Though, I was glad that I didn’t have to tell someone else about that. I doubted that I could realistically convey the significance of it to someone that was not an expert. And even then, it wouldn’t be a simple conversation.  </p><p>In a way, stress was like gravity. Without it, thinking that we would be jumping happily was a good dream. In reality, our bodies would turn into malformed abominations with countless defects, because every little biological function we had depended on gravity to shape it. </p><p>Stress had some function for our minds and the society. </p><p>Just like gravity, there were many harmful effects caused by stress. Chronic health problems, impact on productivity, leading social conflicts, aggressions, damaging relationships, burnouts, and many other effects that would take too long to list… </p><p>Yet, it was a proven fact that stress, in moderate doses, was a critical aspect of motivation. It sharpened focus and drove the individuals to become better. From a certain point of view, it was also the reason most successful people had been maladjusted — a list that included me, if I were to be honest. </p><p>It drove people to adapt, grow, and innovate in unpredictable ways. Without that drive, people could still push themselves and excel, but they rarely became exceptional. In a way, it generated excellent accountants and gym teachers, but not many true scientists or record breaking athletes.  </p><p>That alone explained why most people didn’t even think of pushing the limits of the System but obediently followed the easiest path to improvement. </p><p>Of course, fighting constantly against monsters was a stressful activity, but it didn’t make people innovate. Too much stress impacts creativity in a completely opposite manner, stifling it and forcing people to stick to their traditions and habits even more. Especially habits like killing more monsters to get stronger, which was an obvious choice. </p><p>It didn’t exactly happen like that for me … but then, I could hardly call myself a normal, well-adjusted human being. I was the reason my psychologist had been able to send her child through college without student loans.  </p><p>“I hate it,” I growled as I destroyed another monster. “We are dealing with a magical disaster and literal monsters, yet we’re still our worst enemy.” </p><p>I wasn’t exaggerating. Just by stopping people from experimenting, those calming fields might have killed more people than the first wave of Calamity. A massacre of grand scale.  </p><p>That alone would have been horrible enough. But, there were many other critical functions of stress in society. For example, it played an incredible role in social bonding. Stress drew people together, both seeking comfort of the group, and trying to overcome the challenges together. </p><p>Yet, people had been living in relative, forced calm, then went out to fight against monsters to get an enhanced dose of stress, not just from the fact that they were fighting for their lives, but it was likely that they also suffered withdrawal effects from leaving the calming field, at least to a level similar to trying to quit smoking. </p><p>Which meant, any group that worked together had turned even more close knit and loyal. A good thing during a fight, as people weren’t afraid of being abandoned by their fellow fighters. But a horrible thing from a societal perspective. </p><p>“Codependent” was a word that people loved to throw around, but it was a dangerous thing. It made people stay in cults that drained their money and linger in abusive relationships until it killed them. </p><p>In our current situation, codependent was an understatement —  </p><p>“Fuck, that explains why everyone follows people with Charisma like lost puppies,” I growled even as I punched the nearest tree, leaving a deep indent. It didn’t break my gauntleted hand. I wish it did. Not only had people turned more loyal, but Charisma was probably able to replicate that effect, at least partially. </p><p>Which meant that anyone with Charisma was essentially microdosing people constantly when they had been struggling with addiction symptoms. </p><p>Combined, it was even more devastating than ordinary. It meant, every guild was some kind of a frat house on steroids, led by what was essentially a cult leader. </p><p>It also explained one of the biggest questions I had, the strong drift on social values and ethics. While I had some theories, I had always been weirded out by how quickly a world built on the idea of freedom and individuality — at least, to some degree — had been able to regress back to medieval principles in less than three years. </p><p>The peace fields presented a much better explanation.</p><p>I reacted that badly, because I had already studied the concept before Cataclysm. </p><p>The idea of artificially adjusting people’s emotions and drives to create a ‘better’ society wasn’t exactly a new idea. The CIA had famously experimented on the impact of the drugs, not to mention many famous science fiction books examined the concept as a thought experiment. </p><p>Of course, as a famous sociologist that could actually model impacts of such concepts, I had sufficient access to some of the studies that hadn’t been revealed to the public yet. People often underestimated the number of contingencies that the government had for any kind of an emergency, from disease outbreaks to a sudden nuclear attack. </p><p>Ironically, even the Cataclysm was prepared for … technically. A total collapse of electrical infrastructure along with a hostile invasion sufficiently fit the theme. Of course, it didn’t help even a bit when the Cataclysm hit, because, ultimately, those plans needed to be implemented on time. </p><p>However, they weren’t the only ones that commissioned such studies. There were many eccentric rich people that tried to solve every problem the world had through their sheer genius. Of course, those genius ideas were often one-liners like building a huge underwater city before leaving the ‘easy’ part to the experts. </p><p>I remembered it, because I had been harassed by a particularly annoying one years ago. It was called Horizon Institute, and they had been obsessive enough to harass me for a month, offering me a frankly ludicrous amount of money to work for their genius founder. </p><p>But, no money was worth working for a bunch of crazy people, especially since I had been more than comfortable with my finances thanks to a few peripheral projects I had done for tech companies. A few startups had paid in shares, which then appreciated more than I expected, freeing me from the necessity to indulge them. </p><p>It was particularly satisfying to throw the gold watch they had given me as an apology to the garbage. It had been less satisfying when I actually went and paid for a replica to be made when the dean started to nag me about upsetting important donors. </p><p>“Those were the days,” I muttered even as I continued to kill, going deeper and deeper into the forest, letting my anger drain out of me while I let my skill lead me. In a way, it was like Meditation. </p><p>A very violent variant. </p><p>I continued, spending some more time before I started to walk back. ”It is ironic that the conspiracies about chem-trails had suddenly turned real,” I said, but my chuckle sounded dark even to my ears.   </p><p>Not a surprise, considering what would happen if I tried to convince people about my conclusions. I didn’t know if the peace fields were some kind of intentional conspiracy to somehow manipulate humanity, or if it was something they used simply because it helped people in power. Ultimately, it didn’t matter. </p><p>It took decades of fighting to limit tobacco usage, where the industry lied, cheated, bribed, used legal troubles, and that had been only one recreational industry. Trying to convince the people that were actually fashioning themselves as feudal city lords and medieval nobles that one of the fundamental aspects of their power was harmful…  </p><p>There was only one question about what would happen if I tried. Would I be treated as a madman and dismissed, or quietly assassinated?</p>",

    "content": "<p>What I was doing was certainly heavy-handed, as evidenced by the presence of all six Foundation Establishment cultivators at the entrance, their approach banned by the formation itself. However, I ignored their intimidating presence as I stood against them, giving them a mocking smirk. </p><p>However, even as the time ticked, they failed to react, still discussing what to do, so five minutes later, I had let the arena disappear. </p><p>The moment the arena disappeared, several disciples attacked me at the same time. Fire meshed with water, turning into a threatening wave that would have destroyed a small town if it wasn’t for the formation around me, neutralizing it completely. </p><p>Lightning flashed from the formation, hitting every single one of them, forcing them to faint. However, that was not the full extent of my trick. An illusion appeared over them, showing them disintegrate, while several places opened on the ground, pulling them underground to a new room. </p><p>Having a few sect prisoners in my growing prison wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators immediately triggered several alarms. I tried to block them, but from their reaction, I failed to do so. The talismans were easy to block, but two of them used artifacts designed for that purpose, and blocking them without knowing their working principles was harder. </p><p>Still, I didn’t let it bother me. It would still take some time for the Golden Core cultivators to arrive, and even then, I was prepared for their presence. </p><p>Ignoring everything, I moved to the second checkpoint group. This time, I learned the technique even faster. One minute to reach Perfection, making them envy me even more as I returned to the arena. “Come on. Is this all your precious sects can do, watch a poor rogue cultivator show off. </p><p>\"Impossible,\" one of them muttered, his voice barely a whisper. \"No one can learn this technique so quickly.\"</p><p>“Not an itinerant cultivator. He must be a spy.” </p><p>“Maybe a demonic cultivator,” another responded. “It must be how he had achieved it.” </p><p>However, while they were discussing, several cultivators pulled various techniques — both written, and locked in jades — and put them on the measure. A pale light appeared, weighing their sacrifice … and finding it wanting. </p><p>Since I had risked things, I wanted more than a bunch of Qi Gathering techniques. </p><p>Was it greedy? Certainly. But, I had a feeling that today would be the final day of the mystic land, and I wanted a proper haul for it. Soon, one of the Foundation Establishment cultivators passed a jade to a Qi Gathering cultivator, who placed it there. </p><p>They were not gifting them to me, so it wasn’t surprising to see the system not reacting, but I didn’t care about that. I was more interested in getting the seeds which then I could recycle through Janassa. All I needed was a few decent techniques that at least reached Golden Core. </p><p>As for valuing the techniques they sacrificed, I cheated in a more ordinary manner. Whenever they put a technique, I checked the contents of it roughly through the formation and assigned a value. </p><p>With the intervention of the Foundation Establishment cultivators, the first challenger soon appeared. A Peak Qi Cultivator of Kartpa Valley. “Finally, someone not poor or coward,” I shouted loudly, as angering them was to my benefit. </p><p>The more they attacked me, the more I could imprison them, which was critical to ultimately trigger the System. </p><p>“You have pushed your luck too much,” he declared. </p><p>“And you talk too much,” I said as I rushed forward. He tried to attack me, only to realize his fist attacks not working due to the gloves he was wearing. I sent him away with a palm strike. “Idiot. Of course, you can’t use any artifact here” I declared. </p><p>And, sent him out of the arena with a palm technique. </p><p>Meanwhile, I just wanted to be prepared against any potentially dangerous technique. </p><p>Before they could gather another set of techniques to gain the right, the arena disappeared. I walked to the third one and started practicing the techniques. </p><p>I decided to add another bait. </p><p>“Let’s disrupt his concentration. Someone, preach him some techniques,” a voice reached from a corner. </p><p>One of the Qi Gathering Cultivators did that and started preaching to me a sword technique. I made a show of stumbling, but that was the extent of my distraction. He stopped. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Insult Bonus - 160 (Capped)]</p><p>[220x Return - Heartless Blade - Beginner, Perfection]</p><p>“It worked, but we need a stronger technique and more insights,” I once again used the formation to mix with the general murmur, glad that the System didn’t consider that as an attack. It should have, but it wasn’t the first time the System’s categorization didn’t make any sense. </p><p>Not to mention, I had noted that Insult had a looser definition, as my attempts with my prisoners had shown. </p><p>Soon, my surroundings had been filled with a cacophony of noise, as they started granting me even more. The corner of my vision was filled with notifications, which was a nice confirmation of the viability of my plan. </p><p>I pushed my acting skills to the limit as I focused on the swirling energies on my palm, beginning to build within my palms. Twice, I let it explode, letting my hand bleed. That part was believable, because learning cultivation techniques was not an easy process. A single misstep could result in catastrophic injury.</p><p>There was a reason cultivators treated disturbing someone’s solitary practice session as a reason for a blood feud, the same level as killing one’s brother. </p><p>“I won’t surrender, you useless lot,” I said even as I nodded in determination, as if I was determined to prove them wrong. I closed my eyes began to channel my Qi even more intensely, and started to rapidly climb the stairs of skill proficiency. </p><p>Meanwhile, I used the formation to shout once more. “Everyone. Use different styles. Art, music, formations … whatever you can use. It’ll be more confusing that way.” </p><p>That made people start switching their lessons. It was intentional, as the more varied their lessons were, the more I would learn. My mood got even better when, after a quick chat, Foundation Establishment cultivators joined the mix as well. </p><p>I made a show of vomiting blood when they joined in and even crouched down. Instead, I was busy activating the rewards I received one by one, which rapidly covered the information I lacked in basics. With hundreds of Qi Gathering cultivators speaking at once, each with their own hobbies, cultivation arts, and techniques, my information basics jumped further and further. </p><p>Cheating was certainly fun. </p><p>This time, it took about three hours for me to ‘learn’ the technique to perfection. I had thought about delaying it a bit more, but I was afraid of the arrival of the Golden Core cultivators interrupting my fun. </p><p>Before that, I want the cultivators to act even more desperate. </p><p>It proved useful, as soon, as more Foundation Establishment cultivators arrived, giving me more and more cultivation. </p><p>The only problem, every single technique they had taught, whether that came from the Qi Cultivators of Foundation Establishment, they didn’t even reach Golden Core, let alone Nascent Soul level like the Kartpa Alchemy technique did. </p><p>Admittedly, none of those techniques actually carried the name of Entsa or Kartpa. Considering the temporary nature of the outer disciples, maybe they were not allowed to learn such techniques in the first place. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly a problem, as my growing expertise in techniques that covered every single topic from music to assassination went a long way to compensate for it. </p><p>Even if I had been interrupted immediately, I was still happy with my growing list of competencies. I had attempted that twice more, but before I could complete it properly, half a day later, a suffocating presence I recognized as a Golden Core Cultivator appeared. </p><p>As much as I wanted to taunt him, the moment he appeared,  the formation flared. “How dare you interrupt my legacy test,” the fake voice boomed even as the formation closed around him, and filled with poison. </p><p>“Impossible,” he gasped even as he smashed against the formation several times, the outer side weak enough to allow him to escape. </p><p>Even as he retreated, I used the formation to spit out everyone in the formation, and the fake mystic land pulled underground… and immediately dissolved there. In its place, I filled it with layers and layers of traps, each linked with a dose of poison I created with my alchemy. </p><p>And, those formations went the opposite way of Markas, just in case. </p><p>It was both an excuse for it to disappear … and a bait for experts to visit. </p><p>I wanted to see if I could get a lesson on formations from a Golden Core, which was my biggest lack. </p><p>Then, I retreated, my breathing rapid. I had just committed the riskiest act of my life. </p><p>I just hoped that it didn’t blow on my face. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The structure of the mystic land was simple. I had created fifty checkpoints, and ten groups, each group progressively difficult. Each checkpoint could be cleared after practicing one obscure technique. And, one either had to reach Minor Familiarity in all five techniques, or Minor Accomplishment in one to clear a checkpoint. </p><p>And, with each checkpoint cleared, there were certain rewards. Mostly talismans I had drawn, occasionally techniques I had written in a hurry. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly an amazing, intricate design, but considering the hurry I had displayed while designing it, it was appropriate. After all, the whole point was to conceal Pearyin’s situation, the learning aura slipping from a multitude of formations I had in place.</p><p> A trick that had succeeded considering the lack of Golden Core cultivators, or even Inner Disciples around. However, it also meant that the aura of learning, at least in its diminished form, wasn’t as valuable as I had expected. </p><p>Or, it would have been abandoned to the management of six Foundation Establishment cultivators, none looking particularly capable — at least, in terms of sect cultivators. </p><p>Maybe it wasn’t too surprising. The System might have helped me to cheat initially, but even without it, I had discovered many methods to cheat, from using calligraphy to pills. Not expecting the sects to have similar tricks despite their long existence, ruled by cultivators of the Nascent Soul stage or even higher was the height of folly. </p><p>At least they let the outer disciples in. Hopefully, they would still know enough to make my detour useful. </p><p>The progress the outer disciples made reinforced that point. When I was creating the checkpoints, I was under the impression that they would require somewhere between years and decades to clear it. Aisnam was talented when it came to palm techniques, but without my initial assistance, she could have never cleared all the checkpoints in a lifetime. </p><p>I had designed the challenges on that benchmark, assuming that sect disciples would be ten times more skilled than Aisnam, meaning one could expect them to clear the whole path somewhere along a decade, split between practicing the techniques and their cultivation needs.  </p><p>That assumption seemed to be woefully inadequate, as barely months later, there were teams that cleared seven out of ten checkpoints. And, their discussions and attitude made it clear that they were far from the top outer disciples. </p><p>I must have underestimated the potential of the sects significantly. No wonder they were so dismissive of the itinerant cultivators. </p><p>No one bothered to interact with me even as I stood at the entrance of the first challenge, their attitude gazes showing that they expected me to waste my limited time there before being kicked out. </p><p>Any other time, being dismissed would have been the exact outcome I had been hoping for. Right now, it was the opposite. After all, I was here to be insulted — or failing that, pitied — and both required a certain level of caring to start. </p><p>I stood in front of the first checkpoint, looking captivated by the technique, but my focus was on the talks of the cultivators. Most of them weren’t afraid of being overheard, as the section between checkpoints and zones didn’t allow the sound to pass, letting them believe that they were isolated. </p><p>It was even true … for the most part. I was the one exception as the creator of the formation, easily manipulating such details. The more paranoid ones used their Qi to block their voices, but even that was useless when they were in my domain. </p><p>Their numbers helped, as most of the discussion was idle gossip, talking about people and places I didn’t know, and discussing tasks that I had no idea about. </p><p>But, I had a general sense of their presence. Apparently, the rewards I had put weren’t as attractive as I had expected for the outer disciples here. Instead, their discussion was focused on Foundation Establishment. </p><p>That seemed weird at first, but when a few of them mentioned some kind of contribution point payout for the one that first completed all the checkpoints and revealed the ‘true reward’. But, the disciples cared less about the nature of the reward, and more about the contribution point. </p><p>Apparently, it was enough to pay one-third of the price for a Foundation Establishment pill. </p><p>That realization would have surprised me before I realized how sects were using that pill as a control mechanism more than anything else. </p><p>Yet, even with that, I was surprised by the anxiousness of the outer disciples as they all seemed young … of course, that was until one of them mentioned only having six months before some kind of time limit of being kicked out of the sect, forcing them to join a cultivation family instead. </p><p>Ironically, their anxiousness reminded me of my own before the injury, where hundreds of student-athletes competed to be the best, only for most of us to end up disappointed when we failed to clear some extremely challenging cutoff points. </p><p>I understood their anxiousness, but I didn’t feel very sympathetic. I might have if I wasn’t trying to potentially save the lives of billions of lives, but ultimately, it was an easy choice. </p><p>Instead, I decided to trigger their anxiousness in a very distinct manner. I raised my hands, and used the technique on the wall, showing a beginner competency. It went unnoticed, probably assuming that I already knew of the technique. </p><p>No one saw an itinerant cultivator that arrived late as a problem. </p><p>Three more attacks, and I reached Minor Familiarity, triggering the glow from the formation which signaled I had cleared the first checkpoint. That earned a few suspicious glances from the disciples surrounding me. </p><p>“Hey, didn’t he just arrive?” one of them asked. </p><p>“I think so. Maybe he already learned the technique before coming here. There’s a lot of cultivators scamming the gullible by selling the techniques outside,” another responded. </p><p>I ignored those as I continued to repeat the techniques. After a dozen attempts, I reached Major Familiarity. A minute later, I faked reaching Minor Accomplishment. Another, even more intense glow spread from the formation, informing everyone that I had managed to complete the first group of checkpoints. </p><p>That created a bigger commotion, but it wasn’t as big as I had expected. I was hoping to at least gather the free disciples around me. </p><p>It looked like I needed an even bigger commotion. Even as I started practicing the palm technique, I started adding several new features to the formation, including a nice arena feature,  which bypassed the current peace field enforced by the formation. </p><p>I wanted to create an excuse to interact with them. </p><p>However, that wasn’t the only thing that I did. I also added several defensive formations against a potential intervention from Golden Core cultivators. However, those formations were merely there to control the area and distract them. Regardless of my level of expertise, I couldn’t rely on my formation abilities to capture Golden Core cultivators. </p><p>The real function was different. </p><p>It was there to dispense poison, one that I had refined based on my Alchemy Technique at Perfection, which was strong enough to incapacitate Golden Core cultivators. Admittedly, for all my greed, my objective wasn’t to capture them, afraid it would bring even stronger cultivators. </p><p>No matter how tempting was the idea of learning techniques from Golden Core cultivators. </p><p>No, I just wanted to create some distraction to allow me to escape in case my next action created an even bigger commotion. </p><p>Once the preparations were complete, I enhanced my display, showing my abilities to Perfection. The formation triggered once again, centered on me. </p><p>And, at the same time, the ruins started to shuffle. The checkpoints, which were spread in a straight line, moved to create a curved structure, while an arena appeared at the center. </p><p>“The first candidate has been selected. Defend the arena while only using the technique you have learned to receive the first key!” </p><p>“Yes, immortal master!” I shouted even as I ran toward the arena. Several disciples tried to interrupt me, but the formation around me protected me from them. I stood at the center, while the sect disciples watched me, their faces contorted with envy and frustration. </p><p>Though, regret was also visible in the eyes of many. </p><p>“You better think what you’re doing,” one of the disciples from below warned me. “You don’t want to know what might happen to your family if you take this opportunity from us.” </p><p>“Too bad I’m in disguise,” I said with mocking laughter and made a show of throwing my robe and removing a mask, only to show another illusion thanks to my formation, which they stepped on willingly. “Now, if you’re so confident, why don’t you come and walk inside,” I said. </p><p>One of them tried, only for the formation around me to not allow him. </p><p>“Only the worthy challenge,” the booming voice declared. </p><p>“How do we prove we’re worthy, great immortal,” more than one asked. </p><p>“By sacrificing knowledge,” the booming voice shouted once again, and a jade platform rose. “Show your techniques to earn that right.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk at their shocked expression. “Come on, you pathetic sect cultivators. Fight me,” I called. </p>",

    "content": "<p>While I knew Maria and Eleanor were on the way, I stayed in the dungeon nevertheless, talking with the guards to learn about the various methods that they had used to explore the dungeon. It started as listening to them about the stories, but soon it turned into a Q&amp;A session as they proved very willing to answer my questions, where I started to ask very pointed questions about the tactics they had used to first explore the dungeon and determine its profitability. </p><p>At first, I was surprised by the candid way they answered the questions, even with Eleanor leaving me in charge unofficially. At first, I assumed it was my generous tipping that had earned me this privilege, but even that felt a bit excessive. </p><p>Then, it clicked. It was my power. More accurately, their perception of my power. From their perspective, I was already at least level hundred — with the gossip split equally on whether I had passed the threshold — and with that power, came respect. </p><p>It was just that I underestimated the intensity of it. </p><p>It was my mistake considering my job. While equality had always been more of an idealized concept than a true reality, it didn’t change the fact that, before the Calamity, all people had been in the same baseline. Yet, even then, people had a tendency to idolize the strong and the famous. It was inevitable. </p><p>Ultimately, humans were social beings, and the more complicated the society, the more we relied on heuristic patterns of thought. In the past, the rich, the strong, and the famous had been revered. </p><p>Here, a sufficiently high level meant all three. Levels meant power, in a direct, visceral way that was impossible to ignore. Then, with the world economy regressing to a primitive level, power also meant riches. It was a reason that there wasn’t anyone above level fifty trying to get into this dungeon. They had better dungeons to make money from. </p><p>Dungeons that didn’t require them to get away from what passed for civilization. </p><p>More importantly, the ones that didn’t put them in the middle of a political dispute. </p><p>This meant that, other than Eleanor and Maria, I was perceived to be the only high-level person here, and with that, came respect. However, it was one thing to acknowledge it in theory, another thing was to live through it. Even as a professor, I wasn’t used to it, though that was mostly due to my age making it difficult for my students to respect me. </p><p>Suddenly, I was glad that I didn’t have to deal with it for long. Arthur was a fake identity, one that I would abandon as soon as I made enough money. But, that was for the future. I still had too much to learn here. </p><p>I continued questioning them, trying to learn the tactics they had used. It seemed that they had already utilized some of the more obvious methods. Spears had worked to kill, but their wooden handles degraded even faster under the corrosive effect.  </p><p>As for bows, the cost of ammunition made it unsustainable. Special arrowheads were required to penetrate through the thick shells of the monsters, which inevitably ruined the arrow itself, making it more expensive. </p><p>I questioned whether they tried to raise some native plants. They confirmed that they tried and abandoned it quickly. Apparently, the native dungeon plants pushing back the dungeon mist was a known trick, but it wasn’t well explored, because there were better magical alternatives that could dispel that mist and reestablish better visual clarity. </p><p>Alternatives that didn’t work in a region that lacked mana — or, as my experiments showed, had a low mana density. And, according to them, the desert nature of the dungeon meant that growing any kind of plant was not worth the effort. </p><p>It meant that no one had bothered to experiment with the water from the fourth floor, at least properly. I could have revealed that, but it would have told Eleanor that monopolizing the fourth floor was possible despite the corrosive effect, which would ruin my business model. </p><p>Instead, I wanted to try something simpler. </p><p>“Lend me your bow. I want to try something,” I asked one of the guards. While they didn’t use them for hunting insects as it was expensive, some of them were still armed with bows to defend the fort. </p><p>Not many of them, which was probably why Thomas’ trick had been that devastating. </p><p>He passed the bow immediately, but I noticed the hesitance as he passed the arrows. “Just two arrows is enough,” I said. “And take ten shells from the latest order. It should be enough, right?” I said. I knew it was overpaying, but it was always better to keep people happy while asking for a favor. </p><p>I went back into the dungeon, once again relying on the mist to hide me from the view. But, instead of targeting them directly, I reached into my bag, and pulled a skill stone — one of many I carried with me — which I had been planning to consume. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Shoot (Basic)]</p><p>“Let’s add a ranged attack to the mix,” I muttered even as I consumed it. The sensation of absorbing a skill was disorienting as always, but a basic skill was easy to ignore.  </p><p>[Shoot (Basic) - 1]</p><p>The first few times, I used the bow to aim at the rocks, testing the skill. Just like the other basic combat skills, shooting only came with the most basic motion, nothing else. It gave me a general understanding of how to hold, how to pull back, aim, and shoot. </p><p>Even with the skill barely at one, I was able to hit a target accurately from ten yards away. Dexterity helped me with aiming, but the greater the distance, the more inaccurate my aim became. Compensating for that inaccuracy was possible, but it slowed the process of aiming even more. </p><p>There were several reasons that most people preferred melee over ranged. The first was the logistic challenge. While arrows could be used multiple times, they were still more fragile than weapons. They broke and got lost, and collecting them was a significant chore. Not to mention, it meant it was harder to replenish them during longer expeditions. </p><p>Especially since the best arrows came from the System Shops, like everything else. </p><p>As a result of all these factors, not only was killing monsters from the range more expensive, but it was also more challenging. Stronger monsters were either armored, which made arrows a very bad — or expensive — method of dealing with them; or they had been agile enough to avoid arrows even after they were shot, making the task of hitting them at a distance impossible. </p><p>Sometimes, they had just excess vitality, requiring an absurd amount of arrows to take down. </p><p>They were not really useful other than for support — unless someone had a special class — because magic was much more effective as a ranged weapon. Stronger, more accurate, and, most importantly, cheaper. </p><p>Well, cheaper anywhere with abundant mana. But, even in mana dead zones, it was probably a close call. Of course, the biggest reason for their relative lack of use was that they required Perception, even for their Common variant, which was not exactly a common stat. </p><p>And then, there were even fewer classes that had Perception and Strength at the same time, the second stat necessary to use bows with higher draw weight. Of course, they were still useful in many circumstances, especially near settlements, and more expensive crossbows with certain enchantments removed some of those drawbacks. </p><p>When all those facts combined, it explained why they were not as popular as melee while exploring dungeons, even in ones like ours.</p><p>“Now, let’s improve it,” I said. I could have practiced it again and again until I was confident in taking down the beast. Instead, I touched the arrow I had borrowed, and modified its surface with my mana, adding a few hexagons and arrow structure to make it better to hold mana. </p><p>Then, I pumped it with mana, treated it as a spear, and shot it to a nearby target. The rock I targeted had been demolished.</p><p>[-9 Mana] </p><p>[Shoot (Basic) 1 -&gt; 25]</p><p>One step was enough to maximize the basic skill. “Excellent,” I muttered even as I used the other arrow to practice a few more times, getting a better sense of the abilities and limitations of the skill. I quickly made a few simple bows and crossbows, all made purely of metal, reusing the bowstring from the bow I had borrowed. </p><p>Of course, those bows were useless garbage. Pure metal was not a good material for making bows. However, since my aim was to understand which weapons triggered the basic skill, it still worked. </p><p>And, a smile popped on my face when I noticed crossbows were included on that list. It gave me an idea for an interesting pitch. I broke down the weapons I forged into base metal — mana once again allowing me to bypass very cumbersome steps under automatic control of my skill — and returned to the fort. </p><p>Eleanor was waiting for me there. </p>",

    "content": "<p>For the hammer, I wasn’t exactly designing a ranged attack the same way I did with a sword. I could, but there wasn’t too much of a point. It wouldn’t give me any benefits. Instead, I picked a different direction. </p><p>Namely, the quake attack. </p><p>For that, I designed a new hammer. Its surface was covered with hexagons, gold and silver conductive patterns etched inside it like wires to not only carry the mana, but also distribute it in the same pattern as the Quake attack. </p><p>With this brand-new toy, I was able to create a weaker version of the quake effect. To test, I was once again at the mining pit, using the hammer to steadily destroy ore deposits, replenishing my reserves at the same time. </p><p>I tried to use it on the monsters. Unfortunately, the weapon proved too fragile, shattering upon impact. And, since I had a limited amount of gold, I couldn’t make a dozen hammers to bring it with me. </p><p>But, since I needed to replenish my ore reserves in the first place, I just continued crushing ore and loading it to the main feeder for the conveyor belt. Occasionally, I went back to the forge to redesign the weapon. </p><p>Of course, from a single-attack perspective, there were not many benefits to actually creating a mana attack, as the vitality attack was already superior. Yet, I focused on mana attacks first despite that. </p><p>While the vitality attacks were strong, they were also costly. </p><p>Of course, mana attacks cost even more to achieve a similar effect. Combined with the fact that my mana reserves were much smaller, its utility was supposedly limited. </p><p>If it wasn’t for one important fact: Cleansing Meditation allowed me to absorb mana far faster than I could replenish my Health. While my high Vitality allowed me to metabolize the food faster to replenish my Health, all but most concentrated extracts required several minutes to refill my reserves of Health. I just needed to stand still for five seconds to replenish my mana. </p><p>And then there was the fact that Health was a literal tool for survival… Armor could help to survive a lot of things, but it didn’t make me impervious. Blunt force trauma, in particular, still required Health to recover from. </p><p>However, the biggest part was that I didn’t have the research on vitality that I had on mana. I needed to once again experiment on many materials to understand how they worked when interacting with solid materials. </p><p>And, the recovery speed of Health meant that I couldn’t easily replicate it. </p><p>Not without a large number of assistants. </p><p>With all those factors included, trying to develop a mana attack was the better path until I had the necessary manpower. </p><p>I swung my hammer again, this time crushing a shell into pieces, and used meditation to absorb it. Five seconds of standing still, and my mana was replenished once again.  “Maybe I should try and see if I could figure a way to meditate while moving,” I muttered even as I swung my hammer again, destroying another small section of the ore mine. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 184 -&gt; 185] </p><p>So, I started trying to activate the meditation effect whenever I tried to move around, but it didn’t work as well as I had hoped. Whenever I tried to move, the mana shape destabilized or stopped rotating, which made the process of figuring out how to Meditate while moving rather annoying. </p><p>I could maintain the existence of the orb, but without the movement, it didn’t work. </p><p>However, repeated attempts failed to give a result. “Well, do I actually have to,” I suddenly realized. After all, I had already realized that mana had been reacting to the shapes. Why not transform that orb into a different shape. </p><p>But first, I decided to finish improving Quake Hammer to its limit. As much as the idea of experimenting with Meditation had been tempting, I didn’t want to do so immediately. Instead, I chose to focus on Quake Hammer. </p><p>It required two more trips to the forge to optimize the structure of the hammer based on trial and error before I could actually start delivering a decent facsimile of the first vitality attack, but it still depleted all my mana. </p><p>[-200 Mana] </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 199 -&gt; 200]</p><p>[Perk Options — Persistent Tremor / Shatter / Swift Dodge] </p><p>“What a tough choice,” I muttered. Swift Dodge was easy to ignore, as I had long adapted to using Fleeting Step without using the spear art as a crutch thanks to repeatedly using it to move around. The choice between Persistent Tremor and Shatter, on the other hand, was harder to decide on. </p><p>I had a feeling that, with my combat style, Shatter would be more useful, but I still chose Persistent Tremor. The implication was that it would create a lasting effect, and the experimental value of such a thing was too important. </p><p>“Let’s try,” I said as I used it on a thick section of ore. </p><p>[-300 Health]</p><p>“Well, that’s expensive,” I muttered even as I examined the surface. Unlike Quake Hammer, the attack didn’t disappear at once, but maintained its presence between the shattered pieces, throwing them around wildly. </p><p>It still had a mere two feet radius, but the devastation was incredible. It would work incredibly against a monster … or an armored human. </p><p>Though, I didn’t want to imagine how the remains would look. </p><p>I first moved back to the forge and activated the crusher. Then, as the mana flowed around me, I activated the meditative orb, but I didn’t rotate it, curious if it would absorb. It did, just very slowly despite the density around me. </p><p>I turned that into a hexagonal cube, and, even without moving, the effect of rejecting mana was displayed, but it was weak. It implied that, along with the shape, the movement was also important. Soon, I added a triangle to the intersection point, and it started channeling mana inside, once again with an absurd slowness, certainly not enough to make it worth it.</p><p>I added a triangle to every corner, but after a certain point, I was struggling to maintain the shape of the entity even without rotating it, as if I was trying to juggle a dozen balls in the air. Trying to maintain the shape of the orb was an interesting experience. I couldn’t just do something and start ignoring it. </p><p>Every piece of construct required me to maintain it separately while rotating seemed to be using something completely different. </p><p>I reduced the number of triangles and started rotating, but it failed. While the sphere — which I was starting to realize was not exactly a smooth structure, but the surface details were a mystery — was able to function better the faster it rotated, the triangles lost their effectiveness. </p><p>The lack of stats, I realized. No wonder Intelligence was a critical requirement for every mage. The sheer focus necessary to maintain even half a dozen shapes was incredible. </p><p>I stayed like that for hours, repeating various methods to increase mana absorption, but the best I could get was one point of mana in twenty minutes. Hardly groundbreaking. </p><p>Maybe the research institutes were right in rejecting me —</p><p>“Nonsense,” I growled even as I shook my head. It was absurd to feel depressed, especially after my string of successes. Absurd enough that I would have suspected that there was some kind of spell over me. But, an easier guess was in place. </p><p>It was the side effect of what I was doing with the meditation. </p><p>When I stood up, I felt tired and drained, like I had been lost in the deepest recesses of a dark depression, tired in a way I had never felt before. “Alright, that’s enough experimentation for today,” I muttered as I started tidying up everything. </p><p>It was the second time Meditation had caused some kind of trouble. Maybe I shouldn’t play around with it without consulting Maria first. </p><p>While I was mentally drained, I felt fine physically. So, I chose to pick the cart and went back to the third floor. However, after a few attempts of removing the shell with a mana attack, I realized that trying to use Mana turned out to be much more difficult. So, I stopped that as well and instead relied on the ordinary spear and extractor combo to collect. </p><p> I was exhausted mentally, but I didn’t feel like sleeping. Some pointless, mind-numbing physical activity might have been exactly what I needed. </p><p>And, if I could make more money in the process, even better. </p><p>Since I had been distracted by the latest set of experiments, I decided not to go up before collecting around four thousand shells, which would explain my longer-than-usual disappearance. </p><p>I could always say I took a trip to the third floor. </p><p>As I fought, I could feel that weird exhaustion disappear slowly. It wasn’t completely gone, but the sudden listlessness had disappeared. Still, I didn’t stop until I collected the target number of shells. </p><p>I went back to the fort, only to be greeted by smiling guards. “Good news, sir,” one of them declared happily. “We have just received the news. The caravan will be here in just an hour.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as the guards rushed toward the cart, enthusiastic about processing it. My habit of leaving big tips was already doing wonders. </p><p>Hopefully, it would also help when it came to recruiting. My experiments needed help. Just a few people would be enough, but finding someone trustworthy seemed like a challenge. Instead, I could just hire a bunch of people to work in the dungeon, both to help me make money, and to allow me to identify trustworthy assistants. </p><p>I wanted nothing more than to rest, but with the arrival of the caravan, things wouldn’t be as simple. </p><p>“So, does anyone have any interesting stories about the first days of this dungeon?” I asked, which was just an opportunity to question them. </p><p>Now that Eleanor and Maria had arrived, I needed to decide on a solution that was just innovative enough to help without being too suspicious. </p><p>I much preferred experimenting over killing monsters… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as I wanted to start forging the sword that could potentially allow me to use better mana attacks by leveraging the new materials and properties I had discovered, I didn’t do so immediately. </p><p>Instead, I sat on the ground and started working on a conceptual design and making some rough calculations based on my observations. It wasn’t particularly easy to figure out the necessary design. I tried to do my best to get inspired by electrical system structure. It could have even worked if I was dealing with a perfect insulator and a perfect conductor, but neither material had been perfect for their role. </p><p>And, my skills were singularly unhelpful. Every single design I could access relied on one type of material, whether it was an alloy or a pure metal. What I was trying to do with the sword was more of a composite material, with layers of different alloys and shapes. </p><p>While the rough calculations helped, there was a limit to what I could achieve without a computer to do anything computationally intense. In the end, without any supporting materials, at best I could come up with a rough design. </p><p>It was a short sword, nothing too complicated. A shorter, thicker scimitar, to be exact. The one end had been made entirely of mana-resistant hexagonal pattern, as fine as I could manage, to prevent the leakage, and the main body also had a similar outer layer. However, there was a thin layer of conductive silver-iron alloy that started from the center, and went forward to reach the center. </p><p>Forging it hadn’t been fun … because, with every move I made, I had to ignore the asinine suggestions of my skills to ‘correct’ the process, which would have ruined everything. It registered the composite approach as a mistake, and Repair was even worse. </p><p>Still, I bit my lips ignored the intense sense of wrongness, and managed to finish it. </p><p>“What a piece of junk.” I examined the sword with a big smile. Admittedly, it was not for no reason that my skill had been giving me an incredible amount of negative feedback about my invention. It was thick, poorly balanced, and unwieldy. I doubted whether it could survive even one hit, as the hexagonal gaps had destroyed its integrity. And, the conductive alloy I discovered was too soft to support the center. </p><p>Still, it didn’t matter. It was just a training wheel equivalent. </p><p>“Let’s try,” I muttered even as I focused on my mana. A mana glow immediately appeared around the blade, extending two inches without problem. More importantly, it was stable. I swung the sword a few times more, shifting between skills to get a better understanding of the flow. </p><p>It was a beautiful process. I was able to extend the mana flow almost half a foot before it destabilized. “Excellent work,” I muttered even as I tried a ranged attack. And failed. </p><p>It didn’t matter. </p><p>I went back to the drawing board, and changed the design multiple times, trying to find a way to achieve ranged attack. Unfortunately, I was soon met with an unfortunate realization. I had reached the limit. Not the material, but the technique. Just like swordsmanship gave me better control and tactical awareness, Forge gave me better control of the minute details. And, I needed to improve it to get finer control. </p><p>For that, I needed gold. </p><p>I looked at my remaining gold coins, wondering if it was worth the sacrifice to enhance the speed of improvement. Eleanor and Maria should arrive in one or two days at most, and I could probably arrange the delivery of pure gold, which must have been cheaper than system gold coins. </p><p>I just needed to wait two days, maybe one extra for material delivery. Was it worth wasting forty coins, especially since there was no guarantee that the amount would be enough to trigger the System and improve the skill further? </p><p>I was reluctant because it meant losing all my money. While I already had eight hundred coins in my account, it was just a promissory note. There was no bank to cash it, and there was no government I could sue them to get if they decided to hold it. </p><p>There was a reason most transactions were based on cash, and even that was only because of the existence of the System-backed coinage. </p><p>However, delaying three days, when I had solved every other problem standing in my way, was unbearable. “Why wait,” I concluded even as I pulled the coins and destroyed them, turning them into raw material with confidence.</p><p>Then, I went to the forge and forged a small stiletto dagger made of pure gold, the smallest weapon I could imagine. The System didn’t respond. I tried again, this time once again bleeding over it and using the Health trick, and pushed all the mana I had in my reserves. </p><p>[-200 Mana]</p><p>It didn’t trigger again. </p><p>“Let’s see if you will work,” I said even as I looked at the steam-powered crusher I had in place. </p><p>I spent easily two thousand points of mana. It failed again. “Alright, no surrender,” I said even as I repeated the experiment. This time, I made a couple modifications to the setup, expanding the crusher area to make its mana output even more intense, started it, and forged another gold dagger. </p><p>It only responded when I spent roughly twenty thousand mana points, something that would have taken a lot of time to crush by hand and interrupt my forging repeatedly. The forging alone took ten minutes. </p><p>The reward was worth it.</p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 102 -&gt; 117]</p><p>“Industrialization for the win,” I muttered even as I looked at the small, beautiful dagger in my hand. Curious, I tried to use it to create a mana edge. It conducted mana better than the alloy I discovered, but my sword maintained a better edge. </p><p>Confirming the viability of my composite design and my path to improve the class skills at the same time. </p><p>I once again started with the repetitive act of forging, damaging, repairing, and destroying. With my setup in place, I was able to extract mana easily. As an added benefit, the tainted energy was collected in a container, so whenever I ran out of material, I just needed to go to the edge of the base, open the container, and fight against the resulting swarm. </p><p>I was glad that I came up with a way to cut the shell with a mana blade, as it made the process far faster. And, I didn’t even need to carry them back. I just needed to put them in the conveyor belt, and they would go back on their own. </p><p>Excellent work. </p><p>Too bad the conveyor belt was too much work to expand even at moderate distances. Conveying power mechanically had its limits, not to mention every yard of metal belt took some time for me to forge and assemble. </p><p>Not the best use of my time, especially when the monsters were kind enough to visit my base in the first place. </p><p>As usual, improving the skill got harder the more it improved, and the incredible amount of mana it required to trigger made it even more difficult. However, in the end, I received my reward. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 202]</p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) - 201]</p><p>The perk selection had been almost trivial. Advanced Observe was a no-brainer. And, while I might have been split between Advanced Mana Control and Advanced Creative Forging, I only received Advanced Creative Forging as an option, which I accepted. </p><p>Advanced Creative Forging didn’t allow me to forge the composite weapons, but every little bit still helped. </p><p>“I wonder when I will be able to push it to the next stage,” I muttered, feeling impatient. It was greedy, I knew, but I didn’t care. Now that I had discovered the method of improvement faster and faster, I couldn’t ignore the addictive pull of its sensation. </p><p>I wondered if platinum would have given me the same boost gold did. Admittedly, the only reason I believed that was the fact that the next coin in the System was the platinum coin. Still, the theory was worth experimenting with. </p><p>But, even if it did, I couldn’t even imagine how much mana it would consume in the process. The mana requirement between silver and gold to trigger the system had gone up almost thirty times. I didn’t want to even imagine how much it would require for platinum, assuming the original trick held true in the first place. </p><p>Which, unfortunately, was not guaranteed. </p><p>“Prioritize,” I grumbled, reminding myself about the more important problem. One step at a time. I still needed to solve the issue of the ranged mana attack. However, instead of making a new variant of the sword, I started experimenting with gold, wanting to utilize its superior conductive properties. </p><p>With the setup in place, it didn’t take too much time to design a gold variant that conducted mana far better. Then, I simply replaced the silver core with the golden one, focusing on the hexagonal structure at the back of the scimitar. </p><p>An hour later, I was looking at a successful ranged attack. It barely went five yards before it dissipated, but I didn’t try to improve it. Instead, I destroyed the sword and instead started to work on a new weapon based on the same principles. </p><p>A hammer. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I need to find a way to contain mana for longer,” I muttered as I returned to the forge, and started working. Which meant that I needed more materials, which in turn required more time spent on mining and operating the blast furnace. </p><p>With my Quake Hammer, the actual mining didn’t take too much time. Carrying the ore to the blast furnace and loading it, on the other hand, took much longer. “No, I need to automate things. I continued working on another steam engine. </p><p>This time, it was the improved version, with a separate condenser chamber, meaning the steam cooled down in a separate chamber. That way, the cylinder didn’t have to heat up and cool down repeatedly. Therefore, not only did the power strokes move more regularly, but it was also more power efficient. </p><p>The trickier part was to connect the power arm to a set of gears and power shafts to convey the power into other materials. Originally, it was not that difficult. Just a thick fabric line would be enough. Unfortunately, here, the fabric didn’t survive long under the constant corrosive effect. </p><p>“It looks like I have to forge a lot of gear,” I said and began working. An hour later, I was looking at a brand-new steam engine, with multiple moving wheels, and gears to transfer power. Then, I started forging a conveyor belt. Unfortunately, I needed to make the moving parts out of thin metal plates rather than another simple fabric. </p><p>It was wasteful, but I didn’t have any other options. Inventing new materials wasn't as easy without the skills helping me to skip some critical stages midway. A few tricky mechanical parts were difficult to work out without any rubber or plastic, but I managed to do it. </p><p>Barely. However, it was more or less the limits of what I could achieve mechanically without additional effort. </p><p>The ultimate setup was simple. I had connected the new steam engine to multiple gears, allowing it to take over three critical roles at the same time. Working the conveyor belt, which was connected to a large reservoir into which I piled the raw iron ore I mined. Pumping out the water from the mining pit to keep it easy. And, feeding the blast furnace with materials and bringing away the excess. Well, blast furnaces, as I had built two more to benefit from the automation, which allowed me to stockpile refined iron, just in case. </p><p>As for the old atmospheric steam engine, I moved it next to the forge and fashioned it into a simple crusher that would destroy insect shells. It had a main output line, which would channel most of the mana toward the forge so I could use it to reshape metal. </p><p>I tried to come up with a way to channel the excess tainted energy toward the secondary experimentation area, but I failed. While the metal contained the tainted energy much better than mana, it was still not enough for it to reach the target almost two hundred yards away. </p><p>I might have tried to figure out a method of somehow forcing the monsters to evolve into something more profitable, but I did not. It was just an experiment to understand the dungeon’s secrets better, not to mention it was a good way to prepare for the fifth floor. </p><p>So, instead of creating a pipe System, I just created an inner cage to hold the foreign energy from the broken shells, which I could carry manually. </p><p>With that done, I started another set of experiments. A whole new set of containers, this time all made from the same alloy, but integrating hexagon shapes in different ways. Some, I etched the metal with hexagon shapes. Some, I created overlapping layers of thin containers with nothing but air in between. </p><p>As I worked, I periodically visited the cage to feed the monster with the tainted energy, watching it get more and more agitated. Since I expected it to transform into a giant insect, I even forged a new, reinforced cage. </p><p>Of the two experiments, the container one was the first to give a positive result. </p><p>The best performer was the one that I had shaped as a modified beehive, with the hexagon structure spreading not only as a layer but as a three-dimensional structure. It had outperformed any other container significantly, holding mana inside for more than a minute before it dissipated completely. </p><p>It had potential. </p><p>“I wonder why hexagons contain mana so much better,” I thought to myself. Unfortunately, when it came to science, why was often far more difficult to discover than how. Repeated experiments could discover the latter, but the former required a much deeper theoretical approach. </p><p>And I lacked the information necessary for that. </p><p>In the end, I decided to take the beehive pattern as an interim success, and start working on a way to mass produce it. While experimenting, I basically etched every hexagonal pattern directly with mana, which allowed me to forge them perfectly. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was difficult to make anything truly large-scale using that method. I tried to simplify the design. In the end, I came up with the idea of casting two thin sheets of metal: one smooth and one with a beehive pattern. Then, I would layer them multiple times, and then cut the whole layered sheet into six pieces and weld it together as a hexagonal cylinder. </p><p>However, creating a setup for casting was a level of automation I wasn’t ready for. Instead, I had forged one by hand, enough to confirm that the principle worked well enough. </p><p>“Mass production is not urgent,” I muttered as I grabbed another container filled with tainted energy and rushed toward the captured insect. During the last blast, it started trying to get away, so I was hoping to trigger the next development. </p><p>It did, but to my surprise, it didn’t transform into a giant one, but a flying one. </p><p>“Well, that’s not good news,” I said even as I watched the monster fly with surprising effectiveness. The biggest weakness of the ordinary monsters had been their mobility. However, their flying variant clearly didn’t share the same flaw, which was not encouraging for the future. </p><p>Even I wasn’t sure whether I could handle them if they collapsed around me like some kind of three-dimensional swarm. Not unless I had a better attack. </p><p>“Alright, creating a ranged mana attack is back on track,” I said as I walked back to the forge. </p><p>Of course, this meant that I needed to start my containment experiments from the beginning, this time to find the best patterns to actually increase mana conductivity. </p><p>After all, I was still a Blacksmith, and making tools to enable ranged attacks first was much better than blindly practicing the same technique again and again. </p><p>***</p><p>Just like that, with the absence of Eleanor and Maria, I found myself locked in a routine for the next two days. I stayed in the dungeon and didn’t go back to the town. Most of my time, I spent in my hidden base, alternating between trying to discover new variants of monsters and new materials, and restructuring the base, utilizing the wide availability of materials. </p><p>Though, several times, I went upstairs to bring ever-growing piles of monster shells. I had managed to figure out how to cut the shell with a mana attack directly, which allowed me to make almost a hundred gold with each trip. Three trips a day, and two days later, my account had almost reached eight hundred coins, a level of money I couldn’t have imagined before. </p><p>However, making more money had been the least interesting part of my time. </p><p>Experimenting with monsters was far more interesting. I had discovered two new variants of the normal-sized creature, which included a faster melee variant, and an armored one; and three variants for the giant one, one with an even thicker shell, a ranged variant, and one that looked like a burrowing type. </p><p>And, while I was experimenting with that, I also discovered why the monsters had been gathered whenever parts of the dungeon had been destroyed. Whenever it was destroyed, the same tainted energy was free, though the amount was not enough to be noticed by my Meditation. The Observe caught it, but only barely. </p><p>While it was interesting, the emergence of the new monster types was dangerous and, therefore more important. The potential existence of a flying one was problematic enough, forcing me to make some significant modifications to my base. I had not only created a roof over the forge, but also turned it into a roof garden to dissuade any possible attackers. </p><p>The potential risk of the burrowers had been easier to handle. I had just added a thick metal floor to the base to make sure there wouldn’t be any nasty surprises if the dungeon started to have more monsters. </p><p>The trick with the lure potion had been dangerous enough, I didn’t believe that it was the only way people discovered to sabotage dungeons, not even for a second. While I didn’t like the general attitude of this new world when it came to research and discovery, not for a moment did I believe that the same negligence applied to dungeons. </p><p>Dungeons had military implications with an immediate return, and no research that offered short-term improvements to the military had funding troubles. I had no doubt that the new research institutes I had been applying to — unsuccessfully — were focusing more on that than anything else. </p><p>However, while redesigning the base and experimenting with the monsters had taken a lot of time, it wasn’t the end of my research. I had also experimented with metals, which gave me an iron-silver alloy that was particularly good at conducting mana. </p><p>After several more experiments, I was able to discover that while hexagons were good at capturing mana, triangles were good at directing. </p><p>All that remained was to weaponize it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Too bad I have to stop,” I complained even as I smashed another giant insect, and started walking back. I had drifted away from it to hunt even more giant monsters, which had been even easier with my new hammer technique … especially since, once I got far away from the base, I stopped bothering to collect the shells. </p><p>I hadn’t brought the cart with me, and bringing them back would be an unnecessary chore. However, just because I didn’t bring back the shells didn’t mean that the adventure wasn’t useful. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) - 142]</p><p>The new variant of the mana attack once again pushed the skill to develop smoothly, until it stalled after one hundred and forty. Reaching a hundred points gave me an even better vitality attack, with its effects spreading to everything in a two-foot cone. </p><p>Unfortunately, it also consumed more than a hundred Health, meaning it couldn’t be used casually. At least, not before I confirmed whether the root plants I was raising on the fourth floor were edible. </p><p>I wanted nothing more than to return to my lab and continue experimenting on mana attacks. Unfortunately, I needed to show my face upstairs occasionally. Which meant, I had to waste another hour hunting the ordinary monsters. </p><p>“I can’t believe how quickly the money loses its allure,” I muttered. Now that I was getting richer, I immediately lost interest in working for more money. I wanted nothing more than to stop hunting, and focus on my experiments. </p><p>However, I learned my lesson from the last time when I assumed that money would be coming indefinitely. Even with all the tricks I had discovered, making money wasn’t that simple. I was able to monopolize the dungeon only because nobody else had discovered how to handle the corrosion effect, allowing me to make a ridiculous amount of money every day. </p><p>But, that income could disappear just as easily. All it would take was one of the ploys of Thomas to succeed, or someone else to find an anti-corrosion enchantment or come up with another solution. </p><p>“Maybe I should start delving deeper,” I examined. While the idea of finding the entrance to the fifth floor was a very time-consuming adventure, it might prove to be necessary. Unfortunately, it needed to stay an idea, at least for the moment. </p><p>Instead, I once again went to the third floor, about to start the tedious process of hunting, when I remembered how the monsters of the fourth floor had reacted to the concentrated tainted energy. “Why not multitask,” I muttered even as I went to the fourth floor and brought the chamber here. </p><p>It weighed more than a ton, especially when it was filled with broken large shells, but my metal cart easily handled that weight, while my strength handled the carrying. Once on the third floor, I closed myself in once more, and started to break the shells. The mana easily escaped the room, while tainted energy stayed in. </p><p>However, I didn’t waste too much time. The moment the mana density had dropped below a certain point, I opened the hatch, and the tainted energy rushed out. </p><p>Which immediately triggered a swarm that wasn’t any less impressive than the one triggered by the lure potion. Luckily, without the need to fight off a team of assassins at the same time, it was far easier to deal with. </p><p>I continued cutting them down, the sword in one hand, the extraction device in another, multitasking to play around with the shape of the sword attack even more. With the number of monsters attacking, extracting all of their shells was nearly impossible. </p><p>I was just about to see if I could modify the mana field around the sword in a way that would allow me to kill the monster and get the shell at the same time, something more interesting caught my gaze. </p><p>Some of the monsters were moving away. </p><p>It was the first time I had seen the monsters actually behave like that, which I felt like an incredible discovery. One that I wanted to observe. However, instead, I just followed and killed them, not even taking away their shells. </p><p>It felt like letting them go away would have been irresponsible. </p><p>Only after I dealt with every monster that was trying to get away did I start playing with the mana field around the blade, trying to extract the shell and kill the monster in one blow. When the swarm finally calmed down, I was yet to succeed in that, but I made some nice progress. </p><p>Still, I was more excited about the experiment rather than adding another sixty gold coins to my account. </p><p>“So, what’s going on?” I asked as I arrived at the base, and noticed the guards were looking stressed. </p><p>“The news is not good, sir,” one of the guards whispered. “I heard that two of the guilds had already pulled back from the operation. And, it looks like others are considering pulling back as well.” </p><p>“Oh?” I asked. </p><p>The guard nodded. “Yes, the news of the dungeon disaster has spread, and some of the guilds are already packing up.” </p><p>“Really?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes. Everyone fears that we’ll end up getting fired.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, the other guilds pulling out is excellent news,” I answered, loud enough for the guards to look surprised. “Well, the less guild there is, the more money I would make,” I said. Then, I smiled excessively widely. “And, I doubt any other guild masters would be generous enough to tip you guys with gold coins, right?” </p><p>I was speaking loudly to maintain their morale. </p><p>“Right, sir,” the guard replied, relieved. </p><p>The world might have changed to an unrecognizable mess, but money still solved all problems.</p><p>“Now, count all of it and record it on my account,” I said as I took a new cart, once again going down. Only after I had left the fort behind, I frowned. </p><p>The news of guilds pulling back was certainly not good. If Maria changed her mind about operating the dungeon alone, a lot of plans I had would have been ruined. The biggest reason I was able to achieve everything in such a short order was their lax management. </p><p>I wasn’t sure if I could do the same if they changed their mind and sold the dungeon operations to someone else. </p><p>Technically, my bragging about hiring a lot of people and earning even more money from the dungeon was not a lie. I could do so, but doing so would be troubling. Having only five more fighters, each armed with one of the modified looted swords would make me a lot of money. </p><p>However, expanding that operation further didn’t have the same advantage. Trying to build a guild that could single-handedly operate the dungeon meant that I needed to reveal some secrets, which, in turn, made me an even bigger target for assassination.</p><p>“No need to borrow trouble from the future,” I muttered even as I passed through the gate. Ultimately, it was just gossip, and I didn’t know the real scale of the problem </p><p>However, there was nothing I could do about that before Eleanor and Maria returned with the caravan, so I didn’t want to waste my time. </p><p>Instead, I returned to the fourth floor. I had another experiment to make. </p><p>For that experiment, I decided to keep things simple. I went back to my hidden base and created another tree ring just a hundred yards away from the outer ring. Then, I made a cage out of the strongest anti-corrosive material I had. </p><p>Capturing one of the ordinary monsters had been slightly more troubling, but then I dragged it to the center of the woods. </p><p>Then, I made a copy of the container I used to practice meditation. I could have brought the other one back from the third floor, but that would mean that I had to carry that back and forth whenever I wanted to use it to trigger another swarm.</p><p>Assuming, of course, there wasn’t a disastrous consequence. </p><p>Once the container was complete, I positioned it against the cage, and once again broke multiple shells into pieces, periodically leaving the beast under its effects. </p><p>After three bursts, the beast started to struggle, trying to run away. However, the cage was strong enough to hold it back, so after several attempts of breaking out, it started to turn listless. Then, it fell into a coma. </p><p>It was the first time I saw a monster sleeping, or doing anything that could be defined as living. So, I stayed there to watch it, curious about what was going on. </p><p>I didn’t waste my time. At the same time, I started practicing with my sword, once again focusing on the mana field around the blade. Soon, I had already succeeded in spreading it two inches away from the edge blade, which gave it an incredible cutting ability. </p><p>However, it was unnecessarily mana-consuming and unstable. The moment I stopped providing extra mana, it flickered slightly, and it destabilized immediately.  </p><p>“But, what if I modify the sword to better channel the mana?” I muttered, already deciding on what to work on next. Maybe I could copy the general shape of a sharpening enchantment, adding some hexagonal tubes into the metal to channel the mana better. </p><p>Such a modification would have made the sword weaker, but still, it was a worthy experiment. </p><p>However, those thoughts had been interrupted when the monster woke up, only to attack me with a ranged spit. </p><p>I didn’t expect monsters to be able to evolve. </p><p>This had implications… but exploring this revelation would take some preparation, as triggering that evolution had been very wasteful. It used the material from almost ten giant insects. Hardly cost-efficient for practical purposes. </p><p>The mystery behind this occurrence, on the other hand… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s see what’s the difference between the two methods,” I muttered even as I focused, and attempted to activate my newly obtained skill. An imaginary orb once again started rotating, though both the speed of the rotation and the pull were far less than I had expected. I actually had to open the hatch and disperse most of the tainted energy that had been collected to succeed. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 1 -&gt; 7]</p><p>“At least it improves faster,” I said, and I shattered a few more shells. Another minute of meditation gave me two more mana points. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 7 -&gt; 19]</p><p>“Well, no perks,” I growled. While I didn’t expect more perks, I had still been hoping for that to be the case. I pushed again, which brought my skill’s proficiency to its thirties. The sphere started rotating even faster, already surpassing the performance of the Common variant had on its level fifties. </p><p>However, the more interesting part was that, once I passed level twenty-five, I could feel that it wasn’t a singular method anymore. Instead, I could feel a second option, a sphere with a deep gap around its equator line. </p><p>It was not a straight line, but a wavy gap, almost like a trench, or a water canal. </p><p>Switching between the two had been instinctual, but the actual application of the skill was not. As I rotated, the sphere moved sluggishly, with the foreign energy clogging its flow. It was an interesting experience. The skill was giving me direction, but I failed to actually push it. </p><p>The reason soon became clear. The tainted energy, for lack of a better word, was clogging the structure. I had a good idea of what the function of that line was, so I opened the hatch once again to cleanse the room of the tainted energy, slowly increasing intensity once more. </p><p>The gap at the center almost worked like a centrifuge, the mana was gathered there, while the tainted energy was pushed to the surface, essentially separating the two factors. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said even as I focused on the shape of the channel. It felt immutable. But then, as I repeated the process a few more times and pushed it above fifty, it changed. I could feel that I could transform both the surface of the sphere, and the shape of the ditch. </p><p>However, when I tried to do that, I was met with something I hadn’t faced ever before. The Skill refused to engage, like I was trying to lift a weight I wasn’t capable of lifting. </p><p>“I wonder if it’s due to my lack of stats,” I muttered. I vaguely remembered the sensation when I had first acquired Mana Forge, but back then, I didn’t have too much time to process it. I couldn’t help but feel excited, wondering whether it would mean I could unlock another Stat while leveling up. </p><p>But, I wasn’t in a hurry for that. I still had a lot of experiments to run. Level fifty was the biggest opportunity I had to upgrade my class once more, and I wanted to maximize the opportunity there. </p><p>Still, while it didn’t rotate automatically, that didn’t mean I couldn’t reshape it. Curious, I transformed it to a simple hexagon and rotated … it pushed both mana and tainted energy away. “Interesting.” I maintained the hexagonal shape and used it to run the process in reverse and discharge my mana. </p><p>It worked far better. </p><p>I ignored it temporarily. I had a lot of time to experiment. Instead, I started gathering and releasing mana again and again, increasing the density of the tainted energy whenever the skill development stalled. </p><p>Soon, another bonus arrived. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 98 -&gt; 102]</p><p> [Perk Options — Advanced Purification (Purification) / Superior Sensing (Enhanced Sensing) / Efficient Absorption / Channeled Flow (Controlled Flow)] </p><p>I chose Superior Sensing, as it was the one that would help me most when discovering the secrets of mana. I was glad to do so. I could actually see some more details. Unfortunately, they were hard to describe, and that enhanced visibility only worked while I was meditating. </p><p>Soon, the maximum density of tainted energy I could achieve stopped giving me benefits, which meant that the immediate benefits had stopped. Not that I was complaining. I had already pushed my meditation to an incredible level. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 134 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]</p><p>“That’s enough meditation for today,” I said to myself, even as I stood up, and left the hatch. With two of my tasks complete, I was about to focus on creating the steam-powered crusher. </p><p>Now that I could refill my mana completely in seconds, breaking the shells actually turned into my biggest problem. However, once I stepped out of the steel coffin I had created for myself, I had to delay that. The reason? </p><p>The density of the insects around my base had increased significantly as if someone had broken a weak lure potion. But, I didn’t start looking for a spy because of it, since the aired-out concentrated tainted energy was a much better explanation for their presence. </p><p>“Interesting discovery,” I muttered even as I rushed forward. I chose to use a sword, as it was a good opportunity to work on the mana attack. I was prepared to work hard to create something even halfway usable. </p><p>So, when I bisected the first giant insect effortlessly, I was actually surprised. Unlike my previous attempts, the mana edge solidified around the blade effortlessly, enhancing the cutting edge perfectly. It almost looked like I was using a skill … but then, it was not. Whenever I used a skill, there was always a slight sense of separation. </p><p>The difference was subtle, like the difference between riding a bike and swimming. Both gave a sense of control, but the former was reliant on the shape of the tool more than the latter. </p><p>In my case, the skill still handled my movements, but the mana around the blade was under my direct influence, changing shape through my control, weakening, and strengthening as I focused on the mana field.</p><p>It didn’t take long for me to understand the source of the sudden improvements. My experiments. </p><p>After all, I had spent several hours working with mana. And, more importantly, it was not mere repetition work, but experimental work that had forced me to interact with mana, both directly, and based on different materials. </p><p>The more I practiced, the more I realized that change came from many different directions. One was simple. By repeatedly using Mana Control to shape and release mana again and again, I had gotten more familiar with the way mana moved, and the uncommon variant of the Meditation had further improved my understanding. </p><p>Of course, what I was doing with the mana blade was nowhere as tight as using Mana Control. Still, using it repeatedly gave me a better instinct for mana’s liquid form — or, at least, what I temporarily named, as it was not exactly an accurate descriptor — which translated somewhat into the more solidified form a mana attack used. </p><p>Then, there were my insights on the movement and dispersal of mana, particularly understanding how it roughly followed a similar path to Newton’s Law of Cooling. That alone gave me a better idea of how much mana to push into the structure. More importantly, knowing that there was still a mana cloud around me even if I couldn’t detect it allowed me to compensate for it. </p><p>However, the biggest benefit came from an unexpected source: How the mana interacted with the metal itself. </p><p>During the experiment, I had created hundreds of different alloy variants, focusing on nothing but the way they interacted with mana. Of course, I had just focused on observing the way they kept the mana contained, but since that was done with Observe, I had caught far more minute details than just the speed of dispersal. </p><p>And, after thousands of observations, I had managed to get a better sense of how to maintain that mana field. “Suddenly, I’m glad that I haven’t destroyed the containers,” I chuckled even as I continued to cut down the giant insects, trying to angle my attacks so that I could kill the beasts and remove their shells at the same time. </p><p>Of course, that way, I was only able to get a broken shell, and it dropped the skill quality considerably, but I didn’t care for either the sales potential or the skills. The most important thing was to have even more material for my experiments. </p><p>Once the density of the monsters had been dropped to a certain degree, I went back to the shelves, and forged another set of containers, this time going the opposite direction, and focusing on creating a metal that allowed the mana to flow freely. </p><p>What followed was another cycle of experimentation. I alternated between using a hammer, sword, and spear, sometimes using the mana blows through the Mana Forge skill, and sometimes experimenting with it directly. It was another session of experimentation someone else would have classified as boring, but not me. </p><p>No, I was too busy inventing a new mana attack for my Quake Hammer. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 83 -&gt; 85]</p><p>“Success,” I said even as I looked at the horde of monsters surrounding my base. </p><p>But, as I looked at them, I only saw walking proficiency points. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I decided to hold the first iteration of the next experiment on the fourth floor. While I was afraid that the corrosive effect might ruin the experiment, considering the trial and error process I had to go through, I felt that it was an acceptable compromise. </p><p>I could always use the anti-corrosive material on different floors to confirm my conclusion, but the reverse wouldn’t have worked. </p><p>Before starting, I mined another huge pile of iron ores, and refilled the blast furnace. I didn’t need more iron under the circumstances, but it was not an excuse to waste the capacity. I could always store the excess. Also, watching the rhythmic movement of the steam engine was calming, reminding me that my work was not for naught. </p><p>I forged a hundred different variants of anti-corrosive alloys, each shaped into the same hexagonal cylinder with thick walls and a hollow core, and half a foot tall. A boring process, so the reminder was certainly welcome. I only stopped to refill the blast furnace, and occasionally to mine more iron ore — which was rapid thanks to Quake Hammer. </p><p>Then, I filled each of those containers with five different intensities of mana, noting down the rate of dispersal for each set — this time writing them on clay tablets as paper disintegrated on the fourth floor — while leaving the containers on the shelves I had created. </p><p>Once the results were compiled, I picked the ten most promising results and created ten variants for each result. And, I repeated that cycle until I was looking at five hundred different cylinders. Luckily, with my Forge skill above a hundred, forging all those different materials barely took four hours. </p><p>“A good halfway result,” I said. Without the skill to help me, even with a modern materials lab, the same experimental cycle would have taken months, and a dedicated team of tab technicians, manufacturers, and assistants. </p><p>I could have continued to experiment, but I decided to visit the first three floors, and maybe even leave the dungeon momentarily to see how it worked outside. For the trip, I only took five cylinders with me, making sure there was a great performance variance between them. I wanted to bring more, but it would be too suspicious. </p><p>Hiding the cylinders wasn’t the only preparation I had made for the trip. I stopped by the third floor and reforged the armor I wore whenever I went outside. Its surface stayed the same, but I added two layers of protection underneath. </p><p>I still remember how easily I was able to kill my assassins due to their poor armor. Just because I was in disguise didn’t mean I had to wear substandard armor. </p><p>With that done, I tested the experimental hexagonal cylinders and observed the dispersal rate of mana change between the third and the fourth floors. Mana dispersed faster on the fourth floor. The difference was significant, but the relative dispersal rate stayed the same between the cylinders.</p><p>That much could have been accounted for by environmental differences, but the mechanics were in doubt. A glass of water cools down at different paces in a room and in a freezer. But, the cooling rate would be different if the glass was in front of a ventilator as well. </p><p>My current setup wasn’t designed to detect the difference. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I muttered even as I traveled between the floors, and confirmed that it was true for the first two floors as well. The higher the dungeon was, the slower the mana dispersed. </p><p>And, since I was returning to the camp, I spent some time hunting insects on the third floor, bringing another thousand shells to the guards. Just because I was experimenting didn’t mean I had to stop making money. It was also a good chance to check in with the guards and confirm there was no problem. </p><p>Finding out mana dispersed at different speeds in different dungeon floors had been curious. But, ultimately, the difference had been minor. However, the real interesting phenomena occurred when I walked out of the dungeon to ‘get some fresh air’. </p><p>The mana dispersal rate outside was far weaker. Even on the first floor, the mana I pushed in had merely stayed in for two seconds before disappearing completely, while outside, it stayed in the container for almost thirty seconds. The difference was resounding. </p><p>What was even more interesting was the direction Mana flowed. Inside the dungeon, the mana had dispersed in every direction at the same time. Meanwhile, outside, the dispersal seemed to be moving toward the ground. It was hard to be certain, particularly since I needed to keep the cylinders concealed from the guards.</p><p>My new status didn’t mean I could act with impunity.  </p><p>I wished that I could stay out to observe the differences between the dungeon and the outside world more, but I didn’t want the guards to notice anything extraordinary. I could go into the wilderness, but I didn’t want to do so without Eleanor around. </p><p>It would be a pity if I died in another assassination attempt. </p><p>This meant that, the difference between the dungeon and the outside world was added to the list of interesting phenomena I couldn’t explore any further because of more immediate concerns. “Frustrating,” I grumbled as I started walking through the empty wasteland of the dungeon once more. </p><p>On my way back, I chose to practice an enhanced version of the Fleeting Step, this time dragging the cart behind me. It was an interesting experience. I fell many times, and broke the cart more times than I wanted to admit, but the improvement had been interesting. </p><p>Once I returned to the fourth floor, I brought my attention back to my material research. However, in the third cycle, the returns started to not be so worth it. </p><p>Still, I had my material. First, I created another thin tube, this time in a hexagonal shape, and kept one end blunt. </p><p>[-20 Mana]</p><p>“Success,” I muttered as I used Observe on the tube again to examine the movement of the mana. This time, rather than just slipping out of the tube, it stuck around, dispersing in a directional manner, giving me the chance to get a feel for the mana movement. </p><p>It didn’t teach me anything practical, but that was the nature of scientific experiments. The aim was to reach a better understanding, not to develop anything useful. Once the working principles were in place, the technology would inevitably follow. </p><p>Speaking of technology, I wondered if I could scale up the tubes enough to function as mana storage. I forged two more tubes. From the outside, they looked the same, but one of them was solid, while the other was made of thin layers, kept apart by the thinnest connectors I could forge. </p><p>The layered one kept the mana inside far longer. The difference was between three seconds and eight seconds. At first glance, it felt like an unimportant practical difference, but it was not so. </p><p>At this point, forging required more and more of my mana, which meant I had to take a lot of breaks to destroy the shells. However, maybe I could create a device, and link it to the steam engine. Add in a simple gravity feeder, and it would output mana far more regularly.</p><p>Creating a crank system that would power that device, and making sure it ran constantly wasn’t easy … but then again, I didn’t need to do so for an experiment. A manual variant was much easier to create. </p><p>Soon, I was looking at another layered tube, with a thick crusher attached to the end. I used it to shatter the shell piece into smaller pieces, and a burst of mana followed. </p><p>With an unexpected result. While the pure mana passed through the layers easily, the same wasn’t true for the tainted energy. It stuck around, unable to penetrate the layer. </p><p>“That’s interesting,” I muttered. Up until now, I had been running the experiment using my own mana, as it was far easier to control and measure. And, excited by the progress, I didn’t even consider how the tainted part of it would have reacted. </p><p>From an absorption speed perspective, it wasn’t really important. I already had Purification, which made the absorption much faster. </p><p>However, it didn’t mean it was useless. On the contrary. </p><p>Excited by the process, I immediately forged another hexagonal tube, large enough for me to fit in, and with a hexagonal door that could be sealed from inside. Then, I sealed myself in with my hammer, and with a lot of shells, and started shattering the shells. </p><p>The pure mana escaped easily, but the same wasn’t true for the taint part. Its density started to get more and more intense. Once I destroyed half of the shells, I crouched down, and started channeling my Meditation skill. </p><p>It took fifteen seconds for the first notification to appear. </p><p>[+1 Mana]</p><p>However, rather than stopping, I kept going. I could feel the strain as I ran the skill, which signaled excellent progress. I stopped only after a minute had passed, ignoring the rare notifications of mana alert. </p><p>What was really valuable was the one that appeared once I stopped. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 53 -&gt; 61]</p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered, happy that my research was already paying dividends. I wondered why the jump was so sudden. But, at this point, I was used to seemingly nonsensical ways skills could jump. Luckily, one thing I wasn’t lacking was shells. I repeated the same thing again and again, running the skill longer every time.  </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 61 -&gt; 78]</p><p>[Meditation (Common) 78 -&gt; 92]</p><p>[Meditation (Common) 92 -&gt; 99]</p><p>“One more to receive my perk,” I said as I repeated the experiment once more.

I could have always repeated the same thing with Skill Stones … or could I, I suddenly added. After all, I still didn’t know if I had the prerequisite stats for the Uncommon version of the skill. </p><p>Then, once I checked the skill, I was met with another surprise. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 1 [Controlled Flow, Enhanced Sensing, Purification]</p><p>My perks were still in place. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 36</p><p>The moment I stepped through the gate, I got charged by multiple monsters. I could easily count forty of them around me, making it a challenge. That would have been dangerous enough, but a few of the insect monsters had stopped their charge to spit out some kind of discharge. </p><p>Eleanor had mentioned that their attacks only damaged armor, but I wasn’t willing to test it. Instead, I dodged them first before I turned the momentum into a charge, shattering the armor of the first beast. I was glad that I didn’t rely on the mana blow to deal with them, as it would have made dodging the insects far more difficult. </p><p>Instead, I let expertise from the skill handle the challenge, limiting my involvement only to a strategic level, dealing with the ranged attackers first. Ordinarily, it would have been a bad idea to jump into the middle of a horde of monsters even if they were weaker. </p><p>But a combat skill at its limit was truly wondrous. </p><p>“After dealing with that attack, I understand why exploring new dungeons is such a perilous journey,” I muttered even as I took a deep breath. Just trying to get into a new floor was difficult, and that was after it was cleaned by Eleanor just yesterday. </p><p>I couldn’t even imagine the difficulty of facing a completely new dungeon, with no idea of what it might hold. It also explained why they had spent all that money to defend the other side of the entrance. </p><p>“Still, not all is bad,” I said. With traversing between floors even more difficult than I had expected, people shouldn’t walk around carelessly, meaning my forge was even less likely to be discovered.</p><p>Only once I dealt with the monsters, did  I decide to examine my immediate surroundings. Just as Eleanor had stated, the mysterious mist was blocking more of my sight. I walked, however, halfway in, I pressed my hand on a herb and used Nurture. </p><p>[-9 Health]</p><p>This time, it worked. I moved deeper. The same attempt didn’t work when the plant was outside the dungeon. </p><p>However, while that was another interesting experiment to run, it didn’t have any priority. I needed to discover the entrance to the third floor first. </p><p>I pulled a piece of paper, carefully mapping my surroundings, not wanting to get lost. It was a slow, laborious process, the limited visual range making it far more difficult. I didn’t want to get lost. </p><p>However, as I walked away, I noticed that it wasn’t too much of a problem. Even as the mist had covered the dungeon gate, I could still see its glow. I considered it to be of interest, as it hadn’t worked that way from the other side. </p><p>I wondered if it worked the same way for the main entrance. If it did, the walls had been thick enough to block the sight. </p><p>I walked directly to test its limit, only stopping to kill the monsters — and spending some time piling them to get better skills. One ranged attack, I deliberately let it deliver a glancing blow. It hurt somewhat, but nowhere strong enough to actually qualify as damage. </p><p>[-5 Health]</p><p>However, it damaged the armor and weapons even more than the feedback corrosion effect. </p><p>“Huh,” I exclaimed, but before making a move, I started searching for the gate to the third floor. Amusingly, it had been easier than expected. I just needed to follow the path with the least amount of monsters, making a careful note of every milestone on my way to make sure I wouldn’t get lost, only slowing down to replenish my mana completely. </p><p>Going through the third floor would be even more difficult. </p><p>While walking, I found a lot of crystals and herbs, far more than I could use in a short period. After all, it clearly took a while for them to grow, and the first floor was too crowded for them to be found regularly. </p><p>Maybe I could make a stockpile near the forge. Once I revealed the anti-corrosion metal, they would be far more valuable. Which was true even if there were other blacksmiths with the same recipe. </p><p>It was better to be prepared. </p><p>Following Eleanor’s path, finding the third gate hadn’t been that difficult in terms of practical matters, but I was confronted by a swarm twice. Three hundred monsters had managed to slow me down somewhat, but I was at the next gate almost an hour later, and that was with stopping enough times to create a map. </p><p>I was not exactly a cartographer, but creating a guide for myself wasn’t that difficult. </p><p>“Now, the real challenge,” I muttered as I twirled my hammer. At the next gate, there would be a giant bug, which would have been a troubling encounter even without mixing it with the other beasts. I was tempted to return, and try to convince Eleanor about having a second location to experiment. It would be much safer. </p><p>But, that was my pre-Calamity perspective talking. I tried to stay safe for three years, and where did that get me? </p><p>Nowhere. </p><p>I took a deep breath, tightened my grip on my hammer, and prepared myself for a fight, already making plans on how to handle a giant monster depending on its size and position. Eleanor had mentioned them to be rare, but I wanted to be prepared for the worst case. </p><p>As I stepped to the third floor, I found myself facing another swarm that had gathered around the gate. There were about fifty of them, a mixture of ranged and melee variants, but there was no giant variant. “Excellent,” I muttered even as I dealt with them rapidly, slowing down just to kick them into a pile. </p><p>That way, I received Common skills rather than Basic ones. Unfortunately, I had two more Common Nurture skills, one common spear skill, and another that didn’t react to me. </p><p>How annoying. </p><p>“I wonder how rare the giant insects are,” I questioned as I tightened my grip further, and started walking forward, once again careful not to lose my way. The second floor was larger than the first, and the third was larger than the second. </p><p>About a mile away from the gate, I faced the first giant insect. “Hey there, buddy,” I said while circling the monstrosity, testing its speed. In a straight line, it was faster than its smaller counterparts, but it was slower to turn. </p><p>I approached it from the side and smashed one of its legs. It shattered temporarily, but I could already see it was recovering from the damage. Meanwhile, I could feel my hammer degrade far compared to when I dealt with its smaller counterparts. </p><p>“That’s annoying,” I muttered even as I rotated around it, and used Inspect to check the damage. It was a good thing I did, as not only was it damaged more, but there was also a persistent effect that stuck around. A burst of mana stopped it. </p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>I deliberately circled it twice, testing its limits. However, I avoided its back, afraid of a nasty surprise. My concern only got stronger once I noticed it trying to reverse direction. Carefully, I rotated around it, testing it a while longer, making sure I wouldn't be met with a nasty surprise while switching skills. </p><p>[-12 Mana]</p><p>I might not push more than a couple points of mana outside with meditation without killing myself, but things doing that was much easier under the command of the Forge skill. It settled around the hammer, ready to smash the nonexistent metal into pieces. </p><p>One that turned my strike devastating as it landed. The hammer was protected, while the leg stopped recovering. I struck it again and it stopped moving. Another blow and its mandible had been broken. Three more blows, and it stopped moving. </p><p>I pulled back, waiting for it to disappear, not even trying to pull its shell. There was no need to take the risk in case it was playing dead or had another nasty surprise. </p><p>There was none. It faded, leaving behind another skill.</p><p> [Skill Stone: Nurture (Common)]</p><p>“Nice,” I muttered even as I twirled it in my hand. Not because I needed another Nurture skill, but because it was the first time a higher rank skill dropped from the monsters without piling them together. Confirming that the giant monsters weren’t too hard to deal with was another benefit. </p><p>After testing my attacks on a few of them, it would probably be much easier. I was immediately struck with a desire to hunt another, this time to rip mana-dense sections of its shell to see if it had other uses. </p><p>But, that was for later. First, I continued moving deeper and deeper, searching for a nice hidden spot for my forge. </p><p>In the end, I found a sharp cliff with almost nothing. One that I could dig a deep hole to set up my forge, and bury whenever my work gets finished. However, I didn’t have anything to dig with. </p><p>Luckily, I was a blacksmith who could forge with mana, and one thing I didn’t lack was mana. I quickly forged a huge pick and an equally large shovel, both designed to put my strength advantage to use. They weren’t as good as it could have been without a proper fire, but mana was a good way to compensate. </p><p>As I dug a pit, I learned the reason for not damaging the dungeon. The more I dug, the more monsters swarmed toward me. Which was excellent news.</p><p>After all, I needed a lot of mana. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 37</p><p>“Wow, they are burning better than I had expected,” I said as I settled a crude crucible on top of the hearth that held the fire, the iron it held had already turned into a white hot liquid, ready to be purified. Nearby, there was an anvil that was cooling down. </p><p>I was so happy that I could cheat with mana, as otherwise, I would have had to work hard to set up a proper blast furnace. I still might if I wanted to increase my production rate, but for the moment, this was sufficient.</p><p>“Now, let’s gear up,” I said and used the available metal to make myself a full set of gear, including full body armor, a large tower shield with sharp edges and a spike that I could drive into the beasts, a war hammer made of pure metal, and a thick, stout sword that was designed to work perfectly with Stalwart Guard technique. </p><p>According to the information my skill had provided, all of them were perfectly immune to corrosion. </p><p>A small part of me couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Letting everything be handled by a skill was very underwhelming, but considering the potential benefits, I was more than ready to ignore that detail. </p><p>It had been merely three hours, which was an incredibly short amount of time; but then, having my Mana Forge skill that high had provided me with many benefits. It would have been even faster, but … </p><p>I lacked water to quench the metal, which meant I needed to use mana to compensate for it, slowing the process. Luckily, with my increased Meditation, I was able to refill my mana far faster, allowing me to bypass my biggest problem.</p><p>At least, for the moment. For the future, I needed to find a reason to bring some more water inside. Maybe I could set up a small garden on the first floor, arguably to test whether I could create a sustainable setup for myself to get some extra Health. </p><p>It wasn’t a novel idea. The current dungeon was hardly the biggest one imaginable. There were other, bigger dungeons, and for some of them, it was more efficient to set up gardens to provide food rather than transport them from outside. </p><p>I doubted that it was the case for our dungeon, considering the desert environment surrounding it, but I just needed an excuse. Between that, and going to the fourth floor just to bring some water, a fake garden was clearly the better option … once I had others in my guild that could handle that. </p><p>My new, nameless guild. </p><p>“Actually, it might be easier to test the fourth floor first,” I said even as I put my finishing touches to the set. After all, the whole point was to stay hidden. It would probably avoid attention for a while, but sooner or later, people would start poking around. </p><p>Still, I didn’t need to hurry up. Actually, it wasn’t even certain that I would be able to find the way to the fourth floor. Not with the way my sight was blocked. </p><p>“I’m trying to handle too many projects,” I said even as I started moving. I collected my tools, and left my equipment buried, but left the forge uncovered. I wanted to see if the monsters would attack and destroy it. </p><p>They shouldn’t, but it was better safe than sorry. It wouldn’t bother me if my current setup had been destroyed, but it wouldn’t be the same if they attacked equipment I had worked harder to put together. </p><p>“But first, let’s see if I can get a renewable source of wood,” I said. The plants I used didn’t have any seeds, but trying to grow plants using saplings should have been sustainable. </p><p>It worked … after a fashion. </p><p>[-280 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 3 -&gt; 5]</p><p>“Nice jump in skill level,” I muttered. It was a nice surprise, but maybe the damage to the plant had affected the skill development, just as the quality of the weapon affected Repair. However, I didn’t start experimenting immediately. </p><p>I was not exactly happy with the amount of Health it took, and the resulting limited impact. But then, I was trying to force growth in a dead land, lacking any kind of water. Hardly an efficient method. While some interesting ideas popped into my mind, I ignored them. </p><p>“Nurturing Nurture is not a priority,” I said, then groaned, glad that I was alone. It was not a pun I was proud of. </p><p> I moved away from the forge, letting the monsters gather around it again, to see if they would attack it. Luckily, it stayed untouched even when I deliberately drew a small-sized swarm near it. It was excellent news, as this meant that my plans to create a new forge on the fourth floor were viable. </p><p>As long as I confirmed the anti-corrosive Mana alloy worked as well as my skill suggested. I spent an hour cleaning the immediate surroundings of the forge, collecting skills, other dungeon materials, and various samples, but the real aim was to test the anti-corrosive Mana alloy under repeated stress. </p><p>It passed perfectly, even when I deliberately hacked at a giant bug multiple times to push it to its limits. It not only resisted the effects of the smaller insects but also the giant ones’, which had been far easier to deal with without worrying about the destruction of the weapons. It meant that I could slowly hack them to death using my sword and shield combo, the stronger enemy once again speeding up the growth of Stalwart Guard, finally passing the fifty proficiency mark. </p><p>My attempts to figure out the mana attack, on the other hand, didn’t work as well. </p><p>A talk with Eleanor seemed to be necessary to push it to the limit as I had done with the hammer skill. But, that required an opportunity. Maybe after Maria had returned, during another dinner... Assuming, of course, they would continue to invite me. </p><p> However, even as I tested those advantages and made plans, I couldn’t help but wonder about why the dungeons existed. More importantly, why were they so convenient? The biggest challenge the current dungeon provided was the corrosion effect, and it had all the materials needed to solve that. </p><p>And, the recipe it required was conveniently included in a Rare skill, a classification that was supposed to be easy to attain for other classes according to Maria’s ramblings, mentioning categories such as Legendary casually. </p><p>“Maybe I should keep a lid on this anti-corrosive material a bit,” I decided. My success was making me a little nervous. It wasn’t always good to be too successful. </p><p>Ironically, that immediately changed my plans in an interesting way. While I hadn’t promised Eleanor that I could invent anti-corrosive material and openly warned her that it might fail, I was very much aware that she took that as a certainty. </p><p>Meaning, I needed to preemptively counter any loss of goodwill she might get from it. The most obvious way … improving my abilities with the sword. </p><p>“A little trip upstairs is in order,” I said even as I cut the trip a little short, even suppressing the temptation to test the shells I took from the giant monsters. It was frustrating because I was looking forward to discovering the differences between the two, curious whether there were any differences other than their mana density. </p><p>I wanted to change the carts and get more metal, and not just because I wanted to prepare for the future. No, I wanted to forge swords of different shapes and sizes and see if they would work. At the same time, as I climbed up, I was examining the Sharpness enchantment on the sword, wondering if it would give me a clue. </p><p>The mana blow from the forging was more like a thick, confusing web that reminded me of a complicated knitting pattern, but the details were a mystery. </p><p>Mana was essentially still a black box for me. </p><p>As I climbed up, I tried to channel the Mana discharge in multiple thin lines, trying to replicate sharpness enchantment in some way. </p><p>I refilled my mana almost ten times during the long trip between the third floor and the first floor, only to fail at every single attempt. It didn’t even give me a new skill point in anything. Not even in Meditation. </p><p>It was the flip side of forcing skills to grow unnaturally. There was no easy benefit to be gained from the routine activities. </p><p>“I’m so lucky that I don’t have to ration my Mana,” I muttered even as I arrived at my broken cart, and filled it with mostly random garbage. I dragged it out of its hiding spot, dragging it back to the main area. </p><p>“Hey,” I said as I waved at a familiar guard. </p><p>”It looks like your trip has been a little unlucky,” he said. </p><p>“Unfortunately,” I replied even as a couple of workers arrived to pack them to be delivered to the town. Another service I could use for a limited time. “Why don’t I get a new cart for the second trip.” </p><p>“Sure, but I can’t waive the penalty,” he said. “It doesn’t matter that you brought the cart back. You still need to pay five silver.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” I said as I looked around, only to notice a stall nearby. “What’s that?” I asked. </p><p>“A few people trying to sell the skills they got from the dungeon. A total ripoff,” he said. </p><p>“Well, it’s better than going back to town,” I replied. “Is there anything useful?” </p><p>“Maybe if you want to change your sword style for more efficient hunting, but I don’t think a Common skill is worth it,” he said as he pointed at my bulky shield. It wasn’t as big as the tower shield I forged, but it was still big. </p><p>“No. It’s not like I’m going to spend my days killing monsters. I’m here to laze around and watch others make money for me.” </p><p>“That’s the dream,” the guard replied. However, even as we chatted, I went to the skill rack. Everything they were trying to sell was common and basic. Understandable. While I was able to get uncommon skills, I had to kill a lot of monsters at the same time for it. </p><p>However, it did give me a sad confirmation. I wasn’t able to learn anything above basic when it came to magic skills. The lack of Intelligence stumped me once more. I still spent ten silver there, purchasing one of every skill. </p><p>Including one that I had been trying to get all day. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Fire Bolt (Basic)]</p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 38</p><p>For the second trip, I didn’t destroy the cart completely. While it was a good way to get some extra iron, it would be suspicious if I brought back every single one with significant damage. </p><p>Instead, I spent some time reforging the parts. There were several thick metal bands, which I melted and reforged with a stone core. It was too much effort for something that could be purchased for three copper coins, but the opportunity cost was too critical. </p><p>Only after I was finished with the cart and arrived at the second floor, I actually absorbed my newest skill. My first real magical one. </p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 1]</p><p>Did I expect it to be useful in any kind of combat situation? Not particularly. Basic skills were basic for a reason. But, I was sure that it would be situationally useful during my smithing. The ability to reheat the metal locally, for example, could be really useful. </p><p>But, the real objective was to give me an idea of how to use mana. </p><p>I was tempted to start playing with it immediately, but I managed to hold myself back until I arrived at the third floor, afraid that someone would stumble upon me. Throwing fire bolts around was not exactly a good way of progressing. </p><p>Still, before trying it for the first time, I made sure to clean my surroundings. I didn’t want to be interrupted. With that, I looked at a rock thirty feet away, opened my hand, and triggered the skill. </p><p>The first time using a new skill was always weird, and it had been even more true for the fire bolt. The mana burst out of my hand, with an intensity I could have never imagined. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>I tensed even as I felt the mana take shape in my hand, rotating and transforming in a complicated pattern that I couldn’t begin to understand. I had already assumed that the mana blow was complicated. Watching my mana reshape under the control of the skill was nothing less than a true miracle. </p><p>A fire appeared from nothingness and collided against the rock with an eerie precision. </p><p>Well, at least, it was the perspective of my scientist side. </p><p>From a tactical perspective, it was just garbage. It took almost ten seconds for me to channel the spell. It consumed a truly ridiculous amount of mana, and for all of it, I had nothing to show but a projectile attack that moved slower than an ordinary arrow, which could easily be dodged. </p><p>I was glad that I hadn’t wasted a skill slot for Ice Blast the day before. </p><p>Of course, its tactical uselessness meant nothing. I could already imagine a dozen different ways I could use it for my experiments. But first, I needed to push it to the limit and see if I could glean any insights that I could apply to my sword attack. </p><p>My first instinct was to stop and see if I could modify the skill somewhat. With the perks from multiple skills allowing me to interact with mana, it felt like a worthwhile experiment to run. However, I still remembered how trying to do that with Meditation blew on my face. </p><p>“Maybe not now,” I muttered even as I searched for another monster. After a few quick takedowns followed by absorption, I was ready to cast again. A few more times, I targeted my skill at the rocks, but there had been no improvement. </p><p>Just like any other skill, it required a lot of repetition. Unfortunately, unlike other skills, every repeat required a lengthy pause as I refilled my mana. Luckily, it took less than five minutes to hunt the necessary monsters and absorb them. </p><p>Before the perks, filling my Mana reserves took closer to half an hour. </p><p>The next step was to target the monsters, but I wasn’t in a hurry to do that. I wasn’t able to even walk while trying to cast the spell, and ten seconds was too long to deal with the monsters. Instead, I stopped by my temporary forge, dropped the new batch of iron I had brought with me, and changed into the anti-corrosive set. </p><p>Even then, I didn’t attack a monster immediately, but searched for a specific opponent. </p><p>What I was looking for was one of the creatures with the ranged attack. I cleaned their immediate surroundings and used the shield to block their attack, which gave me the leisurely ten seconds I had required. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 1 -&gt; 6]</p><p>“Wow, that’s a nice jump,” I muttered. Targeting stronger monsters always helped, not to mention improving basic skills was easier than their better variants. “Now, let’s see what changed.” </p><p>Another attempt, once again targeting a ranged monster. This time, the spell gathered faster, something like eight seconds, not to mention flew faster and burned brighter. A nice range of benefits, though mostly incremental. </p><p>A few more repeats and I soon reached the improvement limit. </p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 23 -&gt; 25]</p><p>The casting time had dropped to just below five seconds, which was barely enough to attack the giant beasts. I tried that just to be on the safe side, but it didn’t go up. </p><p>It turned out that people were right about the limits of the Basic skills. Worse, there was no Perk. </p><p>A pity. An extra perk would have been useful. </p><p>Once it reached the limit, I decided to test a few other things. I wasn’t able to move while casting, because it was somewhat anchored in the air. However, my experience with the camouflage ring showed that such requirements were rather arbitrary. </p><p>But, breaking it was a mission for another time. At first, I attempted interrupting spells. It was not as hard as I feared. Nothing like the disaster reversing the meditation technique had triggered. It was easiest when I interrupted once I let out all the mana, but interrupting halfway was also safe. </p><p>It just gave me more resistance, but at this point, I was used to interrupting skills exactly when I wanted to. Three years of practice was truly useful. </p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t learn much from the way the mana moved. Despite what I had hoped, it wasn’t the exact same pattern every single time. While it had roughly the same shape, even getting a rough sense was next to impossible. </p><p>Suddenly, I understood what Maria meant by it being impossible to sketch properly. Truly, what she was able to draw was leagues more complicated than what I had been able to even comprehend. </p><p>“Alright, now I understand why they need Intelligence,” I groaned. It probably required Intelligence to direct and control the mana, which was a level of multitasking even a skill couldn’t handle alone. </p><p>Well, at least, that was my current working theory, one that I couldn’t examine one way or another. One that I wanted to push more, but could not. </p><p>The trick with the sword was far more important. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a sword technique that was anywhere close to anything I had in my forging techniques. Though, there was a chance it existed, but I wasn’t able to access it. </p><p>Another arbitrary restriction. </p><p>A spear, on the other hand, could be classified as a chisel if one squinted enough. There was no reason for it not to work. I still needed a skill, but that could be mixed with the search for the dungeon door for the next floor. All I needed was for me to slow down slightly to make sure the monsters I killed connected. It didn’t take too many small monsters to make sure every giant bug dropped a skill of Uncommon variety — which now I could distinguish thanks to a quick talk with the skill vendor. </p><p>Previously, I wasn’t able to get much information on it, with most people hiding the information. Understandable, as when I had the money to buy skills, they were still rare enough that even common ones had required connections to acquire. </p><p>And, once they started to get more common, I was poor enough to be treated as a nuisance. In that regard, my current stage showed a significant difference, in which I looked like an adventurer with a lot of money to throw around. </p><p>Of course, it was still nothing more than a reasonable hypothesis. I fired up the forge once more and started creating a multitude of different chisels, ignoring the limits set by the System. And, if at one point, those chisels had started suspiciously like short spears, it was surely an accident. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I waved around my ugly chisel made entirely of metal, with a thick wedge at the front. </p><p>“Now, all I need is to set a search pattern,” I said as I moved a while. It didn’t take long for me to realize that the density of giant monsters varied greatly based on the direction I picked. Eleanor had already mentioned that the giant ones were mostly spilling from the next floor. </p><p>“Probably the right path,” I muttered even as I shifted to my hammer, angling myself to avoid the charge of a giant monster while making sure the second one had been blocked by the first. It was challenging enough even without factoring in the ordinary monsters making things more complicated. </p><p>Luckily, the new armor was allowing me to block the corrosion attacks, or dealing with the combination of monsters would have been a messy challenge. </p><p>But, while it had been difficult, I made sure to slowly immobilize the giant ones first before it disappeared. </p><p>The reward had been equally impressive. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Swift Spear (Uncommon)]</p><p>A short but painful absorption period later, I concentrated, targeting the nearest stone, treating it as a target I needed to shape as a grindstone. The mana pattern appeared in front of it. At this point, switching between attacks was a common trick. </p><p>[Swift Spear (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 7 ]</p><p>“Marvelous.” </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 39</p><p>“And, stay down, ugly bastard,” I said even as I pushed my abomination of a spear through the skin of an even uglier giant insect monster, feeling excited and satisfied at the same time. </p><p>After all, I had just brought a skill from nothing to its limit in less than half an hour. </p><p>[Swift Spear (Uncommon) 98 -&gt; 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Fleeting Step / Charge] </p><p>“I wonder if that’s a record,” I said even as I ripped the shell of the giant monster I had taken down, and started my trek back to the forge. Now that the skill had reached its limit, I could create a more fitting weapon than the ugly monstrosity I had created to abuse the mismatch. </p><p>Just like Hammer of Might required a proper heavy-headed hammer to show its benefits, Swift Spear required something tall and with a decent elasticity to properly show its power. </p><p>While I probably couldn’t create something that would show the full potential of the technique without high-grade wood — as there was a limit to the elasticity that could be shown by a pure metal handle — I should still be able to replicate it somewhat. </p><p>However, while I was on the way, I made sure to choose a perk option, one that didn’t require even the slightest thought. Fleeting Step. </p><p>After all, I had my Hammer of Might for situations that required power, and Stalwart Guard was excellent when I needed to defend myself. Meanwhile, Swift Spear, true to its name, focused more on mobility. It wasn’t exactly my strongest suit, but considering the effort it required, I was still more than happy to take it. </p><p>Fleeting Step transformed the skill somewhat, giving me an even better ability to dance between the attacks. But, even as I tested it, I could feel that, somewhat, it was my stats that weren't supporting it properly. </p><p>My guess was that my Dexterity had been barely enough to allow me to learn it. </p><p>“Not that I’m complaining,” I groaned as I charged among a small swarm, intentionally letting them surround me, yet dodging them with ease. Not even a splatter of a ranged attack landed on me. I could have dealt with them easily, but instead, I let them attack me, while I limited myself to deflecting their mandibles. </p><p>Just because I had a skill at its limit didn’t mean that I could use it well. </p><p>The skill was fascinating, especially with Fleeting Step mixed in. It allowed me to dance among the attacks from the monsters with the elegance of a dancer. It didn’t make me run faster at longer distances, but it actually helped me to climb the cliffs and other surfaces. </p><p>I couldn’t simply climb a ninety-degree surface, but anything with a rough surface was a fair deal. If a mountain goat could climb it, I had a fair chance. “Fascinating.” Of course, in a world where people could actually fly, it wasn’t as fascinating, but that was just the reality. </p><p>It meant I could actually ditch the swarms by using the natural impediments, which was a good thing. That way, I didn’t have to kill the monsters in the first two floors, which should keep the others from getting suspicious about the lack of monsters in a certain direction. </p><p>“And, that’s not the only benefit,” I muttered as I switched weapons, and started engaging with monsters using Stalwart Guard. I had already used my lessons from the hammer technique to improve it, and when it came to it, sword and spear had much more in common regarding the fundamentals. </p><p>Which was why, the progress I had made when I  had arrived back at to forge was only to be expected. More than enough to impress Eleanor. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) - 57]</p><p>The best part was that I hadn’t even pushed it to the limit. But, for once, I decided to slow down. I wanted it to look impressive, not unbelievable. </p><p>Once I forged myself a new, seven-foot-long spear, I decided to leave everything but my hammer in my forge. Searching the gate for the next floor while running as fast as I could manage seemed like a fitting task. </p><p>One particularly great advantage I had was my Strength, allowing me to break the shell just as easily without waiting for the beast to attack. It was even a better fit for hunting on the first floor without damaging the shell as long as corrosion wasn’t a concern. </p><p>But then, without the corrosion effect, a lot of things were easier. </p><p>As I faced my next challenge — four giant monsters in one horde — I was suddenly glad that I decided to add the spear to the mix. Hammer had the necessary power to take down the beast in one hit as long as I could hit a weak spot thanks to Shattering Blow, but reaching that weak spot had been the problem. </p><p>With Fleeting Step, I could simply climb on top of them, the corrosion effect uselessly crashing against my metal greaves. </p><p>Suddenly, the fights were less like a deadly struggle, and more like an action movie. Cheating was truly fun. Once I climbed to their back, all I needed was to switch to the hammer. One blow and the giant insects died. </p><p>Too bad piling four of them together still granted me with an Uncommon skill, one that I couldn’t even use. </p><p>I had been hoping for a Rare one. </p><p>“Maybe next time,” I muttered even as I continued my dedicated dash, not even slowing down to pick up the shells or the crystals. The only thing I slowed down for was to take note of the various geographical features to prevent myself from getting lost. </p><p>No, I just wanted to find the gate, and while the density of the giant monsters had given me a direction to search, it was not exactly a compass. And, the twenty-yard vision range wasn’t exactly making it easier.</p><p>The dungeon fog — which was not a real fog but a weird energy — was a mixed blessing. Its existence was an inconvenience to be sure, but only because it was there, I had dared to set up a hidden forge. </p><p>“Finally,” I shouted in celebration when I arrived at the gate I had been searching for. Around it, there were eight giant monsters, which had been not exactly inconvenient to deal with with the trick of combining two skills at their limits. </p><p>I was able to kill all of them in under one minute. Throwing them together had been the bigger challenge. </p><p>They were not exactly small. Even with my strength, I couldn’t casually pile them. </p><p>“It’s worth it,” I said when I found a skill that had been glowing in an unfamiliar pattern. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Rare)]</p><p>I examined the skill. It was rare, yet it didn’t have any kind of qualifier. I wondered if it was something that could happen for all skills. Was there an inferior version of Mana Forge that I could get from dungeons, or was it only something that was relevant for the Nurture skill… </p><p>Frankly, it wouldn't be the first way the System discriminated against the Farmer class. </p><p>I was tempted to absorb it, but I decided not to. It was tempting, but it was far from the most urgent task I had in mind. I put it in my sack before I turned toward the next challenge I wanted to face. </p><p>The gate. </p><p>“Unto the breach once more,” I said as I took a step forward, finally ready to face the next batch. It was a risky step, one that I would have been far more reticent to take without Swift Spear and Fleeting Step. But then again, it wasn’t the first time the dungeon offered a nice solution to the problem it presented. </p><p>As I landed, the first thing that caught my attention was the mist. Not just the dungeon energy we referred to as such, but a real one, enough to make the vision even more difficult. </p><p>That meant I had no idea how many monsters I had to deal with. But, I could already count six giant monsters mixed with a true swarm. </p><p>They charged. </p><p>I jumped. </p><p>Frankly, I didn’t know what I could call the following encounter. It was a baffling mixture of boring and exciting. My conscious mind treated it as a disaster, wave after wave of insects popping out of the mist to overwhelm me, like I was in a desperate last stand. </p><p>But also, it was boring. The only thing I really paid attention to was keeping track of the death of the first monster of the pile while they routinely disappeared because I had been using them as a platform to fight rather than letting the bog close around me. </p><p>But, their disappearance was not a waste. As, without exception, they all faded into Rare skill stones. Two of them were Nurture, which I recognized without touching. The others were a mystery. However, the endless wave of attack continued, preventing me from checking it. </p><p>The monsters continued to appear endlessly, showing me the reason why Eleanor regularly cleansed the first two floors. </p><p>It was truly endless. I fought and fought, the battle slowly turning into something as routine as forging another weapon. </p><p>I would have complained if it wasn’t for a very welcome notification. </p><p>[Level 36 -&gt; 37]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 40</p><p>An hour after I had passed through the gate, after killing almost five hundred giant insect monsters, and even more smaller insects, I finally stopped pushing forward, and started to retreat. I might not be physically exhausted, but it was not true from a mental perspective. </p><p>But, being under constant siege by monsters had grown exhausting despite the relative tedium. </p><p>I wondered if it was an ordinary problem, or if it was what happened to a dungeon that had been left unattended for a long time — Eleanor explicitly mentioned that she wasn’t coming down to the fourth floor to cleanse. </p><p>However, the reason didn’t matter in the short term. Either way, it meant that I had to delay my plans to move my forge into the fourth floor. I might have to spend an even longer time than I had expected. </p><p>Still, even as I retreated back to the gate, I wasn’t feeling defeated. The incursion might have been exhausting, but it was also profitable. I was holding almost a dozen Rare skills, and even more Uncommon ones — unfortunately, all of them were either unusable for me or another copy of Nurture. </p><p>Then, there was the other, even more concrete benefit. </p><p>[Level 37 -&gt; 38]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>And, they were not the only discoveries. Some of the rocks I touched reacted to my Forge talent. They contained iron. It wasn’t dense enough to make it worth my while to collect it. Even the richest rock had an iron content of barely more than five percent, which meant that collecting and processing them would have taken a lot of time even if I wasn’t attacked by monsters every second.</p><p>The trick with the carts was far more efficient. Still, it was always pleasant to have an alternative path. Also, it was convenient enough that I didn’t need to go back to the forge or destroy a part of my weapon to forge a large bucket, bringing water and soil samples together. </p><p>The main objective was to test it for forging, to see whether it could be used for quenching the weapons I forged to cool down, freeing me from the need to use mana to compensate. But, that was not the only purpose I had in mind for it. </p><p>I wanted to test its effect on Nurture as well, which was why I didn’t scoop just water, but also the mulch from the bottom. Considering how the other materials worked, it was worth a try. </p><p>It was not a suggestion from my skill that led me to that decision, but my common sense. Well, that, and the memory of my considerable success, using silver and gold to push my Forge skill higher. There was no reason it wouldn’t work on Nurture. </p><p>It wasn’t the first experiment I did. I had already tried that with a half-dead cutting, but the constant corrosion effect had destroyed it before I could even start my experiment. Luckily, it didn’t affect flesh. </p><p>“Now, let’s try it,” I muttered even as I dug a small pit, and put a palm-full of mulch and water. Then, I followed up by putting another cutting, ready to fill it with Health through Nurture. </p><p>It failed. </p><p>“Alright. Even that’s too much,” I muttered. This time, I decided to reverse the direction slightly. I put another cutting into the ground and flooded it with Health until it started showing signs of growth. </p><p>[-182 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 5 -&gt; 6] </p><p>Once again, a wasteful burst, barely able to turn the cutting into a sapling. But that was the fate of experimenting. I reached into my pocket, ready to take a concentrated food pill … only to find they had been already destroyed by the corrosive attacks. “Alright, that was an oversight,” I muttered. I hadn’t expected it to work that way. </p><p>The leather pouch survived, but the signs of degradation were still obvious. </p><p>However, the map I created had been destroyed as well. </p><p>Luckily, my memory was still fresh, and I was confident I could go back without being touched, or I would have been in big, big trouble. </p><p>It looked like moving to the fourth floor wouldn’t have been as easy as I had expected. </p><p>However, without the ability to refresh my Health, I needed to stop my plans of pushing Nurture to its limit. “One last experiment,” I muttered even as I took a drop of water, and put it in the roots. The small sapling had immediately started wilting. </p><p>I put my hand to its surface. A flood of Health counteracted the corrosion. When it ended, the sapling was slightly taller. Not enough to be worth … in terms of growth. </p><p>[-133 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 6 -&gt; 9] </p><p>Increasing the skill was a far more valuable benefit. “A note, bring a lot of food to replenish health tomorrow,” I said, curious about how far I could push Nurture here, and whether it could grow a small woodland for me to actually benefit from it. </p><p>Also, it was finally nice to discover a trick to improve Nurture. Disseminating it alone would solve a lot of problems Farmers faced. I just needed to find a way to spread that without ending up being assassinated. </p><p>Or, one that would trigger a bloody labor dispute. Empowering workers and lower classes historically had been a bloody affair, and that was before the people with power had the ability to cut metal and summon lightning. </p><p>No, it required a lot of finesse. </p><p>“I know what I will be experimenting on tonight,” I said. I had turned the bucket into an anti-corrosion metal, but I made sure to cover it with a more ordinary alloy. </p><p>From outside, it looked like an ordinary water can, which meant, no one would pay attention to it. It was important. While bringing some water samples was not wrong, it would also reveal that I had gone deep enough to reach the fourth floor. </p><p>I still stopped by my forge and buried it with a layer of dirt to keep its presence a secret, and left my other set there, including my spear. However, while I did that, I still broke a thick stick of wood and roughly shaped it until the System started to treat it as a spear. </p><p>Fleeting Step would be useful for getting out of the dungeon. </p><p>Running full speed without slowing down, it didn’t take long for me to reach the gate to the first floor. Just to be on the safe side, I spent ten minutes hunting, collecting enough broken shells to fill the cart, enough not to be suspicious. </p><p>“It’s such a pity,” I muttered even as I examined the broken shells. I would have received more than twenty gold for them if they were not broken. However, I didn’t have the ability to remove them without causing damage. Even if I had, carefully removing it would have been too challenging. </p><p>“What if I create a small device for it,” I muttered, my mind already working on how to do it. The skill didn’t have any such plan, because it didn’t include any device with moving parts, but as long as I come up with a working design, it should be doable to make a hand-powered device, maybe one with a simple crank and multiple blades… </p><p> On the way back, I chatted with the guards. When I arrived back at my temporary residence, however, I didn’t start playing with it. While I had a general idea, I didn’t know how long it would take to create a working copy. </p><p>Or, even if I could. </p><p>As much as I was tempted, pushing Nurture to the next stage was a better idea. </p><p>I once again picked three pots, one with an herb from the dungeon, and two others. While I made the preparations, I ate a quick meal, which replenished my Health, even faster than I had been used to. Still, it took time. </p><p>The first result from the experiment, using the water from the fourth floor made the dungeon herb react. That alone was an interesting output, showing that it was possible to grow those plants outside the dungeon. </p><p>Whether it was worth the effort was a completely different thing. The empirical result was … underwhelming. Meanwhile, even a small drop of it had been enough to kill the other two plants, and Nurture was not enough to save them. </p><p>“Progress,” I said still. In the next step, I used some of the materials I had prepared for forging, mixing them with a drop of swamp water. I didn’t have to work hard or think, because my experiment methodology was essentially a rough version of my anti-corrosion material experiment. </p><p>Some of them, I even flooded with my mana to see if it helped. That, it didn’t. I continued to experiment. </p><p>Was it absurd to try and make a fertilizer almost the same way I tried to prepare an alloy? It certainly should have been … but an hour into the experiment, I was looking at an empty water bottle and a dozen herbs with various states of growth, which disagreed with the absurdity of my methodology. </p><p>What I had managed to make was more of a poison than a fertilizer. It was certainly not worth the effort from any productivity angle. </p><p>But, from a System enhancement angle, it was a completely different story. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) - 34] </p><p>Amusingly, I had a feeling that what really improved the skill was not the growth aspect, but the poison aspect, while curing it pushed the skill higher. Unfortunately, the water I had brought with me was gone, preventing me from experimenting further. </p><p>I needed to return to the fourth floor for more material first. </p><p>Luckily, I had a lot of other things to do … including my first prototype of a shell removal machine. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 31</p><p>After killing another three hundred monsters — half with their shells ripped, half left intact — I had received three rewards, with ascending importance. I had collected six skill stones. I had reached level thirty-five. </p><p>And, I gathered enough data to reinforce the idea that the intact monsters had a higher likelihood of dropping a skill stone. I received two stones from the first group, and four from the second. It could still be a coincidence, but the numbers were still reliable. </p><p>At the same time, I noticed that whenever a skill stone appeared, the glow had been slightly brighter. “Let’s try something else,” I muttered even as I found another small group. This time, when I killed them, I made sure to pile their corpses together. </p><p>I expected them to disappear in sequence, but ten of them had disappeared at the same time, leaving a skill stone behind. “I wonder if that's a coincidence.”</p><p>It turned out that, it was not. Whenever I piled at least ten monsters together, there was always at least one skill stone. Even better, they were not exclusively basic, and there had been some common mixed, but the results were tempting. I wanted to try increasing the number, but there was a limit to the number I could pile alone. </p><p>The moment the first one reached the time limit, they all disappeared together. </p><p>For that, I needed to go deeper. </p><p>“I’m probably trying to discover something that’s already known,” I pondered even as I moved farther away, not even bothering to bring back the shells I collected. Instead, I just demolished them to replenish my mana as an insurance. </p><p>With an uncommon skill maximized, I wasn’t afraid of the risks of the first floor, but that was not an excuse to be careless. </p><p>This time, I didn’t stop until I found an even bigger swarm. The mist prevented me from counting the full numbers, but their distribution pattern suggested that there were at least five hundred of them. “At least another level,” I muttered, but I didn’t attack them directly. Instead, I searched for a nice, defensible spot with a solid rock behind me. </p><p>There were two reasons for it. Fighting without worrying about attacks from behind was more fitting to my style. And, with the monsters attacking en masse, I didn’t need to waste any effort piling them together. </p><p>Once that was done, I went to attack the first one. The swarm reacted as one, chasing me to the spot I had picked. What followed was a man against a thousand monsters, a daring and incredible fight … or, at least, it should have been. </p><p>Instead, it was no different than repairing a hundred swords at once. Interesting trick, but once it was discovered, the process was almost routine. Mostly, I dealt with them using the standard Mana Blow trick, and whenever the numbers turned tricky, I relied fully on skills, Shattering Blow easily solving the trouble. </p><p>I just needed to let out a point of mana to prevent the backlash from damaging my hammer. </p><p>In the end, I killed almost a thousand monsters, yet gained merely one level, showing that I was already reaching the limits in terms of gaining a level. I doubted that I would be able to gain even one more level today. </p><p>However, I didn’t care about that, and collected the skill stones. I had another fifteen skill stones in hand. Most of it, I wasn’t able to properly read. But what I had received from the largest pile I had managed to gather — thirty-eight insects — had already reinforced my assumption. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Uncommon)]</p><p>I wondered if there were any uncommon skills in the mix. Too bad I wasn’t able to read most of them. I decided to keep them separate and ask Maria later. Better safe than sorry. </p><p>However, the Nurture skill, I absorbed. I had no reason not to. Unlike common skills, I already knew that uncommon ones could grant a perk, and as long as I act creatively, I should be able to raise it to its limit and get a Perk. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) - 1]</p><p>And, while having a combat perk was convenient, it didn’t fascinate me as much as getting another trick that relied on production skills. The synergy possibilities were incredible. </p><p>Assuming, of course, I could make it work. </p><p>Curious about how it would go, I moved to one of the rare half-dead thorny plants, and put my hand on it. I felt a familiar energy move inside me, and went through my finger. It was a subtle feeling, one that I would have missed if I hadn’t been playing around with my Vitality for the last three years. </p><p>To my shame, I was not making any progress. The best trick I had been able to discover was to imbue my blood with Health, which only came useful due to sheer coincidence. I never even thought about acquiring a Nurture skill to test. </p><p>Mostly because, up until I had combined Forge and Repair, I hadn’t even thought about using skills to improve each other. </p><p>Sometimes, all it took was a new look to a paradigm shift to open a completely new path. </p><p>As I used Nurture, I could feel my Health moving in a smoothness I could never replicate even as it departed my finger and disappeared into the plant. I repeated multiple times, wasting some of my Health, all without getting any feedback other than the leaves getting greener. </p><p>[-92 Health]</p><p>“That’s enough experimentation,” I said even as I left the plant behind. I wasn’t annoyed with my lack of success, as it was only the first impression. It wasn’t even a proper failure. The talk I had given Eleanor was not just for show. </p><p>I was used to tangling with a complicated problem for months without getting a result, persisting. “Looking back, it was the mistake that led me stuck in that dead end job for three years, ignoring the obvious,” I pondered. I was so used to succeeding when I had put my mind into it, I didn’t even bother working for the alternative path even as I decided to join the budding research organizations. </p><p>Though, I wondered what my old therapist would say. Maybe something about unhealthy focus on achievements, or something about seeking comfort in familiarity in face of disaster. </p><p>“Maybe one day, I’ll learn,” I muttered, wondering if she was alive. A thought that I abandoned once I started killing monsters once again, but with a twist. </p><p>This time, I focused on using the sword. Technically, it was a good piece of equipment, because it stunted my performance significantly. In three hours, I could kill at least three thousand with the hammer, maybe more if I was lucky and find a larger swarm, which would give me not only enough materials to keep going for a long time, but also help me gain at least another level or two, even with the rapidly lessening effect of the weaker monsters. </p><p>However, it wasn’t worth the suspicion it would generate. I couldn’t show an incredible improvement in both techniques during the same day. Showing off my sword skill was not the safer option, but there were certain advantages. </p><p>Like asking her some questions on how to use a sword. Even if she didn’t have the ability to use mana, she still had at least a Rare skill. Any insight she provided might help me improve my second skill even further. </p><p>Also, I had to admit, trying to come up with new ways to deal with the giant insects was more fun than I had expected. I was getting more and more used to weaponizing my shield, and I had the advantage in pure strength as long as I didn’t just try to tank their charge. </p><p>A few shield bashes put them in an unbalanced state, slowing their attack, giving me the chance to deliver a killing blow. </p><p>The only problem with the style was the weapon degradation. It damaged them far more than the method the others had been using. Considering the price and rarity of the ingots that were used for repairs, I would have been operating at a loss even without factoring in the taxes and various expenses. </p><p>However, not caring about making ends meet was truly a luxury. I just repaired them directly while using ingots. I didn’t even need to start a fire, just used mana directly to merge the alloy ingots with the shield and the sword. </p><p>Raising Mana Repair over sixty had opened up a lot of new opportunities. Of course, I still pulled several bushes and set a small fire, just enough to mislead Eleanor. </p><p>I could have repaired them even without using the material I brought along, but that would have required a real fire, intense enough to soften the metal so I could infuse it with mana once again, which was not exactly easy to set up. </p><p>A smirk appeared on my face as I imagined myself in the dungeon, with a huge forge setup, swatting monsters and repairing weapons. A nice dream, but a little bit too noticeable for my taste.</p><p>I continued killing monsters while practicing the skill, but I only managed to gain four more points, showing that I had already depleted the benefits from my other combat skill. So, halfway, I changed focus and started trying to figure out how to use mana attacks. </p><p>Though, once I depleted my mana, I stopped. Eleanor might return early, and I didn’t want to get caught playing with Mana. I still didn’t know if she could use — or at least sense — mana, but until I was sure, I would go around with empty mana reserves. </p><p>I didn’t have any success, but toward the end, I managed to time it perfectly to at least protect the sword. It was probably useless, as anyone that could use mana would have been targeting more profitable dungeons. While this dungeon had been a source of fortune for me, ultimately, it wasn’t really anything worthwhile in the grand scale. </p><p>Or, they wouldn’t have used it as a tool for a bet. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 32</p><p>Eleanor arrived as I was in the middle of another fight. She walked toward me rather than running, but I could see her freeze for a moment even as I fought against the monster, throwing it around easily. </p><p>It was hard to pinpoint the skill level without some direct tests, but a rough guess was far easier. Even a conservative estimate would put that over thirties. I said nothing as she approached, stabbing the monster through its mouth after a fight that lasted about half a minute. </p><p>“Wow, incredible performance,” she said. I was surprised, not by her words, but her smile. It was the first time I saw her lips stretching that much. “How did you pull that off?” </p><p>I smiled, curious if I could leverage it for another advantage, but in the end, I decided to stick to the familiar excuse. While revealing what was possibly a secret rankled me, I was almost certain that it was common knowledge for people at her level. </p><p>There was no way the whole world had missed something that straightforward for three years. “A little luck, a little skill,” I replied. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m sure you noticed that a skill improves faster if someone has been more competent if they were familiar with the subject,” I said. </p><p>“Of course,” she said as she shifted her stance. “You can’t believe how glad I am for picking fencing as a hobby even before the Cataclysm,” she said, her sword shifting to a familiar stance, yet lacking the smoothness of a skill. </p><p>It might be the first real personal information I had from her. </p><p>“Exactly, that’s the part of the reason I improved quickly,” I said. </p><p>“Really, you did fencing as well?” she said. </p><p>“No, but I had visited my fair share of renaissance fairs, jousting and playing fake knight,” I said. She frowned, clearly not finding it reasonable. Not a problem, as that was just there for a later stage, when others failed to copy. “Though, the real benefit had been forging,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, looking confused. </p><p>“Swinging a hammer for three years taught me a lot about how to swing heavy objects the best way, especially with my Hammer of Might as a template,” I said even as I used a shield attack. It was an aggressive downward swing, one that was most similar to the movement of a hammer. </p><p>“I see, clever,” she said, but I could see her smile fading to a look of boredom. She was not really interested in it. Understandable, as what I had revealed would only be effective for beginning. Three years ago, it would have been extremely valuable, but currently, there were easier ways to increase skills. </p><p>Like finding a dungeon that fitted well with the skill before starting to kill, like the insect monsters and the hammer skill. </p><p>“Of course, I still managed to raise it to forty-five. Even with the similarities, it should mean that I have a talent for the sword,” I added, curious whether it would make her interested. Her earlier reaction convinced me that it was a safe move. </p><p>“Forty-five, in eight hours? Impressive,” she said even as she raised her sword. “Let’s see how good you are. Defend yourself.” </p><p>With that, she dashed forward. She was faster than I had expected, but not enough to keep me from pulling down my shield to parry her attack. I drew my sword as well, defending myself under her repeated attacks, getting faster and faster. </p><p>I didn’t hold back. I couldn’t, not when I had to act reflexively. She started moving faster, her hits getting harder and harder. “You’re relying on blocking too much,” she said as she moved her sword faster than I had expected. </p><p>If she had been aiming for my neck, it would have killed me. Health was useful, but it didn’t cure decapitation. Instead, she aimed for the center of my shield, trying to push me back. She succeeded, and I stumbled back. </p><p>“Interesting, you’re better than I had expected,” she muttered, then her eyes widened. “Of course, double Strength. It pairs really well with Stalwart Guard.” </p><p>“Probably,” I said. “It’s really good for a blacksmith. With it, I’m confident I can defend myself longer against the next assassination.” </p><p>“Good to have confidence, but don’t overestimate yourself, nor underestimate any opponent,” she said even as she attacked again. This time, rather than trying to break my guard, she moved around me. It took three attacks for her to press her sword against my throat. </p><p>“Noted,” I said, making a show of gulping in fear. I already knew that she could kill me easily, but showing some fear was not a bad idea if it would make her feel better. </p><p>After all, she still controlled my experimental budget. </p><p>“Put on your helmet and follow me,” she said. She started walking, and I followed her. “So, did you manage to collect enough for your experiments?” </p><p>“Enough for three days, maybe a week if I try to be conservative,” I said. </p><p>“Really?” she asked as she looked at the cart, which had been filled with a lot of broken shells. </p><p>“I can stretch it further, of course, but it’ll slow down the experiment,” I replied. “Instead of that, why shouldn’t I return tomorrow for another collection.” </p><p>“I can’t ferry you with me. I only visit the dungeon once every five days to clean the lower levels to prevent an overrun.” </p><p>“You don’t have to. There’s teams moving between the dungeon and the town constantly, right?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, once every four hours,” she said. “It’s mostly to transport the gains.”</p><p>“And, would it be suspicious if a guild representative assigned his house while he tested the dungeon? We can even move the forge there,” I said. She looked reluctant. Understandable after the assassination attempt. </p><p>Luckily, I had already seen that she wasn’t very happy with Maria spending time with me for some reason. “And, that way, I won’t be living in the same building with Lady Maria. It’s improper,” I said. </p><p>“Good point, but I don’t have time to arrange a new residence,” she said. “We’ll say that you’re going to stay as a guest in the main building. I’ll set up a new place before Lady Maria returns.” </p><p>“Just make sure that we have an excuse to bring in and out a lot of materials,” I said. </p><p>”Don’t be too greedy,” she warned. </p><p>“I’m not,” I said. I was being greedy, of course, but it was not a good idea to say it. “But, while the other blacksmiths learn how to repair faster, I might still need to repair swords. If I have a way, your job will be easier,” I said. </p><p>“Good point,” she admitted again. </p><p>I was tempted to give her some more ideas, but I could see that I had already pushed her to the limit. “If you don’t mind my asking: Why do you have to come here every five days?” I said. </p><p>She looked at me, surprised. “You know what a dungeon overrun is,” she said. </p><p>“Yes. It’s what happens when a dungeon is left unattended too much, and the gate breaks,” I said. </p><p>“It also happens between floors,” she explained. If the bottom floors left to grow, sooner or later, monsters burst out. </p><p>“I see. That sounds dangerous,” I said. “But, why don't the guards clean the lower floors? Is it that dangerous?” </p><p>“Not particularly,” she said. “It’s just inconvenient.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“The second floor is similar to the first, but it has two differences. The vision range is merely forty yards, and there’s a second kind of insect with a ranged attack.” </p><p>“Is it deadly?” I asked. </p><p>“No. It doesn’t hurt the skin,” said. “However, it damages the weapons and armors significantly. A lot of families tried various combinations, but it’s still unprofitable. The lack of mana makes things too hard,” she said. </p><p>My mind already went to the corrosion resistant material I could make based on the Rare recipe. Suddenly, that had turned even more valuable. I decided to keep it a secret. </p><p>“How about the other floors?” </p><p>“The third one is even worse. The mist is even thicker, and there are occasional giant insects that are even more dangerous.” </p><p>“I’m guessing that they are worth more.” </p><p>“Yes. They go for a gold, but it doesn’t matter,” she said. “They are not common enough to make their hunting profitable, but still strong enough to kill anyone unprepared. A bad combination.” </p><p>“How about the fourth floor?” I asked. “Or are there only three floors?” </p><p>“No, there are at least four floors,” she said. </p><p>“What do you mean, at least?” </p><p>“Because it’s not a desert but a bog, constantly rotting weapons and armor. Even high level weapons would be damaged by it.” </p><p>“Really, is there no way to resist?” I asked. </p><p>“Not any that makes any financial sense,” she said. “It would have been different if the dungeon granted any rare skill, but it’s not worth it. Rare Nurture would have been useful, but the dungeon is too weak to grant anything above basic in a default state. It’s not worth the effort to get the Rare variant.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought. Her words implied that my trick of piling the monsters together was well known trick. That, or they had better methods to do the same. Either way, it didn’t really matter. I decided to ask another question. She was in a good mood after I had displayed my sword skill, and I didn’t want to waste it. </p><p>“How about the risk of overrun?” I asked. “What if there are even bigger monsters?” </p><p>“Not a risk,” she said. “Even if there are stronger monsters, they would first fill the third and second floors. I would catch them long before they reach the first one,” she explained. </p><p>She had just confirmed that no one would go down to the fourth floor because it would be a waste. Not for me, not with my corrosion-immune alloy. </p><p>Suddenly, I was glad that I kept my shut about the possibilities. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 33</p><p>“Do you think anyone would recognize you?” she asked. </p><p>“I don’t think so,” I said. “To their knowledge, the blacksmith you brought along is already dead. And, I didn’t interact with many people. As long as my beard grows a bit more, no one should.” </p><p>“Good,” she said. “Then, we’re going to register you as a guild representative of that wretched woman.” </p><p>“Rosie?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes. Her guild is already registered here?” </p><p>My eyes widened. While Broken Tankard had always been a very good business, Rosie had never shown an interest in establishing a guild. The sudden change was interesting, but not entirely in a good way. Eleanor and Maria were dangerous on a battlefield, but the same wasn’t true for anything else. </p><p>Rosie was much sharper. Keeping things secret from her would be far more difficult even without being in her employ. </p><p>Guilds were weird entities. Their exact legal standing differed from town to town, especially since every town operated independently, at least when practical matters were concerned. It meant that the legal system was long gone, and disputes were handled in an informal manner. </p><p>Our town, for example, had something similar to an elder's council, where respectable — meaning strong or rich — citizens took collective decisions. I hadn’t interacted with them much, but I had observed the decisions they took. </p><p>More often than not, those decisions showed that they were more than happy to treat the guilds as independent entities, accepting the way they disciplined their members as long as it wasn’t too excessive; and their definition of excessive didn’t exactly match with mine. </p><p>No, I didn’t want to suddenly put myself under the authority of Rosie. </p><p>Technically, I did that with Maria — and indirectly, Eleanor — but it was a mere business relationship. I had no doubt that, if I taught their blacksmiths about how to repair fast before disappearing, they would just wish me luck. </p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” I said. “If I work for her, she could easily find out everything I bring out.” She looked at me suspiciously, probably about the fact that Rosie had introduced me. </p><p>“Really? Didn’t you work for her?” Eleanor asked, surprised. “Don’t you trust her?” </p><p>“No, I worked with her,” I said, quick to highlight the difference. I realized that Eleanor assumed the relationship between me and Rosie was more similar to hers with Maria. Knowing Rosie, it was something she implied, but never openly said. </p><p> “She isn’t my employer, but a business partner. I had purchased her services many times before I … fell to hard times. I trust her as a business partner, but it doesn’t mean I want to declare my loyalty to her,” I said. “Oaths of fealty are serious things.” </p><p>They were not, but Eleanor was clearly more inclined to that feudal mode of thinking. I wondered if it was the impact of hanging around people with Charisma, or just the natural inclination of seeing a new order in chaos. </p><p>Either way, one good thing about living in a small town, people with Charisma didn’t deign to live in such a small place. </p><p>“Of course, loyalty is a serious thing,” she said. “But, that means we don’t have an easy solution.” </p><p>“Don’t we?” I said. “With the guards gone, I’m sure you’re interacting with a lot of new guilds. Register me under a new one,” I said. </p><p>“Really, you have a Guild Mark?” she said. </p><p>It didn’t feel like a random question. “What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s an item that drops from the dungeon, like skill stones. It allows guild members to connect,” she said. </p><p>“Really? I never heard of them,” I said. “And, I’m pretty sure the ones in our town don't have any.” </p><p>“It has a lot of benefits while operating in a dungeon,” she said, then paused. </p><p>From the way she paused, I could see that she didn’t know about those benefits either. So, I didn’t bother asking more. “I’m guessing it’s not exactly cheap?” </p><p>She chuckled. “Of course not. You need to destroy a dungeon to acquire one. I didn’t even hear of one being sold.” She paused again. “Actually, I’m not even sure they can be sold.” </p><p>“Then, I’m sure that, as the commander of the camp, you can arrange an unofficial guild for me, and I’ll be the leader.” </p><p>She paused, thinking. “Alright, but only temporarily. I won’t let you get everything you want just because you can repair weapons.” </p><p>“How about this: I’ll do my best to train the blacksmiths for you like I promised, and in the meanwhile, do my best to handle the overflow. You just need to arrange the delivery for the guild hall secretly until the training is complete, so I won’t get assassinated. And in exchange, you’ll arrange a guild hall that I can use both as a forge and a small team. You won’t have to fund my experiments going forward, and, after three months, I’ll start paying rent just like any other guild.” </p><p>She looked surprised. “Are you sure? Even without a Guild Mark, establishing a guild is a serious thing. It feels sudden.” </p><p>It was, but only because I didn’t actually expect her to allow it. Letting a guild to be established in town, even a budding, troubled one like their camp was a serious affair. She must have been even more impressed by my fighting ability than I assumed. </p><p>Every other time I asked anything, she had been acting like I was begging for free food. But now, she was actually treating me as a peer. </p><p>“Alright. I’ll even give your guild one person access for a month, but you have to pay tax like everyone. Take it as a gift from me. But, if you want to expand your guild, you have to join the weekly bidding like any other guild.” </p><p>“Sounds fair,” I said. </p><p>“And, I’ll take the forge away the moment the other blacksmiths arrive. We don’t have a spare. You have to source your own equipment.” </p><p>“Tough, but manageable,” I said. “But, I still need to use it occasionally to experiment.” </p><p>“Only if you’re willing to pay rent and mix in with the other blacksmiths,” she said. </p><p>“What about the supply risk?” I asked. </p><p>“I thought about it, and I don’t think it’s an acceptable risk,” she said. A sudden change. She must have realized that I had exaggerated the risk to get more material. </p><p>Admittedly, she would be right. I didn’t think they would have tried to assassinate me if they could cut supply. </p><p>It would have scared me before visiting the dungeon. But, now that I had a better understanding of what was going on inside of the dungeon, I was confident that utilizing forged corrosion-resistant equipment was more profitable than importing mana alloys. </p><p>If I played my hand right, I would make enough money to fund my experiments. And, the best part, I was doing something that would benefit them. </p><p>I just needed to make some serious progress beforehand. </p><p>“Fair,” I said. </p><p>“You must be really confident that you can find a way to invent a new material,” she said. </p><p> It was a reasonable suspicion. “Fifty-fifty,” I said. “Of course, I’ll be willing to sell it to you for a reasonable price. Maybe for permanent access spots?” I asked. </p><p>“Sure. We’ll discuss it based on the material’s performance,” she said. “As long as it doesn’t cost more than double, I’m willing to pay for it.” </p><p>As I followed her, we started talking about other formalities, which I could handle easily. I had managed too many projects as a professor to be slowed down by little details. </p><p>However, the more I discussed, the more I realized her opinion about the new alloy I promised to develop. She was certain that I could actually develop it — which was true — but she also had very strict assumptions about its limits. </p><p>Since it was not provided by the System, it had to be strictly inferior. </p><p>That approach irked me, but I wasn’t in a hurry to change her mind about it, and ruin her mood in the process. Since she believed that I was certain to succeed, she could have insisted that developing an alloy for them was a part of the contract, and I couldn’t sell. </p><p>Her goodwill was valuable. It was also the reason I was pushing things at an uncomfortable pace. I didn’t want to miss this opportunity like I had done before. All it would take was another dungeon drop with some stupid new enchantment to ruin my budding business, and I needed to make some money beforehand. </p><p>Of course, while I wanted to make money, it wasn’t the only reason. After everything I had discovered, having a space that truly belonged to me was vital. </p><p>Important enough to push some limits and look suspicious. Luckily, I had excuses in place to distract others from my real secrets. Maria had helped me level up, and Eleanor provided me with multiple valuable skills. Together, they went a long way to explain any casual questions people might have, especially since no one had any reason to interrogate them about the details. </p><p>There were still some risks, but those were acceptable. </p><p>So, I said very little once I stood behind Eleanor while handling the registration details. Though, my eyes widened when I learned when they were purchasing the undamaged shells for only two silver. </p><p>I expected a hefty cut, but that still surprised me. </p><p>“You can always not sell and bring them to the System Store yourself,” she countered mockingly. She had a point. They had to be transferred by a caravan, and the nearest System Store was almost two weeks away. “Just one silver,” she said, then added. “Even if they are broken.” </p><p>It worked for me as well. After all, I wasn’t planning to bring most of them out in the first place. </p><p>Still, it was a successful trip. Not just in terms of gains, but it actually made Eleanor warm up to me. And, that meant I could actually do a lot more than I was initially planning. </p><p>I couldn’t help but appreciate the irony. I had so much to offer, but the two greatest opportunities I had gotten in this Post-Cataclysm world had nothing to with it. Maria helped me far more than necessary because I was good enough to entertain her playing chess, and Eleanor was impressed by the rapid improvement of my sword skills. </p><p>I didn’t expect to end up like one of those useless rich kids that only got the job because they played golf with the CEO. </p><p>Life was unpredictable. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 34</p><p>“This is your new house,” Eleanor said. “You have until the return of the caravan to make it a livable place and move here permanently.” </p><p>“Beautiful place, very airy,” I said teasingly. Not an unfair comment, considering I was standing in front of an empty stretch surrounded by a thin wooden rail. I needed to build a building from scratch. I deemed two of my new home’s details to be the most important. </p><p>The first thing was the location. It was outside the walls. However, it was neither a slight nor a revenge attempt. At a distance, I could see a secondary wall building. Apparently, once the caravans arrived, they wanted to push anyone that wasn’t directly employed by them to an outer town, which was a common practice. </p><p>Reasonable as well. While mana dead locations were not as valuable, a large dungeon was still enough to vitalize the place, especially since the loot could be sold directly for silver. There was less potential, but also less danger. I was sure there would be people who would appreciate the opportunity. </p><p>The second, even more shocking thing was the size of the compound that had been given to me. It was larger than I had expected. A large rectangle, almost ten thousand square-feet. </p><p>“You have my trust that you can make a nice place,” she said. “I already asked workers to build a small wooden cottage with a stone cellar in addition to a wall around the compound. The rest is up to you.” </p><p>Another benefit of impressing her with my sword skills, I guessed. “Sure, as long as you keep the fact that I’m a blacksmith a secret. I don’t want to lose my head to another assassin,” I said. </p><p>“Sure, we can say that you’re a Fighter. You certainly fight well enough to be one,” she said. “Since it’s our town, no one would check it. Still, just in case, don’t walk around too much until we have other blacksmiths with your quick repair trick.” </p><p>“Yes. And, as long as I wear a helmet while teaching, everything will be fine,” I said. Maybe it was excessive, but one assassination attempt had done wonders to make me a more paranoid man. Luckily, the conditions of the attempt had been rare enough that it shouldn’t be replicated even if my fake death had been discovered. </p><p>They couldn’t simply send another combatant as capable as Eleanor immediately, and anyone weaker would be relying on an invisibility trick, unaware that I could see them. </p><p>No one would expect me to have Essence stat. </p><p>With that done, we returned to the part of the town that wasn’t under construction. “Are you going to go to the dungeon tomorrow as well?” she asked. </p><p>“I plan to,” I replied. </p><p>“Make sure to rest well, then. Dungeon visits can be surprisingly exhausting.” </p><p>“Fair point,” I said, but once I arrived at my temporary residence, I headed straight to the forge. </p><p>Once I had returned from the dungeon, I immediately started working. I had three immediate objectives, sorted from the most exciting to least. Playing around with Nurture, practicing Meditation, and forging myself two new sets of tools. </p><p>I started with the least exciting option. Forging two sets of new tools. The bigger set was for my own forge, made of iron alloys. Not many blacksmiths could make them, but some could. Most blacksmiths had to make do with such equipment, unable to afford anything better.</p><p>Of course, I had plans of making something more impressive, made of mana alloys, but if I did that right now, Eleanor would rightfully assume that I had used her stock — which was better than the truth. I still needed to build a proper fire pit and some other stuff. </p><p>But, an anvil, and hammers of varying sizes, and metal tongs were critical. </p><p>Still, I had four days to forge them. I did not finish them as soon as possible, because they were here as a cover for the second, more portable set. One to be hidden in the dungeon. </p><p>Eleanor already suspected that I had made progress with anti-corrosion material, and she might actually decide to check my things, even after I moved to my new residence. </p><p>My solution was simple: Just build a forge on the second floor of the dungeon. </p><p>Her explanation was clear, no one would be there, and as long as I picked a nice concealed spot, no one would really discover it. It wouldn’t be a complicated, fancy forge, but I don’t need anything complicated. I could simply use mana to bypass some of the requirements. </p><p>Once that was done, I moved to the next topic: meditation. </p><p>During my dungeon trip, the thing that slowed me down the most was my Mana reserve. Draining  Mana from monsters had been the slowest part of the process. It had been bad enough while fighting, and it would slow me even more once I started to forge mana alloys. </p><p>It would be even more important once I got a skill for magic. But, I wanted to start practicing with a fire spell. That way, even if it turned useless in every other way, I could still use it for smithing. </p><p>“Now, let’s start,” I muttered even as I smashed the first shell, absorbing it greedily. </p><p>[+2 Mana]</p><p>Then, I reversed the flow, pushing it out. </p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>“Not bad. Let’s try to increase the intensity,” I muttered to myself, curious if I could trigger the growth by using more. However, I didn’t dare to. I still remembered how much damage one mana could cause. I didn’t want to lose control and end up dead. </p><p>Instead, I repeated the same trick again and again, going through all the shells. Luckily, it was not a waste, as the broken pieces could be eventually used for anti-corrosion alloy.</p><p>Twenty minutes and almost three hundred points of Mana later, another notification appeared. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 42 -&gt; 43]</p><p>“Excellent,” I said, and continued practicing, ignoring the temptation to pull and release more mana. As long as I could bring Meditation to the next threshold before morning, it was enough. I wanted to have Efficient Absorption at a minimum. </p><p>It was already dawn when I finally reached my target. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 49 -&gt; 50]</p><p>[Perk Options — Efficient Absorption / Augmented Flow / Purification] </p><p>“Thank god that Perk Reset stones exist,” I said even as I looked at the unexpected third entry. After spending all night trying to absorb mana from monsters, I was almost entirely sure that Purification referred to the act of isolating that excess energy from monster mana. </p><p>I picked that. </p><p>“Jackpot,” I muttered after I broke another shell. Previously, draining the mana from a destroyed alloy was almost four times faster than draining it from the broken shell. Draining from monsters was still slower, but this time, it was a far more reasonable difference. About twenty percent, I guessed. A more accurate assessment required several experiments. </p><p>“Too bad I have very little time left to test my new skill,” I muttered. I only had half an hour before the first group left the town for the dungeon, and I wanted to join them. While understanding how Nurture worked was important, it wasn’t as important as trying to set up a second forge in the depths of the dungeon. </p><p>An idea that had only appeared in my mind because monsters didn’t attack abandoned objects as long as they didn’t block their path, as proven by the cart I brought not getting damaged. </p><p>“Later,” I decided even as I looked at three objects that were in front of me. A seed, a broken branch, and a small herb from the dungeon I brought along, each in a separate pot. </p><p>First, I put my hand on the broken branch, and started feeding it with Nurture. As my Health started to slowly disappear, the leaves of the broken branch began regaining their green, but that had been the full extent of the change.</p><p>[-16 Health]</p><p>I continued to feed it, feeling that I could still push, curious of the change. I pushed more and more. And the branch stirred while a small root grew into the vase. The skill was controlling the movement of the Health, which moved in an incredible, impossible to understand pattern. </p><p>I couldn’t even begin to comprehend the movement, and I couldn’t use Inspect to compensate for it either. After all, it was not made of metal, and the System didn’t trigger, no matter how much I tried. </p><p>[-184 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 2 ]</p><p>“Not bad.” While I hadn’t thought about using Nurture before, I had collected a lot of information about it. While bringing a plant to optimal condition was easy, forcing growth took too much Health, making it economically unfeasible. </p><p>And, most farmers couldn’t casually throw hundreds of Health to a single plant. I moved to the dungeon plant, trying to push it to an optimal state. </p><p>It didn’t even react. Something was missing. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said as I moved on to the seed, flooding it with my Health aggressively until a tiny sapling appeared. Incredible, but not when factoring in all the mana I had forced into it. </p><p>[-462 Health] </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 2 -&gt; 3]</p><p>Forcefully improving a skill by just spending a lot of Health rather than finding a clever workaround was not as fun, but I still managed to grow it faster than most farmers were able to do in a week. The difference in Health was simply that important. I ate a quick meal before I sat down, picking another seed, this time feeding it slowly. </p><p>The pattern of feeding a seed had been far simpler. Maybe I could get a better idea if I practiced enough. </p><p>However, even as I focused on it, my mind wandered. Mostly to the unfortunate plight of the Farmers. </p><p>While all production classes were unlucky to some degree, none was as unlucky as the Farmers. They were by far the most common production class, which was never a good thing. The more common a skill was, the less valuable it became. </p><p>To make the situation even worse, they received only one Vitality with each level up and nothing more. Their only skill was Nurture, and without Strength, the only combat skills they could learn were the basic ones. </p><p>They should have still been able to make money, especially with the amount of food the world consumed. </p><p>However, the biggest problem was that monsters were drawn to the vitality of the plants. The bigger the farm, the more monsters it drove. It prevented them from just picking a nice mana dead location with weak monsters and working independently. </p><p>In the end, they ended up gathering together near the big cities, working in the huge greenhouses that supplied the consumption while being protected by others that took all the profit. With the food critical to replenish Health, the amount a city consumed was truly incredible. </p><p>Still, there were always more Farmers than was needed, driving the money they could earn even lower, most of them below level five as they labored hopelessly, working hard to keep with their individual quotas.</p><p>Of course, theoretically, the solution to that problem was simple. All it would take for the stronger people was to just decide to support the weak properly. Just let them access a friendly dungeon, and bring them up to a higher level. </p><p>But, similarly, all the problems with Capitalism would have been solved if billionaires were nicer, Communism would have worked if the officials were not corrupt, and Monarchy would have worked too if the kings cared about peasants more than they cared about their glory. </p><p>As a sociologist that had spent my whole life trying to understand how human behavior had worked in aggregate, I knew that it was hopeless. Solitary humans might be merciful and fair, but humanity was not. Or, we wouldn’t have waited to ban slavery until it was financially unsustainable. </p><p>Humanity was selfish, and the individual power given by the System made it only worse. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 35</p><p>I let my mind wander even as I moved with the group, walking toward the dungeon, easily matching their pace even as I walked on foot. </p><p>High Vitality meant that running while wearing thick armor barely counted as exercise. </p><p>Using Nurture had reminded me of the plight of the Farmers, which had distracted me. There’s not much I could do for them now, but that wasn’t true for the future. I just needed to experiment more. All I needed was to find a way to upgrade their Nurture skill like I had upgraded my Forge and Repair skills. </p><p>Well, that, and find a way to teach people without getting myself killed in the process. People in charge loved small, incremental developments they could control, but they didn’t like systemic changes.</p><p>At all. </p><p>It was why I revealed my improvement of sword skill easily even though it was exceptional, while keeping Mana Forge desperately hidden. Nothing would change even if all Blacksmiths turned into excellent warriors. At most, we would match a common warrior, operating under the same restrictions. </p><p>Mana Forging already had the potential to reshape the current economic landscape, but I couldn’t imagine what would happen if all Farmers suddenly had better classes. </p><p>While I was not a historian, as a sociologist, I had studied many social shifts in history, enough to know that people didn’t really like it when people upset the apple cart. And, while I didn’t fashion myself a Revolutionary desperate to reshape the world to my vision, I also wasn’t stupid enough to miss how others would see me. </p><p>And, people with such radical ideas didn’t exactly end up well off. They either died in a variety of unpleasant ways, or fought with the society until they won, and ended up in charge. The former was obviously what would happen, but the latter didn’t sound any better. </p><p>It was impossible, of course, but even if it did happen, it was a horrible choice. Despite everything, I was a scientist. There was nothing more satisfying than understanding how the world truly worked. While at first, I hated the System for ruining that, I was slowly coming around. </p><p>It was just another mystery to solve. One that conveniently came with its own toolkit. </p><p>“So, a new guild,” one of the guards asked, distracting me from my thoughts. “I thought you were a guild representative. What changed?” </p><p>The guards must have been gossiping. Understandable, as a new guild, one that had been escorted by Eleanor was notable. We didn’t try to hide it, as we decided that an old friend of Eleanor from a dungeon was a good, uncomplicated story most people would buy. </p><p>Unfortunately, that came with a lot of gossip. No one gossiped like patrolling soldiers. </p><p>“I was, but after seeing the dungeon, I realized that it was a good opportunity to make some money, especially since it’s ruled by an old friend. I had some money saved up, which was enough to pay the penalty and still rent a nice piece of land.” </p><p>“You’re a more daring man than I am,” the guard responded. </p><p>“No risk, no gain,” I replied. For the rest of the way, I chatted with the guards. Well, they chatted while I listened. While none of the topics they had been talking about actually interested me, as long as I looked vaguely interested, most people were happy to carry the small talk. </p><p>Another trick I had learned during my decade as a professor. No workplace was free of intrigue, but the academy was particularly egregious on that aspect. Inevitable with a bunch of overachievers fighting for very limited budget and acclaim. </p><p>Trying to keep your head down and focus on your research never worked. Maintaining a friendly distance with the custodial staff paid well for me, since most of my coworkers were more than happy to treat them as invisible. </p><p>Having a few casual acquaintances among the guards would only cost me a few free drinks. </p><p>We continued to chat even as we passed through the dungeon gate, and arrived at the encampment inside the dungeon. “Are you sure you want to go alone?” one of the guards asked even as I moved inside. “It’ll be easier with someone to distract them and get the shell. They won’t take it if there’s even the slightest crack.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Not exactly a problem. I don’t care about a few silvers. I just want to explore the floor and select which part of the dungeon is the best place to set up an operation once I start hiring,” I said. </p><p>“Good point,” he said, laughing a bit excessively to look friendly. Jokes of rich people always landed better for some reason. </p><p>Acting like I had no financial difficulty was another calculated choice. I didn’t have a lot of money — forty five golds sounded like an incredible amount, but it wouldn’t last long once the guild started operating. </p><p>But, having a reputation for being rich was a good way to stay under the radar once I started buying some weird skills. </p><p>I still picked a cart to bring with me, the biggest one available. “Wow, that’s an ambitious choice,” the guard called. “Someone is having mixed feelings about not needing money.” </p><p>Of course I needed money. And, I would have loved to fill the largest cart available with a thousand shells, which would have given me a nice payday of forty golds. Without the need for repair, it would have been an excellent investment. </p><p>But, there were two problems with it. First, I couldn’t explain why I didn’t need to repair my sword. While I could rent them — there were already a small pile of familiar swords in the corner, which people could change for pristine ones for a price — it would cut into the profit.</p><p>It wasn’t Eleanor’s fault. I was familiar with the process, I knew that they were already running it near the cost. I had discovered many ways to make the process faster, but that only solved the urgency aspect. Ultimately, it still consumed the same amount of mana alloy, which was more than ninety percent of the cost. </p><p>And, while I could repair the swords myself, bringing a thousand shells without exchanging swords would have been noticeable. </p><p>Of course, that wasn’t the only reason. The real reason was that I couldn’t kill a thousand monsters on my own. Not without damaging the shell. </p><p>Unfortunately, I still needed the cart. More exactly, I needed the material of the cart. It was a mixture of iron and wood, both the cheapest alloys. For me, they represented far more than what they were valued on the market. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I said. “I plan on getting some samples from the environment. Broken rocks, soil samples, things like that. You never know what can be discovered in a dungeon.” </p><p>“Be careful. You know how the beast could be when we start damaging the dungeon too much,” he said. </p><p>“Thanks,” I said, happy with the warning. Because, I didn’t know how they could be. “By the way, how much do we need to pay if the monsters destroy the cart?” </p><p>“Five silvers,” he warned. My eyes widened, but he misread the reason. “I know, it’s a rip-off. They cost something like eight coppers. But that’s how the dungeons work. Everything is a ripoff.” </p><p>He was true about overcharging, but I didn’t care about it. For me, it represented the easiest way I could get some metal for the forge I was planning to build. While I had the most fundamental tools, I still needed an anvil to experiment properly. A proper fire pit would help as well. </p><p>Dragging a cart or two with significant damage that coincidentally broke off their most metallic parts was easier to explain. </p><p>“True, but that's life,” I said. “Maybe one day we can get strong enough to monopolize a dungeon.” </p><p>“That’s the dream, but it’s impossible without accessing a good dungeon to level up first,” the guard replied. “That, or trying to level up in the wilderness like a crazy person.” </p><p>“A wise assessment,” I said as I turned my back and left. He had a point about the wilderness. Unless escorted by someone like Maria, trying to level up in the wilderness was a very dangerous affair. </p><p>As I left the small fort, I moved deeper. A monster attacked while I was still in the range of others. I could have pulled my hammer and killed it in one blow, or at least, I could have disoriented it with my shield. </p><p>However, I did neither. Instead, I moved around the beast, relying on the sword attacks to keep it distracted before I picked a moment to stab it through its mouth. </p><p>Having a reputation as primarily a sword user was another part of my new identity. One that was probably even more important than anything else. Connecting an expert swordsman to a poor blacksmith was even more difficult. </p><p>That’s why I took it down, but when I ripped the shell with my bare hands, I saw a lot of people wince. It was a good display, but it still damaged the shell enough to make it useless. </p><p>“What a waste,” I heard one of the hunters murmur. </p><p>“Rich people, man. They are all the same,” the other replied, though his whisper wasn’t as weak as they first thought. </p><p>I smiled as I walked away, feeling confident that my new identity would hold. Still, even as I moved, I made sure to stop multiple times in the view of the others, getting soil samples, broken rocks, even dried plants, wanting to sell my commitment to understanding the dungeon even more. </p><p>That way, they wouldn’t question when I returned midday to replace a damaged cart. </p><p>With that, I pulled the cart deeper and deeper, until I arrived at a concealed spot that was not near any of the five gates that led to the second floor. I didn’t want anyone to start wondering where I was. Then, I damaged the cart and ripped more than half of its metal, spending some time reforging the edges to make it look like it was destroyed by a monster attack. </p><p>Then, I walked toward the gate farthest away from the entrance. Eleanor’s map helped me immensely. Too bad she didn’t give a map for the second floor as well. It would have made moving around without risking myself far easier. </p><p>With that done, I cut a direct path toward the second floor, the immediate surrounding of the gate empty. </p><p>I switched to my hammer, and stepped through the gate. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Approaching the mystic land would have been a simple affair if I had been planning to stay hidden all the time to tweak its formation and defenses, but considering I wanted to use it as an opportunity to interact with the other applicants, it was slightly more complicated. I couldn’t simply appear in the middle of the mystic land. </p><p>Well, technically I could, but I didn’t need the suspicion it would generate. </p><p>I could do that, as, at this point, Kartpa Valley and Entsa Pavilion had reached an agreement to access, which also covered the access rights of the smaller cultivation families. Of course, it wasn’t because they were nice people willing to support the smaller families.</p><p>In fact, it was the opposite. </p><p>They didn’t even allow external access before their Qi Gathering disciples scoured the underground portion multiple times and made sure there was nothing that was truly valuable from the perspective of the major sects. Only then, did they create a perimeter that allowed the other cultivators access, but only if they were willing to pay an excessive price of a hundred low-grade spirit stones for each day they spent in the mystic land. </p><p>Though, I noted that their standardized low-grade spirit stones differed from the system, the energy it contained was less than ten strands of Qi.</p><p>It was an excessive price already, but that wasn’t all the sects had requested. The cultivators that wanted to pass needed to consent to a search, which registered every single item in their possession, and storage items were not allowed. </p><p>And, they charged triple for the itinerant cultivators. </p><p>It was an excessively punitive deal that practically refused the existence of the itinerant cultivators, and even for the family cultivators, it was excessive pricing. </p><p>It worked to my benefit. Cobbling together a few hundred spirit stones was easy. I just needed to visit the cultivator market and sell a few spiritual plants while disguised as an itinerant cultivator. However, I didn’t use the itinerant cultivator identity for one reason. </p><p>It was too attention-grabbing. </p><p>Instead, I disguised myself as a member of the Umnim family. Since I knew their signature Alchemy technique — learned from the cultivator who had carried me in his flying boat — I was confident I could disguise myself as one of them easily. However, I didn’t disguise myself as him. </p><p>If someone asked, I would act like a member of the branch family who was getting older and was trying to find something that could help him as a gamble. </p><p>It was not the most ideal disguise, but considering I was under a time crunch, I didn’t want to spend weeks trying to create a more reliable identity. I might have gone through the trouble if the Golden Core cultivators were still around, but they were long gone, replaced by Foundation Establishment cultivators from both sects.</p><p>Six outer sect disciples from each sect, to be exact, all living in a nearby residence, taking turns maintaining the entrance. Interestingly, there was also a small marketplace inside the formation, near enough to the formation entrance so that the Foundation Establishment cultivators could protect it. </p><p>Naturally, taking most of the profits from the marketplace in the process. They demanded sixty percent of the transaction cost, which was an absurd number on the face value, but the value of safely exchanging for items was a luxury that was difficult to attain under most circumstances. </p><p>Killing and robbing were a bit too commonplace for a successful market … but I couldn’t help but wonder if my most recent discovery had anything to do with it. After all, Heavenly Dao was quite biased against trade, treating the wrong moves from merchants far more harshly than actually killing and robbing. </p><p>Yet, it was another curiosity I had to leave the wayside. </p><p>Instead, I made sure my disguise was impeccable before I approached the formation, and approached the gatekeeper. Naturally, the gatekeeper was not a cultivator, but a martial artist. They stood on two sides, one belonging to Kartpa Valley, the other to Entsa Pavilion. The ones on the Kartpa Valley side, predictably, were Tiger Fist disciples, but the identity of the other side surprised me. </p><p>There was no way I couldn’t recognize Snow Blossom Essence.  </p><p>It was the same form Elsana used, but it was far denser and modified significantly to deal with the drawbacks. Yet, despite all the changes, I was willing to bet that all the martial artists had been taught indirectly by Elsana, probably with two generations of disciples in between. </p><p>However, the changes in the essence were incredible. It had been almost half a year since I had last seen Elsana, and while that was enough for me to make huge jumps thanks to my System, it shouldn’t apply to the others. </p><p>Still, regardless of the mystery of the development, it was a sign that Elsana was living well, and I would take it. If only I could get the same from Aisnam. She had not sent even a message since her departure, and I was afraid that it wasn’t something she had chosen. </p><p>As much as I wanted to enter through the Entsa side and see if I could get some more information about Elsana and Aisnam, my disguise belonged to the Umnim family. And, just like how Verdant Family belonged to Entsa’s sphere of influence — discounting a small attempt to switch — Umnim belonged to Kartpa Valley. </p><p>“How long will you be here, honorable cultivator,” Tiger Fist disciple greeted me. </p><p>“Three days for now,” I said even as I passed him a pouch that held three hundred and ten spirit stones. A little tip was never a bad idea. </p><p>“Honorable cultivator,” the martial artist bowed. Then, he looked toward the tent, where the Foundation Establishment cultivators were resting. “I have to risk angering you and consent to be searched, honorable cultivator,” he said. </p><p>Even with the protection of the Foundation Establishment cultivator, he seemed tense saying that. I didn’t blame him. It was not an enviable position. A more irritable cultivator could kill him for the disrespect alone. </p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators at the gate would have likely killed the one daring enough to challenge their authority, but it was hardly a comfort. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said, not wanting to create a commotion as he patted my body, then used an artifact to examine my Qi signature to see if I wasn’t hiding anything. </p><p>I wasn’t, as anything I wanted to smuggle, I already brought inside. While the Foundation Establishment cultivators thought that they were the ones who controlled the area, it couldn’t be further from the truth. </p><p>Once the martial artist finished checking my pouches, he passed me a piece of metal plate, which was an artifact linked to the formation the sects had built. </p><p>“Please don’t lose it. It’ll measure the time you spend inside and will send an alert if you exceed the time. If you continue to stay inside, you have to pay triple the entrance fee as the penalty for each day,” he said. </p><p>“Thank you for the warning,” I said even as I entered into the area, and examined the place. Other than the Foundation Establishment cultivators assigned to the place as guards, every single cultivator inside was the Qi Gathering realm. </p><p>Right at the gate, there was the large marketplace that had been established. Some people were selling their gains from the ruins — mostly various talismans I had placed inside, though during the last time, I repaired the place, I added a few pills, spirit plants, and other miscellaneous rewards thanks to my increased capabilities — but others were selling items they had brought from the outside. </p><p>Every transaction was observed and recorded by martial artists for taxation purposes. </p><p>Unfortunately, the market didn’t hold any useful reward for me. I had already checked. The thing I needed most was the advanced techniques, particularly ones that extended to Nascent Soul. I didn’t need them to be complete. Just a fragment would have been enough. </p><p>Unfortunately, no cultivator would have been stupid enough to sell such a technique under the nose of the two major sects. I still checked through formation, but the results weren’t satisfactory. </p><p>Instead, I examined the cultivators walking around. The majority of the cultivators I could see were actually from the cultivation families, with only a minority belonging to the two major sects. But, those that I could see, without exception, belonged to the outer sect. </p><p>However, that didn’t prevent them from walking around like royalty, not afraid of anything, and easily entering into conflict with the family cultivators. </p><p>The few itinerant cultivators that managed to enter the place were treated like dirt by both groups. </p><p>Such a nice crowd, I decided even as I moved toward the mystic land itself. </p><p>It was the safest place to convince someone to insult me. </p><p>Hopefully.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>Making my new Burning Blizzard team accumulate Providence proved harder than I had expected.</p><p>I started by using a simple method, by trying to let them replicate the gardening process. Unfortunately, it proved completely useless. Low-level spiritual plants proved useless to trigger the effect, and, unlike Forests Dance, their essence wasn’t geared to boost plant growth.</p><p>Which meant I needed to be more creative. I decided to pick some volunteers and spread them among the refugees so that they could do some good deeds, from dealing with the evil bandits to more ordinary activities like distributing food.</p><p>“I’m looking for volunteers for a mission that might end up in your deaths,” I shouted once I arrived at the largest room at their underground training base.</p><p>All of them took a step forward, looking excited at the prospect.</p><p>During the month, I had added many new rooms to the base to handle the new recruits, their numbers surpassing thirty thousand, and almost ten thousand of them already in the Blood Essence realm.</p><p>I had to be more selective in their recruitment, relying only on the secret guard of the capital.</p><p>With the spiritual pillar recovered, I didn’t have to spend my time supervising their training directly. The spiritual pillar was strong enough to maintain the purity of the essence, especially with the first batch of trainees taking my role as the trainers. Under their guidance, the new team of martial artists was growing.</p><p>Watching them gather, I couldn’t help but feel impressed and scared in equal measure. Just a few months ago, when I faced two disciples of Tiger Fist, I had no choice but to run away desperately. Now, one order from me, and the army in front of me could easily subjugate the whole mortal domain and the billions of people that lived here.</p><p>Naturally, assuming no intervention from the cultivators. While they were strong enough to deal with the ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators as long as they acted as a team, I didn’t fancy their chances against a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Still, watching their excitement as I declared the potential risk of death, I couldn’t help but feel they would still follow my orders against such an opponent. “I don’t want anyone to feel obligated. It’s a dangerous mission, and if you get caught by the cultivators, you might have to kill yourself rather than be traced back here,” I warned. “Your martial arts are top secret, and revealing it to the cultivators means the destruction of your homeland.”</p><p>It was not an empty warning. Everything I had seen about the sects showed that they wanted to be the only source of high-end power. While their main method of doing so was limiting the number of Foundation Establishment pills available through their monopoly, there was no reason they wouldn’t extend it to the Blood Essence realm.</p><p>Everdawn Empire’s fate was a good example of how they dealt with it.</p><p>The warning didn’t stop them. “Alright,” I said even as I picked a thousand warriors from them, all in Blood Essence Realm, and dismissed the rest.</p><p>Then, I went over to their mission in great detail, which could be summarized as helping people while following the prevailing cultural norms. Not bullying the weak, helping the poor, and helping the refugees while dealing with objectively evil people.</p><p>All while keeping things as calm as possible.</p><p>Once that was done, I went through the equipment I had created for them, all mass-produced thanks to my formations. A lot of essence pills, a few alchemical healing pills, several defensive talismans that could be activated by a martial artist, and, one pseudo-suicide pill.</p><p>It wouldn’t have killed them, but destroyed their cultivation and put them into suspended animation only a great alchemical master could wake them up, which would also send me a signal so I could extract them.</p><p>While I had put the idea of suicide as a possibility, I wanted to do everything I could to actually prevent it. I wanted it to be just a precaution rather than a reality.</p><p>Just making a poison pill that would have destroyed their bodies was much easier, but I couldn’t bring myself to do that. I felt responsible.</p><p>Once it was done, I blindfolded them before I started deploying them in various refugee camps in teams of ten operators, not neglecting to set some detection formation in their area of operation to preemptively react to the presence of any Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>As an added benefit, it recorded their actions in general terms, which allowed me to track the speed the Providence gathered based on their actions.</p><p>The first thing I noticed was that Providence was very biased toward killing. Preventing an unethical situation, whether it was killing, robbing, or another evil act according to common culture, gained next to no feedback from the world, while dealing with them permanently triggered a response in Providence.</p><p>I was glad that I had waited until my Alchemy had reached Perfection before I started the experiment, as it allowed me to understand exactly what I was dealing with.</p><p>As, interestingly, not all situations were equal from the perspective of the Heavens. It had some surprising results. For example, if the one doing evil acts was a government official, the threshold for being treated as evil was far higher than I had expected. Sometimes, even when they were committing extremely evil acts like forcing people to starve through excessive taxation, the world didn’t count them as evil, and dealing with them actually resulted in a loss of providence.</p><p>I would have assumed it was about the act of taxation being too subtle to be caught by the Heavens compared to killing, but there was evidence to the contrary as well. The threshold for the merchants was just as warped, but in the opposite direction. Just the act of selling the grain expensively was enough to make their punishment a ‘just’ act from the Providence perspective, and actually hoarding to the point of causing starvation had been treated even more evil than banditry.</p><p>In a way, it fitted with the prevailing cultural zeitgeist of the world, where the rulers were treated as divinely ordained, the government officials were treated as elite based on their links, and merchants had been treated as slightly better than parasites culturally.</p><p>A weird sense of priority that felt foreign to me. Not that I was exactly a defender of Capitalism, but from my perspective, monarchy wasn’t any better. It not only took people’s money, but also lives. It was something interesting, one that I would have loved to delve deeper into if I had time, but I had other, more urgent tasks.</p><p>So, I kept my efforts to understand the Providence practical. I stayed at the Burning Blizzard base most of my time, observing the Providence-farming humanitarian efforts from a distance through formations while I focused my attention on the spiritual pillar, trying to understand how it reacted with Providence.</p><p>It wasn’t as straightforward as I wanted it to be. I was able to understand how providence affected the artificial trees I used as a totem, but that was mostly because of the alchemical nature of the trees. I was competent when it came to alchemy, and the fact that I was the one who designed the tree allowed me to understand it even better.</p><p>I didn’t have the same advantage for the drawing on the wall. While I had used the time to upgrade my painting skills to catch up with my calligraphy, the benefit of an ordinary skill was limited. Comparatively, my talisman knowledge helped me to understand what was going on more.</p><p>Unfortunately, that understanding was limited to Qi aspects only, and the Providence part was simply too complicated. I could barely detect the direction of the Providence thanks to my alchemy. Unlike the alchemical trees, it didn’t gather around the Symbol and absorbed passively. A small part of it was devoured directly by the Symbol, almost like an active process, getting stronger in the process.</p><p>Meanwhile, the majority disappeared deeper into the mist as a tight beam. It took a lot of formation from me, and I needed to stretch my Alchemy knowledge, but somehow, I was able to track the general direction of it.</p><p>It was going deeper into the mist, farther than I could simply move, so I started creating several checkpoints on the way. Finally, I had a direction, but creating a line of formations that would allow me to reach that direction would take a while.</p><p>Meanwhile, I needed to do something else.</p><p>And, since I was starting to struggle due to a lack of advanced knowledge, I decided to try and address that.</p><p>A visit to the fake mystic land was in order.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I had returned to the fourth floor, the first thing I did was add another layer of trees and kill every beast surrounding the forge. The existence of lure potions scared me. All it would take was for someone to throw one into the center, and my forge would be ruined. </p><p>The monsters didn’t even have to attack directly. Just the existence of giant insects, stampeding wildly, would be enough to ruin my work. </p><p>While I doubted that another layer of trees would help, there was no real harm in expanding my safe zone. </p><p>However, once that was done, I started my experiments. My aim was to understand how mana moved at a macro scale. For that, I finally raised the silver and iron pole with an empty center, which I previously used to search for iron deposits, and started my incredible experiment. </p><p>Which was to push mana from one side, and try to observe its movements before it dissipated. </p><p>It was a simple experiment, but it would help me better understand mana in its natural state. Merely observing didn’t help. Only a limited amount of information could be derived from looking at a glass of water. Worse, in my case, that glass was opaque, and I could only look at it from fifty feet away. </p><p>It was impossible to overstate just how bad my understanding of mana was. For example, whenever I broke a shell, the mana cloud disappeared soon after. However, I didn’t actually know what happened. Was it some kind of energy that disappeared completely like light? Maybe it was like heat, and it searched for some kind of equilibrium with its environment, and I just lost the ability to perceive it once it dropped below a certain level... </p><p>There were limits to what indirect observation would bring. I couldn’t even assume that it didn’t disperse just because of the existence of mana-dead locations. After all, heat dispersed, but there were still places that were freezing and boiling hot on Earth. </p><p>Trying to deduce fundamental working principles from macro systems was an extremely difficult task. Admittedly, even direct observation wasn’t easy. Or, the ancient philosophers wouldn’t have had such misguided assumptions about the way the world worked. </p><p>“Let’s start simple,” I grumbled even as I pushed some mana to the center of the pipe, using Mana Control to deliver that as a ball, hoping that the mana would follow the pipe's direction. </p><p>The aim of the experiment was simple. I wanted to understand how mana moved in its natural state. My observations weren’t exactly conclusive. In its free state, it reacted similarly to something in between liquid and gas, however, it was not consistent It changed freely for no reason … well, no apparent reason, at least. </p><p>However, whenever I used the perk Mana Control, it turned into some kind of extremely malleable tactile material, not unlike some kind of soft plastic. It had been similar to when I used Mana Manipulation, but, for the lack of a better term, it felt more … liquidy. </p><p>“I wish I studied material sciences more,” I muttered. When I had been studying, I had readily dismissed anything mechanical or material-based as an area of study, feeling that they had long reached the bottleneck of development, instead choosing to dabble with computer engineering before I finally picked mathematical sociology as my final direction. After that, I abandoned anything on the physical side, though I still worked on the software part. </p><p>Coding my own models, at least the core components, was always easier than trying to explain them to someone else. </p><p>However, my lack of grounding on the more experimental side of things was coming to bite me in the ass. I probably could have come up with a lot of interesting experiments if I had been more familiar with the more esoteric side of the material sciences. </p><p>Instead, I needed to start from scratch. </p><p>“Let’s begin,” I muttered. </p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>The setup for the experiment was simple: Maintain a hold on the mana using Mana Control, bring it to the center of the pipe, and shift to Repair the moment I let go of the mana, hoping that it would give me enough time to observe it. </p><p>It failed. </p><p>Spectacularly. </p><p>The mana just dispersed before I could get a sense of its movement. I repeated the experiment, this time with more mana. The result had been the same, but I didn’t let that stop me. I repeated the experiment a hundred times. </p><p>The only thing I gained, was the dispersion shape of the mana being slightly affected by the pipe. Unfortunately, even that was a bit doubtful, as the silver and iron mixture had let the mana pass through. Whether there was no resistance, or there was only a slight resistance, I didn’t know. </p><p>“Back to the drawing board. I need a material that resists mana better,” I said. Unfortunately, due to the way Observe worked, I needed to rely exclusively on metals.</p><p>Worse, while the Mana Forge offered many materials, it didn’t exactly come with an analysis report. I instinctively knew which metal would hold a better edge, and which one would be more durable, but it didn’t index them based on their mana resistance. </p><p>I was curious whether it was not available, or it was something that would be unlocked once the conditions were fulfilled — whether it was finding the raw materials, or reaching a certain skill proficiency. </p><p>However, that question, at least in the short term, was just one of idle curiosity. I needed far more gold than I currently had in my possession to improve them further … and, that was assuming I could infuse enough mana to trigger a System response, which was not exactly a given. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I said to myself and started on my experiment. </p><p>The first step was easy. I just needed to make a box, put mana in, close the box, and watch its dispersal. It was a simpler setup than the pipe, which, I had to admit, was a bit too ambitious of me. </p><p>The first rule of experimentation was to start from the most basic alternative. And, for that, I had to go back to the third floor, as the ordinary materials would have been just destroyed on the fourth floor. </p><p>Luckily, I had kept my third-floor forge intact, just buried. I made a dozen boxes made of available materials. Copper, bronze, iron, silver, and, with the tiny amount of it I had, gold. All except gold, I had created both pure versions, vitality-only alloys, and mana alloys of. </p><p>Then, I infused several bursts of mana into each material, trying to get a general sense. Of the pure materials, iron functioned the best for my purposes, while gold performed the worst. Of course, another way of saying that was that gold might be an excellent conducting material for mana, but that was currently not the experiment. </p><p>Also, technically, I couldn’t call that effect conduction without a lot more experiments. After all, I still didn’t know whether the mana was disappearing, or just reaching a point below my detection capabilities. </p><p>Then, there was the performance. Across the board, mana alloys performed the worst, letting the mana pass through easily. “Interesting,” I grumbled, my mind already wondering whether that fact had anything to do with better mana alloys allowing for stronger enchantments. Maybe it was creating a medium to collect the environmental mana. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I said again while still taking notes. One benefit of working on the third floor, it allowed me to use paper. </p><p>Meanwhile, alloys made out of Vitality were more of a mixed bag. Some of them performed better than their pure variant, some of them worse. None of them were good enough to work for my purposes, but it was still valuable. It meant that, possibly, there was a solution. </p><p>“Next, the shape,” I said, and forged a hundred different shapes from pure iron, from simple cubes of various sizes and thicknesses to exotic curvy shapes that would have challenged even the most complex 3D printer. </p><p>I didn’t expect much, which was why I was surprised to notice a hexagonal prism performing excellently, somehow forcing mana to linger inside for a significantly longer time. Yet, the moment it started slipping through the surface of the metal, it started dispersing. </p><p>There was no reason I could think of that would cause a hexagon to somehow work better … but then, that was the point of experimentation, wasn’t it? To understand how things had been working. </p><p>“Let’s find an answer,” I said even as I forged a dozen hexagons, of varying sizes and shapes. Then, I started pushing mana inside and observing the results. Soon, I had a sheet of paper in front of me, and I started trying to find a formula that explained the phenomena. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was a very tedious calculation by hand. The simple arithmetic operations didn’t give me any results, but that wasn’t too much of a surprise. </p><p>However, after going through some common formulas, I actually managed to find a good formula. One of the classics. </p><p>Newton’s law of cooling. I first played with the transfer coefficient and transfer surface area, confirming that those two rules held true. Then, I started increasing mana density, and calculated the rate of the mana transfer. </p><p>I found out that, similar to heat energy, the higher the mana difference, the faster the transfer. </p><p>Interestingly, the formula only worked when I assumed that there was a certain gap between environmental mana and what I could detect from the environment, which was very strong evidence for my theory that the disappearance of the mana meant that it was below my detection threshold. </p><p>It had many interesting conclusions, but none of those conclusions were really relevant. Especially since I still wasn’t certain whether the core conclusion I had driven was accurate, or if I was misrepresenting the principles. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the luxury of repeating the experiment a hundred times in different forms to conclusively confirm it. </p><p>I still had other experiments to run. </p>",

    "content": "<p>While I was asked to stay in the dungeon, I didn’t have command over the guards. However, I also went to a secret meeting with Eleanor after the crisis. She left in a hurry and I stayed back. It meant the guards had no idea exactly where I stood. </p><p>Thomas running after a confrontation with me complicated things further. </p><p>It was a problem because they didn’t know what they were supposed to do if I gave them an order. Of course, in a fair world, it wouldn’t matter, but life wasn’t fair. Making a wrong choice meant that they would be blamed. </p><p>“Don’t worry. I’m just here to keep an eye on things, and make sure that there’s no accident from the second floor,” I said, which simultaneously comforted them and explained my disappearance. “Just give me a new cart, and record the old ones,” I said. </p><p>“What should we do with the broken ones?” one asked. </p><p>“Just pack them and send them to the town. They’ll be useful for my guild,” I said. “Also, pass me a cart.” </p><p>“Do you need swords, sir?” one asked. </p><p>“No, those should keep me going for a while,” I said, pointing at the multiple swords I had on my waist. It was wasteful to use them against monsters, but luckily, it was not a problem for me. Their only use was to explain why I wasn’t coming back with a lot of destroyed weapons. </p><p>With that done, I left, dragging my cart away, and preparing myself for a sleepless night. “Well, maybe I can take a nap on the fourth floor if it gets unbearable,” I muttered, amused by the unexpected benefit. But, otherwise, skipping sleep for a night shouldn’t be too hard. </p><p>I was used to it. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to go to the fourth floor and start working, I didn’t disappear immediately. Just in case, I wanted to show myself a few times first, in case there was a spy that would pull another trick. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t waste my time. Instead, I pulled one of the swords, using Observe to examine the sword. It was a good opportunity to multitask, as not only was I curious about the secrets hidden inside a higher-grade weapon, but I would also be able to finally test Observe properly. I had been running around since I upgraded it, which meant I wasn’t able to test it properly. </p><p>A part of that delay had been a lack of need. Pushing myself to the limit while producing that gold alloy to trick the System had given me enough of a boost that just listening to the System directions and relying on Creative Forging to adjust the designs had been easier. </p><p>Technically, I had used Observe while building the atmospheric steam engine, but it was more about checking the macro details that even Analyze could have caught. Hardly a way to test the limits of my new perk. </p><p>More importantly, I was excited to learn the secrets of a weapon from the System Store. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to start with something radical, I ignored that instinct. Instead, I started with using Repair, trying to get the path to Repair the weapon. </p><p>There was none. </p><p>It was not a surprise. The reason I was able to repair the other weapons was that the Sharpness enchantment was simple enough to be ignored while repairing a simple weapon, but even the more complicated bronze mana-alloy weapons I had been initially hired to mend required Warm Blow as a prerequisite. </p><p>I had basically bypassed that requirement by doing the repair manually. From the System perspective, what I had been doing was cheating. </p><p>Clearly, for the more complicated enchantments, the Mana Repair variant wasn’t enough, and I needed one — or possibly multiple, considering I wasn’t receiving a suggestion — perks. </p><p>I had Mana Control, which was enough to bypass the enchantment and work on the metal without breaking the spell structure, but Repair skill didn’t know that. They both might be Class skills, but the perks weren’t transferrable. </p><p>A pity. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean I couldn’t restore the weapon if I wished to do so. One trick was even obvious. I could strip one of the swords from its enchantments, and replicate the damage on the other one, then use it as a cheat sheet. </p><p>An absurd solution that was too cumbersome to be useful in any situation that wasn’t exactly specific. “Well, not so absurd,” I muttered even as I chuckled. Ultimately, what I had been planning to do wasn’t too different. I would strip the enchantment, essentially ruining the sword, then destroy it repeatedly in different methods. </p><p>Just a more comprehensive version of the first model. </p><p>I had to, because as much as I wished, the weapons couldn’t be repaired the same way. The differences between different materials; not just completely different ones like bronze and iron, but also two variants of the same main alloy. </p><p>Problems started at the base material level. Mechanical properties alone had many subsets. Just the ability to deal with external force had many categories of measurement, brittleness which defined the likelihood of shattering without deformation, hardness which defined its surface strength, fatigue which was about resisting repeated and long-term force, tensile strength was about the maximum force that could be applied, resilience which defined its ability to absorb energy while bending… </p><p>They were all about the ability to deal with external forces, and it wasn’t even a comprehensive list. There were manufacturing properties, the way it reacted to heat, and chemical features like reacting to rust or other external attempts.</p><p>Those features had changed wildly between alloys, meaning working with a new alloy without the System’s assistance was an incredible study. </p><p>They weren’t exactly a problem for me for two reasons. First, I had been relying on the System suggestions a lot to compensate for any problem. Second, I wasn’t exactly trying to maximize the potential of any alloy. As long as it was workable, I would be happy to use it. </p><p>After all, it didn’t matter whether a fork was made of silver or steel. As long as one avoided making one out of glass — at least, ordinary window glass — it would work.</p><p>Unfortunately, all those details meant that I needed to learn how to repair each weapon type from scratch. Some, like the case of bronze weapons, were doable. Meanwhile, it would likely not be really useful for more complicated, unique weapons. </p><p>And, in the case of the weapon I had in my hands, it was a bit more complicated. I had only six numbers, which wasn’t really enough to make it worth the trouble of learning. I could forge pure weapons that could surpass their enchanted performance as long as I was willing to spend the time. </p><p>Unfortunately, bringing them out in public without a source to explain their existence was troubling. I didn’t want Eleanor to be suspicious. While I trusted her about most things, I had no intention of testing her when selling me out would solve Maria’s problem.  </p><p>It meant I had to spend time learning about them. </p><p>For the next hour, I used Observe, focusing on learning the nature of the weapon without the benefit of the skill. It was an iron-silver mix, and there was too much silver, enough to compromise the integral structure and base strength of the metal.</p><p>As for other stabilizing materials used, they were a mystery. I could break the enchantment to find out what they were … but, I could also go with a simpler route instead. </p><p>“An anti-corrosive plating.” It was a rough solution, one that would undoubtedly reduce the quality of the swords even more, even weaken the enchantment, but I didn’t care. The whole point was to explain why I could kill thousands of beasts without borrowing bronze swords to Eleanor. </p><p>Technically, I could have claimed the same without adding the plating, but this way, I could lend the other five to my future guild members without it being suspicious.  </p><p>It wouldn’t have convinced any spies Thomas had, who would have known about the issue with the swords he had armed his assassins with, but it wasn’t too much of a problem. If he continued to believe that I was near a hundred, new swords weren’t exactly a problem. </p><p>I only needed to go to the trouble to convince Eleanor. </p><p>I spend the next hour at the first level, slowly adding a layer of coating to the sword. Since it was a process that was more reliant on mana than heat, I didn’t bother going down to the fourth floor. The dungeon was kind enough to give me all the supporting material I needed, and the iron, I could always take from the cart. As for silver, I used the fake sword I had brought with me. </p><p>The experiment lasted almost two hours, and the only reason I was able to do that was the Mana Control Perk, allowed me to slowly detach and reattach the mana links between the enchantment and the metal. </p><p>Even then, the first one was almost a spectacular failure. The enchantment lost the link with the metal, which turned completely useless. The enchantment was still there, just useless. </p><p>The others, I had various levels of success with. But, the real success was that I got more familiar with Observe. Not enough to dare trying to overcharge it, but still satisfyingly so. </p><p>“Customization for the win,” I muttered even as I walked toward the fort once again, wanting to show myself for one last time for the evening, casually mentioning how the assassins were kind enough to grant me weapons that worked excellently in the dungeon, knowing it would be eventually reported to Eleanor. </p><p>I had some real experiments to run. It was time to get a better understanding of Mana and Health. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Follow me,” Eleanor said, and we started moving toward the gate. </p><p>“What should we do about the body? It belongs to the attacker,” I said. </p><p>“Anything incriminating?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing except this,” I said as I showed her the bottle, not trying to hide it. </p><p>She frowned even as she opened her hand. “A lure potion,” she said even as she examined it, then put it in her pocket. The pieces of glass were taken by the guard. “Follow me,” she repeated. </p><p>I did. I had enough presence of mind to keep my mouth shut about the sixty gold I was supposed to get from the shells. Everything had its time and place. Eleanor had dragged me to a room and pulled some kind of gem, which radiated a soft blue glow.</p><p>Suddenly, all the voices from outside ceased. “No one can hear us,” she said, her voice the most serious I had ever heard. “Now, what was that?!” </p><p>“What was what?” I asked. She looked angry, but I opened my hands in surrender. “I genuinely don’t know. We have too many things to talk about. The death of hundreds of people, the lure potion, the fact that I managed to deal with six dangerous assassins, the fact we had to let that monster go despite it being obvious he had done it?” </p><p>“None of them,” she said, her tone getting more and more serious. “It’s about how you rejected the weight of his Charisma. Only people of higher levels can do that. So, either someone trained you for a long time to resist the effects, or you have been lying about your level —” she started, only to stop. </p><p>Probably because I looked shocked. I had no idea why it was such a big deal. But then, I knew very little about the secrets of Charisma. “Wait, can resisting Charisma be trained?” I asked before I shook my head. “Sorry, scientist reflex. To answer your question, I didn’t resist the effect. I was scared shitless.” </p><p>She didn’t seem convinced. “What about that laugh? It was obviously not a fake. No one can really act under Charisma. It must have been genuine, or Thomas wouldn’t have bought it!” </p><p>“Wait, can he read my mind?” I asked. </p><p>“No, but he can sense your emotions,” she said, looking even more confused. </p><p>I chuckled again when I realized exactly what had happened. She was starting to look angry. “Sorry, but I promise you, you’ll find it amusing as well,” I promised. </p><p>“I doubt it,” she replied frostily. </p><p>I couldn’t help it. I started giggling. Realizing that after everything, potentially the biggest part of my problem had been solved by a misunderstanding was funny … in a hysterical sort of way. “You know how I’m … kind of tense when flying,” I asked. </p><p>“Frozen in terror,” she said. </p><p>“Yeah, being under Charisma reminded me of that. With the stress of everything, I couldn’t help but find that amusing.” Eleanor looked at me as if trying to see if I was lying. I couldn’t help it, I started to laugh even more. Absent-mindedly, I recognized it as not genuine amusement, but a hysteric release of shock. “Good … that … you … silenced …” I said, trying to speak. </p><p>I collapsed, laughing. </p><p>She watched me like I was crazy, but soon, she started giggling as well. I didn’t know how much time we spent, laughing like a couple of crazy people. I didn’t know how much time passed before we managed to calm down. She shrugged just as much, which was understandable. She was probably even more stressed. At least, I succeeded. She still needed to explain her failure to Maria. </p><p>Though, from what I had seen, Eleanor would have been beating herself far more than Maria would admonish her about an external sabotage. </p><p>The pressure did weird things to our minds.</p><p>“So, my involuntary giggle made him assume that I was a higher level than him,” I asked once we finally managed to calm down. She nodded. “But, why did he escape?” </p><p>“Using Charisma like that is an insult. You can challenge him to a duel for it, especially if he did so publicly, and I was there as a witness.” </p><p>“And his level is?” </p><p>“A hundred. It’s a known fact that he’s trying to pass the threshold. He just lacks the necessary resources” she said. </p><p>“People need resources for that?” I asked. “Do I need to prepare anything for level fifty?” </p><p>“No, only level hundred requires resources,” She said. </p><p>“What kind of resources?” </p><p>“I don’t know. Family secret,” she said. “Apparently, it differs from class to class. But, it’s well known that they are expensive. It’s why we bet everything on this dungeon. Otherwise, we can’t buy them for Maria once she reaches level one hundred.” </p><p>As much as I was tempted to question her from about six different directions, most of it related to the level hundred threshold and why it required resources, but I forced myself to focus. “So, they believe that I’m over level hundred, that’s a problem,” I said. “I doubt that I can fake it.” </p><p>She pondered for a moment. “Maybe not. Thomas doesn’t exactly have a reputation for bravery. We can probably say that you are at level hundred, but you’re unlucky enough to have a Militia class, it’ll be believable.” </p><p>Militia was probably the weakest class that was still classified as one. It only received three stats, evenly distributed between Strength, Dexterity, and Vitality. Of course, they compensated for this somewhat by having one melee and one ranged combat skill, which they could upgrade to their preferred weapon with a Stat stone. </p><p>It gave them much better combat flexibility compared to classes like Blacksmith with higher base stat gain, making them much more preferable as guards and other roles.  </p><p>As my own experience had shown, Perks mattered. A lot. </p><p>I thought about accepting it, as it would make my situation more secure. That way, I could develop safely … but would it be truly safe? It had been a close call. “No, let’s not explain it further,” I said. “Maybe even let the guards gossip how Thomas had been scared of me.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” she said. </p><p>“Yes,” I said. “I prefer if he doesn’t send any more assassins. Today, I survived by sheer luck,” I said. </p><p>“Good, that was about to be my next question,” she replied. “How did you survive a group of assassins? I doubt they were weak.” </p><p>“Luck and incompetence,” I replied. “Mine, and theirs, in that order.” She looked intrigued, and I gave her a long, detailed tale of my imaginary fight. It was more or less what had happened, but some details like using the lure potion had turned into an accident, which allowed me to kill the first one and take their much better weapon, followed by a tough battle where I pushed my sword skill to the limit. </p><p>Including my ability to halfway copy a vitality attack; one with a corresponding tale of how close I had come to death before inspiration struck.  </p><p>“Show me,” she said. </p><p>“Sure. But, I don’t need to tell you we have to keep it a secret, right,” I said. Knowing the Rare skills would come with one at twenty-five proficiency, and how combining it with a Perk helped, it felt like a good compromise. </p><p>With her bias for sword skills, she would have no trouble accepting it. Not only that, but it would also explain the rapid development I planned to show once I upgraded to Rare skill. </p><p>The best part, while it was an impressive achievement, it was nothing more than a pointless gimmick from her perspective. I even had planned a long explanation where I would reveal my Rare Nurture skill and how it had helped me to control my Health.</p><p>She didn’t even ask that, accepting my achievement as a display of my talent. “What a waste it is that you ended up as a Blacksmith,” she sighed deeply. </p><p>“And what a waste we don’t have time to spar,” I said, happy to end my story without any hard questions. </p><p>“Yes, I have a lot of things to do,” she said. “Who would have guessed that bastard can get his hands on pure lure potions.” </p><p>“I’m guessing it’s the thing in the bottle,” I said. “What exactly is it?” </p><p>“A controlled substance, made from a recipe,” she said. “The function is simple. It radiates a smell that draws the dungeon monsters at a certain radius to a target, depending on the dose and amount used.” </p><p>“I’m guessing it’s not usually used as a full bottle,” I said. </p><p>“No, usually, it’s used as a diluted mix,” she said. </p><p>“But it’s not forbidden,” I said. </p><p>“No. They are not really a risk to any mature dungeon operation,” she said. </p><p>“Because there are not enough monsters to create a swarm in a dungeon with continued hunting,” I said. </p><p>“Exactly,” she said. “Of course, we were supposed to have sentries preventing exactly that, but with the family guards gone, we’re already overextended. Still, I should have been prepared. I just didn’t expect that bastard to be vicious enough to kill that many people just to take over the command. That’s my mistake,” she said. </p><p>She didn’t seem particularly torn up about the deaths, and more about them representing her failure. </p><p>I didn’t like it. I wanted to blame her, but it wouldn’t be fair. She was fighting for a long time, and during that, she clearly saw a lot of death, to the point of losing her sensitivity to it. It was just how the human mind worked, so I couldn’t even blame the System for it. </p><p>We got used to it in order not to go mad. </p><p>She sighed. “I need to go and visit the caravan, to talk with Maria. We have a lot of work to do to keep the guilds investing in the area. But, some of them would try to pull back. Do you mind staying here tonight to keep an eye on the dungeon? It should be over, but I’ll feel better if you’re here as well.” </p><p>“Sure, just keep it in mind when I need a favor,” I replied, acting like the ability to stay in the dungeon without raising suspicion was not something I wanted in the first place. </p><p>Especially the alternative meant staying in the town, which didn’t feel as safe with both Maria and Eleanor gone. </p><p>“Deal,” she said as she squeezed my hand. </p><p>“However, I can only promise help about the monsters. I won’t get involved with the guards. That can get complicated if there’s a spy among them. I need to stay aloof if I’m to convince people I’m really strong. Maybe I can hunt some more monsters. I’ll be even faster with my new Perk,” I said.  </p><p>“Good point. But, don’t tire yourself too much. We still have to spar once I return.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I followed her out. </p><p>She had only one track of mind. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I barely came up with a reasonable method of action once I was done dealing with the swarm, which took more than strictly necessary as I continued to rip their broken shells even as I dealt with the last few monsters.</p><p>Technically, that part was not necessary to sell my story, but I didn’t want to waste the opportunity to bring a lot of forging material back to the guild. While I didn’t need them for my experiments anymore with my new setup, there was no harm in having them. </p><p>I could still use them to run experiments at night. More importantly, they would give me a convenient excuse to explain any sudden development I might achieve.  </p><p>Of course, bringing all of it out meant that I couldn’t hide what happened from Eleanor, but luckily, that was not a good strategy in the first place. Most of the details, I had no problems revealing. The only tricky part was to explain how I managed to deal with five people with Rare skills, led by one with an Epic skill. </p><p>Ironically, the shells — both intact and fragmented — came in handy when delivering my story. A little story of arrogance, and how they started fighting about who would get what I had collected. So, they only sent one to kill me while the others continued to argue. </p><p>Then, a shield attack broke one of the vials while we fought, triggering a swarm. Their unfamiliarity with the swarm allowed me to pick them off one by one. </p><p>It was a good story. I even had the evidence … in the form of a half-filled vial. </p><p>Naturally, I kept some for myself. The moment I was sure that the swarm wouldn’t spill upstairs, I rushed down to the third floor, hiding one of the swords and two and a half vials there. And, while I was there, I even forged myself a sixth fake one just to keep the evidence complete. </p><p>Unfortunately, whatever they had used to communicate was a single-use device, and the enchantment was gone, leaving only an ordinary ring behind. </p><p>“A good story, but it needs one last touch to be believable,” I muttered even as I pulled my new sword, using it to kill the straggling monsters, mana dancing around the blade. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 79 -&gt; 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Stout Defense / Determined Swing] </p><p>I completed the progression, because a skill at the limit, alongside a Perk, would make the story of taking them down more convincing. Not to mention, as an added benefit, the exciting life-and-death struggle against the six enemies while being trapped in a swarm was exactly the kind of thing that might push me to my limits. </p><p>As for the perks, I picked Stout Defense. While the idea of having another attack perk was not exactly unappealing, my experience with Fleeting Step had changed my mind. The auxiliary abilities were certainly useful as well. </p><p>Stout Defense was a complicated thing, almost the reverse of Fleeting Step, which focused on enhancing mobility. My new perk seemed like it would allow me to stand against blows that would have otherwise sent me flying. However, it was just a feeling, as it was difficult to test it without an enemy. </p><p>Monsters would have made a good sparring partner to test it, but only if I was wearing my anti-corrosive set. Otherwise, their mandibles would just cut through my shield. Truthfully, even with an anti-corrosive set, it would be troublesome to practice. However, I still wanted to. </p><p>The special abilities were too convenient to be ignored. </p><p>“I was lucky those idiots didn’t have their skills any higher,” I said. None of them even used any special attacks, which made it likely that they hadn’t brought their new skills up to twenty-five. </p><p>A stupid enemy was a beautiful gift. </p><p>“A lot of work,” I grumbled as I walked to finish the last step, which was collecting the broken glass from the vial. Extra supporting evidence wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>Once that was done, I finally stepped through the gate, pulling a cart that was filled to the brim with shells behind me. The only reason it didn’t collapse was the few modifications I had added. The good thing was that there weren't a lot of monsters around the gate. </p><p>It was weird, as with the delay, it was already nighttime, which meant the hunting operations should have ceased. Of course, while the dungeons weren’t affected by the day-night cycle — at least, to my knowledge — with the current number of operators, it didn’t make sense to work in multiple shifts. </p><p>And, for the current setup, a certain number of teams working at the same time was critical, or the monsters started to group together, making the process cumbersome. </p><p>So, the sudden decreased density was troubling. I didn’t abandon the cart, but I was ready to do so in case of trouble. Fleeting Step gave me the confidence to retreat, but not enough to feel safe. </p><p>The realization hit when I arrived at the fortress that was defending the dungeon entrance, only to find a scarred mess. The walls were still in place, but I could recognize the deep marks in the stone. </p><p>“Halt,” the guard shouted. </p><p>I removed my helmet. “It’s me, Arthur,” I shouted, giving the fake name I used, which I was willing to admit was an homage to the famous King Arthur. </p><p>“Wow, you’re alive,” the guard responded. “Impressive achievement. Especially with all the load.”  </p><p>“Well, I got locked in a swarm. I had been fighting for hours,” I replied. Together with the signs of insect bites on the walls, I was starting to get a good idea of what had happened. The door opened, and I walked in. </p><p>Was I feeling a bit tense? Certainly. But, I still entered for one reason. If my assassins could control the fort, they wouldn’t have bothered to set sentries at each gate.</p><p> I was trying to find the best way to grill him, when a familiar figure burst in, but her exhaustion was clear. “De — Arthur. You’re alive!” she gasped, her relief clear. </p><p>“Yes, but it was a close call. I have a lot to tell —” I started, only for another familiar figure to walk from the mist. This time, one that was not as welcome. </p><p>Thomas. </p><p>The slight delay in his step was one of the two things he showed when he saw me, which would have already been enough for me to guess. But, his gaze lingering on the sword, with an obvious tint of recognition, was even more clear.</p><p>Not that I needed anything to be suspicious. The words of my attackers had already revealed that they were there to assassinate a guild leader and not a blacksmith. That had surprised me when I first heard it, but seeing the state of the fort, I had a good idea of what had happened. </p><p>They triggered an artificial monster wave. It was nowhere near enough to destroy the fort, but it probably killed most of the hunters, especially if they were caught unawares. </p><p>It was a transparent ploy, which was why I said nothing. Eleanor was not stupid, and there was no chance she wasn’t suspecting Thomas. And, she was more direct than me. The fact that he was alive meant that we couldn’t touch him.</p><p>“So, this is your friend that’s … brave enough to set a guild in this godforsaken town,” Thomas said, with clear distaste toward either my apparent age — I looked in my late forties with the bushy beard and the few silver, bleached hair mixing with the black — or the fact that his assassination plot had failed. </p><p>Eleanor’s expression twisted in anger for a moment before it smoothed. “I don’t see how that’s any of your business, Sir Thomas,” she replied, managing to keep her tone mostly smooth, then she turned to me. “It’s good that you’re alive. Follow me.” </p><p>“Wait a second, Eleanor. I want to hear it as well. I want to know how you failed in such a spectacular manner. I still need to report it to the family, along with the disappearance of the steward.” </p><p>“The latter is not my problem, Thomas. You have already questioned all the guards under your Charisma, and they confirmed that he left. I can’t be responsible for the security of any visitor,” she said, then smirked. “Especially since someone had taken all the family guards for a more important mission. Maybe you should explain that to the family head.” </p><p>Thomas didn’t look happy with the accusation. “Maybe I should interrogate him as well, just in case,” he said, and a familiar pressure landed on me. Charisma. </p><p>I hated it, but I was happy to note that, compared to the last time, it was much weaker. Previously, I wasn’t the target, yet I froze helplessly. This time, despite being the focus, it was just all of my instincts shouting at me to obey and kneel. </p><p>Being on a higher level helped significantly. Charisma was incredibly useful, but as a tool for subjugation, its effectiveness dropped significantly. </p><p>Admittedly, it was far from something easy to ignore. It was still a primal sensation, begging me to kneel just to avoid the feeling. If I tried to fight against him, it would be an incredibly difficult thing. It was why people with Charisma were treasured and feared in equal measures. </p><p>Yet, a chuckle escaped my mouth. I couldn’t help it. The fear effect felt too familiar. </p><p>It was a weaker version of what I felt whenever I tried to fly. </p><p>Thomas immediately pulled his Charisma at my reaction, his expression showing abject terror. At the same time, his two guards stepped forward, like they wanted to defend him, while Eleanor stood in front of me. </p><p>“I’ll report your failure to the family again, Eleanor. You can’t rely on hired help,” Thomas said as he turned and left, the two guards followed, keeping themselves between me and Thomas. </p><p>I watched them, not making a move. </p><p>Wondering what the hell had just happened. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I watched silently as the group shuffled about. “How should we split?” one of them asked. </p><p>“Call me leader, you arrogant swine,” the leader responded, which gave me a clue about the state of their group. They had not been together for a long time. “Just for that, you have to go and find him alone.” </p><p>“You can’t be serious. You think you’re my owner just because you got hired a day before us?” </p><p>“I’m the only one that has an Epic skill,” the leader declared smugly. “Do you want to come and test it?” </p><p>I listened to them carefully, trying to understand what was going on.

Though, maybe they had — rightfully — assumed that the steward had only died because of his carelessness, and a team of thugs would be able to kill me based on sheer numerical advantage. </p><p>But, if it was the case, they were clearly not briefed fully. </p><p>I wished that I was wearing the silver alloy set I had forged for myself. I left them below to keep under the radar, but it was clearly a mistake. I would have been feeling far more confident if I were wearing weapons that would hold against them. </p><p>Ultimately, as long as they split, and I can ambush the remaining ones, I would be able to deal with them soon enough. </p><p>“Leader, maybe we shouldn’t be taking it lightly. I don’t think he’ll be happy if we fail. It would be bad if he blames you for this moron’s idiocy,” one of the others intervened, showing common sense to deflate the tension. </p><p>I respected that attitude. Too bad it marked him as a priority target. The last thing I needed was someone calm and calculating to help. </p><p>“Alright, he can take the two idiots here,” he said. “Since they failed their only task, they can redeem themselves. He will be slowed down by the monsters, so you can catch up easily.” </p><p>They argued a little more, but I wasn’t able to hear all of it, busy slowly retreating. I kept the camouflage up until I was safely in the mist, and after that, I shifted my location, using Fleeting Step to look for a nice ambush location, merely two hundred yards away from the dungeon gate. I knew the general direction they would be taking, and finding them would be easy. </p><p>I just needed to follow the sound of fighting. </p><p>Still, I was happy that I cleaned the immediate surroundings, or, even with Fleeting Step, I couldn’t have avoided the monsters without making too much noise. </p><p>Once I found a nice ambush spot, I activated the camouflage ring once more, waiting for them to pass under me, shuffling slightly to make sure I would be merely a few yards away from them when I was forced to drop the camouflage field. </p><p>To make my job even easier, they were arguing as they ran, not paying enough attention to their surroundings. </p><p>I waited until they passed me and then attacked, targeting the one with the Rare skill first. To his credit, he managed to react to my assault in time, far faster than I had expected. His Dexterity score must have been amazing. </p><p>Unfortunately, he tried to parry my hammer strike with his sword. </p><p>[-50 Vitality]</p><p>My full-powered attack taught him the disadvantages of doing so immediately. His sword didn’t break, but merely deflected. He tried to throw himself to the side, but it was too late. It might have been different if he was wearing armor that matched his sword in quality … but he did not. </p><p>The other two weren't even able to react. Technically, a hammer was considerably slower than a sword in combat, but that was only true when comparing the skills of equal rank and proficiency. They died just as easily. </p><p>“Hey, morons, what’s going on?” the leader shouted. I frowned, unhappy that they had caught on to the fact that something was wrong. A mistake on my part, but I didn’t have the time to regret it. </p><p>“A monster swarm. We’re surrounded, and the idiots are already dead,” I shouted back, hoping that the panic would cover up the fact that I didn’t sound the same. At the same time, I grabbed one of the bodies and dragged it away. </p><p>It was a hasty plan, but not a terrible one. It was clear that they had been gathered together recently, and their hiring was obviously a hasty job, meaning that they weren’t used to their tactical acumen.</p><p>I took the sword, his cloak, and his pouches away, but touched nothing else. I threw the body to the nearest monster that was in a relatively concealed spot, and retreated more, gathering and agitating monsters near a hundred-yard radius, but killed none, deliberately turning them into a swarm. </p><p>Then, I once again ditched them by climbing up a steep cliff using the Fleeting Step. Once again, I activated the ring, watching them from high up. </p><p>“I can’t believe you broke another vial. You’re a disgrace,” the leader shouted. “I’ll make sure to deal with you.” </p><p>I had no idea what that vial was other than what I could derive from the context. I pulled open the pouches and found one bottle that was glowing with energy. I didn’t know how it worked, but a quick tap on the glass confirmed that it was breakable. </p><p>I threw it to a distance, right at the edge of my field of vision. A small flash of mana spread, and then I was hit by a subtle smell. Just like that, the monsters started gathering wildly. My eyes widened, wondering what would have happened if I used that on the fourth floor. </p><p>Maybe it would have gathered enough monsters to give me an Epic skill. However, at that moment, I was more than happy with wasting it. One against five, each with Rare skills with the exception of their leader, who had an Epic skill, was not a favorable confrontation. </p><p>I would take any advantage I could. The monsters rushed toward them, accompanied by the sound of fighting. Some of the monsters started to attack me despite my concealment. </p><p>“That’s a problem,” I said as I started running, ditching them. However, the smell of the potion they had used to trigger the swarm was still enough to make them chase more than they were used to. </p><p>Once again, I circled their approximate location, and once again prepared to attack them from behind. Ultimately, it was my best chance. </p><p>When I found them, they were already dealing with the monster wave, careless enough to spread so that they could deal with the monsters more smoothly. Currently, only two of them were visible due to mist. A mistake, one that I could truly leverage thanks to my newly discovered trick of enhancing Fleeting Step with Health.</p><p>As much as I wanted to, slowly getting close to them under concealment was not an option, as it wasn’t effective against the monsters. </p><p>Instead, I moved forward as smoothly as possible, using my newly acquired sword against the monsters to avoid making loud sounds. Though, it was certainly a smooth experience, both the quality of the sword and the enchantment made the task even easier. </p><p>Notably, even with its apparent quality, it still degraded as I killed the beasts. It was considerably slower, but it still did. </p><p>“Finally, you’re here,” one of them began talking as he caught me from the corner of his eye while I approached even closer, the cloak and the sword enough to disguise myself as my past victim. I walked closer, keeping the cloak tight around me. </p><p>Before I could kill the two, I entered the field of view of the third one. It was the one that I identified as the smart one. “He’s an imposter!” he shouted. The speed he noticed despite everything suggested he had perception. </p><p>A big problem. Luckily, without proper armor, they couldn’t just ignore the monsters and regroup. I caught up with the first one before they could. With our weapons equal, the proficiency difference proved deadly.</p><p>Before the others could arrive, I had already decapitated him. “Quick, gather together,” the calm one shouted, recognizing the threat. It was too late. I switched to my hammer even as I used the enhanced version of the Fleeting Step for the first time. </p><p>Covering twenty yards in an instant, making a loud noise in the process. </p><p>[-7 Health]</p><p>“He’s not a warrior, but some kind of rogue!” he shouted. </p><p>It was interesting. Not the part that he assumed I was a rogue, as he clearly misread the Fleeting Step. The interesting part was that he assumed that I was a warrior, and not a blacksmith. But, the implications of that, I could think about later. </p><p>He tried to defend himself, but he wasn’t ready for me to switch to a Hammer. And he was certainly not ready for a full blow. </p><p>[-50 Vitality]</p><p>Lack of information was always deadly. Health was useful against monsters, but against people, it wasn’t as effective unless it was paired with a strong set of armor to protect the vitals. Health wasn’t enough to recover from a body shattered into minced meat. </p><p>While the leader, with his Epic skill, was the biggest threat, I hunted the remaining three first, their unfamiliarity with the insect monsters making it a smooth achievement. The way they fought against in the midst of the insect swarm belied their unfamiliarity. </p><p>“You think you can fight against me? I own an Epic skill. I’m untouchable,” the leader shouted as I attacked him. </p><p>“Good point,” I shouted back even as I moved back, looted the four fallen ones out of their weapons and pouches, and retreated with a loud fanfare, using Health-Enhanced fleeting speed quickly several times. </p><p>At this point, the swarm had grown big enough to exhaust him. I retreated back to the gate, listening to him fight even as I forged myself an iron spear, using the benefits of my advanced Forging to my benefit. It was a thick piece of bulky garbage, but it didn’t look like it. It looked like something a king would use during a parade. </p><p>One with a nasty surprise hidden inside. </p><p>I worked on it until the sound from the insect swarm started to lessen, then, I rushed forward. “You again,” he growled, but his eyes widened as he saw my ‘amazing’ spear, glowing blue. “A magic spear!” he gasped in fear. </p><p>So, when I threw it against him, he treated it as a deadly plague. That was the other problem with skills. While they gave perfect combat advice, that advice relied on the perception of the user. </p><p>A deep, crackling wave of vitality energy gathered around the sword as he countered the spear, which shattered into pieces. It wasn’t a deadly explosion, nothing more than thin metal shards. </p><p>It was enough to make him close his eyes in panic. I closed the distance with another burst, one last hammer blow enough to bring the fight to an end. </p><p>I pulled his body from the middle of the swarm in case I needed the evidence, and I continued to kill the monsters.</p><p>I needed to come up with a convincing story. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had a large smile on my face, flipping and playing around with a coin in hand, using Observe to examine it. There wasn’t anything other than perfectly aligned microstructures inside the metal, surrounded by a complicated enchantment I couldn’t even begin to comprehend. </p><p>However, this time, my aim wasn’t to solve anything. I just wanted to push Observe to its limit, to get a better understanding of what was going on. It had been easy to empower the spear attack and the Fleeting Step. Ultimately, it was an external object. </p><p>The Observe Perk wasn’t as clear-cut. I didn’t even know where to target. The object I was observing? My eyes? My brain? The latter two, in particular, weren’t exactly easy concepts. I still remembered how close I came to killing myself when I had tried to reverse Meditation. </p><p>Pushing a burst of life energy that I had modified blindly to a weapon was one thing, my brain was something else. Still, even with the risks, it was hard to ignore the temptation — </p><p>My thoughts were cut short when I arrived at the gate and saw two people waiting. From the way their posture shifted, I guessed that I was the target. I shifted my shield slightly while I looked at them at the same time, trying to see what was going on. </p><p>Unfortunately, due to the dungeon mist blocking my view, when I saw them, they were already forty yards away. Not exactly a dangerous distance, but not safe either. </p><p>“Hello, friend,” one of them called loudly, their weapons in hand. It wasn’t exactly a friendly call.  </p><p>I didn’t bother hiding my sudden tenseness as I looked at the two. I vaguely remembered seeing them at the dungeon, hunting monsters with a relatively decent success rate. They were not weak. However, unless they were hiding their power very well, they weren’t strong enough to threaten me. </p><p>Even with what I had revealed to the public — a strong warrior, capable enough to start his own guild — it shouldn’t be enough for the two to target me. Then, there was another problem. How did they know I would be at this gate? </p><p>It wasn’t the one I used in the morning. I chose to use different gates, as it made cleaning them easier. Then, why were they waiting here, where it was more dangerous, instead of ambushing me when I appeared on the other side. </p><p>It was already suspicious before one of them touched a ring, a thin line of mana appeared, and went through the door. </p><p>“So, what’s this about?” I asked, staying in place, trying to decide what to do. The message explained how they were at the gate, as obviously, they were just on the lookout. </p><p>“Since you are lucky while hunting, we thought that you might share some of your riches with the less fortunate,” one declared, trying to sound confident, but unable to hide his tenseness. </p><p>I didn’t need to read his tone perfectly to understand what was going on. This was a premeditated ambush, one that had nothing to do with the shells, or a mere payout of sixty gold coins. While that sounded like an incredible payout at face value, they had used an object that was capable of sending messages across dungeon floors. </p><p>While I wasn’t exactly familiar with the high-end magical item market, even the cheapest communication devices were measured in gold coins, which was the reason the world once again relied on letters and parcel delivery for communication. </p><p>To send messages between dungeon floors, which were famously isolated, would be expensive. Prohibitively so for two robbers who were weak enough to restrict themselves to a low-level dungeon with a hostile environment. </p><p>Meaning, they weren’t here for the cart. Still, it required one last test. “Fine, take it. I don’t need any trouble for measly sixty gold pieces,” I said as I started walking away, though I picked a diagonal route so that their target would be obvious.</p><p>“Hey, wait,” they said and started to move toward me, but before they could pick up speed, I was already running back. However, I didn’t run away. </p><p>No, I had a different plan in mind. Whoever planned the ambush was targeting me, and running away meant that I would be blind. Instead, I deliberately took a wide circle, the Fleeting Step allowing me to move easily. When I arrived at the gate, they were still searching for me in the mist, too loud. </p><p>I ignored them as I put the camouflage ring from my pocket, and put it to my finger. However, I remembered how the slight glow allowed me to discover its previous owner, and also hid behind a rock. Also, the camouflage effect was hardly flawless. It wouldn’t fool anyone with Perception if I waited out in the open. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to ignore the fact that I might end up taking another life. It was not the first time, and I was just trying to defend myself, but it was still an uncomfortable thing for me. Waiting for them to arrive while the two desperately searched for me made it even worse. </p><p>It felt more like cold-blooded murder than self-defense, and not for no reason. There was neither a judge nor a jury that would classify what I was about to do as self-defense, claiming that I had ample time to retreat. The legal system was long gone, along with the other conveniences of modern civilization, but for three years, I refused to embrace the Wild West mentality. </p><p>I would have retreated … if it wasn’t for my most recent discovery about the so-called peace wards. I could feel in my bones that their existence was a bane to humanity, but I couldn’t simply rely on past laws as my personal ethical framework. </p><p>But, I was also aware of how bad of a slippery slope it could be. A complicated question … one that I failed to resolve when six people stepped out of the dungeon door, only to see a full cart, but no sign of fighting. </p><p>The way they dressed was interesting. Their armor looked poor, and they were carrying a sword and a wooden staff, like they were here to hunt in the dungeon. However, the way they walked showed that they felt no danger from the dungeon. </p><p>“What’s going on?” their leader shouted while one of them split from the group, moving to deal with an approaching insect. </p><p>“Sorry, sir. He turned out to be a coward. He escaped,” the lookout shouted, and the leader started shouting about incompetence. However, seeing that the two lookouts were alive, their alertness had dropped significantly. </p><p>The two returned, and the leader chewed them up. Meanwhile, I carefully watched the one dealing with the monster, trying to get his measure. It was not a simple task, but as I watched him bisecting a charging monster easily, I could make a few guesses. </p><p>The first was his sword skill. With my own sword skill near the peak, I was able to read it relatively easily. It wasn’t exactly an accurate call, but it was at least a Rare one, with the potential to be even better. However, from the smoothness of his actual delivery, I would guess his proficiency wasn’t too high. Merely in the twenties if it was Rare, potentially even lower if it was even better.  </p><p>Something I could use to my advantage. The higher the proficiency of a skill, the more it helped its user deal with more complicated situations, something I knew from experience. </p><p>I stayed hidden, now observing not the one dealing with the stray beasts, but the others. </p><p>Right now, with the distance between me and them, there was no benefit of charging forward. Whether I let them go while staying hidden or wanted to attack, time worked to my benefit. </p><p>Also, if I was being honest, I wanted one of them to confirm that they were here to kill me. Killing people was a more difficult decision than killing mindless monsters.  </p><p>I waited and watched, trying to see where they had come from. The leader was clearly not too experienced, as he was wasting time chewing out failure when he could chase me. Of course, it would be the wrong move with me hidden behind them, but he didn’t know that. </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention to their weapons. Unlike their armor, their weapons were works of art. Smooth, made of an alloy I couldn’t recognize immediately, and clearly enchanted with something far fancier than a commonplace enchantment like Sharpness. </p><p>Not the kind of weaponry a bunch of bandits who wanted to make a quick buck would carry, which further confirmed a ploy. Technically, they could be here to make me an offer, but at best, it would be the kind that came with the dreaded ‘or else’ statement. </p><p>“Alright, just find him and kill him. I’m sure he went to the nearest gate,” the leader called soon enough. I smiled darkly. At least it solved my ethical dilemma. </p><p>I watched, waiting for them to act … and maybe learn how they discovered my identity.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Beautiful,” I repeated as I looked at the forge area, still feeling surprised by the change I was able to achieve in less than four hours. The huge blast furnace was still spitting out fires, but was at its last batch. At the same time, the number of iron shelves I built had reached more than a hundred, though the number and sizes of their sections varied. </p><p>Some of them even had iron doors in case I wanted to isolate the samples from the environment. It was a poor substitute for a sterilized environment, but it was good enough. </p><p>Still, it was temporary. The next step was to dig down to create a basement for those materials, but I delayed that a bit. After all, I was already digging a huge pit to mine the iron ore. It would be easier to use that rather than trying to dig a second pit. </p><p>However, while those changes had been nice, the real source of pride was the steam engine that sat on top of another iron platform, sputtering as it consumed the last of its fuel. The more I dug, the more water seeped into the resulting pit, so I had to make the pump faster than I had been initially planning. </p><p>As a result, it was a simple atmospheric water engine, an early type of steam engine famous for being inefficient. It had a huge cylinder, which was filled with hot steam to rise to the top, and once that reached the top, it triggered a switch, which cut the steam feed. Another flip opened, spraying some cold water to cool down the steam. Condensing steam created a vacuum, and atmospheric pressure dealt with the rest. </p><p>Then, it repeated the cycle. </p><p>It was inefficient and bulky, but it was also mechanically simple enough that I was able to put it together in mere minutes. </p><p>And, inefficiency was easy to deal with thanks to the intensity of the fire. Too bad I would have to redo the whole setup to add a separate condensing chamber and a flywheel tomorrow, which would require a complete redesign, which would allow me to add a crank to connect to the feeder of the blast furnace, automating that part as well. </p><p>I didn’t do so immediately, because I needed to check the designs. While I knew how such an engine worked conceptually, the exact mechanical details weren’t as clear. And, like anything else mechanical, the System was utterly helpless. </p><p>“There is always a gap between the theory and the application,” I muttered even as I walked away. I still had some time to experiment, but not without sacrificing hunting time.</p><p>Today, I wanted to increase the number of shells I collected to fifteen hundred, which would give me a revenue of sixty gold, which would give me the necessary money to build a modest residence and hire some guild members. Technically, I could get away with hiring something like twenty members, and build an elite team that could generate me some income, but I didn’t want that. </p><p>No, I needed to hire as many people as I could manage. The more crowded they were, the more nonsensical tasks I could slip in — like coming up with some designs for a steam engine. </p><p>Trying to build a tech base was not a one-person job. </p><p>Maybe I should look into hiring farmers in bulk. Not only could I give them a better living, but it would also give me a way to use the excessive number of rare Nurture skills I had while giving me an excuse to move a ludicrous amount of carts around. </p><p>I doubted that I would be able to make a profit, but I didn’t really care. </p><p>I went back to the third floor and used the extractor to start hunting. First few, I killed using my sword, pushing the skill even further</p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon)  79 -&gt; 91]</p><p>Admittedly, by increasing that much, I was playing it a bit risky, but the promise of a Rare skill that I could publicly use was too valuable. Especially since I was confident in my method of improvement. </p><p>“Speaking of methods,” I muttered even as I switched to the spear, and started pushing my health through its heft, trying to replicate the Vitality attack without the assistance of the skill. I pushed merely a point or two, trying to shape it. </p><p>Every time I killed an insect, I tried to use that attack. And, I failed. Again and again. </p><p>From a certain point of view, what I had been doing was a waste of time. It wouldn’t take long before I would upgrade both skills to rare, which would give me superior Vitality attacks. However, that was the exact reason I had been trying to do so. </p><p>The Vitality attack from the hammer was even more complicated than the Mana Blow from Forging. And, even  Mana Blow, I wasn’t able to properly reverse-engineer. If I ever wanted to discover the trick behind Vitality attacks, I needed better insights. </p><p>“First, the movement,” I said even as I paused, trying to put together the impression of the two energies. From what I could tell — from my extremely limited perception — Mana behaved mostly like a gas, though there were aspects where it behaved more like a liquid. </p><p>Except for the times it reached certain geometrical patterns and suddenly solidified, which was what enabled the delivery of the Mana attacks. </p><p>Of course, that was just how it reacted in Mana Attacks using the weapon as a medium. I didn’t have the slightest idea what actually happened while casting a spell. </p><p>In comparison, Health was more consistently liquid, but the feeling it gave differed between uses. When it was used for healing, it flowed almost gently. When used as a part of the Nurture, it had a slow, sluggish feel, almost like tar. </p><p>When used to support an attack, it felt more like mercury, rapid yet heavy at the same time. The feeling of my hammer attack and Eleanor’s ranged attack had been similar enough. </p><p>However, it differed at the point of trigger. Mana simply dispersed after the attack — whether it vanished or simply took a form I couldn’t perceive was another question — while Vitality, for the lack of a better term, burned. </p><p>However, it wasn’t a sense of burning life flames. Maybe implosion was a better descriptor, but ignition still felt more accurate. However, regardless of the term, the process was clear. The energy dissipated, turning into the effect of the attack. </p><p>At least, that was how the Quake effect worked. The Health spread into some kind of shatter pattern, then at once, ignited to shatter the target. Combined with the blow from the hammer, it shattered the target perfectly.  </p><p>“Maybe that’s what I’m doing wrong,” I said even as I stood up, ignoring the slight delay it would cause. Ultimately, I was trying to replicate the feeling of a hammer attack with a spear. And, as much as the scientist inside me wanted to argue that it shouldn’t matter, considering the way the System worked, it likely did. </p><p>And, since a hammer attack required that smashing effect, maybe I should try to lean into a piercing concept — </p><p>“I’m a moron,” I muttered even as I slapped my head. I had missed something even more obvious. Yes, a spear method of delivering damage was piercing, but my variant was also about movement. Both the Perk I chose, and the name of Swift Spear implied it. </p><p>I closed my eyes as I ran a few steps, using Fleeting Step to change directions rapidly, climb a steep hill, and even make a few pointlessly complicated dancing moves, replicating a ballet routine perfectly. And, the more I repeated it, the more I realized the distinct concept of the Fleeting Step. </p><p>Just like the Vitality attack from the Hammer Art carried a sense of earthquake. </p><p>“I hope I won’t blow my feet off,” I muttered even as I used Fleeting Step again, but this time, I pushed that mercurial variant of Vitality to my feet. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>Pain hit me. </p><p>Yet, I laughed, simply because of the source of pain. It wasn’t my legs like I feared, but my head. I wasn’t able to compensate for the sudden burst of speed and lost my balance. “Again,” I muttered as I stood up. </p><p>For the next twenty minutes, I stumbled around like I was reenacting a drunk scene from a terrible comedy. Yet, every repeat only made my smile bigger and bigger. I might not be able to stand on my feet, but it didn’t change the fact that I was able to imitate a Vitality attack, and did so on something that was not actually an attack. </p><p>I was able to use it … somewhat. It allowed me to burst forward in a straight line, but it was certainly loud. Also, it was hard to maintain balance if I tried to push over twenty yards. </p><p>“Let’s see. What’s the core of a spear technique? A quick, merciless piercing attack,” I said, trying to focus on that concept, trying to imitate the shape of Mana as I used a chisel to stab the nearest stone. My spear sank deep.  </p><p>“Success,” I chuckled. Of course, it wasn’t the fact that I was able to stab through a rock, which I could have done before. No, the proof was the ragged, uneven edge. </p><p>Then, even in success, I froze. Since I could somehow empower the movement perk with life energy, could I do the same with other perks. </p><p>Like Observe? </p><p>I could feel my heart beating with excitement. If that was possible, the implications were incredible. </p><p>It looked like I knew exactly what I would be doing tonight. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 26</p><p>As much as I wanted to spend the next month reading every book Eleanor had brought and carefully learn everything I could, I knew that it wasn’t the best method to go forward. Improving my skills as far as possible by creating mana alloys was the far superior option. </p><p>The amount of information skills contained was incredible, and the perks were even more fascinating. </p><p>So, I restricted myself to reading material science articles that were relevant to my objectives, and merely skimmed the rest before I started to work on the forge. </p><p>This time, I had a large pile of broken shells to keep me going for several days. The best thing was that, it wasn’t really wasteful. I already needed to break them into small pieces to use for forging, so they wouldn’t be useless. </p><p>I stopped only when my reserves had been filled. </p><p>[Mana (160/160)] </p><p>Reserves weren't enough to forge one ingot, which meant I didn’t have the luxury of following the recipe directly. I could have easily compensated for it with my Mana Blow perk, but the lack of environmental mana erased that possibility. </p><p>Meaning, I had to try more than a dozen times before I successfully forged a piece as small as my thumb. Even then, I would have failed if it wasn’t for Intuitive Forging giving me some last minute burst. </p><p>“Regardless, a success,” I muttered as I flipped the small piece. It was a sign of progress. The first mana alloy I had ever forged. “Too bad the System didn’t reward me.” Still, it didn’t surprise me too much. What I had done was much harder than just using one of the bronze alloys to forge a dagger, but the System didn’t measure difficulty the same way I did. Sometimes, it helped. </p><p>But, not always. </p><p>For Repair, that had been about both the general value of the weapon, and the extent of the damage to an equal measure. But, the sequence of the recipes that had been revealed made me suspect the materials had played even more of a  role than I had first estimated. </p><p>Copper clearly didn’t move the needle once the skill passed level twenties, while the bronze alloy’s effectiveness had been dropped. “Maybe I should try working with iron,” I said as I walked toward the cart. </p><p>Even a partial success could push my skill higher. There was no harm in trying, afterall. </p><p>However, even as I reached for an iron alloy, I caught a more distinctive glint behind it. An ingot of silver. </p><p>“Surely not,” I said, about to ignore the idea the moment it occurred. Silver and gold were not exactly useful material when it came to practical applications, and they weren’t exactly common in the first place. Some people had collected a lot, trying to fake the System Currency, only to fail. Trying to make anything usable out of silver had failed the same way. </p><p>But then, none of those attempts had been done by a blacksmith that could use mana directly. I could have tried to mix the silver with the granules of shell and the other crystals, but I did not. Not when I had an easier option. </p><p>I cut my hand and bled on the molten metal, pushing some of my Health into my blood. </p><p>[-129 Health]</p><p>It was rather ghoulish. </p><p>I started to use Mana Blow, trying to taint the metal with my mana as I shaped it to a rough, thumb-sized cylinder. It was tricky without System directions, but my earlier successes had already taught me enough. Merely fifteen seconds later, I quenched it in water. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 25 -&gt; 29]</p><p>I was shocked by the ease with which I had managed to improve my skills. A changed attitude and a generous experimentation budget was working wonders. I sighed, realizing just how big of a mistake my earlier desire to seek stability had been. Luckily, it was not too late.</p><p>However, while the skill confirmation had been interesting, the ease with which I was able to embed mana into silver was even more interesting. It was able to crystallize around mana even better than bronze, taking almost ten times the amount of mana without any problems. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>“Let’s see if we can turn you into something useful,” I said to the silver as I started tapping it gently. It was a spectacular failure, shattering under my blows, but I didn’t care. I just melted it to cleanse it of my mana and blood, and repeated the process, stopping only to replenish my Health. </p><p>Of course, the experiment I was using was not cheap. The food I was consuming to replenish my Heath was not cheaper than using dungeon materials for forging, and the resulting metal was barely increased. But, the System counted it as a success, which was all I needed. </p><p>Two hours was all I needed to reach forty-five, and then, the gains slowed down. I could have slowed down there, but I did not. Instead, I went in a simpler direction and changed the material. </p><p>Gold. </p><p>There was no gold in the material Eleanor had brought, but it didn’t matter. I already have gold coins. I immediately melted five gold, forever ruining their ability to be used in System stores. Five gold coins barely gave me ten grams to work with, which, considering the density of the gold, was a tiny amount.</p><p>There wasn’t even any mana that bursted out, which was a pity. </p><p>Five experiments, all ending in failure. Probably, it wasn’t enough to trigger the System. I still noted the results as well as I could have managed. </p><p>It was frustrating, but not frustrating enough to slow me down. I was tempted to melt the rest of my coins, but a hundred grams was still not a lot of gold. And, it represented my current fortune, which I might end up having to rely on in case of an emergency. </p><p>I decided to delay that experiment, and try something else.</p><p>“Time to try changing up the experiment,” I said as I mixed that tiny amount of Gold into the silver, and repeated the experiment. It absorbed the mana even better, though similarly, it took more mana to count as a partial success. </p><p>I was glad that I didn’t try to experiment with silver or gold at first, or the System might not have upgraded my skill. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 42 -&gt; 46]</p><p>“Let’s see if I can turn you into a weapon,” I said. This time, the material had actually been malleable enough not to shatter while forging, though it was not exactly usable. But, it was hard to care when I was rewarded by another notification. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 46 -&gt; 52]</p><p>[Perk Options — Modify / Masterwork / Creative Forging (Intuitive Forging) / Mana Control (Mana Manipulation) ] </p><p>A tougher choice, this time between Mana Control and Creative Forging. A better mana control was tempting, but considering Meditation was already helping me on that aspect, and that I needed to invent more materials for alloy variants, I chose Creative Forging. </p><p>They might not have been as useful for me, but it was critical for more funding. </p><p>Then, I passed as I put my hand on the silver. “Just like I suspected,” I muttered. Once I had reached fifty, some new methods had been unlocked. Some better bronze alloys, but also some simple silver alloys. None of them used pure silver like I tried to, and instead used a much more minuscule amount. </p><p>Checking those processes, I could easily deduce its function. Silver was excellent to hold more mana, allowing the weapons to be more dense. But, even a small dagger forged that way would require thousands of points of Mana to actually forge successfully, which was not something I could do without environmental mana.</p><p>And, that meant that failing to trigger the improvement with gold as my material might not have been about the amount, but the mana density of the alloy. An interesting problem, but one I decided not to solve immediately. The next perk was at proficiency level a hundred, and even with all my tricks, it was inevitable that it would require more mana than I could extract from the broken shells. </p><p>Which meant that improving Repair was the far more efficient option. “Let’s cheat the System again.” There was no suggestion from the System on how to repair the damaged dagger, but applying the information I had gathered from forging on repairing was even easier. All I needed to do was to keep the Inspect skill active, so that the System registered the activities as a part of the repair effort. </p><p>”Recycling is fun,” I muttered even as I repeated the same process again and again. The only thing I wasted was my Health-enhanced blood, which was certainly renewable. </p><p> Damaging and repairing the same dagger repeatedly was not a fun process, especially when I had to stab myself again and again, but it was easy to endure as I watched my Repair increase. </p><p>And, when I had reached the next threshold, I immediately picked Advanced Inspect as my Perk. The other options looked good, but with the way I used it, getting an even more detailed view of the internal structure of the metals was not a sacrifice I could make. </p><p>“Now, to understand mana better,” I pondered, wondering whether I could push my Meditation to the next threshold before Eleanor’s next visit. </p><p>Not taking advantage of all that source of mana would have been a waste. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 27</p><p>During Eleanor’s next visit, I wasn’t able to bring my Meditation skill to a higher level, but it was close. A few times, I tried to practice my combat skill, but without an enemy to target, its progress was very limited. </p><p>I had dispersed my attempt to devour mana and instead grabbed the paper in front of me, making a show of taking notes. </p><p>[Mana Blacksmith - Level 32]</p><p>[Health 960/960] [Mana 0/160]</p><p>[Vitality 64 / Strength 64 / Dexterity 48 / Essence 16]</p><p>[Skills (4/10)</p><p>Mana Repair (Rare) - 62 [Advanced Inspect]</p><p>Mana Forge (Rare) - 59 [Creative Forging, Mana Manipulation]</p><p>Meditation (Common) - 42 [Controlled Flow, Enhanced Sensing]</p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 53]</p><p>I had to admit, I was fascinated by the development I had made. The only thing that lagged behind was my level, which would have to stay where it was until Maria returned to accompany me for another trip. </p><p>Eleanor returned, pulling another huge cart, but looked shocked when she looked at the pile in front of me. “You have already used more than half?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, yes,” I replied. “I told you, experimentation can be expensive. Besides, does it matter? I thought all of them were useless.” </p><p>“That might be so, but they are not unlimited. We barely have two more deliveries like this, and we run out of that stock,” she said. </p><p>“We can always break intact ones,” I said. </p><p>She looked unhappy about that. “We can’t waste our only source of income, not when we’re already running in the red,” she said, cutting sharply. “You have already wasted enough. Any more, and you’ll have to hunt them yourself.” </p><p>I was about to reveal some kind of partial success, when I stopped. “Wait, is that an option?” I said. </p><p>“Normally, I would have said no, as you don’t have the Dexterity required to stay out of their path but…” </p><p>“I don’t need to hit their weak points. I don’t need the shells to be intact,” I completed. </p><p>She nodded. “Actually, that might work. You still have the ring of camouflage, right?” she asked. </p><p>I nodded. </p><p>“Good, you can use that to leave the camp with me. And, once we get there, you can disguise as a guild member here to check the dungeon, thinking of joining the camp. That way, we can excuse the broken shells as some kind of sample your guild requires. There are several spots that you can use alone easily, especially with your Hammer of Might. It’s not a permanent solution, but we’re already operating under the dungeon’s limit until Lady Maria returns with the new recruits, so there’s no waste.” </p><p>“Excellent. That way, I can also observe those monsters destroying the weapons. It might give me a better direction about my experiments.” </p><p>“Nice point,” she said. ”Unfortunately, even the safe spots are relatively dangerous. You need to increase your hammer proficiency further before you can move alone.” </p><p>“It’s already at twenty seven, is that enough?” I asked. It was half of the real number, but even that was an absurd number. </p><p>A good choice, as her surprise was apparent, but not the point of shock. “Already,” she said. “I underestimated you. Let’s give you a new set of armor, pick a couple extra hammers, and we can move,” she said. </p><p>“Do they destroy the blunt weapons as well?” I asked. </p><p>“Not at the same rate, and the lack of an edge makes them last longer, but eventually, they get destroyed as well. Still, four hammers should be enough to take down about forty, which should be what you can take down and bring in.” </p><p>“Excellent. I just need to bring a few ingots so I can repair my weapons,” I said as I followed her. </p><p>“Can you do that without a forge?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes, but it’ll be slower,” I said, which was a bit of misrepresentation. Technically, there was a way I could do so, but it would be pointlessly inefficient. I wanted to bring them because I wanted to see if I could use mana forging as a cold forging method. “By the way, do you have a sword skill I can use,” I added. “Something that focuses on defense. I love my hammer, but I don’t think it’s a good weapon to use against an assassin.“ </p><p>“Hmm, you receive one point to your Dexterity, right,” she said. I nodded. “I have an uncommon skill called Stalwart Guard that focuses more on shield than a sword. We purchased several during the initial tests, but it didn’t work as well as we had hoped against the insect monsters.” </p><p>“Exactly what I need,” I replied as I followed her to the armory once more. She pulled that skill stone from a dusty shelf, showing it wasn’t touched for a long time. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Stalwart Guard (Uncommon)]</p><p>I immediately absorbed it, ignoring the pain and discomfort. While having two melee skills was a waste for most warriors, production classes received too many skill slots to care about that. Having a new style that could help me to defend against another potential assassin was worth using a slot. </p><p>Especially since improving it would take much less with my mana trick. </p><p>Once the pain of absorbing an external skill faded, I tested it a bit. One of the gladius-style short swords I had spent most of my time repairing worked wonderfully with it, but only when I had a shield ready. </p><p>“Not bad,” I muttered. Paired with a large shield, it could be used against someone with a larger armor. Once that was done, I slipped the ring back to my finger, activating the spell effect. Once that was done, I followed Eleanor, and sat behind her Griffin. </p><p>She said nothing at first. I grabbed the saddle desperately, wishing for a distraction. But, since I was supposed to not be there, I couldn’t say anything. The vertigo was even worse while watching my skin change color constantly. </p><p>Apparently, the camouflage spell didn’t count the back of a griffin as moving. A weird, arbitrary rule, but at this point, I was used to them. </p><p>“You can remove the ring,” she said. “ </p><p>“Finally,” I groaned as I put it in my pocket. </p><p>“You’re getting more used to flying,” she said. </p><p>“Y-yeah,” I answered, which was all I wanted to say about the subject. “Why don’t you tell me about the dungeon?” I said. While it was important, I was even more desperate for a distraction. </p><p>“Sure. You have been in a dungeon, right?” </p><p>“A few times, but merely for observation,” I said, which was true. Dungeons were truly fantastical. Self-sustaining closed spaces that didn’t correspond to their physical surroundings, constantly generating monsters that were capable of dropping items once killed like a video game. </p><p>Unfortunately, they were as fascinating as a venomous snake. They appeared without a rhythm. Some of them were easy to handle, and turned into a source of economic prosperity. The others were too dangerous to handle, requiring a dedicated force of experts to delve into the depths and destroy it. </p><p>And, some of them just went undiscovered, growing more and more until they exploded, spewing an army of monsters. </p><p>I had visited a few of them with hired escorts — when I was reasonably wealthy — to see what had been going on, but once I realized I lacked the tools to even start penetrating their mystery, I lost my interest. </p><p>The stars were fascinating as well, but I didn’t continuously look at the sky and hoped to figure out how a main sequence star worked. </p><p>“Really? Most people prefer to level up in the dungeons. It’s certainly more efficient, and drops help.” </p><p>Another fun detail. Only in dungeons, did monsters drop items. Outside, they just killed and died. </p><p>“No. I didn’t fight most of the time,” I said. “It’s rather new.” </p><p>“Nothing to be ashamed of. It makes your improvement even more impressive,” she said. “Now, the first thing you need to be careful of is that dungeons always have a mist that blocks the view. It depends on the type, but even the best one is merely more than three hundred yards. Our dungeon has a fifty yard range. Not exactly horrible, but enough to remove the probability of melee combat. We have some flare scrolls for emergencies, but you need to angle them correctly for the people to notice.” </p><p>“Understood,” I said. </p><p>“The monsters inside are not exactly fast, but they can turn and twitch surprisingly quickly, which makes hitting their weak spots a challenge. Also, be careful about their mandibles. They can cut through armor. And, once you kill them, you have less than a minute before their shell melts, which can be difficult solo.” </p><p>“Not for me. I can just rip a large piece,” I said. “How about the drops?” </p><p>“Nothing much. Their drops are pretty rare in the first place. Mostly some basic skills, a couple common ones, and a few spell schemas. Nothing that goes for more than a few silver, basically negligible with the current scale.” </p><p>“What about the crystals and the herbs?” </p><p>“Those grow on the dungeon walls, and the System Shop buys them. Some of them can even go for a gold or two.” </p><p>“I’m guessing they are rare, or they would be the main source of income,” I said. </p><p>“Yes. They grow on their own, and require constant exploration. Other than them, there’s not much vegetation in this dungeon. It’s more like a lifeless desert of stone, interrupted only by some shrubbery.” </p><p>“Sound drab,” I said. </p><p>“I prefer drab over complicated every day. Once, I fought in a jungle dungeon. Trees everywhere, hiding venomous monsters behind. It was pretty much hell.” </p><p>I shuddered. She was right. Lifeless desert sounded much better than a jungle. </p><p>“Luckily, it’s merely stuck in a constant twilight rather than darkness, so we don’t have to deal with torches. Now, about the movement of the monsters. The first thing you need to pay attention to is…” </p><p>Most of the points she mentioned were obvious, but I still listened to them with rapt attention. </p><p>It was much better than focusing on my current mode of transportation. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 28</p><p>“Don’t forget to keep your helmet on, just in case,” Eleanor said even as we landed. Only when the movement of the griffin stopped, I opened my eyes once again. “Your beard is impressive, but let’s not take a risk.”</p><p>I scratched my beard. Forcing it to grow faster was one of the pointless tricks I could do with Health. I just needed to keep it focused on my face, and it quickened the hair growth. A little bleach, and I comfortably looked like someone in mid-forties rather than thirty-one.</p><p>Not all disguises needed to be elaborate. </p><p>“Sure,” I said even as I looked around, taking note of the environment. The first thing that caught my gaze was the gate made of glowing energy, about ten feet tall and half as wide, enough for two people to pass at once. </p><p>Dungeon Gate. The biggest problem Earth had ever faced, but also the biggest source of our growth. Talk about a mixed bag. </p><p>Interestingly, contrary to my expectation, there was no mana around the glowing gate. I had always assumed that they were dense in terms of mana. Another curiosity I wanted to explore, but it was not the time. </p><p>Around it, was a fortress to defend it, garrisoned by merely twenty guards. It was one benefit of mana dead location. The monsters around were much weaker, though inability to employ mages for anything other than emergencies reduced even that advantage somewhat. </p><p>It wasn’t a fully fledged camp, but more of a keep, with merely a few buildings in its limits. From the open gate, I could see a secondary wall outside, currently holding several carriages, probably there to transport the gains to the camp. </p><p>Looking outside, I could see why they hadn’t simply built their frontier camp next to the dungeon. It was on top of a hill, making any large-scale construction difficult. On the flipside, it was easy to defend against the monsters. A benefit, as it was a well known fact that monsters had a tendency to attack dungeon gates from outside. </p><p>A defensible location made a dungeon more valuable. And, one advantage of a mana dead location was that the number of monsters was considerably lesser. No wonder they continued to operate the dungeon even after Thomas took the official guards away. </p><p>However, it was clear that the fort wasn’t relying just on an easily defensible position. It had four large towers, each holding three siege weapons. Large ballistas, to be exact. Their presence was rare, but they were still a part of defending towns. </p><p>I couldn’t help but sigh as I looked at them. The existence of the siege weapons had been another problem that prevented the growth of the Blacksmiths. </p><p>They were just rarely used. A part of it was the cost. I didn’t know for sure how much they cost, but considering our town only had a dozen of them to defend a much larger area, I guessed that they were valued based on platinum coins. Their ammunition was equally expensive, but effective, perfect for taking larger monsters that threatened the stationary defenses. </p><p>Ironically, their use case prevented the blacksmiths’ growth even more. </p><p>One problem was making them. There was no recipe for making siege weapons in our Forge and Repair skills, something that continued to be true for my mana variants. Which meant, no easy construction. </p><p>If that had been the only problem, it could have been bypassed. Ultimately, the design of a ballista wasn’t exactly the most complicated thing. Even if we couldn’t make them as good as the other weapons, as long as blacksmiths could forge them for cheaper, the quantity could be used to cover up quality. Once the walls were covered up with hundreds of ballistas, the towns would be even more secure. </p><p>The real problem with that strategy was that using siege weapons didn’t trigger the System. It meant, no matter how many monsters had been killed by siege weapons, there was no System feedback, meaning no leveling up, and no upgrade of skills. </p><p>And, since the monsters’ attack on the town was one of the safest ways people could level up, the blacksmiths that tried to develop that direction had been quick to abandon that path. It was another reason to believe that, in the larger scheme of things, Blacksmiths were truly useless, even among the other production classes. </p><p>A fact I had also believed up until very recently. </p><p>Maybe I would try my hand on making some ammunition. Making an actual ballista was equally tempting, but since I either needed to coordinate with a woodworker, or forge it purely out of metal, which would take too much material.</p><p>Not to mention, I could hardly hide it when someone visited. </p><p>“I know it can be stressful to enter a dungeon, but please focus. You’re representing your guild,” Eleanor called, pulling me out of my pondering, also reminding me that I was supposed to be an employee for another guild. </p><p>“I was just checking the quality of the defenses,” I said loudly. “We need to make sure the dungeon won't be any trouble.” </p><p>“Not to worry. We’re very careful to defend both sides,” she said. “Now, follow me.” </p><p>I did, and stepped through the glowing gate. A brief vertigo hit me as I was enveloped by light. </p><p>The next time I was on the ground, I was in a land of twilight, surrounded by a thick mist. At the edge of the mist, tall walls rose, far thicker than the ones outside. Sixteen towers rose high, tall enough that I couldn’t see their top, but I had no doubt that they held multiple ballistas. </p><p>As I examined the defenses, I was starting to believe that I might have misunderstood the true power of the Griffin family. It wasn’t just the number of siege weapons. I didn’t know much about the dungeons, but I knew that not many organizations dared to establish permanent encampments inside the dungeon. </p><p>It made the operation far more efficient, but it also required a significant commitment to defend. It explained why Thomas taking the family forces away troubled them so much. Without the encampment, they would have been able to just reduce the number of trips but still work with a somewhat high efficiency. </p><p>Now, with their forces split into three different encampments, they had to keep their operation slow until the caravan could arrive with the new recruits. </p><p>No wonder they were losing money despite the incredible sales price of a shell. </p><p>I began to pay more attention to the operation as I followed her. </p><p>Unlike the other side of the camp, there were no buildings inside, just several open carts and a few workers currently piling them with bloody shells. “For now, you can use our fortress as a staging ground, but when your guild gets here, they need to establish their own fortress near ours,” she explained loudly enough for the others to hear. “For now, you can borrow one of our carts, but you have to drag it yourself.” </p><p>“That’s agreeable, Lady Eleanor,” I replied, playing the role even as I grabbed one of the carts and pulled it with me. It was not a challenging job for a blacksmith. </p><p>We didn’t say anything more as she led me outside, and I dragged a cart with me. Meanwhile, she passed me a small bundle. “In here, there’s a map, and multiple flares. It shouldn’t be any risk unless you go too deep, as the monsters can’t move fast enough to keep up with you, but be careful,” she said. “I won’t be able to stay with you. I have a patrol to lead.” </p><p>That was not a surprise. Dungeons were treated as a prime leveling spot, mostly because the risks inside were predictable, especially near the gate. Assuming, of course, there were regular patrols deeper to keep the monster density manageable. </p><p>I didn’t answer her immediately, but instead watched a scene at the edge of my vision. At a distance, there were two warriors, facing against an insect that was about two feet tall and five feet long, including the dangerous looking mandibles. One had poked it with a long spear, made of ordinary wood. The moment it poked against the shell, the wood started degrading. </p><p>The monster attacked him with a surprising burst of speed. He dodged the attacks multiple times, carefully leading it to his partner, waiting for an opportunity. Only when he caught the monster in the middle of its attack, he stabbed, sinking the blade to its mouth. </p><p>When he pulled, a sickly glow was around his sword, looking ruined. He probably could use it once more, but it would be the limit. However, the monster was not dead yet. </p><p>It required another stabbing, which turned the sword mostly useless. The two warriors managed to take an insect down in tandem in less than a minute. When it died, a small cloud of mana appeared. It dissipated even faster than usual. Even with my Meditation far higher than usual, I shouldn’t be able to absorb a point. </p><p>I smiled. While meditation wouldn’t have worked, the same wasn’t true for the mana blow trick I had improvised. It latched it to mana directly, so it should allow me to catch some mana. </p><p>I continued to watch as the one that had been playing the bait pulled a few weird looking implements, and used them to pull the largest piece of shell while keeping it pristine.</p><p>Interestingly, once the beast died, touching the shell didn’t cause any damage. </p><p>The shell piece they took was the biggest one, but it was still just a small piece, roughly round, from the center of its back. “They only take one piece?” I asked. </p><p>“That’s the only piece that can be sold for eight silver,” she replied. “The other pieces merely go for a silver, and it’s hard to extract them on time.” </p><p>I didn’t ask what she meant. When they pulled back, the monster started fading into some kind of weird blue and white light that matched the dungeon’s entrance. </p><p>Another feature of the dungeons. Absorbing the dead monster back. </p><p>Merely two minutes of work, and they were eight silver richer. Of course, minus all the costs, the fee for the access rights to the dungeon for access, and the cut the guards of the System Store would take… Still, not a bad profit. </p><p>“Looks easy,” I commented. </p><p>“It is, when they are alone,” she answered. “When they are more crowded, properly taking them down is very troubling.” Then, she looked at my hammer. “Not for you, of course,” she said as she led me away from the camp. </p><p>We walked about half a mile, before she brought me to a rocky area which limited mobility significantly. “This is the best place for you,” she said. “Our hunting teams don't get near here because it’s hard to properly bait them without a proper movement area.”</p><p>“But, it’s perfect for me,” I said even as I moved toward the nearest monster. It attacked me, but stepping sideways had been easy. I smashed my hammer down and retreated from the path of the attack smoothly. </p><p>My skill might be offensively oriented, dodging was still a part of it. It still took ten blows to bring the beast down, almost a minute. </p><p>Of course, that was without using mana. </p><p>“Excellent. You have eight hours before we return. Don’t get too far away, or do something stupid,” she said before she walked away. </p><p>I twirled my hammer. For the first time, I was feeling excited for a fight. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 29</p><p>I took down a few monsters while Eleanor walked away, still holding back, ripping the shells carelessly from their bodies. I didn't absorb the mana from them, both as a test of my abilities without mana assistance, and as a precaution in case she was still nearby. </p><p>Naturally, there was no reaction from the System. The insects were decent enemies, but not enough to help someone around level thirty to level up immediately. By spending about a minute each monster, the leveling efficiency would be much lower than trying to fight outside. </p><p>Then, there was the weapon destruction effect. While it wasn’t as much as directly plunging into the mouth of the beast, every hit to the shell degraded the weapon somewhat. It was impossible to notice it with the naked eye, but with the Advanced Inspect, I could easily watch the damage. That effect got even stronger once a shell was cracked. </p><p>It was some kind of spell, sticking to the surface of the metal to worm itself to the surface, almost working like acid for a second before fading away. </p><p>It was interesting, but I couldn’t focus on it as much as I wanted. Watching one of them bite a huge rock into two was enough to remind me that this operation was not without risk. Maybe I could spend more time testing it if the guards capture and immobilize one. </p><p>For now, it was time to improve my combat skills, and maybe gain a few levels. I first pulled the cart behind a rock. The monsters didn’t seem to care about inanimate objects, but even if they did, I didn’t care. Instead, I moved deeper into the rocky area, holding a broken shell in my hand. </p><p>Once I was sure that no one was around, I smashed it aggressively, and drained its mana. </p><p>[+3 Mana]</p><p>“Well, that was much less than I had hoped,” I muttered. Normally, I would be able to drain almost twenty mana from a similarly damaged shell, but it was without the dungeon absorbing it back. Not that I cared much. </p><p>Then, I pulled the map Eleanor had given me, and examined it. The map only showed the first floor — as there were similar glowing passages that led to other floors — which was roughly circular. </p><p>With a radius of ten miles. </p><p>And, as if the idea of a pocket universe wasn’t fascinating enough, I also knew that ten miles was relatively small as far as dungeons went. Truly fascinating. </p><p>Too bad I was here, inside an incredible miracle, only to kill monsters like a barbarian rather than exploring it as a proper scientist. </p><p>The map showed the patrol areas and the safe spots clearly. Eleanor had given it to me to keep me from getting into trouble, but I had the exact opposite intention. For me, it represented the best areas to operate. </p><p>“But first, a test,” I muttered as I moved toward another monster, and pushed the mana to the head of the hammer. Though, once again, I was able to repeat the trick of mana attack only when I thought of the hammer as a forging tool. </p><p>Though, even as I faced the monster, and barely dodged the attack, I realized a small problem. Focusing on my Forging skill meant that the reflexive footwork didn’t arrive. I was barely able to switch skills before throwing myself to the side, rolling painfully. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 53 -&gt; 55]</p><p>“Note to myself, be careful about switching skills,” I muttered as I looked at the corpse of the monster. If that blow didn’t kill it in one hit, it wouldn’t be that easy. </p><p>I sat on the ground, watching the mangled remains of the beast. The mana blow, even if it was just worth three points, increased its effectiveness against the shell significantly. It had turned the loot completely worthless. </p><p>More importantly, since its shell had been destroyed completely, the mana cloud around it was much thicker. More than enough for me to catch some using Mana Blow. Meaning, I could deal with multiple monsters without the need for stopping to replenish my mana. </p><p>I was still stuck near the cart for almost half an hour, hunting the monsters until my mana reserves were full, and killing twenty more insects in the process. Without holding back, I was able to shatter their shells in merely four or five hits even without using mana. But, without mana, there was no rapid skill increase.</p><p>Absorbing Mana was a slow process, but even half an hour was only possible because of my high Meditation skill. If it was below twenty five, I wouldn’t have been able to take even a drop of mana from the greedy pull of the dungeon. </p><p>I fully intended to use the Mana Blow trick to kill the beasts rather than using my stored mana, but wasting an hour was acceptable for additional safety. </p><p>“It’s time,” I muttered even as I moved forward, my hammer flipping in my hand as I left the safe area behind, and moved toward the edge of the dungeon. </p><p>The landscape got rockier and rockier, but I didn’t care about it. I was more interested in the density of the insects. I deliberately positioned myself so that multiple monsters moved toward me at the same time. </p><p>The first one, I killed using my reserves. Unlike trying to reverse the flow of Meditation, mana leaked out of my body smoothly to land on my hammer head. </p><p>[-4 Mana] </p><p>A single blow, and the target had been dealt with. This time, knowing that it would die in one blow, I hadn’t thrown myself to the side in panic. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 55 -&gt; 57]</p><p>Instead, I shifted back to Mana Forge, which allowed me to gather the mana around my hammer far faster than I could with Meditation. A step forward, and another beast died. Killing them unassisted allowed my skill to improve far faster. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 57 -&gt; 59]</p><p>“Let’s go,” I muttered as I moved deeper recklessly, especially once I realized that using mana blow prevented the erosion effect from their shell sticking to my hammer, preventing durability loss. </p><p>A dungeon where I didn’t need to share with others was an incredible treasure, especially one that fit my skill configuration perfectly. It was the perfect environment to use the benefits of the System. So, when I drifted away enough to see a swarm of insects, the count easily reaching hundreds, I moved forward. </p><p>The only thing that I paid attention to was not to be surrounded by the swarm as my hammer danced, my movement getting smoother and smoother. </p><p>Once my hammer skill reached seventies, it only started to increase once with every kill. At around eighty proficiency, it started going up once in several monsters. A pity, but not a big one. Having an external combat skill in the eighties was already fascinating enough. After improving my skill so much, I was able to shatter the shell with one hit, even without using Mana. </p><p>The skill didn’t increase my Strength, but it gave me many new tricks to create an unbelievable sense of leverage, which was only possible due to Dexterity helping my body move. </p><p>As I destroyed the insects, their bodies continued to disappear. However, not all of them had disappeared into nothing. Several of them had left glowing orbs behind. Skills.</p><p>However, I didn’t have time to stop and take them, since I was dealing with a swarm of huge insects. Instead, I continued killing, and counting. </p><p>As my skill proficiency passed the hundred and fifty mark, an even more welcome notification appeared. </p><p>[Level 32 -&gt; 33]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>I started moving smoothly. It was even more efficient than leveling with Maria’s help. Experiencing it directly, I could understand why people were charging for dungeon access. Fighting against only one type of enemy made things far easier. </p><p>As I fought, I realized an unexpected situation. As I continued to kill, the surrounding monsters started to get antsy. Still, I wasn’t deep enough for it to be a risk, so I merely decided to deal with the mess. </p><p>I fought for almost twenty minutes without interruption, which was a challenge that would have exhausted any warrior. But, that was another benefit of being a Blacksmith. There were some classes that didn’t even receive Vitality, while most of them only received one point. Blacksmith received double, giving us a considerable endurance even without burning Health to reinforce the muscles. </p><p>As I fought, another reward arrived. </p><p>[Level 33 -&gt; 34]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>When the onslaught was over, I had killed a total of five hundred and forty six monsters, though there was no sign of it other than a few glowing orbs, the rest had long disappeared. However, I didn’t bother gathering the skill stones just yet. </p><p>While I was curious to check them and see if there was anything useful, something else was far more important. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Shattering Blow / Smooth Step] </p><p>I was as happy to learn that there was an unexpected benefit to leveling external skills as much as I was happy about leveling once more. </p><p>Too bad it seemed to hit its limit by reaching hundred, not improving further. Another choice.” Smooth Step was tempting. It was clearly related to dodging, which was helpful. However I chose Shattering Blow. </p><p>I already had a new skill focused on defense. For the moment, trying to focus on my strength seemed like a better idea. </p><p>That way, even without mana, I could deal with a horde, an ability I could reveal to Eleanor. Not today, maybe, but it would be convincing after a few more trips. It would still be hard to swallow, but I could always spin a tale about discovering my aptitude toward fighting with a hammer, maybe mixing with some kind of desperate battle against ten thousand bugs.</p><p>It was well known that the desperation of death helped skills improve faster. </p><p>It would mean potentially revealing a secret — that external skills granted a Perk once they reached proficiency one hundred — but I wasn’t afraid of it for multiple reasons. First, I had a feeling that it wasn’t a big secret. I was sure that bigger organizations had long discovered it. </p><p>Unlike my Mana Skill upgrade, its discovery was far more straightforward. Meaning, it was a secret I could give up safely to improve her impression of me. </p><p>I made a note to proudly declare that I had already reached sixty today. A good lie benefited from a good foundation. </p><p>Then, I started walking toward the glowing skill orbs. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 30</p><p>I walked around the battlefield, collecting the skill stones. Not that it took a long time, as there were merely fifteen of them. It meant, about only one in thirty of the beasts had dropped a skill. </p><p>Of those fifteen skill stones, nine of them didn’t react, showing that I lacked the prerequisite conditions to activate them. And, since the dungeon didn’t drop anything truly rare, I guessed it was related to missing stats rather than anything I could match. Perception, Charisma, Wisdom … and, my biggest achilles heel, Intelligence. </p><p>That, or they might be some commonplace spell schemas or construction recipes that required a specific ability. Then, I started examining the six that I received. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Overhead Strike (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Ice Blast (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Swipe (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Stab (Basic)]</p><p>Ice Blast had immediately caught my attention among the available skills. A magic skill, something incredibly tempting in more ways than one. However, no matter how tempting it was, I didn’t absorb it immediately. </p><p>A dungeon wasn’t the best place for starting a new experiment. It was better to focus on the one I had in front of me. </p><p>The other five skill stones weren’t as interesting. Nurture was the sole class skill of Farmers, which was a class that was even more unfortunate than Blacksmiths. Not only were they limited to receiving only one point of Vitality, but they also received only one class skill, which could be used to hasten the growth of the plants. </p><p>One that used their Health in return. </p><p>They almost exclusively worked in greenhouses, growing food. While monster meat could be used as a food, metabolizing the enhanced food they produced was faster. The basic variant, in particular, was useless at this point. </p><p>Of the three combat skills, two of them were worthless. At this point, the basic skills were plentiful enough to be picked for a few copper coins, and even a common combat skill wasn’t too different. I hadn’t changed mine before, mostly because I hadn’t been planning to go to the trouble of improving my proficiency from the start. </p><p>Actually, absorbing Stab was tempting as well. Just like how Overhead Strike was a basic hammer skill, Stab was a basic spear skill. Adding another weapon to the mix was an alluring idea, particularly after confirming that I was able to gain a Perk from improving external skills. </p><p>A simple perk, maybe, but only through the existence of my Perks was I able to break through the limits of the skills. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I said even as I collected the skill stones, not absorbing any of them. </p><p>Before absorbing them, I needed to confirm that the rapid improvement trick actually worked with weapons other than hammer, which was not a given. </p><p>“Let’s see if it works,” I muttered even as I retreated back toward my cart. On the way, I had killed a few insects, but I didn’t bother using any mana. Instead, I focused on collecting their shells to put on the cart. It was better to be safe than sorry. </p><p>When I arrived, the cart had been untouched. I put the shells I collected there as well as all skills except three — Stab, Nurture, and Ice Blast — before I changed my weapons to sword and shield. It was finally the time to test the skill properly. </p><p>I attacked the air. My movement was direct, straightforward, and most importantly, incompetent, which was inevitable. One point of proficiency didn’t mean much, and the glaring mistakes were even more obvious after bringing another combat skill to hundred. </p><p>I ignored them, and instead tried to use mana in my storage to attack. It would be easier to use than Mana Blow. </p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>It failed. </p><p>“That’s not good,” I muttered. I was very confident that I could use the mana to enhance the attack, but it didn’t even take hold around the sword. I tried the same thing multiple times, trying to modify the shape of the mana. </p><p>Even when I depleted most of my mana, it failed. My unfamiliarity was not helping. “I need to watch a swordsman use mana attacks,” I deduced, which was not exactly easy to find. I didn’t know if Eleanor was capable of using mana. She might be depending on the class, as there were multiple hybrid classes. But, I didn’t see her use one. And, I couldn’t ask her about it without looking suspicious. </p><p>She wasn’t like Maria, willing to entertain my random questions. Nor was she careless enough not to realize she would be revealing potential secrets. </p><p>Waiting for Maria was the easiest way. It was likely that she had a melee external skill that she could use for emergencies. I remembered that she carried a dagger. However, I needed to wait almost five days for her. There were other ways to handle things. </p><p>“And, I don’t need mana for the first step, do I?” I said to myself. Just because the mana trick didn’t work didn’t mean I didn’t have any other option. </p><p>I made a simple forward attack with the sword a few times, then switched to hammer, replicating the attack. Of course, the weapons were really different, but so was the difference between one point of proficiency and a hundred. </p><p>More importantly, there was a lot of overlap between two melee skills, just like there was a strong overlap between Repair and Forge. The concept of balance, momentum, maintaining a distance … all had been a relevant part of it. </p><p>It took merely five swings to improve my skill once. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 2]</p><p>I was more than happy to discover another way to improve the skill. Clearly, it wasn’t too effective, barely matching the speed of killing monsters, especially with the momentum lacking. I practiced for ten minutes. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 2 -&gt; 11]</p><p>The improvement was nice, but not as high as it could have been. It slowed down significantly once I passed the ten point mark. It was barely enough to fight against monsters. </p><p>However, I didn’t rush to fight against them immediately. I only had one shield, and I didn’t want to ruin it with a mistake. </p><p>“Speaking of shields,” I said even as I paused, focusing on the skill once more. I referred to it as a sword skill, but it wasn’t, was it? It was a sword and shield skill. Once I reached ten proficiency, several moves that included the shield in a more offensive manner had opened up. </p><p>That put a big smile on my face for one, good reason. In terms of momentum, a shield attack was more similar to a hammer than a sword. ”Let’s try it again,” I said. I started another round of practice, this time focusing on shield attacks over sword ones. </p><p>The skill continued to rise. Half an hour of practice had been enough to bring my skill to a new stage. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) - 25]</p><p>“Cheating is fun,” I said even as I started moving deeper once again. While I had been fighting, I had been interrupted by the occasional monster, but I chose to deal with them using my hammer. It was the first time I was going to use a sword. </p><p>I approached an insect, trusting the skill to do its job. When the beast attacked, I took a step to the side, and slammed it with my shield. Unbalanced, I followed with multiple attacks, a combination of shield and sword, relying on the direction of the skill. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 25 -&gt; 26]</p><p>The reward was nice, but the damage to both my sword and shield was considerable. No wonder they dealt with the monster by distracting it. </p><p>Still. It was a reasonable sacrifice. The damage to weapons would explain how I was able to improve the combat skill that quickly. An improvement I wanted to reveal, at least to some degree. It would be less suspicious than suddenly defending myself with incredible proficiency if the need arose. </p><p>“Now, the next trick,” I said as I tried to time my attacks with a mana burst. </p><p>It wasn’t like the mana blow. It didn’t impact my attack. However, it managed to interfere with the corrosion effect, preventing the weapons from slowly getting damaged. It was another trick, but not a particularly valuable one. Simply repairing them was easier. </p><p>“Still, it’s always better to know more rather than less,” I said, more than happy with my performance. </p><p>After killing a few more beasts, I started experimenting once more, doing my best to correct the skill based on the feedback of the hammer attacks. I occasionally switched weapons just to refresh my memory. </p><p>Soon, another dozen insects fell under my attacks, and I ripped their shells before they faded. Though, even as I repeated the attack, I noticed an interesting detail. The ones with their shells ripped didn’t seem to drop skills at the same rate. </p><p>“Interesting. Too bad it’s not statistically significant,” I pondered. I needed to kill a lot of beasts and test it that way. However, first, I wanted to finish improving my sword skill. I continued killing, not only collecting shells, but also improving the skill high enough to — hopefully — impress Eleanor without alarming her. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) - 41]</p><p>“Impressive, but not groundbreaking,” I finally said. The best part, the way I improved it was actually replicable. She could test it with another hammer expert, and they would get some results. </p><p>Not at the same level, but enough to keep her from getting suspicious. </p><p>I returned to the cart to drop my sword and shield along with the excess shells. Then, I moved deeper, hammer in hand, feeling strangely excited that I would be able to run the experiment myself. The day had been filled with fascinating discoveries. </p><p>Maybe that had been my mistake all along, I decided. I relied on others to collect data, rather than doing it myself. </p><p>I had another experiment to run. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I watched from the shadows as a seventy-year-old man silently surpassed the Connate Realm, his body transforming with the assistance of the Forest Essence I had created. </p><p>He was not the first one. He was not even one of the first thousand. </p><p>No, currently, he was one of the eleven thousand Blood Essence realm martial artists, spread between almost a hundred different enclaves. </p><p>It had been a month since I had recruited the first disciple, and the mysterious nameless sect that was dedicated to the growth of the forest had grown in leaps and bounds. Their breakthroughs had been far easier compared to the martial artists of Burning Blizzard. </p><p>Ironically, it was the problem I was trying to solve. </p><p>From the perspective of the benefits, it was not a problem. After all, the stronger they were, the faster they could expand the endless spirit forests, which would allow me to explore the misty mountains even faster, which was critical to understanding the truth behind the conspiracy. </p><p>However, the fact that I didn’t understand what was going on unsettled me. Just because it was currently beneficial, it didn’t mean it would stay that way in the future. </p><p>One that confused me more was the pace of the change. For the first week, the speed of development was just like I had expected. It started to exceed that by week two, which turned alarming. Especially since it seemed to only get faster. </p><p>It worked that way even with the new bases, even if I didn’t bring any trainers from the older enclaves. </p><p>Of course, I had one suspect, but only today, I had managed to collect the tool that could hopefully allow me to examine it. One that I was able to receive thanks to Janassa, and only because I had piled her with a shocking number of cultivation pills, pushing her cultivation to the peak of Formation Establishment. </p><p>[310x Return - Kartpa Alchemy Technique Lesson - Major Accomplishment, Perfection]</p><p>It wasn’t exactly ideal, even though I had done my best to keep the quality of the pills high enough to manage the side effects. Forcefully raising cultivation with the assistance of the pills was certainly harmful. I had yet to discover the process of breaking into the Golden Core, but even without it, I knew that any such attempt would have ended messily. </p><p>I still dared to push her — in the form of missions from the interface — not because I was merciless, but because I was confident I could fix it. I could have done so if my real cultivation was at Golden Core, but even without it, I was confident that I could find a way. </p><p>I just needed to reach the Immersion realm first, and if that wasn’t enough Integration. </p><p>With a deep sigh, I activated the skill, receiving another magical injection of knowledge. “Finally,” I said even as I absorbed the knowledge, and experienced the great difference. However, while the increased Alchemy ability meant that I could refine even greater amounts of pills with ease while maintaining the quality, I didn’t care about it for the moment. </p><p>I had a bigger reward in mind. The ability to analyze the alchemical tree I designed as a spiritual pillar. I had examined every other variable behind the sudden and unexpected development of the Forest Dance disciples and confirmed that nothing was extraordinary. </p><p>The only exception was the alchemical tree I had created as a container. While I was the one that created it, it didn’t mean I completely understood it. The tree had implemented some Golden Core and Nascent Soul aspects, and the lack of the corresponding cultivation knowledge meant that I didn’t always understand the full implications of what I had been doing. </p><p>I was hoping that, by increasing it to Perfection, I could understand the drivers for that improvement further. </p><p>“Let’s see,” I said even as I put my hand on the trunk of the alchemical tree, examining its structure, ready to delve into the details of its structure like the replacement wood, and the connection of the essence. </p><p>But, I didn’t need to. Because I immediately found the source of the ‘problem’.</p><p>Providence. </p><p>It was a subtle effect, spreading across the tree that I used as a spiritual pillar, with several tendrils leading out … tendrils that pointed to the location of the other enclaves I had created. </p><p>For a moment, I froze, my mind inevitably going to the horrible vision I had seen under the capital, the chained undead that was cursed by Providence. But, that flash was only a momentary reaction, as the difference between the two was apparent. </p><p>He had been used as a focus to a method to gather Providence, which was clearly a horrible idea, and what I had been feeling from the underground prison had only confirmed it further. </p><p>The province I could feel at the heart of the alchemical tree, and subtly bonding with the material. </p><p>“Alright, at least it confirms that I guessed correctly. There was one thing I neglected.” What I neglected was the high-quality material of the alchemical tree, somewhat absorbing providence to improve. That process meant that the Providence managed to stay invisible to my senses until I reached Perfection. </p><p>Unfortunately, even with the Perfection, that was all I could understand. Even for Nascent Soul, Providence was a mysterious concept. A Qi Gathering cultivator understood more about Qi than a Nascent Soul understood about Providence. </p><p>They could detect, and manipulate in very limited ways, but that was it. My own ability was even worse, lacking the cultivation technique portion, limiting my abilities to understand and manipulate Providence even further. </p><p>Not that I was exactly enthusiastic about manipulating Providence, as it was hardly a safe thing to do. However, it meant that I couldn’t even fully understand how Providence created some kind of connective web between the different trees, and how it enhanced the cultivation of the martial artists. </p><p>“At least I don’t have to wonder about why Providence gathered,” I said as I pulled my hand back. While everything else was a mystery, that one was simple. </p><p>Ridiculously so. </p><p>Good deeds resulted in Providence. While that statement was not simple — as to what exactly was good, how Heavenly Dao measured it, or why there was such a reward mechanism — the gathering providence explained one thing. The act of spreading spirit plants and essence plants and increasing the Qi density of the world counted as a good deed. </p><p>It wasn’t much. Singularly, the effect was too light for me to notice. However, I had almost a hundred thousand martial artists, more than a tenth of them in the Blood Essence realm, each doing nothing but work peacefully to cover the lands with forests full of spirit plants. </p><p>The surprise part was that the Providence that rewarded their action didn’t gather around them, but actually gathered into the spiritual pillar, and turned into some kind of a collective resource. </p><p>I might have suspected that it might be a side effect of using the alchemical tree based on Nascent Soul techniques, but I had one strong evidence against that assumption. </p><p>That horror show underneath the capital. They were not somehow gathering Providence for their benefit — I guessed — but actively positioning Everdawn Empire as the responsible party. </p><p>It wasn’t the source of the weakness of the essence, maybe, but it certainly played a part. Even now, there was one aspect I couldn’t properly understand, creating a web of connections between the different spiritual pillar trees. </p><p>Most likely, the spiritual pillar of the Everdawn Empire had something similar feature, one that at least gathered more Providence. And, if that was the case, creating those Providence collection traps would have been an excellent way to corrupt that main entity. </p><p>“It has so many implications,” I muttered even as I left the enclave, only to go deeper into the territory, and start creating five more enclaves, and this time, I made them even larger. Now that I understood the source of the cultivation speed, I had no problem scaling it up even further. </p><p>Risky, but when billions of lives were at stake, that much risk was acceptable. </p><p>And, working with the monotony allowed me to test the limits of my new discovery. I realized that the providence connection wasn’t created the moment I had refined a new tree. However, it didn’t actually need the collection of Providence. </p><p>No, the moment the density of Forest Essence surpassed a certain point, the tree had joined the web of connections and started receiving Providence from the other trees, almost like spreading the effect. </p><p>That was an interesting and promising mechanic. Too bad I didn’t dare to use it to find the location of the Everdawn Empire, not with its providence actively being manipulated by hostile forces. </p><p>Luckily, Everdawn Empire was not my only option. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>The idea of turning Forest Dance into one of the ancient martial arts as an experiment was tempting for multiple reasons. For once, it was already focused on nonlethal force, and I could turn its spiritual conception toward self-defense and pacifism even further. </p><p>However, in addition. The other martial arts were designed as a way to fight. Its combination with supporting aspects was auxiliary at best. That had been even true for the Volcano Hammer and Snow Blossom Apothecary techniques I had learned — though, now that I knew the true source of the two techniques, that was not a surprise. </p><p>I wanted to design Forest Dance as a method to raise spiritual plants first, and fighting aspects would be auxiliary. That way, the essence it would generate would be strong and dense, but far more fitting boosting the growth of the plants, and the fighting aspect would be secondary. </p><p>It was not exactly a simple process. Even creating the initial basis took a week. While that was an absurdly quick time from the perspective of the others, who spent their lifetimes to merely modify a mover two, I wasn’t working on the same basis. </p><p>Thanks to Aisnam’s assistance, I was an expert in hundreds of different cultivation techniques, and my martial talent allowed me to dissect the various aspects of martial arts. But, even then, without the constant inspiration from the constant glow of the Dao Gate, I might have failed to achieve my objective. </p><p>As I sat across the mysterious gate Pearyin was yet to return, I was able to comprehend the concept of palm far more deeply. Not just in terms of its delivery, but also the concept behind it, representing a willingness to adapt and protect over destruction. </p><p>Of course, like everything related to cultivation, that openness was a relative, adaptive concept. I had learned many palm techniques that turned adaptability into a series of deadly counter-strikes. </p><p>I went in a different direction, focusing on the aspects of harmony with nature and protecting the land, with the essence harmonizing with the world. </p><p>Even with all those advantages, the martial arts I created were useless anything but practice. It wouldn’t have even worked well as a method of farming, as embedding the sense of protection meant that the practitioners would feel connected to the grooves they maintained. </p><p>However, it didn’t matter. The only reason I wanted those grooves was the excess Qi they would let out, which then could be used to explore the misty mountains. </p><p>The revised forest dance was interesting. Highly specialized to the point of uselessness, it wouldn’t appeal to the young men and women. That alone would have killed any other school of thought, as the young people were the ideal target for martial arts, but I saw that as a big benefit. </p><p>After all, I was trying to save lives, and creating tens of thousands of martial artists eager to prove themselves was not a good way to create stability. </p><p>Ordinarily, targeting older people would have been an inefficient choice. The development of martial arts was highly reliant on the adaptability of the body, which dropped significantly as the target aged.</p><p>Luckily, I had a way to cheat on that aspect. The combined effects of alchemy and martial talent pills would reinforce their talent enough that achieving the Blood Essence realm was not impossible; particularly since I could start with a strong, solid concept to center the martial arts rather than slowly rekindle the faded aspect like Burning Blizzard. </p><p>Compared to it, creating the spiritual pillar was more complicated. The first part was to method of creation. I still didn’t know the method of creating a spiritual pillar that grew and developed. It was clear that there was some kind of technique behind it, one that required a deeper understanding of the essence I currently lacked. </p><p>Talent was useful, but it couldn’t rival the generations of gathered knowledge. The way that the spiritual pillar had been designed seemed to have a mysterious ability, one that couldn’t be easily replicated. </p><p>Luckily, that didn’t mean I couldn’t create a workaround. Admittedly, it was a solution that was far more complicated than a simple drawing, but since I didn’t know how it handled essence from so many different sources to create a singular concept, I had no choice. </p><p>My solution had three steps. The first one was to create — and not raise — a giant tree, which was essentially some kind of alchemical container with the conception of a tree rather than being a real tree. It also functioned as the heart of a formation, while every single leave it had was a local focus for the formation. </p><p>The martial artists would carry those leaves with them, which would constantly guide their inner essence as it would constantly share the essence with them. That was probably its biggest advantage, as it would mean the recruits didn’t need my supervision to maintain the cohesion. </p><p>The biggest disadvantage, every tree would have a limit of people it could support, and it wouldn’t grow alongside. It was a bit of a problem, but I was hoping that I would be able to find a solution for that once my Kartpa Alchemy technique broke through Perfection. </p><p>During the week, Janassa managed to complete her breakthrough safely, which gave me the hope to achieve it. Not immediately, as the multiplier difference wasn’t as high enough to justify the effort of breaking through, but I had seen the way Janassa studied the notes I provided about the Kartpa Valley Alchemy technique. </p><p>Reaching the Foundation Establishment realm increased her comprehension significantly, which in turn allowed her to understand alchemy more in-depth. And, the more valuable the original teaching, the more valuable the System returns. </p><p>And, she wasn’t the only one that was making progress. The hundred martial artists I was training were steadily progressing deeper into the Blood Essence realm, the combination of high-quality essence medicine to support their essence combined with their talent allowed them to improve far faster than it was supposed to be possible. </p><p>The occasional acupuncture treatment made it even faster. </p><p>Their improvement didn’t grant me any reward from the System, but that didn’t mean it was useless. Constantly observing the recovery of the spiritual pillar passively allowed me to further improve the design of the alchemical tree I had created, while constantly treating them allowed me to get an even better understanding of the Blood Essence realm. </p><p>The difference between theory and practice was radically different. </p><p>Once I had prepared the alchemical tree totem, the last remaining step was to create locations for the martial artists to work, and the best place for them was enclaves deep into the misty mountains, away from any ruin, isolated from the mist through my formation. Another formation was there to assist them tend and raise plants, but it wasn’t as intricate as the one I had used. </p><p>And, in each location, there was nothing but the giant tree and another crystal container that contained the technique. The formation even blocked the view outside, disguising the place as a mystic land. </p><p>For each location, I also created a huge batch of martial aptitude pills, though instead of trying to push it to Earth Grade, I focused on quantity, creating a truly mind-boggling number of Black Grade martial talent pills. </p><p>As for essence pills, I only created a few, as they could easily live off of the fruits and the other parts of the plants, not to mention their strength would allow them to raise savage beasts easily. The new Forest Dance was not good for farming, but enjoying the occasional essence fruit or Qi fruit from the giant forest of spirit plants and essence plants was not excessive. </p><p>The hiring process was even easier. The war in the mortal domain was still ongoing, which meant millions of refugees were currently on the move. Just like the conspiracy, I recruited from the refugees, but unlike them, I wasn’t looking for talent, skill, or age. </p><p>No, I was more than happy to take the old, the injured, and otherwise disfranchised who had been suffering during the war. I didn’t kidnap them, nor that I need to. All I needed was to create a mist around them and create the illusion of an immortal offering them an opportunity for a peaceful life, away from the ravages of war. </p><p>Ironically, it was even true. While I needed their assistance to expand the spirit plants, which in turn needed to move deeper into the misty mountains, there was no request other than to help the forest grow. In exchange, not only do I offer them protection away from the merciless dominion of nobles and cultivators, but also health. </p><p>Breaking into the Blood Essence realm would certainly help them to live longer. I didn’t know how long, but a couple decades should be the minimum. </p><p>However, as much as helping people felt good, I didn’t let myself distract from the real deal. My hiring process saved tens of thousands of people, which was true, but that number was a drop in the bucket compared to the people that would die if the conspiracy succeeded. </p><p>I still didn’t know what they were trying to achieve, and it scared me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Impressive performance,” I said as I looked at two women who had just finished their duel, one pressing against the throat of the other with a broken spear. </p><p>It was not an exaggeration. Their essence was not as strong enough as other martial artists, but their talent meant that watching them fight was watching a show that was a mixture of the best points of ballet and boxing, mixed with superhuman acrobatic performance. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” the winner said with a smile, while the loser frowned, disappointed. Understandable, as she had climbed all the way up to the last fight before she lost, meaning she had missed the reward. </p><p>The reward being the ‘honor’ of breaking through first. </p><p>From any rational perspective, it was not a reward but a punishment, as they would be an experimental target. But, even as I had warned them, they seemed to be dismissive of that fact. Whether they trusted me that much, or their pride as a martial artist demanded that, I wasn’t entirely sure. </p><p>Ultimately, it didn’t matter. </p><p>“Are you ready?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she declared respectfully as she went in front of the spiritual pillar, and took the fighting pose with a pill in hand, ready to fight. It was the biggest difference between martial arts and Qi cultivation. </p><p>Qi required the cultivator to sit down and turn inward in a silent, calm location as they slowly explored their internal feelings and inner conceptions while transforming their bodies deliberately. Martial arts was different. It required understanding and technique, true, but ultimately, they were just intermediate steps, generating essence. </p><p>The real transformation started once the martial artist reached Connate Realm, the essence slowly transforming their bodies to better adapt to the essence, a process that went much faster while fighting, the body binding with essence faster as it was pushed above the absolute limit. </p><p>According to the records — both Everdawn and Burning Blizzard — the breakthrough to the Blood Essence realm was ultimately a straightforward affair. Purify the essence as much as possible, and constantly fight to force it to transform the body. </p><p>Until, at one point, the body of the martial artists started to get aligned with the essence, removing the need to actively control the essence. Instead, the body started to absorb it completely and make it a part of it, while the blood carried it just like any other nutrient. </p><p>Hence the Blood Essence realm. </p><p>Unfortunately, for my new recruits, it was impossible to break that way unassisted for one very simple reason. Their essence might be pure, but it was still weak due to the meager support of the spiritual pillar. Even with all the benefits I provided, they could never break through the natural way. </p><p>Luckily, alchemy allowed me to pull various tricks, including the delayed-release essence pill I had created, which didn’t provide natural essence. Instead, it contained a burst of essence that was dangerously similar to the Burning Blizzard essence.</p><p>For all intents of purposes, it was a horrible mixture of pure poison, and performance-enhancing drugs that would have killed a savage beast elephant. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked even as I flicked my fingers, and every single acupuncture point had been penetrated by a tiny needle. She nodded. “Take the pill and attack. Don’t forget. No matter how much it hurts, you can’t stop, or you’ll fail, ruining your cultivation permanently.” </p><p>The last part was probably not true, but another white lie wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>The moment she swallowed the pill, her skin turned blood red, a side effect of every single organ of hers working past its limits. The boundless essence filled her body as she attacked at her full might. I merely deflected every single attack with a palm attack of my own. </p><p>I wasn’t as good as Aisnam and her palm intent, but what I lacked in purity of intent, I easily compensated with the limitless Qi I had, supplying it directly through the formation and channeling to my palm attacks. </p><p>Without an outward ranged attack, it looked like martial arts, but it was not. </p><p>However, the part of defending was easy. Making sure she didn’t die was much harder. I constantly activated the needles across her body, using Qi to fix the worst of the damage while letting the rest be transformed by her essence. </p><p>It was a challenging process. Surprisingly, the Umnim Alchemy technique helped more than Kartpa. Since it had long passed Perfection and reached Integration Realm, it allowed me to use the technique in an adaptive manner that wasn’t constrained by techniques. </p><p>Without that, even if she broke through, the internal injuries would have killed her in a few weeks. </p><p>But, with that assistance, we fought for a full hour, a show the rest watched with rapt attention, their talent allowing them to learn a lot from the fight. When she finally collapsed, she had a smile despite the pain and exhaustion she was feeling. </p><p>She had successfully broken through. </p><p>“Welcome to the Blood Essence Realm,” I said to her even as I sent another pill to her mouth, triggering it to hasten her recovery. </p><p>“I feel … amazing,,” she gasped even as she threw a simple punch. Her essence raged, while an illusion of a flaming fist appeared around her. A follow-up punch invoked the concept of a blizzard. </p><p>“Very good. Now, go and reinforce the spiritual pillar,” I said. She once again bled over the spiritual pillar, which consumed the essence in the blood greedily. I observed as it started recovering at a rapid speed, that drop of blood alone helping it recover more than everything else we had done all week. </p><p>With that drop, it finally reached the initial strength of the Everdawn Essence. </p><p>She made a move to cut her arm even deeper, but I stopped her. “I can handle it, sir,” she said. </p><p>“Patience,” I advised. “Repairing a spiritual pillar is a slow, delicate work,” I said as I put my hand on its surface, finally feeling confident enough to probe the edges of the drawing. </p><p>The structure was fascinating. In a way, it was similar to my calligraphy, carrying the hint of conception. In most ways, it was a more rough, primitive version of the Qi calligraphy. But, it was superior in one critical way. When I created calligraphy, the intent I put behind it was a still concept, unable to grow and change. </p><p>Meanwhile, the drawing here could absorb the essence of the others and grow with it, almost like a living thing. I didn’t have an exact idea of how it worked, and I couldn’t simply break the only clue I had to learn how it worked. </p><p>However, passive observation was different. </p><p>“Bleed once again,” I asked. She did, and I noticed that the recovery wasn’t as much as the first time. It took a while for me to understand the reason. The breakthrough allowed her to develop a lot of new insights about the essence, which helped the drawing to recover far more. Repeating wasn’t as useful. </p><p>However, considering one session was still more effective than a hundred Connate Realm martial artists constantly interacting with for a full day. </p><p>“Next,” I called even as I runner up to breakthrough, but not before she visited the spiritual pillar. The recovered pillar had transformed her essence with a speed that surprised me, empowering her significantly. Though, I had a feeling that, if I hadn’t been working hard to keep the concept of Burning Blizzard so tightly aligned, it would have taken weeks, and not seconds. </p><p>The increased strength of essence made the process easier. I used the exact same method, but this time, it barely lasted forty minutes to induce the breakthrough. The next time, it lasted twenty. Then, I stopped giving them the dangerous medicine, and replaced it with essence pills, letting them spar against the ones that broke through, increasing the speed even more. </p><p>It merely took half a day for all hundred of them to reach the Blood Essence realm. Their strength wasn’t enough to match the Foundation Establishment realm yet, but I had a feeling that any Ninth Stage Qi Gathering Realm cultivator would have hated to fight them. </p><p>And, as their concept essence got stronger, they would get stronger and stronger. </p><p>As an added benefit, I had a much better understanding of how the symbol worked. Not enough to fully understand it, especially since I didn’t dare to use any invasive method that might damage it, but I learned enough to create an inferior copy. </p><p>To understand, I needed to experiment. At the same time, I needed to explore the misty mountains more to discover other martial arts sects. </p><p>Luckily, those two objectives were not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, they could actually support each other. </p><p>I just needed to revise one of my old martial arts for the new purpose. </p><p>It was time to revisit the Forest Dance. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>Setting up my new — and hopefully more permanent — forge took half of my available time. However, it was certainly worth it. Three layers of trees surrounded it to give me a perfect vision of my surroundings. </p><p>There was even a small farm where the root plants I discovered had been growing en masse. I hoped to use them to replenish my Health. However, I was yet to eat despite feeling the intense vitality it contained, because I still needed an expert to confirm that it was edible and not poisonous.</p><p>System allowed Health to solve most problems, but it didn’t solve every single ailment.  </p><p>And, setting the encampment came with its own reward. </p><p>[Nurture (Rare)  92 -&gt; 97]  </p><p>However, as much as the plants that surrounded my farm were an incredible achievement, it was nothing compared to what laid at the center. </p><p>For once, the main forge was sitting on a raised platform made of iron-covered stone, giving it an elegant feeling. The only reason it wasn’t a full wall was that it would have blocked my view. Even when working, I didn’t have the luxury of staying hidden. </p><p>Instead, I forged a few metal sheets that I might raise in case I’m doing something particularly sensitive. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t know how to make corrosion-resistant glass. Ultimately, Forge and Repair were both focused on metal, limiting the available information I could access. While I was confident that I could figure out a way, glass wasn’t exactly on top of my list of required materials. </p><p>No, that honor went to discovering a lesser variant of the corrosion-resistant material. Well, more accurately, finding a version that was simple enough that I could argue that I discovered it through sheer repetition. </p><p>Too bad I never had a common variant of the Forge high enough to know whether a recipe was included there. If it was, revealing it wouldn’t have any risk. </p><p>Technically, that also meant that my experiment might be unnecessary, but I decided to conduct it nevertheless. Even if it turned out to be useless, it would be a good test run for the experimental procedure so that I could perfect it before I could start with my real experiment. </p><p>My desire to test how various metals and alloys interacted with mana in my desire to understand mana better. </p><p>Currently, I had merely one small shelf, made of pure iron — as the wood didn’t resist corrosion once it was cut out of the tree. Each shelf had a chart — once again an iron sheet — for me to take note of the experimental details and results. </p><p>Even a small shelf used up a lot of material, but I was happy with it. Ideally, I planned to make a hundred of such shelves. After all, a proper experiment required thousands of samples. </p><p>To be able to produce all of it, I needed a lot of material, hence the existence of the thirty-feet blast furnace sitting on the low ground, to refine the iron ore into pig iron. It wasn’t a design from the System. Instead, it belonged to me. </p><p>I didn’t know why the System didn’t have it. Maybe it was a part of a different class, or maybe the System disdained even the simplest type of mass production — I wasn’t exactly exaggerating when I called System the wet dream of Objectivists. </p><p>Either way, I had to design blast furnace myself completely. Luckily, the working principles of a blast furnace were simple. Create layers of iron and coke — purified coal — and burn starting from the bottom. Iron melted and gathered at the bottom, while the waste products floated up. </p><p>However, in medieval times, raising iron to melting temperature couldn’t be achieved by open flames. Hence the blast furnace. It not only used bellows to pump air, but also had a huge chimney, creating a suction effect. </p><p>Combined, they were barely able to raise the temperature to the necessary level. Luckily, for me, neither bellows nor coke was necessary. Thanks to their intense vitality, the wood from the trees would burn intensely enough. </p><p>Which was good, because making a bellow was very difficult when one was restricted to metal only, without any elastic materials to make things easier. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered even as I moved toward the open pit with a raised hammer, ready to gather more ores. Then, I paused, my mood slipping a bit. Despite my attempts, there was already a layer gathered on top. Clearly, there were some water leaks from the bottom, and the more I dug, the worse it would get. </p><p>A pump was necessary. </p><p>“Or, maybe a steam engine,” I muttered with an amused smile, mostly because the first steam engines had been used to pump water out of mines. The world had changed, but the problems stayed the same.  </p><p>Admittedly, a simple pump would be enough for a surface deposit. Combined with my Strength, it would be far more efficient than a steam engine. Not to mention, it would consume a couple of tons of iron to build. </p><p>Wasteful and pointless, but I couldn’t help but admit that the allure was there, especially if I could link to a conveyor belt to free me from the task of going back and forth. </p><p>“Actually, that might not be a bad idea,” I said. The world had abandoned the existence of steam engines because they were not worth the cost. People with Strength could easily use simple pumps for free, and even the simplest alloy was expensive. </p><p>Even the simplest steam engine that could survive in a post-Cataclysm world would cost enough to be measured in gold coins, while the same thing could be achieved in paying someone less than a silver a day — which would probably be cheaper than the fuel it consumed. </p><p>It was not for no reason the production had been stuck to a feudal balance. Especially since, if there was a need for automation, magic was there to compensate. </p><p>However, it wasn’t out of a principled stance that I wanted to build a simple steam engine. I had a simpler problem. I didn’t have time. </p><p>It didn’t matter that a steam engine wouldn’t be as efficient as me. My current power was still a secret, and I needed to find a way to free myself from simpler tasks if I ever wanted to scale up the production. </p><p>It would be hard work, but when the alternative was to hire people and trust them to keep it a secret… </p><p>“First, let’s start producing iron,” I said. Ultimately, the whole plan depended on an abundance of iron, measured in tons; which sounded a lot, but considering the pre-Calamity world measured the yearly production in billions of metric tons, it wasn’t as impressive. </p><p>“I wonder if this is the first iron mine in this new world?” I asked myself. Technically, it was possible. After all, the outside world was filled with excess metal, especially when it came to simpler stuff. Why bother going through all that trouble when scavenging was easier?</p><p>I sighed, ignoring the problem as I raised my hammer, ready to shatter the deposit under my feet. Of course, traditionally, a pickaxe was a much better tool to deal with semi-solid rock, but I had a different plan. </p><p>[-10 Health]</p><p>The hammer hit the rock, and about a cubic foot of material had shattered into small pieces. It wasn’t the typical way the rock should behave under such an attack, but the life energy that surrounded the hammer worked wonders. </p><p>A cubic foot of material didn’t sound too much, but considering the material density, it certainly was. Iron was a relatively dense metal, almost eight grams of density, which meant four cubic feet of iron weighed about a metric ton. </p><p>Of course, the raw material wasn’t as dense, but even with it, and the low purity ratio had been factored in, a cubic feet of raw material should give me almost twenty pounds of iron. It was all I could steal from a cart without things getting suspicious. </p><p>There was a reason I spent my precious time creating my current setup. </p><p>Ten blows had been enough to fill the blast furnace for the first few layers. I dragged the cart up, but before going to the furnace, I stopped to chop down a tree. </p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to prepare fuel beforehand, as the moment I cut the tree, it started rotting. I tried to make charcoal, but it didn’t prevent the process, meaning I needed another experiment just to have long lasting charcoal. </p><p>However, I ignored that necessity as I created the layers, and lit it on fire, once again using my fire bolt. Wasteful, but since it was holding a skill slot, there was no harm experimenting a bit more.  </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>I watched as the flames covered the open mouth of the furnace, and a slow wind started to pick up. Soon, the bright red drops of iron were already gathered at the bottom of the bellows, the heat hitting my face hard. </p><p>If I was still below level ten, I would have taken a step back. Instead, I watched proudly as a dark smoke started to rise from the top, along with a sharp, disgusting smell that suggested it was contaminated by a great amount of sulfur.</p><p>Meanwhile, the molten iron glowed brightly as it dripped down from the tap at the bottom along with the slag, finally adding some color to the opening, gathering in the large crucible. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered despite everything, including the disgusting smell. It was the first step of success. </p><p>Then, I turned and walked back to the mine. </p><p>I still had a lot of material to excavate. </p>",
