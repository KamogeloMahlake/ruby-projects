    "content": "<p>“I had just noticed someone triggering the planar wards, and it’s not the undead,” Seldanna muttered, but considering she was locked between my body and a Tree of Life — one of many we had grown during our attempts to erase every sign of undead invasion — each hit of our bodies allowing Seldanna to resonate stronger with it. </p><p>A fun method to enhance the plant growth of the area we had discovered. </p><p>“Talk about horrible timing,” I murmured, blur tare then stopping, I quickened the movement of my hips, hastening our journey to the explosive end. </p><p>It had been three months since the end of the battle and my latest discovery … which had some interesting outcomes in terms of my stats. </p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>Pity that, after three months, Seldanna’s connection to the plane had reached a state that wasn’t easy to improve further, which meant that the gains I received from that hit a limit after a month. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean the other two months were a waste. We had caught several attempts of undead incursions, some blunt, the others subtle, suggesting that they had no intention of stopping to target the region. </p><p>Considering they weren’t dissuaded by their earlier decisive defeat and still dared to probe a plane that hosted two divine beings — at least from their perspective — it meant that they had a plan. </p><p>It didn’t take a genius to guess it had something to do with the Eternals. </p><p>It was why I stayed with Seldanna for two more months even after realizing I had hit a limit in terms of my direct benefits. </p><p>The most visible benefit I had generated for her was to help her with the revitalization efforts. While that, in her current state, she had no trouble converting any type of mana into Nature mana, she was still limited by the amount the plane could generate by slowly breaking down Aether — which in turn was limited to the slow decay of the primordial aether that slipped through the planar barrier. </p><p>The greatest advantage of my unique skillset was to break down Primordial Aether into mana directly, hastening the process that would normally take years into days. </p><p>The other benefit was subtler, but still useful. We have studied a lot — though with frequent breaks to … revitalize the land — to integrate some of the principles of Arcana detection wards into Nature Spells she could cast, so that she didn’t have to rely on the Arcana wards I cast. </p><p>I wasn’t going to be here for long. </p><p>I still needed to return back to my home. I could still feel that my girls were alive and well, but that was the only thing I could feel, the rest of my connection already faded. I would have been afraid that it was targeting something outside my control … but then, it coincided with another effect. </p><p>My original System, disappeared. </p><p>When it happened, it came as a shock, and only the fact that I could still feel the presence of my girls — through a far more faded manner — prevented me from panicking badly.  </p><p>Still, no matter how much I expected it to happen, it still came as a shock. Luckily, I still had Tantric completely embedded into my existence, still with me even as the System faded. </p><p>The loss of the skills was unfortunate, but that was the only practical challenge. With my stats already at a point that could rival the earlier state, and with the chance to improve more, I was not in a position to miss it. </p><p>I couldn’t be more glad that I had designed my own System, impossible to be taken from me, or I would have returned to my earlier meaningless existence … and not for long, not with the enemies I had collected in the process. </p><p>While my mind wandered, my body continued its steady movement, and soon, I exploded into Seldanna, filling her to the brim once again. </p><p>“Do you really have to leave?” Seldanna murmured. “Can’t you just stay here and we can defend against them.” </p><p>“I have to,” I answered. “Our enemies are too strong for us to stay in a fragmented plane forever and hope we can resist them. Just look at the things we could do because I managed to steal mana storage from them…”  I said. “We can’t afford to wait until they realize I’m not just an old, feeble god.” </p><p>During those three months, I explained some things to Seldanna about my power, but during that process, I also made sure to conceal some fundamental aspects. Ironically, this time, it was to protect her rather than myself. </p><p>The secret I was hiding was immense, and if it was discovered, I could run away … but bound to the plane by her nature of existence, she could not. </p><p>And, I strongly doubted a small, fragment plane could resist the full attention of the Eternals, who seemed to pull yet another interesting trick whenever I encountered them. </p><p>“Still, I don’t want you to go,” she said. </p><p>“I don’t want to leave you either…” I answered as I caressed her hair. “But that’s the only option we have.” </p><p>And, unlike my earlier misdirection, that was completely true. I had to travel outside the planar border several times during that journey, but no matter how much I tried, I failed to find a way to navigate the Primordial Aether. </p><p>I could not only survive but also thrive in the Primordial Aether thanks to my limitless mana generation — though without a plane to base myself, it was rather boring — but the same thing didn’t work to my benefit. </p><p>There was only one thing that worked to my benefit, and that was my ability to return to Seldanna. With my connection to her, no matter how far I traveled in Primordial Aether in our expeditions, I was able to return back easily, allowing me to take a daring step forward. </p><p>So, I stayed to help Seldanna strengthen the plane — while avoiding some of the crazier ploys I had planned not to alert the others — waiting for the Eternals to make another trip. </p><p>I was confident that they would visit to understand what was going on at a minimum. Not to mention, I had made such a big show of capturing and imprisoning all the Divine Spark from the undead army, which, to their knowledge, was completely useless for me, so I should have been willing to trade it. </p><p>Trying to sneak into their ship was a risky plan … but it was the best way for me to find the way back home … and if all went well, maybe even discover a way to navigate repeatedly. </p><p>With a sigh, I cast a spell, activating the giant avatar I had created for that purpose. “Ready for teleportation,” I asked her. </p><p>“Not yet,” she said, fixing her hair and changing her dress into armor — well, a wooden, grown equivalent of armor, with rose thorns growing, making her sexy yet dangerous at the same time. </p><p>“You remember the plan,” I asked. It was unnecessary, of course. We had gone through several times, but I was feeling tense as well. </p><p>“Yes, once your confrontation is over and you sneak into their vehicle, I’m going to bring the avatar back to the valley you prepared, and make it look like you’re meditating to further adapt your power, while I act like I’m intimidated by you.” </p><p>“And, what will you do if the Eternals come to you with an offer to help you defeat me,” I asked. </p><p>“Can’t I just kill them,” she pouted, and I looked at her with a teasing glare. “I’m going to do my best to look like I’m tempted with the idea, but still intimidated by the process, while I’ll use the treants you prepare to destroy any ship that tries to sneak in, so they’ll assume you’re the one destroying them. And, if I face anyone that I’m not confident in defeating, I’m going to trigger the emergency beacons you prepared.” </p><p>“Good goddess,” I said with a chuckle as I leaned forward and kissed her, amused that, after all that time, it still made her blush spectacularly. “Now, are you ready to confront our uninvited guests?” </p><p>She nodded, and we teleported… </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 32920}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 1103  Mana: 2410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, my goddess, does having a divine communion feel good?” I asked. </p><p>“N-no, of course not,” she stammered, her tone telling the exact opposite as my tongue continued to tease her. I smirked, entertained by her shyness. </p><p>“Then, how about we change the pattern, maybe you’ll like it better,” I suggested and changed position. Before she could react, I was on my back, and she was above me, looking the other way. I continued teasing her wetness with my tongue, while she found herself looking at my raging arousal. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, we don’t have too much time to waste,” I said, another brush of my tongue making her cry once more. It was a beautiful cry, tinged with overwhelming arousal as her pleasure got more and more dominant. </p><p>“I-if you say so,” she murmured in rapid acceptance rather than calling off my absurd argument, her blush thickening as she lowered her head, her excitement reaching a new level. </p><p>She said nothing else, as her mouth soon busied itself with a more important task. Her warm lips enveloped my girth, giving a new meaning to the divine sensation, just the presence of her lips was enough to bring me near my limits. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured, enjoying the way she shivered against my body, but it didn’t prevent her from going deeper, and soon, my shaft was doing something quite heretical, pushing against her throat. </p><p>She gagged even as she pushed down, showing that even divinity wasn’t enough to solve all of her physical ailments — not that I was complaining. The moans that escaped her mouth were heavenly despite their muffled state, her chest rubbing against my stomach with each desperate push, soon falling into a hypnotic pattern. </p><p>Never too one to leave such a spectacular thing without payment, my tongue started exploring her entrance, quickly turning fast and aggressive, circling her knob again and again. Her moans turned even louder, showing how much she was enjoying me spoiling her. </p><p>Another gag escaped her mouth as she lowered herself even more, enough to cut her breath completely … which was, technically speaking, not particularly critical at the moment. She was strong enough to survive without breathing for a long time — maybe even permanently — though that took nothing from the spectacular tightness of her throat. </p><p>As she treated my girth to a divine journey, she pushed her hips down, her beautiful, plump thighs tightening around my head as if she was trying to suffocate me in turn. </p><p>If someone else dared to do so, I would have reacted rather aggressively, but Seldanna earned that leeway after her spectacular performance of ascension and the battle that followed. I continued to lick her core as her hips moved in response, her wetness grinding against my face aggressively. Her movements were forceful and choppy, showing just how familiar she was with even a hint of domination, but her inexperience just made it sexier. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she murmured dazedly once she pulled back to take a deep, desperate breath — showing that while she didn’t need to breathe, the habit was still there —  while tightened my hold on her plump ass, making sure it was impossible for her to move away to get a reprieve. </p><p>She moaned several times under the combined assault of my tongue and my fingers, giving me time to enjoy the softness of her beautiful hips. “A … break,” she whispered soon. </p><p>“Not until you finish your own job,” I warned her. After all, my poor shaft was once again without anyone to tend, lingering alone. It was not fair. </p><p>“I … just a few seconds,” she begged. </p><p>“No,” I answered, the time to form the word the only break I took, determined to continue teasing her for an hour if she wanted to surrender. </p><p>Slowly playing with her until she turned into a delicious puddle of joy was just too tempting. Especially since, with every immediate danger resolved, we had time to waste. </p><p>“A-as you wish, my lord,” she whispered, her voice conveying surrender as she lowered herself, showing that the confidence she had received from suddenly becoming a god hadn’t changed her inherent submissiveness. </p><p>Amazing. </p><p>She went down once more, this time her head moving with ruthless efficiency, taking me deep into her throat, tightening mercilessly… Enough to trigger an explosion, and while I could have rejected the call and continued, I let myself go instead, painting her throat. </p><p>She deserved that reward. </p><p>{+1 Endurance} </p><p>A gasp of shock appeared in front of me at the sudden, unexpected notification. Seldanna didn’t react, busy catching her reward, giving me the time to dig and understand what had just happened. </p><p>My first guess was that I had somehow used my storage of Purified Spark, but a quick check showed that it was not the case. </p><p>It didn’t make me feel any better. I was afraid that I had somehow stolen some Divine Spark from Seldanna, and while the amount was not high enough to make a difference, the way it happened accidentally was not a good sign. Also, at his point, it required almost a thousand points of Divine Spark to increase a point … which was not entirely a small number either. </p><p>Yet, as I turned my attention inward to see how much Spark I had pilfered from her accident, I met with another surprise. </p><p>The amount of Divine Spark I had assigned to support Endurance Stat was still the same as the others … but then, where did that extra point of Endurance come from…</p><p>A hand distracted me from my musings. “Don’t tell me you’re tired already,” Seldanna said playfully, which was followed by a gasp as I immediately pulled her to my lap, a delicious gasp escaping her mouth as I skewered her. </p><p>I made sure she was pointing the other way, making it easy for me to spank her. “Ride me, my goddess,” I ordered as I landed a loud spank. She followed it immediately, giving me another dose of pleasure. </p><p>“So impatient,” I murmured, unable to keep a wide smirk from covering my face. However, that was all I allowed myself to feel before I dug down back to my soul, trying to understand what was going </p><p>At first, I expected Seldanna’s distraction would make it more difficult, but instead, the opposite happened. As she rode me desperately, I felt another flicker in my Stats … and realized that, it was the nascent connection between me and Seldanna responsible for it. </p><p>I had initially assumed that it was just a connection between the two of us, but as she rode me desperately, I soon realized that the connection was actually between her and my Endurance stat. </p><p>{+1 Endurance} </p><p>As my stat increased again, I was able to observe directly … and I made another fascinating discovery. The reason my Endurance increased was the efficiency increase…. And, it was an incredible benefit, as the square relationship between the divine spark meant that while I only needed a hundred spark to increase a stat from ten to eleven … I needed a whopping ten thousand points just to increase from a hundred to a hundred and one…</p><p>Which had meant that it would have been impossible for me to directly compete with any god, the best I could achieve was to escape back to Primordial Aether, where I had the advantage.</p><p>Of course, I had been planning to explore ways to increase that efficiency … but I certainly didn’t expect that to happen in such a smooth manner.  I could feel the connection between us increasing the efficiency, giving me hope that I could reverse it. </p><p>I analyzed the connection more, and I realized it was not just about her power, but also the way she was connected to the Plane inherently. It wasn’t the Divine Spark of hers that was increasing my efficiency, but the land itself. </p><p>She was just a conduit. Which was good, as it meant I wasn’t stealing anything from her. </p><p>However, it was also bad, because it meant there was a limit to it … unless I found a way to increase the size of the planar fragment … which I doubted to be a simple challenge. </p><p>Another problem, I could already feel that the way she was connected to Endurance was inevitably tight, resonating with her Divine Spark in a fundamental manner. </p><p>Meaning, I needed more goddesses if I wanted to spread that effect into the other stats. </p><p>Oh, no! I needed to seduce more goddesses!

    "content": "<p>The moment Vernon stepped into the office where he was supposed to be interning, he immediately adjusted his plans. </p><p>Initially, he had been planning to make a call to one of his acquiescences. Playing the quarterback during his college days, even as a backup, had its benefits, almost as much as his family's money. </p><p>And, considering it was his father that arranged the internship — as a part of his ridiculous attempt to set him up with the daughter of his business partners, thinking that he was building a dynasty just because he was rich — he couldn’t use his family contacts. His father arranged it so that he could meet with the daughter of his business partner without an official setup. </p><p>Apparently, she was rather picky. </p><p>The office he was joining as an intern was a new one, one that was set up for the daughter, who was apparently just graduated, and was enthusiastic about cutting off from her family — like renting a downtown building and converting it into a freelance architecture agency meant cutting from the family. </p><p>Vernon didn’t care much about seducing a rich heiress — though only because it was supposed to be a permanent thing — and he was ready to use his contacts to free himself from the obligation …</p><p>But a glimpse at the receptionist changed his mind. A sexy redhead, looking sexy enough to die for even when she was wearing a boring t-shirt. Though, it looked far more impressive on her body, sticking to her amazing tits. </p><p>Maybe he could stick around a day before changing his internship location. </p><p>“I’m here to start as the intern,” he said. </p><p>“You’re Vernon,” she said, raising her gaze. Vernon was happy to see a blush on her face. Sticking around a day was certainly a good idea. “You’re late.” </p><p>“The building was hard to find,” he said. “Maybe you can show me around and make sure I don’t get lost.” </p><p>Her blush increased. “Maybe, but we need to make sure—“ she started, only for her words to cut off with a gasp, and she turned toward the other end of the office, where a very distinctive clack of a heeled shoe reached to his ear. </p><p>Curious, he looked there, only for his thoughts about his stay in the office immediately. Maybe he could stay for longer than a day. </p><p>The reason for that change. A sexy Asian, wearing a skirt that was far too tiny for the office environment, and an even sluttier shirt that showed her cleavage … along with her absurdly large tits. Just the view alone was enough for him to stick around a couple days more … not to mention all the implications of the way she dressed implied. </p><p>Especially her makeup, shouting neediness.</p><p>Vernon guessed that it wasn’t a usual thing, because the sexy receptionist gasped next to him. “T-that whore,” she said as she stood up, the intensity of her shock showing it was not a regular thing. </p><p>Maybe she prepared for his arrival. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>He watched as the sexy redhead dashed forward. “I can’t believe you dressed like this, Hina. This is a place of business.” </p><p>“Come on, Margaret. Calm down, just because you don’t dare to dress up a bit doesn’t mean that we all need to walk around like nuns,” she answered. “And what’s the harm. I don’t see our dear boss around.” </p><p>“She might be here any day…” </p><p>“Not if she extended her holiday,” Hina answered with a smug smirk. </p><p>“How do you know that?” Margaret answered. “You can’t know that!” </p><p>“I follow her on social media,” she said, and while the redhead froze in shock, she bypassed her and continued walking toward him, the sway of her hips doing nothing to hide her sexiness. </p><p>Oh, Vernon would definitely stay here for a few days. Until that entitled prospective fiancee of his return from her holiday, at least. </p><p>“As you might have heard, I’m Hina, a big fan,” she said. </p><p>“A fan?” Vernon said, amused. </p><p>“I have seen you play against us, and you demolished our team. You were amazing,” Hina said. She tried to sound confident as she said it, but up close, Vernon could see that she lacked confidence. </p><p>Vernon knew the type. A nerd, probably a scholarship student, whose college life had ended the moment she entered the college, not daring to change it. And now, she was desperately trying to change that reputation in her new work, not realizing that she was pushing too much toward the other side. </p><p>Even the way she dressed confirmed it, excessively revealing and slutty, even slightly transparent. Hardly the smartest location. </p><p>“Oh, always nice to meet with a fan,” Vernon said, leaning slightly slower. The slight panic mixing with excitement, followed by the speed she leaned forward showed that Vernon would have a very quick conquest on her. </p><p>The perfect thing to spice up his short office life. </p><p>“Enough, Hina. You can leave. We still need to assign his tasks.” </p><p>Hina walked toward her. “No need to be jealous, just because you can’t get any, miss prude.” </p><p>“I - I’m no prude, just selective,” Margaret answered, though her tone was evasive. </p><p>Hina laughed mockingly. “And you’ll continue to be … selective as long as you come here dressed like this.” </p><p>“It’s better than to dress like a slut,” Margaret answered, though it didn’t have the impact she hoped to have, leaving her frustrated. As Hina walked away, Margaret rushed to him, her beautiful face contorted in anger. </p><p>“You can go start sorting the files in the archive room if you have time to look around and do nothing,” she ordered. </p><p>Vernon could have argued against it, but instead, he let it slide. She was angry, and if he argued against her, he would give her a  chance to target him. Instead, he followed her direction, leaving her trembling in anger. </p><p>He couldn’t wait to see the poor decisions she would do in that terrible state of mind. </p><p>His first moments in his office were certainly fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Fatima expected him to take her when he asked whether she was ready or not … but at that moment, she still had been hoping that he was going to drag her to her bedroom before starting, allowing her to finally use the room for a purpose it had been designed for. </p><p>That hope had died when he pushed her down against the couch … though she could hardly say it was a moment of great insight, as it was only a second between that realization and his monster pushing forward inside her.</p><p>A moan escaped her mouth as a feeling far more intense than anything she had ever felt in her life filled her. “We can stop if you don’t think you can handle it,” Darion said from behind her. It was a terrible time to ask that question, but Fatima didn’t tell that. </p><p>She had a feeling that the timing was deliberate. </p><p>A blush covered her face as she struggled to come up with an answer. Saying him to continue was too difficult for her, her shyness still somehow blocking her from admitting that. </p><p>“Answer me,” he said as he spanked her ass. </p><p>For a moment, she thought about playing coy and saying no, but that, she suppressed just quickly. “P-please continue,” she barely managed to whisper. </p><p>“Excellent,” Darion answered as he slapped her ass once more. It was supposed to be demeaning, but it felt incredibly amazing instead. “Now, let’s move it to a better location.” </p><p>“Really?” Fatima said, excited that they were finally moving to the privacy of her bedroom. </p><p>“Yes,” he said, and just like that, Fatima found herself floating in the air, easily lifted like she weighed nothing. </p><p>He took a step. “T-the stairs not that way,” Fatima corrected rapidly. “We can go from inside as well.” </p><p>“I know,” he answered as he took another step, bringing them in front of the couch, and no other. “Why bother going that much while we have this amazing couch here … and not to mention the amazing view.” </p><p>“But —“ she said, which was all she was able to say as he picked up speed, at a pace that she thought to be impossible in their current position. The explosion of pleasure was enough to rob her of any strength to argue. </p><p>Worst, she was happy with it. She was finally having the private party she hoped to have when she moved to the country, proving that she could handle that nightlife. </p><p>Passively, maybe, but still doing it spectacularly. “Harder,” she moaned. </p><p>“No,” he answered, shocking her. For a moment, she was afraid that they would stop, which was the worst thing she could imagine as the pleasure climbed up. “Do it yourself if you want it faster,” he ordered, spanking her ass as they landed. </p><p>“Y-you think I can handle it,” she whispered, a needy statement that contrasted the situation. She was afraid that, somehow, he’d ask her to stop. </p><p>Luckily, he did not. “As long as you put your sweet ass to it,” he said as he slapped her ass, and she moaned. Yet, she also moved her hips just as he requested. “Try holding onto my legs, the leverage will help,” he suggested. </p><p>Fatima followed that suggestion, her fingers landing on his shockingly hard muscles as her moans started to get out of control. As she moved more, her core started to get more and more drenched, reaching a level that was not possible. </p><p>She lost herself in pleasure… </p><p>Until, he spoke once more. “Damn, girl. I didn’t expect you to be this enthusiastic. It was an amazing warm-up,” he commented.</p><p>The gasp of protest left her mouth automatically. “W-warm up,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, yes. Warm up,” he said as his fingers wrapped under her legs, and suddenly, she found herself moving once more, his touch enough to control her pace. </p><p>“I — I see it now,” she moaned, losing herself in pleasure. She should have tried to exert some kind of control … but that hardly seemed possible or preferable. She abandoned herself to pleasure. </p><p>“Your moans are very beautiful,” he said, and she shivered in desire. The way his voice hit her ears was even more arousing than she expected. The intensity of his invasion was enough to tell that she was losing her connection with reality, the pleasure getting even more intense. “It sounds like you’re ready for the real experience.” </p><p>“R-real experience —“ Fatima started, which was all she was able to say before he flipped her over, and suddenly she found herself on her back, with him above her. </p><p>Missionary position. </p><p>It was supposed to be the most boring sexual position possible, but Darion put his full weight above her as he impaled her with a furious pace, the pleasure was intense enough to cut her last connection with reality. </p><p>Her legs parted open obediently, allowing him to invade her even more. </p><p>She enjoyed as he pinned her in place, one of her hands sneaking down to tease her clit to explode even more. “Oh, someone is feeling needy,” he muttered, noticing that. “Let me give that, then,” he said. </p><p>With that, his pace increased even more, completely destroying her connection with reality as they explored every inch of the couch. </p><p>Only too late, she realized she was forgetting something. “M-Mary,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me she’s watching us,” he said, his tone enough to make her shiver even more. “I thought she would sleep more after that spectacular fucking.” </p><p>“Y-you have been fucking her right now,” Fatima muttered shockingly. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me that you are surprised by it. You already watched us in the morning.” </p><p>Fatima moaned as he pushed even deeper. “N-not that …” she admitted. “Your stamina….” </p><p>Darion chuckled at that even as he brought her to the short end of her couch. “Oh, sweetie, I have an amazing stamina. Don’t worry. You’ll learn that very well soon.” </p><p>Fatima realized that his words implied that it wasn’t a one-time thing, and it further implied that she wasn’t going to be the one that would set that schedule.</p><p>However, as her climax built up, she found it very difficult to correct her…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I continued acting hesitant as her hands started exploring my body more and more, until she cupped my growing shaft like she owned it. “Oh, are you sure you want to go there?” I asked, my tone barely above a whisper. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean, I’m just helping you to feel better,” she said, her amused tone telling me that she had managed to misread the implications of my voice. “We’re in a dangerous situation, and I need you to be hundred percent ready.” </p><p>I was tempted to let her continue, but the intensity of her smugness managed to trigger me. </p><p>I decided to punish her … in a fun way, but punishment still. </p><p>“Oh, and how are you going to do that?” I asked. </p><p>“Like this,” she started as she pushed my pants down, revealing my shaft. She was about to wrap her fingers around my shaft … when I decided it was enough playing the submissive. </p><p>“Well, you’re the expert. I need to trust you. If you think that’s a problem in the ruins, I have no choice but to trust you.” </p><p>“Oh, trust me. We can’t afford you to be distracted,” she moaned as she caressed my naked shaft once more, then leaned against the wall — and empty section, still careful not to damage the drawings — which displayed her ass, wrapped in perfect leather. “It’s hard to resist this, I assume.” </p><p>“It definitely is,” I said with a sudden change of tone and suddenly reached forward, grabbing her ass with both hands. “It’s amazing enough to worth being locked in a deadly ruin.” </p><p>The way her expression shifted was beautiful. Her confidence evaporated in an instant, leaving its place to shock, her panicked yelp hardly helping. “I …” she whispered, which was all she was able to say as she was being utterly molested by my hands. I took a step forward, my massive hard-on pressing against her leather pants</p><p>“Sorry, miss leader, you need to be louder,” I chuckled as I shifted my hand, cupping her pussy. The leather was thick enough to reduce the sensation, so I added a flick, opening the front. “I-isn’t it a bit forward?” she stammered, showing that she was certainly not as confident taking what she was ready to dish out. </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, really? Even when I’m doing exactly what you have been doing,” I whispered throatily, and she shivered. “Oh, wait a moment, one mistake,” I added and pushed her leather pants down, leaving her in her panties. </p><p>Which were considerably smaller than I expected. “Oh, naughty,” I whispered as I grabbed her core once more, the material too thin to reduce the sensation.</p><p>She said nothing, shocked that her little game reversed in a way she hadn’t expected. </p><p>\"Y-you!\" she managed to stammer, but that was all she was able to say as I pulled her arm and then pushed her against the wall, applying the same treatment to her leather top, but this time, I dragged her underwear as well, leaving her amazing tits naked. </p><p>She covered them up protectively as enjoyed that sight. I chuckled at the sight. “Me,” I said. “I can stop, you just need to admit that you’re a little coward that can’t take what you deliver.” </p><p>“I … I’m not a coward,” she stammered, trying to sound confident, but that failed. She was the one that initiated it, but facing my naked body, she realized it was not a good idea. I hovered above her, big enough to fill her sight. </p><p>She could have done something drastic like saying that she wanted to stop … but I could see in her eyes that confusion was prevalent. She was clearly never been in this situation before, and she wasn't entirely sure she wanted to stop.</p><p>“I - I’m not sure,” she admitted. </p><p>“Do you want to have a minute to think?” I offered. </p><p>“I can?” </p><p>“Yes, you just need to keep me entertained in the process,” I said. </p><p>“E-entertain how?” she said, her voice beautifully hesitant. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, you’re a smart woman,” I chimed, rubbing my cock and smiling at her.</p><p>\"Right...\" she whispered, looking indecisive. For a moment, I thought that I had pushed her too much, which would have made the rest of my work considerably more difficult. I had no idea what kind of defenses this place had, but considering my old rival worked hard to look like a loyal retainer rather than trying to threaten her, pushing her too much was risky. </p><p>Luckily, rather than retreating, she turned her back, pushing her ass out. </p><p>\"And if I do this... you’ll give me time to think,” she asked, unable to take her eyes off of my throbbing cock as she looked back. </p><p>\"Exactly, I promise,\" I said, knowing full well that it was an exaggeration at best. I wouldn’t want to stop once we started … but then it was not a problem. She didn’t look like she wanted to stop either. </p><p>She didn’t move the slightest as I pressed my shaft against her ass, her panties not working particularly well to block the sensation. “I’m not going to do all the work, move your ass, sweetie,” I said as I slapped her ass. </p><p>She started moving. \"Do it sexily,” I ordered, and she started moving faster. “Good. Now push your sexy ass more and grind properly.\"</p><p> She followed that order, closing her eyes as she tried to come to a decision, the repeated moves only it harder for her to reject the follow-up requests. More importantly, her panties were getting more drenched each second. </p><p>A minute passed before I caressed her wet snatch over her panties. “Oh, it feels like you have already made your decision,” I whispered. </p><p>She shivered badly. “N-not yet,” she whispered, clearly not knowing what to say. She felt deep embarrassment at the way I was acting and she was reacting. Part of her clearly just wanted to get this over with.</p><p>The more dominant part of her just wanted to continue. </p><p>\"Bend over for some more if you’re going to take that long to decide,\" I said as I put my hand on her hips, and pulled her back, creating enough space between her and the wall for her to bend forward properly. </p><p>She followed, her legs parting open slightly for balance as her hands pressed against the wall, her tits dangling freely. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I enjoyed her bent-over figure, while I tightened my grip around her waist. Then, I pushed forward, changing my target location, my erection passing between her meaty thighs, her wetness enough to make it a slippery journey. </p><p>It was already pushing hard for a delaying activity. \"That's it. Rub your ass around slowly. It’s your fault for teasing me that much,” I said. I could have pushed for more, but I was loving the sensation of her soft, silky-smooth thighs caressing my shaft. And, her indecisive arousal just made the situation more tempting. </p><p>She was having trouble taking the increasing pleasure from the treatment, yet the answer was yet to arrive, which restricted me. Pity that I couldn’t push yet, enjoying the total control over her, her submissiveness spectacular. </p><p>Suppressing my desire to push for more, but I continued to pump back and forth enjoying her growing wetness. I wanted to do more, but luckily, her sexy thighs were beautiful enough to keep things entertaining… </p><p>Still, after it reached the five-minute mark, with no decision, I decided to add another snag. “You need to make another sacrifice for our fun game,” I ordered, and she looked at me questioningly. </p><p>“A-another sacrifice? What?” she whispered. </p><p>“Turn around and drop your panties,” I ordered. She looked hesitant, but her facial expression didn’t stop her movement. She leaned against the wall as she pushed them down, her legs crossed to hide her core. </p><p>“It’s that?’ she whispered. </p><p>“Yes, now you can start dancing,” I said, and she looked shocked. </p><p>“I - I’m not much of a dancer,” she admitted with a blush, implying that there was a story behind it. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in the mood to dig that. I leaned, grabbed her hair, and pulled her for a rough kiss, sticking my tongue down her throat and enjoying her lips. </p><p>When I pulled back, she was dazed. “I don’t like being played, sweetie. Either pay the price for the delay, or make your decision.” </p><p>Her expression told me that it was impossible for her to answer the question negatively, yet somehow, after everything, she was still too shy to answer positively. </p><p>The contrast with her earlier courage was simply too amusing…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, Miriam, are you sad that you had to leave your poor boyfriend after that disastrous bet?” I asked as I pushed Miriam on the desk. She lay on her back, dazed. She didn’t answer immediately, busy receiving from the extended effort she had delivered under the desk, but I didn’t prompt her to move faster, enjoying the naked sight of her jiggling breasts. </p><p>Her top, already struggling under pressure, finally snapped as I helped her move, parting to the side to reveal an unobstructed sight of her amazing breasts… A delicious view all around. </p><p>“I …” she whispered after taking a deep breath that enhanced the sight even more. “I don’t feel guilty, of course,” she managed to answer even as she parted her legs open invitingly, finally angling for the final reward he had been working for the last half an hour. “He was the one that bet my chastity for the game, yet failed. I’m just being a dutiful girlfriend.” </p><p>It was hardly an accurate representation of what had happened, and under difficult circumstances, I would have loved to tease her about that in a lengthy manner. However, she was lucky that I had a match in fifteen minutes, meaning I needed to reward her quickly. </p><p>I didn’t even consider leaving her halfway, not after she had worked that hard to entertain me during the strategy meeting. </p><p>“You’re lucky I don’t have time to waste,” I said as my touch slid down, caressing her naked thigh. Then, without a warning, my touch turned into a spank, echoing in the room. “Let’s see if you can handle what you had been working for.” </p><p>And, with that, I gripped her ass and flipped her, so that her chest was pressing against the desk. It had the disadvantage of hiding her beautiful breasts from sight … but her plump ass was more than enough to compensate. </p><p>Especially with her misaligned cheerleader skirt adding a fun angle. “I guess, as the acting coach, my role is not limited to educating the players. I also need to educate the misbehaving cheerleaders,” I said as I slapped her ass, earning a helpless moan. </p><p>And, before her moan could fade away, slid inside her, enjoying the explosive nature of her following gasp. “You should be careful if you don’t want to be heard from outside,” I said. </p><p>While she tried to compile an answer, I closed my eyes, enjoying her tightness. She wrapped around me tightly, each push giving me an incredible jolt of pleasure. The soft sinking feeling I experienced as my fingers disappeared into her flesh.</p><p>“I don’t care,” she answered, the explosive moan that followed confirming her lack of concern about it being known. It didn’t surprise me that much-considering everything that led toward it, but still, it was impressive. </p><p>And, I knew for a fact that people could hear us … and not only that, but also sharing the audio of the event. The nature of the Intent I was collecting left no doubt about that. </p><p>“Even if people were sharing your amazing voice,” I answered, still feeling responsible enough to remind her that. </p><p>“Hardly a drawback,” she managed to answer, the longest sentence she could deliver as her moans got more and more intense. I shrugged before continuing to impale her. If it was not a problem for her, it was not a problem for me. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean it wouldn’t be a scandal for me. I had no doubt that people would start mentioning my name along with that scandal, contrasting it with the same event. There was even a chance that it could become a part of the growing national scandal…</p><p>If I was lucky. </p><p>After all, unlike the others, I didn’t have a giant business enterprise that could be tarnished. My only involvement was with Megan’s nascent startup … and for her, any scandal meant free advertisement. </p><p>Especially factoring in the other detail, that I was a literal hero to the city, giving them two memorable victories back to back after a long draught without a hint of success. I had no doubt that, the more I got targeted, the more items Megan would sell. </p><p>I knew that to be the case … as unlike the frantic calls I would have received if it was harmful, Megan sent only one message. ‘Make sure that whore wears our top while leaving,’ the message read, showing that she was already planning to make it a part of her marketing campaign. </p><p>I got the magical Intent I still desperately needed, Miriam got the five minutes of fame she was looking for, and Megan got her business opportunity. Everyone was happy … well, except for the poor guy who had been just humiliated on and off the field … but I didn’t particularly care about him. He wasn’t a hot girl. </p><p>“Harder,” Miriam moaned, making me focus on the present,  loud despite her trembling voice. I shrugged as I tightened my hold and pushed forward, the sound of flesh hitting flesh enough to echo from the walls, leaving absolutely no doubt about what was going on in the room — not that it was a mystery before.</p><p>“As you wish, whore,” I said as I decided to spank her ass, adding another layer to the explosive sounds, her voice intensifying even further. </p><p>Soon,, I stopped spanking. Instead, I leaned forward, grabbing her hair for extra leverage, and pulled her hard enough to lift her, the pain of the pull just enough to trigger her moans even further. She clearly enjoyed the rougher treatment. </p><p>I leaned forward as well, far enough that my breath was falling on her neck, her body trapped between the desk and my body, putting enough weight to be uncomfortable. </p><p>That only made her moans more intense, climbing toward the climax. </p><p>“More, more, more! You magnificent bastard!” she moaned, driving closer and closer to the climax. And, when I used her raised torso to my advantage to sneak a hand and twist her nipple, that gave her the last bit of help she needed to topple over the hill. </p><p>And, she collapsed, her moans turning dazed. </p><p>I pulled out, and she collapsed over the desk,, murmuring in a daze. “That was … amazing.” </p><p>I chuckled. “It was, but it was also just five minutes, we still have ten minutes to kill,” I answered as I grabbed her hips and flipped her. She lay on her back, her eyes parted open in shock. </p><p>“Y-you’re lying. There’s no way it had been only five minutes.” </p><p>“Really,” I chuckled as I slapped her breast, enjoying its jiggles, then pointed at the clock on the wall. “How about this, then?” I chuckled. </p><p>“I … I don’t know. Maybe it’s not correct —“ she argued, which was cut short as I pushed inside her, cutting her words short. </p><p>“It’s not like you’re the one with a timetable, sweetie,” I said as I started moving. “Just enjoy.” </p><p>She opened her mouth, but neither agreement nor argument left her mouth. She just moaned, her body hypersensitive after a climax. I pushed recklessly, her moans making it even more fun for me as my shaft explored her depths once more. </p><p>I could have used my hand or my lips to silence her … but considering we were well past the point of hiding what was going on in the room from the public, I decided to let her … each moan and cry working as a monument to my sexual prowess. </p><p>With some incredible results.</p><p>[Intent Pool: 57.4%] </p><p>Almost thirty percent increase since I had arrived, more than half coming after I had sent the rest of the team away. </p><p>I continued to push inside her repeatedly. I was satisfied with the gains I had made, but she deserved a reward for the process … a reward that I was more than willing to give to her. </p><p>“Do you think you can last ten minutes,” I asked. I felt her stiffen at my question, one that was quickly destroyed by her moans. </p><p>“I — don’t — know,” she said, each word interrupted by a moan, not that I could blame her when I deliberately quickened the beat of my hips. As my invasion draw near to its end, she achieved the impossible, tightening even further. </p><p>“Do you want me to slow down?” I asked, chuckling as I asked. It took a while for her to answer, but considering the blush on her face, more intense than anything I felt on her, was more than enough as an answer. “No, don’t you dare!” she managed to answer a while later.</p><p>“As you wish,” I said, quickening my invasion even further, and when she tightened once more, it brought me to the edge of an explosion. I pulled the last moment, spraying her beautiful tits with my cum, the color of it contrasting beautifully with her dusky skin. </p><p>A spectacular fun, I thought as I pulled back, and removed my new top, throwing it on her.  </p><p>“Just to make sure everyone knows who is responsible for your state. Make sure you wear it,” I said even as I pulled her skirt off. </p><p>The t-shirt was tall enough to function as a skirt for her, after all. A dangerously mini one, but still good enough. </p><p>“You look nice,” I said as she sat on the desk, still dazed as I caressed her cheek. “Pity I need to leave you, but I have a match to win.” </p><p>With that, I chuckled and walked, and when I opened the door, Kim was there, holding another shirt for me. “Busy day, right,” I chuckled. </p><p>“Yes, pity you’re going to miss the photo shoot,” Kim answered with a dark chuckle as she passed me, closing the door behind her. </p><p>For a moment, I thought about following her inside to reeducate her about the perils of teasing me. </p><p>Pity I had a match to win, and a coach to humiliate. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The ability to weaponize lust was an interesting concept, I realized as I started to tease the buxom girl on my lap. It was probably about the nature of it, but even as I pushed the transformed Intent, I could feel it finding only a limited purchase on Miriam. </p><p>I suspected it was the same reason the echo had disappeared. I thought about focusing on re-establishing that, but after some consideration, I changed my mind. I had some interesting ideas to shift Miriam’s perception — an edge play that would take half a day the mildest of my ideas — but my current location was hardly the place to apply those. </p><p>Yet, that was the less consequential of the two reasons. I was afraid that, if I pushed Miriam in that direction too much, her reaction would start to be qualified as worship … which was not something that I wanted to try. </p><p>I still remembered the cursed fires and the mysterious disappearance of the cult. </p><p>In moments like that, I pitied that my guide was available to be consulted. Unfortunately, her attitude assured her that her current imprisonment was still the best idea. Her initial ditzy mood had been bad enough, but the way her attitude changed as she recovered was certainly not a helpful direction. </p><p>No, it was best that she would stay locked until an emergency forced my hand. </p><p>Miriam let out a moan, making me focus on the present. “Naughty girl,” I whispered as I let my hand move higher on her thick thigh, making her squirm even more, while the players still continued to draw the tactics as I requested. </p><p>“Draw faster,” I ordered even as I teased Miriam even more. </p><p>“Yes, faster,” she said as well,  not bothering to hide the needy quality in her tone, making the players snicker in amusement. But, it was evidence of the hold I had over them that none of them even raised their head, working as requested. </p><p>Teasing Miriam’s delicate thighs was fun, but it was not something I wanted to get stuck on for an extended period of time … not when I would soon leave for the promised match. I let my fingers climb further, finally touching her wetness, her lack of panties making it much easier.</p><p>She managed to hold back her moan, which was admirable, but it didn’t last long as my Lust-intent touched her, elevating her sensitivity even more. “Oh, that’s—“ she managed to whisper before she let out a beautiful cry, one that was probably enough to be heard from outside. </p><p>That was enough to make several players raise their heads to see what was going on, but they found me looking at the screen with rapt attention even as Miriam desperately wiggled on my lap … and, I felt the echo of the Command Domain getting even stronger on them. </p><p>An interesting development. </p><p>Curious, I decided to push that aspect even further. While my fingers disappeared into Miriam, pushing her display of arousal to an even more intense level, I rewound the basketball play that was on the screen. “Now, who can tell me why the opponents chose to drive at this moment despite the paint being crowded?” I asked.</p><p>The sudden question startled the players, but I managed to use that subtle sense of Command sensation mentally, making them focus on the play.  “I …” one of them murmured. </p><p>“Because our pivot was a step behind the location he was supposed to stay, creating an easy jump shout opportunity. He can’t contest it without risking a foul,” another player commented after some thinking. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said, using the laser pointer with my empty hand and drawing three lines. “Actually, despite the crowd, we have three safe lines of approach, and the attacker could have taken any of them with a good success percentage,” I explained. </p><p>They nodded seriously, showing that I was somehow pulling the wise coach act even with the squirming beauty on my lap. </p><p>“Continue drawing,” I ordered even as I turned my focus back on Miriam, my empty hand landing on her top to aggressively maul her tits, which, unlike what was going underneath, wasn’t blocked by the desk. The only sacrifice I had did was to keep my hand over her top to maintain a semblance of propriety. </p><p>Not that it was critical. She had shown that she wasn’t particularly torn-up about nudity considering she had been a volunteer stripper during the victory celebration, and her dressing choices while coming here hardly disagreed with it. </p><p>When she first came, she was determined to tease me, but that determination experienced a rapid death as the climax hit her, and hit her hard. </p><p>She moaned and trembled on my lap helplessly as the players snickered, her reaction intense enough to suggest that she had stopped caring about our audience and the camera she had arranged already. Luckily for her, that already stopped. </p><p>The moment she recovered, her hands reached down, trying to pull down my shorts. Unfortunately for her, that was not something I planned to allow. </p><p>Yet. </p><p>“W-what?” she stammered, drunk with pleasure, as I pushed her hand away. </p><p>“That’s not allowed, honey,” I started, and her eyes widened in panic … and that moment, I felt the flicker of Lust growing in her once more, confirming my earlier guess about it being linked to being unattainable. </p><p>Luckily for her, I didn’t want to experiment further on that aspect. I smirked as I dragged my finger on her pouty lips, then pointed to the large space under the desk. “You need to earn that first, sweetie,” I said. </p><p>I expected her to follow that suggestion, but I didn’t expect her to follow it with a shocking speed, her knees actually hitting on the ground hard enough to injure her. I actually had to flood her body with some recovery energy to prevent the pain. </p><p>She pulled down my shorts, the echo of lust disappearing at the same time her lips wrapped around my shaft. </p><p>I leaned back on my chair, closing my eyes to enjoy the sudden assault of pleasure. Miriam started far faster than I had expected, taking my shaft to her throat with shocking aggression ... not without a cost, her gagging filling the room. </p><p>Mixing with the snickering of the players. “Let’s start going through your tactics,” I ordered, gesturing for the one nearest to completion to walk forward to me. </p><p>“Right now, coach?” he asked, surprised.</p><p>“Yes,” I said even as I pushed my chair forward slightly, ensuring that Miriam would stay safely under the desk, not adding any visual to her amazing vocal show, her gags mixing with her slobbering as she delivered an amazing deep-throat show. </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed with her show. The smoothness of her action showed that it was not something that she was used to, but her enthusiasm was more than enough to compensate for it. I looked at her, her hair covering my lap, her lips straining around my girth as she bobbed her head repeatedly,  each enthusiastic push straining her throat even more. </p><p>Yet, her enthusiasm only increased further. </p><p>I was impressed with the speed she adapted to her new station, showing her willingness to endure some punishment as she did her best to devour the entirety of my shaft. </p><p>“Now, let’s go through what your old coach was calling tactics,” I declared mockingly, my expression relaxed as if nothing was going on. With the noises coming under the desk telling the story of what was going on, my calm expression further reinforced my authority — as evidenced by the pull of the command I could feel from them. </p><p>“As you wish, coach,” he answered, and we started going through the tactics. I made sure to give an insightful comment on every single tactic, using the teaching ability I had developed due to my old Tutor Trait to make sure those stuck. </p><p>Watching his expression change with each comment. I had seen the exact same expression on the face of the football players many times as well, something that was supposed to be complicated and hard to understand clicking in their minds, leaving them shocked that how they didn’t understand it before. </p><p>“Thanks, coach,” he said, and went back to his seat. The next player arrived, repeated it … and the following half an hour passed in that routine. Not only I had learned the tactics they were competent at, but also enhanced them and used the opportunity to teach the most promising ones to the rest. </p><p>Of course, it would have ordinarily taken days of dedicated film study to properly communicate those nuances, but my System made that process far more efficient. </p><p>“That’s all,” I said. “We have the game in fifteen minutes. You can go and start warming up, I don’t want you to pull a muscle.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” they said, and started to walk toward the door, but noticed I was sitting. </p><p>One of the braver ones looked at me. “Aren’t you going to join us, coach,” he said, his tone mocking. </p><p>“Go ahead, I have something to finish,” I answered with a chuckle, not bothering to admonish him. After all, during the whole session, they had been listening to Miriam’s gags and moans, yet the suppression of Command prevented them from making a comment. </p><p>Especially since it didn’t stop for a moment — mostly due to my excessive usage of Recovery on Miriam, which kept her from collapsing under exhaustion or the strain of her activities — making it truly torture for them. </p><p>They chuckled as they left, their fingers already on their phones — and the following burst of Intent suggested that they were already gossiping about what had happened. </p><p>Just what I needed, I thought even as I pulled back suddenly, grabbed Miriam, and pushed her onto the desk. “You worked hard, honey. Let’s give you your reward!” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Seldanna said nothing as I wrapped my arms around her divine being, not that words were necessary to convey her feelings. The way she trembled under my arms was enough. </p><p>I said nothing as well, just leaned down to snuggle to the nape of her neck, taking a deep breath, enjoying the novel nature of her new smell, which was a mind-bending mixture of the most beautiful flowers imaginable, intoxicating in its nature, enough to reveal her divine nature.</p><p>I delivered a soft, lingering kiss on her neck, and she shivered helplessly. I enjoyed her warmth against my chest even as I felt the beautiful texture of her skin, her beauty was truly unmatched. Admittedly, even the dress of leaves she had conjured for herself had an unmatched softness, adding a nice texture, yet not blowing her body from my touch.  </p><p>It seemed that godhood had other perks that were near unlimited power and dominion, one that was even more interesting for me. </p><p>“So, my goddess,” I whispered after I kissed her neck again, enjoying the way she reacted to my barest touch, showing that I wasn’t the only one enjoying the more carnal benefits of her transformation. “We have played enough. Do you think it’s finally the time to celebrate your successful elevation?” </p><p>She shivered, catching my gaze, her desire burning even more than I expected. “Yes, worship me,” she whispered, though her needy tone contrasted with the haughty nature her words tried to reflect. </p><p>“As you wish, my goddess,” I answered. I was tempted to teach her the mistake of trying to order me around —  the fun way, of course — but after some thought, I decided to follow her direction. After all, not only she had become an actual goddess, but also she defeated the Avatar of an enemy god. </p><p>More than enough to earn some rare preferential treatment. </p><p>“Wait, really?” she whispered, showing that even with all the power,  she was unused to her authority. It was good, as I had no intention of letting her get arrogant. </p><p>Playful obedience, however, was a different matter.  </p><p>“You’re a goddess, Seldanna,” I whispered as I tightened my grip around her waist, pulling her closer. “Who am I to reject your holy decree?” </p><p>She let out a dismissive chuckle at the misleading nature of my words. Understandable, as my full erection was leaning between her cheeks. Hardly a move that conveyed respect.</p><p>However, while Seldanna mocked my words with a giggle, she made no move to extract herself from that position; unless the way she was moving her body slowly up and down was a way to slowly free herself from my domineering grasp. </p><p>While I played with her, I cast a spell, slowly lowering us to the ground, where a huge bed made of leaves appeared. I let her go from my hold, and she lay on her back immediately, her rapid movement revealing her desperate desire, enough to destroy the dignified aura she wanted to cultivate. </p><p>And, if her blush was any evidence, she realized that after she ended up on her back. “Undress me,” she ordered, trying to sound haughty to compensate for her earlier slip, but it made her look even cuter instead.</p><p>“As you wish, my goddess,” I said as I leaned above her, and put my hands on her dress that was made of thousands of leaves, and removed one piece. Then another, and another… each enhancing her impatience further. </p><p>So, before I could even reach two-digit numbers, her dress suddenly parted open, timed to look like my touch had removed a critical piece, revealing her breasts, which looked even more incredible after her transformation. </p><p>Alluring enough to change my mind about slowly teasing her. I leaned forward, enjoying her gaze filled with excitement getting more intense as I got closer. Unfortunately, that eye contact didn’t last long. </p><p>Fortunately, the alternative was even better. I buried my head into the glorious valley between her breasts, licking them slowly, their taste more spectacular than the most amazing nectar imaginable. </p><p>Seldanna let out a moan of pleasure … which had some interesting effects. Some of the effects, like the ones that had on my body, were perfectly understandable. As her needy moan hit my ear, I felt my body burn with an intense desire. It almost felt like a magical compulsion, and if I didn’t know my own body intimately when it came to that subject, I might have actually believed it. </p><p>But it was my own body, treating her moan as a delicious sustenance. At first, I thought that it was just an illusion, but as I closed my eyes to feel the energies of my body — without stopping the dance of my lips over her amazing breasts, naturally — I realized that it was actually the case. The Divine Spark in my body building a connection with hers. </p><p>It was a soft connection, with the potential to grow further. But I didn’t panic, as I recognized the unique nature of the Companion bond.  The details were different without the System to modify it … but I could feel deep inside me that it was the true form of Companion Connection, and the System-Assisted version was a watered-down variant. </p><p>A nice finding, I thought as I continued licking her breasts, my fingers caressing her stomach to make her tremble sexily. She moaned again, and the effect triggered once more.</p><p>This time, I turned my attention to the external effects, which were not about me, at least not directly. I had already detected that, as a Goddess, she had some kind of connection with the land itself. It was the same kind of connection that the memories of the old god showed. </p><p>I just didn’t know if it was something unique to Nature Spark, or something that was integral to every god, my information was extremely limited. The avatar of the necromancer god didn’t have such a connection,  but that didn’t mean much. </p><p>In the end, one thing was certain. Seldanna’s connection with the land getting stronger was a good thing. It would allow her to use her power remotely with much greater efficiency, which was the greatest advantage of the gods and goddesses. Even I couldn’t do that. </p><p>I had my own tricks, like the one that I used with the God Forest, but I realized that it only worked because there was no god in the fragmented plain at that moment. If I tried to replicate the same trick while using Nature Spark, Seldanna could block it easily, and even if I used another Spark, it would end up with a bitter struggle where she held a great, incredible advantage. </p><p>Since I could still be confident in escaping if Seldanna ever changed her mind, rather than doing the silly thing and interfering, I helped her further by creating a hidden ward in the Aether dimension, one that would convert Aether particles into pure mana and feed it to her — while also conveniently getting rid of remaining necrotic mana in the Aether Dimension. </p><p>Well, I didn’t feed it to her but to the God Forest, not willing to distract her from her amazing state, but practically, it was the same thing. It quickened her bonding with the land several times without interrupting her fun. </p><p>And, speaking of her fun, she let out a spectacular moan as I took her nipple between my lips, my tongue teasing it. The resulting moans were spectacular enough to convince me to focus on our pleasure,  ignoring everything else. </p><p>My fingers danced more aggressively on her stomach, making her tremble under my fingers. She opened her mouth to say something, but only a moan escaped her pretty lips. “So, my goddess, are you enjoying my worship?” I whispered as I started moving up, kissing her collarbone. </p><p>“Stop speaking and start working, you insolent mortal,” she said, her attempt to sound angry dying a quick death as she immediately followed it with an explosive moan. </p><p>“How about if I start like this,” I said as I started moving lower down, kissing her stomach as I moved lower. “Do you think you can handle it?” </p><p>“O-of course I can handle it. I’m a goddess,” she moaned, which would have been more convincing if she had been able to keep herself from stammering as the pleasure invaded her divine senses. </p><p>And, I was yet to reach her wetness. </p><p>When I finally reached there, she let out an even more explosive moan, and with her pleasure, the forests around us got even stronger. Her taste was beautiful, tinged with overwhelming arousal as my fingers danced around her knob, my tongue dipping to her wetness, bringing her divine qualities to the surface. </p><p>“It’s good that your pleasure is useful for growing even more forests,” I said as I chuckled, taking a small break. </p><p>Her blush thickened further as she examined the surrounding area. “T-then, you better start working faster,” she whispered shyly. “The forests need all the help they could get.” </p><p>“For the environment,” I chuckled as I lowered my head…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 30    Charisma: 30</p><p>Precision: 30    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 30     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 30       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 30}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 237555}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 1103  Mana: 2410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Elven Goddess - ???}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I stood in front of Seldanna, I said nothing for a moment, focusing on assessing the differences between an Avatar and the actual presence of a god … and found the difference suffocatingly different. No wonder that, for all her inexperience and her lacking power, Seldanna managed to defeat the Avatar easily. </p><p>Without my latest burst of Stats, her presence would have been suffocating … and even then, the only reason I wasn’t collapsing was because she wasn’t using her power on me directly. </p><p>At her current state, I would have no chance of winning … now that we were face to face, even escaping her would have been challenging. Luckily, even if she decided to suddenly go crazy and betray the man who had not only saved her people from certain extinction but also helped her to ascend to divinity, I could have used the incredible amount of Divine Spark I had collected from the defeated Avatar to increase my stats… </p><p>And with that improvement, I should be able to escape successfully. </p><p>Of course, the fact that I was making various plans to escape as I faced Seldanna told nothing nice about my state of mind … but after living as an utterly powerless being for most of my life, I was not comfortable facing someone that outclassed me significantly. </p><p>Luckily, the long battle between the two, combined with the scraps of memories I had received, gave me a better understanding of how they fought. Both the undead and Seldanna were overly reliant on their environment, without abilities that could deliver a burst of damage. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my experience with different types of Divine Sparks, I would have assumed it was a weakness that was shared by all gods … but I knew that sparks like Light certainly didn’t have that vulnerability. </p><p>A problem for the future, I thought as Seldanna landed in front of me in her real form, letting me take the differences. The biggest was her clothes. Gone were her robes, replaced by a living dress made of leaves, each brimming with enough mana to make a weaker mage go blind. And, that was the most minor difference. </p><p>Her hair and skin had also changed. Her skin maintained its flawless quality, but turned green. Luckily, it was the soft, soothing green of flesh leaves, somehow adding to her beauty than distracting from it. Her hair was a darker shade of green, living flowers peeking through its lushness. </p><p>Just by standing, the surrounding aura of decay and destruction disappeared, replaced by thick grass and the most beautiful flowers I had ever seen, their smell alone more intoxicating than a strong drink. </p><p>I didn’t need to feel the way she connected to every being with a Nature Spark — except mine which I kept locked behind a tantric ward — to be assured of her true divinity. </p><p>“Someone had been being a bad boy, lying quite a bit,” was her first words. </p><p>I smirked, amused by the direction she chose, which was far better than the alternatives, showing that her new power didn’t destroy her sense of humor. “Well, I wouldn’t say lying. More like creatively re-interpreting the truth rather than flat-out lying.” </p><p>“Very creatively. You should be a storyteller rather than a … mage,” she said, though the last part hesitant. I could sense that she wanted to call me something else, but lacked the words to define me. Which was not exactly unfair, as I lacked them as well. I was not a mortal, but I also wasn’t a god, not the way the other gods functioned, at least. </p><p>Though, considering I could feel Seldanna being linked to the very land, which empowered and imprisoned her at the same time, I wasn’t sure I wanted to be one. Not with the Eternals inevitably poking around. They were not an enemy that I could just bunker down to defeat. </p><p>“I’m a man of many skills,” I said, letting my smirk turn salacious. “As you very well know.” </p><p>She avoided my gaze, even turning away to hide her face to hide her blush. I chuckled, amused that divinity didn’t prevent her from blushing. She followed it with a spell, and a bunch of plants appeared around her, hiding her from view. When they disappeared, she was sitting on a throne made of plants. </p><p>Which would have been more impressive if the only reason she went to that trouble was to hide her shyness. </p><p>“So, what were your plans when you arrived?” she asked, desperately trying to change the subject in order not to destroy any gravitas of her first true showing as divinity, unaware of the fact that trying that hard destroyed any hope of it succeeding. “Were you aiming for the slumbering god from the beginning?” </p><p>Despite the sensitive nature of the question, she didn’t have a hint of anger in her voice, and that was not because she was an amazing actress. Though, it made sense, as regardless of the answer, she didn’t have much to be concerned about, considering she ended up being a god rather than ending up as the minion of an ancient god with little care about the lives of his minions — a fact that Seldanna was aware of thanks to the memories she had received. </p><p>I delayed answering, letting my smirk widen as I did so. Instead, I waved my hand, creating a throne made of bare stone, just a bit larger than hers, making her eye twitch slightly. She fed it slightly more mana, which increased the size of her throne to pass mine. </p><p>“Truthfully, nothing,” I answered. “My aim wasn’t to arrive here, but to escape the group that was using the undead as a tool to expand their forces. The only reason I picked this plane among the others was that I could feel the undead invasion was ongoing rather than complete, giving me a chance to recover. Anything else, including our fortunate meeting, was just luck.” </p><p>I chuckled even as I let my throne grow to pass hers in size. “Don’t tell me that you’re unhappy about meeting me,” I said with an exaggerated needy tone. “I don’t think my poor heart could handle it.” </p><p>Her eye twitched in annoyance, making me wonder whether it was about my teasing tone, or the fact that my throne was higher than hers once more. “I don’t know, it’s hard to think that my innocence was taken by such a liar,” she answered, her throne growing further. </p><p>“Oh, it hurts, after everything I sacrificed,” I mocked her, my throne growing even bigger. </p><p>She smiled, trying to let it grow more … but only to experience a snag. An artificial one, in the form of a ward, refined her nature mana into pure mana, reducing the strength of her throne, and making the flowers that covered the surface fade. </p><p>“Oh, that’s how you want to play,” she growled in mock anger, and suddenly, several roots burst out of her throne, digging into my earthen one. I might have been able to defend if  I had elemental mana to actually reinforce, but considering I was still using Pure mana as a proxy, it was impossible to win against natured mana. </p><p>Especially when said natured mana was used by an actual goddess. </p><p>Instead, I created a floating throne made of Arcana mana, but with a touch of light, enough to make her widen at the sudden trick. I was revealing a secret to her, and she knew enough about me to guess it was not accidental. </p><p>I was extending my trust toward her, which made her react favorably, and I abused that trust by…</p><p>Creating an even bigger, floating throne. “It seems that I’m the victor,” I declared with an exaggerated laugh. </p><p>“You bastard,” she growled, playful anger replacing her emotional state, and a veritable forest burst out of the ground, their branches trying to grab me. I dashed away in my floating throne, and she chased, creating the most impactful tag game imaginable. </p><p>I chuckled as she chased, going toward the destroyed landscape. And, as she chased me by creating more and more trees and other plants, we left behind a huge, growing forest … it would take a while for the animal life to return, but it was a start. </p><p>I escaped and she chased for hours, making it a fun but exhausting game out of reforming the plane after the undead assault, the most critical aspects of the land recovering under our incredible chase. However, as she chase me, I could see significant signs of exhaustion on her… </p><p>And that was with her using the God Forest as some kind of weapon to spread life. Without it, even for a goddess, it would have taken weeks and months of hard work. Combined, it was a good, fruitful activity, not only entertaining, but also repairing the worst of the damage that was delivered to the undead. </p><p>I slowed down, letting her trees surround me and cut off my path. “You’re surrounded, I win,” she declared. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I answered with a chuckle, and teleported behind her, hugging her from behind. “It seems that you’re the one that got caught…” </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 30    Charisma: 30</p><p>Precision: 30    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 30     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 30       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 30}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 237555}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 1103  Mana: 2410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Elven Goddess - ???}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>It had been a while since Fatima had stumbled over what had been going on in her pool when she went back to her living room, unable to resist sneaking a peek. </p><p>She shouldn’t do it, that much she knew, but after living all of her life in a repressive country, having some decadent fun was the only reason she had decided to live in America — only for a lifetime of shyness to prevent her. </p><p>Peeking the fun of her young house guest was hardly the scene she had imagined to start. It was certainly pathetic, but seeing the man she claimed to be her swimming instructor from a closer point was too tempting. </p><p>It was why she was behind her couch, trying to catch their view, hoping that, in her absence, they had already moved out of the water. </p><p>Fatima wanted to see get a much better view. </p><p>However, as she looked, she ended up disappointed. “Come on,” she whispered, trying to see them, only to fail. Disappointment welled up in her. “Don’t tell me that they had gone somewhere else.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m still here, miss,” came the answer from behind her. It was a sharp, throttling tone, one that sent shivers through her body. </p><p>But, the quality of the voice, no matter how much it burned her loins, wasn’t the most important part. That honor went to the fact that it came from behind her… </p><p>Panic — and excitement — rose in her as she jumped up to her feet, and looked at him. It didn’t help her emotions any when she saw him, even closer than she expected and completely naked. They burned even more intensely. “Y-you can’t walk around like that around the house,” she managed to stammer. </p><p>“Oh, can’t I?” he answered softly, but as he took a small step forward, his movement promised her everything she wished to enjoy when she moved here. Yet, she only took a hesitant step back. “Isn’t it a bit unfair?” </p><p>“Unfair, how?” Fatima answered. Suddenly facing his naked body in such close quarters, she had trouble thinking straight, but even with her addled mind, she recognized the trap. </p><p>She just lost the ability to deny his implicit aura of demanding obedience, even to the point of answering that question. </p><p>“You walk around wearing that sexy thing. That’s even more attractive than being naked…” </p><p>“I…” she whispered, unable to answer as she processed an unexpected compliment. It was not exactly the most thoughtful one she had ever received, but delivered him, it felt different. “I’m not sure that’s appropriate,” she felt herself admitting. </p><p>Even as she cursed herself. The opportunity she was looking for was right in front of her, but still, she was unable to take it. </p><p>“You’re right,” he said, and she had a sinking feeling, expecting him to walk away. She avoided her gaze in shame, disgusted by her inability to flirt. Even facing a naked man, wearing a sexy nightie, she failed to flirt. </p><p>She prepared to leave. </p><p>“Of course, I can’t be sure whether you look better naked or in this sexy nightie. Do you want me to give a glimpse so I can be sure?” </p><p>“Y-you think so,” she said, blushing badly as she played with her hair … cursing her reflexive action. She shouldn’t be doing her best to look like a silly girl in a schoolyard, doing her best to make him snort and walk away … especially since he had such a young and beautiful girl to go back to. </p><p>Her age wasn’t making things any easier. </p><p>“Of course, it’s only a certain way,” he said. “So, can I interest you to get rid of that sexy lingerie and let me compare properly?” </p><p>“I …” she whispered, trying to gain some time as she tried to process the most absurd moment of her life, too confused to act decisively. Yet, her shyness reared its ugly head soon. “Isn’t it a bit too fast?” </p><p>“Nonsense, that’s only appropriate for you to dress to the level of your guests. So, unless you’re saying that you have a problem with my state of dress and telling me to wear more…</p><p>“No!” she gasped, the answer forcing itself away. </p><p>“Excellent,” he answered and took another step forward. She tried to retreat, forgetting that she had her couch to block her path until it hit her calves. He put his hand on her chin, and she shivered. “Now, let’s get rid of this pesky stuff,” he whispered. </p><p>Fatima was frozen, helpless as his finger touched the strings of her top, which was barely hanging on in the first place. It slipped down, revealing her naked tits to him for, the first time in a long while. She couldn’t help but wait for his order.</p><p>“A-are they beautiful?” she found herself stammering, cursing herself as she did so. </p><p>“They are delicious,” he answered, and she shivered in excitement. “Now, let’s see the rest,” he added, making the rest of her dress down. “Well, I’ll stand corrected, you look much better naked.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” she said, feeling herself blushing as she raised her leg, crossing it to hide her core, unable to handle the process at the same time. </p><p>“Yes, now, tell me you don’t want to waste such a beautiful opportunity.” </p><p>The smirk she had on his face told her that it was a trap … a trap that she wanted to step in. What better way than to start her new life by following the direction of such a man. She wanted him to drag her to her bedroom, and do the exact same thing he had done to Mary. </p><p>“Of course not —“ she answered, expecting him to drag her there. When he grabbed her shoulder, her voice was cut short, ready to be dragged …</p><p>Which was why, she was shocked when, rather than dragging her away, he pushed her down. She opened her mouth, but before she could ask for a change of location, he pushed his hips forward … preventing her from speaking up. </p><p>He pushed forward, her lips stretching around his shaft. With her conservative upbringing, she was unfamiliar with oral, and her experience was limited to a few attempts with a toy before she decided that it was a boring activity.</p><p>But she was learning quickly that, the presence of a throbbing monster in her mouth was something else. She knew she should have been hating the feeling, but instead, the only thing she felt was pleasure as he forced his monster down her throat. </p><p>He showed absolutely no regard for her comfort … and she loved it.  It was everything she imagined, and more. </p><p>Even with her breath being cut by his aggressive invasion, she found herself unable to resist the temptation. She moaned in shock when it got too big for her to contain, gasping and gagging … continuing for a while when he finally pulled back, letting her take a breath. </p><p>“W-we shouldn’t be doing this…” she found herself whispering once she regained her voice.</p><p>He smirked. “Oh, you want me to stop?” </p><p>Fatima froze at the moment. Her shyness begged her to admit that, hoping that he would continue … but a more primal part of her disagreed. What if he actually followed that, and went back to Mary.</p><p>“N-no, just not here,” she whispered. “It’s too public.” </p><p>“Come on, honey. No harm, Mary is already sleeping, and your mansion is safe enough.” </p><p>Fatima opened her mouth to answer, but before she could do so, he lifted her, the ease he was able to do so bordering ridiculous. </p><p>His muscles were certainly not for show … which made her imagine how it would feel to be trapped under him mercilessly. At the same time, her moans exploded once more as his fingers invaded her core … leaving her helpless for the possibility of more. </p><p>“Let’s help you on your feet,” he whispered as he lifted her, and for a moment, disappointment filled her, thinking they had reached the end of their little fun, destroyed by her shyness … but then, he pulled her against his body, his shaft nestled between her cheeks, her fingers teasing her core once more. </p><p>“Now, are you ready for the next step?” he asked. Fatima was unable to answer the question … but luckily, this time, she was convinced that an answer was not necessary. </p><p>He seemed to be quite happy to lead the situation without any of her input. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Alone in a very dangerous ancient ruin, accompanied by a sexy leather-clad lady, I was having trouble focusing on the issue. I was tempted to push her against the wall, enjoying her against the ancient writings…</p><p>Ironically, the only thing that prevented me from doing so was her hungry gaze looking at my naked body. I had always liked a sprinkle of danger mixed with my fun … but Audrum’s expression suggested that she might have been suffering an even deeper variant of after-danger horniness. </p><p>My earlier, tantric-tinged mood setting pushed that sensation even deeper. </p><p>And, to see just how far I could goad her was too tempting to ignore. “Fascinating,” I said as I looked at the writings, acting like I wasn’t paying any attention to her. </p><p>At first, she appreciated my lack of attention, using the opportunity to ogle my body like her eyes were attached to my body with sticking spells, tracing the contours of my body, and lingering on the occasional splatters of blood to further remind her of the danger.</p><p>No wonder she was exploring dungeons despite her lack of magical capabilities. </p><p>However, as I continued not to pay any attention to her and instead stayed focused on the wall, she started to get frustrated. Of course, I made sure to shift ‘carelessly’ and accidentally made a show of my muscles, noticing her appreciative gaze, the low-key tantric aura fueling the area even more. </p><p>She took a step back, and while I felt curious, I ignored the temptation to turn and look. Then, a while later, she stepped back to my side once more, her tone frustrated. “You seem to be interested in the drawings on the wall,” she commented.</p><p>“I sure am,” I answered as I glanced at her, my great experience the only thing that kept me from gasping in surprise. She had used the small break to make some impressive adjustments to her outfit, particularly around the front area by pulling the zipper down significantly. </p><p>The view was shocking because I seemed to underestimate the tightness of her outfit. As she opened it, her breasts pushed forward recklessly, creating a deep valley cutting through the leather outfit. She looked incredibly sexy in her leather outfit already, and the deep cleavage just pushed it further. </p><p>“You don’t mind it, do you?” she asked as she pushed her chest slightly out and pointed at the same time, like there could be any mistake where she was pointing under the circumstances. </p><p>“Oh, go ahead,” I said, dipping my gaze down for a moment before pulling away, her smile dying prematurely. It was hard to balance between teasing and looking completely uninterested. Even with that cleavage, it was better not to give her the completely wrong idea. “We’re going to be here for a long time, and I don’t want you to feel stuffed.” </p><p>“You’re so kind,” she said. “So, do you want me to go through the drawings and summarize,” she said. </p><p>“Please, go ahead,” I said, and she took a step forward, her finger almost touching the drawings — but not directly, clearly trying not to leave a mark over them as a careful explorer. </p><p>“It tells a story of some kind of mystical war,” she said. “It’s clearly a story, as it’s talking about multiple worlds being destroyed, along with many different imaginary races like the phoenixes, elves, and other entities,” she said. “But there’s too much evidence to support the narrative to completely invalidate it.” </p><p>“Evidence like what.” </p><p>“The existence of this place, for example. It’s clearly designed as some kind of emergency shelter, away from any other ruins, and self-sufficient with correct magical applications. I’m guessing such a war really happened, but the teller is using the stories to hide the real parties.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said, which had two targets. The first interesting was the small breakdown of the evidence, which was clearly more accurate than she had assumed. Elves and phoenixes were real, and so was the existence of other worlds. </p><p>Making this ruin some kind of hiding spot of an old magical empire that was strong enough to rule both. </p><p>Having a guide was really convenient. </p><p>The second target of interest was her, or more accurately, the way she bent forward to display her ass in the best light, her leather pants stretching further, to a tempting degree. </p><p>I smirked, fascinated by her ability to combine a very serious lecture about the possible history of ruins with an erotic show. Certainly fascinating enough. </p><p>“Fascinating —“ I started, before I was interrupted by a sudden gasp. </p><p>“Are you alright,” she said, taking a step forward to stand next to me. “Do you need a change of bandages?” </p><p>“No, not that,” I said as I stretched my arms. “It’s my back. I think that I had hurt it while fighting and now it’s feeling stiff.”</p><p>“Oh, really,” she said as she took a step forward immediately, too enthusiastic to miss such an opportunity. “I’m not a bad masseuse.” </p><p>And, just like that, before I could even answer, she grabbed my arm and dragged toward a large smooth rock that could be used as a chair, and pushed me down. “Just enjoy,” she said as she moved to my back, and immediately grabbed my shoulder. </p><p>“I — are you sure that’s appropriate?” I asked, acting shy even as I let my eyes widen with disbelief, playing shy. </p><p>“Of course, I’m just keeping you in fighting condition,” she said as she held my shoulders, already too deep to turn back, but clearly, that just added to her excitement for her. </p><p>Soon, her hands were roaming everywhere on my back, which showed one thing. Her claim about being a good masseuse was complete fiction. It was a high-skill job, requiring to know exactly how much pressure to apply, which sequence to target, and how to address some health concerns. </p><p>She had none of those. </p><p>Admittedly, she seemed to be aware of that, as rather than trying to copy a professional, she just continued to caress my naked muscles for five minutes, happy teasing me. </p><p>Not one to let such an attempt go without retaliation, I hit her with another subtle yet effective tantric effect, one that spiked her arousal she was feeling a bit more … creating the effect of a nice glass of wine. </p><p>Already deep in her aroused state, that magical assistance was clearly what she needed. “It’s serious,” she suddenly commented in a serious tone. “We need to apply some heat, do you have any?” </p><p>“No, but we can start a fire—“ I commented halfway before she interrupted. </p><p>“No, too late, we need to address it immediately,” she said, followed by shuffling of leather. I couldn’t see her from that angle, but I was quick to recognize what were the two warm globes pressing against my neck. </p><p>“Is this —“ I started, but that was all I was able to say before she put her finger on my lips. </p><p>“Shh, it’s treatment,” she said, taking control even more as I acted submissive, which was an amusing reversal. I could feel her arousal from the hardness of her nipples. </p><p>“Are you sure it’s necessary? I can handle a little pain.” </p><p>“Yes, it is,” she said as she started moving up and down, the sensation spectacular. “We need to make sure you’re in top shape, “she added in a throaty tone. “I’m relying on you for my security, we need to make sure that you’re in top shape.” </p><p>Then, her hand moved down, grabbing my ass in a way that left no doubt about exactly what she was talking about. </p><p>I let out a squeal, which was absurd coming from me, but playing the role was too amusing to stop immediately. I acted shy and shocked, letting her molest me, curious just how far she would go.</p><p>For a minute, she continued the same treatment, making me think that she had reached her limit, but then, her hand moved forward, cupping my front as well. “Oh, we have a problem here as well,” she declared confidently. “Let’s fix it before it’s too late.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Your assistant is here, coach,” she whispered throatily as she gave a pose, letting me examine her body. I had first-hand knowledge about the impressive nature of her body, but that didn’t prevent me from lowering my gaze to enjoy the show. </p><p>Especially since she went all that effort to stuff her amazing breasts into a top two sizes too small, enhancing her already impressive cleavage to a fascinating degree, her lack of a bra pushing it even further. The top button was open, but even that hardly reduced the stuffed feeling. </p><p>I could imagine the disaster — a very fortunate one — if she tried to do even the simplest cheerleading move if she tried. </p><p>To contrast, her skirt was normal. Slightly higher than acceptable, but still normal. Still, the mischievous smile that appeared on her face when my gaze touched her skirt suggested that she might have a surprise there as well. </p><p>Her looks were impressive, but even more impressive was the glance she had thrown toward the phone one of the players was holding, confirming that he was still recording. </p><p>That surprised me. I hadn’t paid much attention to the details of the way the popular girls acted, too busy dealing with my own particular problems of trying to chart life,  but the more I watched them, the more I saw their Machiavellian nature. Megan was extreme, of course, using her fame as a part of her ten-year plan, but the others seemed to be just as interesting as the battle for short-term objectives. </p><p>Which was, admittedly, far more interesting than just a silly star-struck approach. </p><p>It prevented me from feeling guilty while pulling my own plans. I was glad that Miriam was aware of the camera, as it allowed me to cut loose even more recklessly. </p><p>“Now, who has the tape of your training, I need to see exactly what you have,” I said. One of them stood up and started playing with the TV, which was, while not as fancy as the ones the football team had, was still expensive, not like the budget of the less popular branches. </p><p>“Meanwhile, I want the rest to draw the twenty play that you’re most confident in, so I can go through them, so we have something other than iso plays to rely on if they don’t play like we expect,” I said. “Not that I expect them to, they are prideful fools,” I declared, acting like I didn’t know I was being live-streamed still. </p><p>I even kept my phone silent for that purpose. </p><p>“Do we really need to—“ one of them started, already feeling rebellious, but when my gaze fell on him, backed by the weight of my intent, he was quick to fall silent. </p><p>“Make that thirty plays,” I declared, and the rest of the team looked at him in frustration. Though, he was smart enough to keep his mouth shut, which was a nice surprise. </p><p>While they were busy drawing plays, I sat behind the desk. “Why are you staying away, my dear assistant,” I said, patting my lap to invite her to my lap. She smirked as she followed that request, but with a pace slow enough to distract the others from drawing their plans. </p><p>She sat on my lap without a preamble and reached for the remote. “Good girl,” I whispered as I wrapped a hand around her naked waist, the other taking notes, acting unaware of the camera that was recording every second of my movements. </p><p>Of course, my moves risked triggering the same kind of scandal, but there was one huge difference. Despite all the tasks I had, I was still a student with no official rank, which made any potential scandal reach critical mass — like the disaster I had triggered for my dear old coach and his friends.</p><p>And, before that, any controversy would feed the System more, jealousy and impotent anger working excellently. </p><p>“Now, start playing,” I ordered Miriam, and she did two things. First, she pressed play, and on the screen, a practice game appeared, showing most of my new players playing. With my enhanced perception, a quick dissection was all I needed. </p><p>“Yes, coach,” she whispered,  her tone just raspy enough sound accidental, but her hips were already moving. I slid my hands down, right under her skirt…</p><p>And finally, discover what she had been hiding. </p><p>She didn’t have her underwear. “Naughty girl,” I said as I let my hand move slightly lower, more than happy to teach her a lesson about playing. My hand danced at her naked her inner thigh. </p><p>At first, she just enjoyed the sensation, a smug smile on her face as she looked at me, encouraged by my hesitant touch, like she pulled an amazing trick that put her ahead in our little game, especially since I had to multitask by watching the tape and going through the tactics the players produced. </p><p>It was a very dangerous mistake, of course, but she didn’t realize it immediately. </p><p>The reason, I was trying to find a way to use my Domain ability in a more direct manner. While she didn’t give me any of the feedback that I could feel from the other sources, I had a feeling that I had just scratched the surface of the potential the Domains represented. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the only domain I was getting feedback from. Both Athletics and Command was giving me some feedback. Then, the first player finished drawing thirty plays as requested, and brought it to me. </p><p>The speed he brought implied that he was either a tactical genius, or a careless worker. </p><p>The one at the top looked nice, but when I pulled another play from the middle, the same care was not there. Worse, the play itself was complicated enough that it was hard to assess without spending some time checking the accuracy. </p><p>Luckily, even with the distraction on my lap, I still had the necessary processing power to handle it. “That’s a mess,” I said as I used a red pen to draw eight lines of correction, turning the complicated paper into an even bigger mess. “Be more careful,” I said as I pushed the paper I fixed to him, and threw the rest into the garbage. </p><p>“But—“ he started, which was all he was able to say under my sharp gaze, backed by a touch of Intent to turn that into a supernatural assault. </p><p>“Did you think all the gossip about my tactical brilliance was nonsense, I’m a chess champion!” I declared haughtily. </p><p>Of course, there was absolutely no link between being good at chess and understanding basketball plays, but I wasn’t exactly torn up about that inaccuracy. After watching hundreds of movies where the intelligent characters always played chess, whether they were inventors or commanders, people were far more willing to link that subconsciously. </p><p>And, the sudden echo I felt at my Command domain confirmed that it was an accurate assumption. It was already somewhat active thanks to the challenge, but the feedback I was feeling from it increased tenfold. </p><p>People were so easy to trick and manipulate it was shocking. </p><p>“Sorry, coach,” he muttered. </p><p>“Good,” I said as let my fingers dance under Miriam’s skirt, still in a relatively safe location. “I know that we don’t have much time before the match, but that’s only more reason not to cut any corners.” As I delivered that declaration, I once again backed it up with Intent-backed leadership. </p><p>As I did that, every single player started drawing those plans once more, much more serious this time as I cheated a bit. Though, that had a little side effect that I didn’t expect. Affected by the leadership, the player that was live streaming the meeting ended the show and put his phone back in his pocket. </p><p>Well, you win some you lose some, I thought as I focused on the show, letting my fingers climb up once more. While ending the live stream meant an immediate drop in the amount of Intent I was collecting — luckily not dropping it to zero — it also meant that I could do my experimentation with Miriam in peace. </p><p>And, to make it even more fun, she was too distracted to notice she wasn’t being recorded anymore. </p><p>I continued caressing her as I reached the System, trying to not just dip into the Intent, but trying to focus on the Domain aspects … treating Miriam’s delicate thighs to an extended massage in the process, each second bringing her pleasure to a higher level, making her bit her lips to keep her moan hidden.</p><p>Soon, I finally got my first hint of success, channeling the gathered Intent through the Lust domain, and Intent changed far more than I could through channeling it through my previous Traits. As the transformed intent infused into her thighs, her eyes widened in shock as she looked at me, the sensation of pleasure hitting her hard. </p><p>“Let’s have some fun,” I said with a chuckle as I caught her gaze. I had my first hint of success … now it was time to push her limits.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, coach, anything else you want to do before I start ‘helping’ you with the training,” I said as I walked toward the man who was doing her best to replicate the color of an eggplant with perfect fidelity after watching his players get demolished.  </p><p>Of course, even worse, he had allowed the training to be live-streamed, hoping that my defeat — forgone in his mind — would give him a chance to send me packing so he could focus on his efforts to undermine the new director of sports. </p><p>It didn’t work as he wished. </p><p>“Wait a minute,” he said. “Just because you’re a better player than the bunch of useless kids doesn’t make you a good coach,” he said. “It doesn’t matter just how good you play. I need to see you coach before letting you anywhere near my team.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said with a chuckle as I looked at his players, who certainly didn’t appreciate the sudden insult. “You’re free to call the director and tell them about that,” I said with a chuckle as I walked forward. “Here, I’ll even call her for you,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“No need to call,” he said hurriedly, clearly not willing to talk with her just after a public defeat. “We just need to have a competition where you show your playing abilities. Just pick whoever you want,” he said as he gestured to his team. “I’ll pick the rest of the players, and we’ll have a match.” He smirked. “You can even have the starters.” </p><p>“No need,” I responded quickly. “I don’t want to deprive you of your amazing starters,” I said as I looked at the rest of the players, examining their expressions of anger at my presence, one that was shared by the starters, and most of the backups. </p><p>Yet, some of the backups, along with the practice squad players, had a more hopeful expression. After all, I had reforged our football team from the backups and junior players, increasing their reputation significantly.</p><p>The basketball team didn’t have a practice squad in the same sense as the football team, but the great number of freshman candidates gave me enough of a pool to make a selection.  </p><p>Their hopeful gaze suggested that they were more than happy with that prospect. </p><p>“You lot,” I gestured to eight of them, making sure to focus more on enthusiasm than pure ability — which was easier considering there didn’t have a huge gap between them — while I quickly called Marcus. </p><p>“You don’t stop, do you?” he said immediately, showing that he was watching the show. Not too surprising. </p><p>“A good way to spend our off day. Do you want to play some  basketball as well?” I asked, chuckling. “I need someone to herd my new players.” </p><p>“Sure, I’m not half bad playing basketball,” Marcus answered. “And, since you’re the one calling, you are clearly confident about what are you doing.” </p><p>“Excellent, pick up Arthur as well and come join me. Hurry up, we’ll start soon.” I wanted Marcuus to join because the additional prestige would be helpful to maintain his enthusiasm. However, the reason I called Arthur was a little trickier. </p><p>I wanted him to be a part of it, so that he could confirm that I wasn’t using any kind of advanced magic to help the group. His spying was a convenient feature. </p><p>After I ended the call, I looked at the coach. “You don’t mind if I bring a couple football players, right?” I asked. “I don’t want to deal with you crying foul and blaming me when your rich kids start to cry.” </p><p>“Bring it on, you little bastard,” he growled. </p><p>“Careful coach. Maybe you should visit a doctor. That color can’t be healthy.”  </p><p>The coach grumbled, but he didn’t bother replying, realizing that a battle of words would only drag him down. After all, not only I was still a student, but also my constant arguments were my biggest claim to fame. </p><p>Even if he could get the edge word-wise, it would be his prestige that would get damaged — well, damaged further, as the earlier show hardly did him any favors. </p><p>“What’s the plan, do you want to play this Friday?” Coach offered. “For a genius like you, four days should be enough,” he offered, giving me just enough time to look generous but short enough that it wouldn’t be truly useful. </p><p>“No need,” I waved my hand dismissively. Let’s have an hour each to draw some tactics and prepare. That’s all I need. So, unless you need some extra time to put this sorry bunch into shape…” </p><p>I let it linger, and he just turned his back angry. Still, he just gestured for his team to gather around. He clearly assumed that my repeated taunts were like the trick I pulled against Spencer, trying to make him punch me.</p><p>He was still confident in defeating me even after I ignored his earlier obvious trap of trying to get players that were clearly hostile to me. He still had his starters that he had been working with for two years, and for all intents and purposes, that should create an unbreakable advantage. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, I didn’t play fair. </p><p>“Now, before we start, I need an assistant to help me, someone that knows about both basketball and football,” I said, speaking loudly. For a moment, that surprised everyone, which changed once I pointed at Miriam.  </p><p>“You bastard—“ the poor boy who had just lost his girlfriend shouted, only for the others to hold him. The coach rapidly whispered several things, no doubt explaining to them that I was trying to trigger a fight that would give me an excuse to pull back from the bet. </p><p>On the contrary, I just wanted to see just how far I could push my domain of lust…</p><p>I waved at him mockingly before I turned toward the stands, where Miriam was walking toward me with a sway on her hips. “I heard you need an assistant.” </p><p>“I do, sweetie,” I said as I grabbed her waist, pulling her closer to me, feeling the flow of Intent getting even more intense as the several cameras, Kim’s included., continued to live to stream the show. </p><p>Including a much stronger echo of Lust feeding into the Domain, coming from a distance. I smirked as I leaned forward. “Why don’t you go and lead me to a meeting room here, and after that, go and put something more interesting,” I whispered to her. Then, I turned to the team. “Follow me, boys,” I said. “We are going to have a talk about tactics, and we don’t need any eavesdroppers.” </p><p>It was another evidence of my growing legend that they didn’t even bother arguing — or commented on the fact that I walked with my hand on Miriam’s ass. </p><p>“That room should be enough,” Miriam said, pointing at a decent-sized room with a locked door. She walked away while I reached for my phone. “Do you guys have the number of the facility manager,” I said. One of them passed it, and I called them. </p><p>“We will be there in five minutes,” the voice said, but I caught the mocking edge in his tone, clearly doing his best to make things harder for us. </p><p>“You have fifteen seconds, or I open it myself.” </p><p>“Go ahead, those locks are electronically locked and steel reinforced—“ he started, only for a crush to reach to their ear.  </p><p>I could have convinced them, of course, but noticing one of my new players was secretly recording the show, I decided to show off a bit more, and kicked the door open, its lock broken. “No worries, it’s already open,” I said as I chuckled, closing the door behind me. </p><p>“Follow me, boys,” I said, leading them into the room. “Now, we don’t have much time, so we’re going to focus on some simple concepts, fast breaks, and simple isolation plays,” I started. </p><p>“Are you sure, coach, we don’t have real runners to pull consistent fast breaks,” one of them asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, that’s why I called Arthur to play. He has the necessary speed for some surprise plays. When they arrive, we’ll talk more about our fast-break strategies. First, let’s focus on our isolation plays for the offense.” </p><p>Isolation plays, or iso plays, were simple in concept. The attacking team spread around the court, leaving the ball in the hands of their best player, which aimed to create a matchup advantage. </p><p>“Are you sure, coach?” one of them said. “It’s a good idea but, we don’t really have a skill advantage to justify that, especially if they try to add some double-teams. </p><p>“Don’t worry, we’re going to mix in some pick and rolls and other tricks into the mix, and Marcus is skilled enough passer to defend against if that happens. Just pass the ball to him if you think that’s sustainable. But, I have a reason for doing so, can you guess why?” </p><p>They thought for a moment before one of them clicked his fingers. “Because their pride won’t allow them to double-team us aggressively from the start,” he said. </p><p>“Exactly,” I answered. “Using isolation plays is essentially a call for a duel, and it’s the fastest thing we can learn in less than an hour. You just need to prove that the only reason you’re the backup is because your family didn’t bribe that asshole.” </p><p>I declared that aggressively, aware that the show was still being watched by the others. </p><p>“Now, let’s start—“ I said, but before I could, Miriam knocked on the door and walked inside, wearing a cheerleader outfit…</p><p>And, just to add insult to injury, it was the outfit of our basketball team.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I felt myself split between excitement and fear as I found myself about to face my first proper Divine opponent, even though I was feeling that the powers it displayed, even in the half-gathered state, were strong enough to impress me.  </p><p>Unfortunately, fighting against an Avatar directly was not a good idea. Not because I was particularly afraid of myself, confident in my ability to defend myself if I revealed some of my secrets … but I was reluctant to trigger such a battle this close to the capital. </p><p>I could retreat back to the capital, the wards giving me the chance to retaliate against them … but after a moment, I decided against it. </p><p>I could feel the connection the Avatar slowly building with the rest of the Necrotic Sparks … which gave me an. Interesting opportunity. I could easily locate the locations of the other Necrotic Sparks. Even better, from the shape of the connection, I could sense whether those sparks were currently passive or active… </p><p>“I see I have a cowardly god that wants to delay me while you hunt for my innocent elves. You are too young to trick me,” I said as I suddenly teleported toward one of the larger gatherings of the undead that was currently in a state of active battle. I found an elven tribe, surrounded by the Guardian Trees that had currently turned into treants, desperately fighting against the undead that surrounded them.  </p><p>It was a large tribe, about ten thousand strong, struggling against the undead attack. “Go and worship me, my children,” I shouted even as I waved my hand, and a huge tree appeared, growing to reach a hundred feet of height in just two seconds, and another second later its center shattered, revealing a gate at its center.  </p><p>A portal for the elves to travel  — a new ability I developed after examining the device of the Eternals — leading it to the capital. </p><p>The portal itself was made of pure Arcana mana, but I made sure to create the connecting tunnel through nature mana. It was far less effective in terms of mana efficiency, but mana was much less precious than my secrets. </p><p>The tree itself was unnecessary as well, just another layer for my deception. </p><p>While the elves retreated, I consumed the Nature Spark of the Guardian trees, and the attacking undead.  </p><p>{+3882 Purified Spark} </p><p>The amount I got wasn’t enough to enhance my stats once more, but before I could lament about that, the Aether plane was breached once more, and six liches appeared in front of me.</p><p>With one great difference. This time, six of them stood side by side, covered by the shadow of a dragon made of necrotic spark. A shadow that gave me an intimidating feeling … containing far more than I managed to steal despite my extended battle. </p><p>And, considering the relative benefits they drove from the Divine Spark were far superior to mine, it didn’t feel like a battle I could win…. “Let’s see if the ancient gods truly deserve their reputation,” the shadow spoke, the voice alone radiating power… </p><p>“I don’t have time to waste with you, dog,” I called as I teleported, just as the huge necrotic bolt passed where I had been. </p><p>I expected him to follow me to the Aether dimension immediately, which was the reason I appeared in a relative opening, but he appeared several seconds later. “How dare you insult me despite being a coward,” the Avatar shouted, the desolate landscape shattering under his cry… </p><p>“Do you think you deserve to fight with me? A coward that doesn’t even dare to show himself and sends an Avatar to fight me,” I said. “Here, a worthwhile opponent for you.” </p><p>With that, I raised my hand, and a huge treant appeared in front of him, attacking him recklessly. I connected him with the remaining stored nature mana, which made him grow to a threatening degree as it rushed toward the Avatar. </p><p>I doubted that it would hold it for more than a minute, but then, that was all I needed. I created an illusion of myself before slipping away, and started hunting the undead forces that were currently fighting against the retreating elves —  though luckily, most of them were already close enough to the capital to make my involvement unnecessary. </p><p>With my attempts to facilitate their escape getting faster and faster due to repeated practice, the Avatar failed to catch up with me. And, luckily, he was arrogant enough to chase me rather than attack the capital to force a confrontation. </p><p>With Seldanna still going through Apothesis, the last thing I wanted to disturb that, especially with the great gap between the direct might we were capable of applying. Technically, I had a dozen ways to equalize the situation in a direct confrontation, especially from a bunch of safe wards, but that would only reveal my secrets. </p><p>And, while the Eternals finally stopped pumping necrotic mana into the Aether Dimension, that didn’t mean that they were still not spying. </p><p>I continued bouncing around, transferring more and more of the tribal elves back to the capital … which had an interesting, but welcome, side effect. After being saved by their ‘god’ they were more than willing to worship the Tree of Life, which currently belonged to Seldanna. </p><p>Through the portals, I took the occasional glimpses, and noticed a similar connection between her and the nature spark that was held between elves was occurring, showing the process was getting even faster.</p><p>All the while, I continued to get stronger by hunting undead while saving more and more elves. </p><p>{+18291 Purified Spark}</p><p> {-20300 Purified Spark}</p><p>{+3 All Stats}</p><p>Soon, I realized that I wasn’t the only one that was trying to use tricks. Occasionally, the Avatar of the Undead God showed speed fast enough to trap me … but he did not, probably still assuming that I was trapping the Necrotic Sparks for his convenience and exhausting myself at the same time. </p><p>Pity that was a lie. </p><p>As I continued my escape, I felt Seldanna’s reach touch at my God Forest. That didn’t surprise me. I could have fought for control, but I needed her awake as soon as possible, and not to mention, she would be able to use its power without constant soul damage. </p><p>Divine Abilities were not jokes. </p><p>I let the chase continue, even after I managed to save all tribes I could find, dealing with smaller and smaller undead clumps, unprepared for my attack. </p><p>Ironically, the presence of their god sealed their defeat. Without his presence, I could never have discovered them with such ease, each discovery empowering me further, until I felt that I could finally rival my old self. </p><p>{+17291 Purified Spark}</p><p> {-16250 Purified Spark}</p><p>{+2 All Stats}</p><p>I still didn’t have access to the convenience of Skills, of course, but the near-infinite mana was more than enough as a substitute. </p><p>And, finally, I received the message I had been waiting for. “I’m awake!” </p><p>Seldanna was back. </p><p>“Excellent. We have your test here already,” I called. Even after her Apothesis, I could feel a faint connection with her. I felt that she could snap it if she wanted, but she maintained it, and from that, I could feel her state. </p><p>She was strong enough to contend against an avatar… </p><p>“You want me to fight against a god!” she gasped. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, You’re a goddess, you can handle it,” I called. “And, feel free to cut loose, I’ll make sure both the dimensional wall and the capital is safe.” </p><p>With that, she rushed forward, soon appearing next to us. “Wait, why there is a goddess here!” the Avatar gasped, his shock almost enough to make me pity him. </p><p>I disappeared, and focused on repairing the dimensional barrier. The memories of elementals invading a plane were still fresh in my mind, and while they didn’t seem to be caring that much about the planetary fragments, that didn’t mean they wouldn’t invade the place … and I much prefer not to deal with them without the assistance of the System. </p><p>Instead, I watched as the Necrotic God fought against Seldanna in a hopeless battle … but just because it was hopeless didn’t mean it was quick. The battle lasted for days, the Avatar’s ability to create endless hordes matching Seldanna’s life-creation abilities. </p><p>I ignored many opportunities to strike, for one simple reason. Seldanna had the adjusted memories of Divine Abilities, but using them required practice. </p><p>In contrast, the Necrotic God was much stronger, but the difference between having an avatar present versus being present directly was much stronger. He tried to retreat several times, but each time, I blocked him, not willing to let go of that much Divine Spark… </p><p>Worse, the more he drained the necrotic mana from the Aether, his biggest advantage started to disappear. As the Divine battle consumed more and more mana, the Aether Dimension turned even more sparse, like a deflating balloon. </p><p>I had a feeling that, without my intervention, the plane would have collapsed, but I worked hard to support the planar barrier with a constant feed of Nature Mana I had hidden away…</p><p>“You win this time…” the necrotic god suddenly shouted. “But don’t think that it’ll be free.” </p><p>With that, I felt his body, made of Divine Spark, ready to explode. I waited until his hint of consciousness finally disappear, then before the spark could disperse, captured it with a cage of Tantric mana, first stuffing it into a crystal, then absorbing it.  </p><p>A fascinating amount … far more than anything else I had got. </p><p>{+230490 Purified Spark} </p><p>I had just received a fortune… </p><p>Now, it was time to celebrate, I thought as I looked at Seldanna’s Divine visage… </p><p>My first time with a goddess. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 30    Charisma: 30</p><p>Precision: 30    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 30     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 30       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 30}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 237555}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 1103  Mana: 2410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Elven Goddess - ???}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched the lich come to a sudden stop after realizing I was not following anymore, I realized another drawback of fighting against them, one that was worse than their endless numbers. </p><p>They didn’t have proper facial expressions, which sapped the enjoyment I would have felt from shocking him with my current stop. He observed me for a moment as I stood in the middle of a forest, my wood dragon long mixed back into the forest. </p><p>“I would have never thought that a god would have been a coward,” he shouted, his voice enhanced magically. A childish taunt, which was made worse by the fact that everything I had seen in the memories suggested that the deceased god would have fallen for that. </p><p>I didn’t even bother to answer as I raised my hand, and the forest that grew around me started spitting out acorns. Only a fraction of it targeted the lich, forcing him to escape, while most of it spread between me and the capital, a forest growing around the undead force. </p><p>The guardian trees were quick to attack them, demolishing them easily once the thick necrotic energy was destroyed by the growth of the forest, the trees sapping the mana and replacing it with nature mana. The lack of strong liches and death knights — that already retreated the moment I pushed forward, smart enough to realize the initial assault failed and not willing to risk themselves — made the destruction even easier.</p><p>Unfortunately, it also meant that the fruits of the rapid success were meager. I had managed to break thousands of crystals that were in the possession of the weaker zombies. Unfortunately, there was a reason those were left under the control of the zombies, the amount of Spark they contained was truly meager, most not even reaching the mark of one point.  </p><p>{+219 Purified Spark} </p><p>{+2153 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>Still, strengthening the god forest had been a nice benefit. Before I could enjoy it, however, I saw the lich I had been chasing turn back, and soon, five other liches appeared around him, teleporting. </p><p>I examined the necrotic spark I kept imprisoned, trying to if there was any increase in its weird movement. There was not, at least not yet, meaning the liches that joined didn’t bring whatever trap they had planned with them. </p><p>I could play with them while they struggled. </p><p>“Let’s hunt ourselves a god,” one of the liches shouted as he cast a spell, and necrotic bolts started to rain. I didn’t even bother looking at him, continuing to expand the secondary layer of the forest until it turned into a shield around the capital, battling with the necrotic mana. The branches of the trees cut them off. </p><p>The constant supply of mana provided by the God Forest kept the trees healthy, but I still made a point of staggering slightly as the attack got more intense,, selling the idea that their attack was successful. </p><p>The more they committed to their ineffective strategies and gave me the time to recover, the better. I was much better compared to that mad attempt to summon all the elves, but still not at my full performance. </p><p>Under the assumption that their necrotic attacks were effective, the demigod-level liches triggered a rain of necrotic energy together, determined to weaken the forest around me, while, at the same time, a horde of weaker undead wars attacking me. </p><p>As more and more lich. joined the attack, it soon turned into something that would rival the earlier siege against the capital, enough to challenge me.  </p><p>A dangerous strategy, one that would have a chance to succeed if they rushed together, forcing me to retreat at a minimum … maybe even managing to cut my path completely. </p><p>But, since they were undead, they were selfish enough to play safe, sending weaker hordes of undead, supported only by their weaker necromancers. </p><p>“Daring to challenge me just because I had just awakened from my slumber, you pathetic pieces of bone skin!” I shouted, letting my voice be enhanced with mana to turn into an attack that would destroy the weaker zombies, but this time, the necromancers among them were ready for it, countering the attack.</p><p>I let out an angry cry, triggering an attack that used almost a quarter of the mana I had converted earlier, the rain of explosive leaves and acorns destroying a significant part of the undead army. Another spell from the memories of the dead god.  </p><p>I knelt the moment I cast that spell, and this time, it wasn’t entirely for show. The difficulty of the spell was comparable to the earlier summoning call, but with my most recent improvements, the impact on my body and soul was significantly lesser. </p><p>And, the rewards were equally impressive. </p><p>{+7219 Purified Spark} </p><p>Time to boost my stats once more. </p><p>{-8414 Purified Spark} </p><p>{+3 Strength}</p><p>{+3 Precision}</p><p>{+3 Agility}</p><p>{+3 Speed}</p><p>{+3 Perception}</p><p>{+3 Intelligence}</p><p>{+3 Wisdom}</p><p>The reason I received such a high boost was the last-minute decision to purify both the necrotic and natural sparks at the same time. The god forest was already capable of creating more mana than I could wield safely, and there was no harm in prioritizing my Stats. </p><p>“Attack him while he’s weak,” the shout came, and the undead horde continued attacking, easily shrugging the loss that would have broken the resolve of a sentient army. </p><p>Though, I had noticed the necromancers and death knights made a point of staying farther back. Smart, and it would have been enough to save them … if it wasn’t for one detail. </p><p>I had been paying attention to the Necrotic Spark I had kept in the crystal, and it finally stirred violently. </p><p>The trap was finally arriving. </p><p>“You cowards,” I created as I used the same attack again, but this time, aiming at them, the divine spark they represented was far too valuable to be ignored. Still, I didn’t want to alert them to my most important ability, so I revealed a huge crystal floating above me, one that immediately started to glow black in various spots, as if it had many slots, each filled with a Divine Spark I had just stolen after my attack. </p><p>Naturally, I consumed all but a slice that remained to maintain the excuse. </p><p>{+13280 Purified Spark} </p><p>Another boost, this time all nine lagging stats, bringing them back to the level of Endurance. </p><p>{-9117 Purified Spark}</p><p>{+2 Strength}</p><p>{+2 Precision}</p><p>{+2 Agility}</p><p>{+2 Speed}</p><p>{+2 Perception}</p><p>{+2 Intelligence}</p><p>{+2 Wisdom}</p><p>{+2 Manipulation}</p><p>{+2 Charisma}</p><p>Another boost, one that brought me even closer to my peak. I stayed on the ground, moaning in genuine pain even as the forest handled the rush of the undead. I watched them approach, though slowly, I started to notice a change. </p><p>The undead started to show a renewed sense of strength, one that was much stronger than the others. At first, I thought it was just another effect of increasing density, but soon, I realized that was mistaken. It was their divine spark that was getting more active … almost consciously. </p><p>It was a subtle change, one that I wouldn’t have noticed if it wasn’t for my familiarity with the Divine Spark and all that was related to it. But how, I was not sure. I could only feel that it was coming from the six leader liches that floated above the rest, content in sacrificing the rest of their army. </p><p>There were two ways of examining that. Either I could try to get close, and confront the liches without the protective presence of the forest … or I enhance my stats even further. </p><p>I chose the second option, especially as they kindly continued to attack me, even more uncaring of the losses; at least a part of their newfound recklessness about the crystal that was floating above me, representing a great fortune that could be exchanged later on. </p><p>Unaware it was just empty bait. </p><p>After waiting a few seconds to recover as much as I could manage, I cast a spell, a basic light spell that made me glow green, faking the side effect of another spell I had picked from the memories, continuing to feign weakness. “What a big disgrace, thinking that an army of dead ants could face my greatness!” I shouted as I used the spell again, this time taking down a smaller portion of the army. </p><p>{+4214 Purified Spark} </p><p>{-5760 Purified Spark}</p><p>{+1 All Stats}</p><p>I was supposed to feel safer and safer as my powers got enhanced, but that didn’t seem to be the case, not when I was able to feel the way the Divine Spark showed more and more movement with each round of absorption. </p><p>It felt similar to the earlier trick I had pulled, ordering all elves to retreat back to the capital, but rather than a one-time effect, it was a continuous one. </p><p>Luckily, after my latest round of improvement, I was able to detect what had been affecting it. It was the leading liches…</p><p>No, it was a shadow of Divine Spark that overlapped with them, slowly getting stronger while still staying hidden. </p><p>I had a feeling that I was about to face my first true Avatar. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 25    Charisma: 25</p><p>Precision: 25    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 25</p><p>Speed: 25       Intelligence: 25</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 25}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 4151}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2783  Mana: 9210}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 28611}</p><p>Elven Priestess - XXXX}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment her gaze fell down the pool, Fatima froze, her mind short-circuiting. </p><p>She had been just having a midnight walk, having trouble sleeping after the view she had come across earlier the day … where she had peeked at her house guest and her friend having another friend over … and did so very explosively. </p><p>She was having trouble handling that, as it was the first time she was truly living alone. She had studied in the States, but when her grandfather was still alive, he had made sure that she was never truly out without at least one chaperone, determined not to let America corrupt his only granddaughter. </p><p>This meant, she had a very conservative college experience, and after that, she was immediately back to her country, a land where it was hard for a woman to truly live. Luckily, it was not the most conservative country there, so when her grandfather finally passed away, she was able to take control of her inheritance easily … and promptly moved back to America. </p><p>It had been six months ago, but contrary to her plans, she didn’t do much. She had spent a fortune buying a mansion, and a smaller fortune to create an amazing wardrobe, but then, that was it. No partying, no wild activities… she found that, even without the pressure from her family, she was too shy to really step into the nightlife to enjoy it. </p><p>It was why she jumped at the opportunity to host a student from her school, playing the role of a good contributor. She hoped that the presence of a wild student would help her break her concerns … but Mary turned out to be surprisingly shy and put together. </p><p>At least, that had been what Fatima had assumed until today, when she had seen her being drilled aggressively in the middle of the courtyard, alternating with her friend. </p><p>Fatima was not a virgin … but with her little experience, she might as well be one, so she was truly rattled by watching that. She was shocked, scandalized, but also aroused; a confusing state of being that was enough to destroy any hope of sleep…</p><p>It was why she had thought that it was an illusion when she walked out, only to see the same boy in the pool… an assumption that died just as quickly. </p><p>“H-hey, Fatima, have you met my swimming instructor, Darion. I’m trying for the school team,” Mary explained rapidly. </p><p>Fatima didn’t believe that even for a second. She was shy, not stupid, and even without what she had seen earlier in the day, there was no chance she would believe it. She prepared to say that, but before she could do that, Darion spoke once more. </p><p>“You look good, by the way. Pink is definitely your color.” </p><p>Just like that, Fatima remembered that, by assuming she would be alone, she hadn’t put any effort to change her sleeping outfit … a sexy nightie she had purchased, hoping for wild nights. Shocked, she covered her body. </p><p>She was not ready to be seen like this, not yet. </p><p>“No need to cover yourself, miss, you look amazing,” Darion said. </p><p>“Please, stop—“ Mary started, but that was all she was able to say before she fell silent. </p><p>“Don’t interrupt me,” Darion said in a sharp, domineering tone, and Fatima felt her body tremble even without being targeted. But still, Mary had stopped talking before he had spoken, leaving Fatima wondering why she suddenly stopped. </p><p>An answer that she received an answer far quicker than she had expected. Mary suddenly rose in the water, a move that surprised Fatima for a fleeting moment, a surprise that only lasted until she had seen Mary’s breasts. </p><p>Her naked breasts. </p><p>After what she had seen earlier, she didn’t doubt for a second what was going underwater. “I better leave you two alone!” she gasped before she turned and dashed away… </p><p>Though, even as she did so, a part of her was cursing her cowardice. Maybe she should have stayed… </p><p>***</p><p>“Y-you are evil!” Mary gasped, trying to admonish Darion, but she was quick to find out that it was difficult Even the risk of being kicked out of her residence wasn’t enough to stem the tide of pleasure that filled her the moment he pushed forward…</p><p>The memories of her explosive climax were too soon for her to reject that call. Maybe she shouldn’t have rushed into this, but Darion … he was impossible to deny, especially after he filled her needy pussy once more. </p><p>Mary needed it. She needed it bad.</p><p>Under his invasion, she barely paid attention to Fatima’s retreat. At this point, she had no chance of making Darion’s excuse about being a swimming coach believable … not that Darion had any intention either. If he did, he wouldn’t have started before sending her away. </p><p>Mary felt like complaining, but as he brought her toward the edge of the pool, he got more domineering, leaving her helpless to do anything but obey. She barely managed to hold to the ladder as he started working behind her, his weight enough to pull both of them down without some assistance. </p><p>She held onto the ladder, the chilly wind enough to remind her of the biggest drawback. As she pulled, she was giving a display of her naked body, enough for Fatima to see completely if she hung around. </p><p>Mary managed to pause only a second to glance around, confirming she had retreated, then she banished those concerns, letting herself enjoy the feeling. At least, it wasn’t as explicit as it could be with the water hiding her from the view…</p><p>“Let’s fix it,” Darion said and pushed her out of the water, and only then she realized she had spoken those words out loud. She would have loved to complain, but he was quick to take a position behind her back, invading her body recklessly once more. </p><p>And, without any concern about staying above water, he was even merciless and reckless. She felt his hand on her hair, pulling it hard, the pain making the pleasure even better. </p><p>She let herself surrender, enjoying the feeling. It was nice, letting go, letting him dominate her as aggressively as he wanted. She just closed her eyes, focused on enjoying the feeling as his shaft stretched her out to the limit, turning poolside into porn. </p><p>“W-we should change locations,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“As you wish,” he said and lifted her, still inside her. They walked forward, impaling in and out recklessly enough that, only halfway in, she realized they weren’t going out but toward the seats at the edge. </p><p>She would have complained … but as the pleasure invaded her mind, she was having trouble staying conscious, let alone complaining. She just enjoyed his repeated invasions, time losing meaning once more. </p><p>Time passed…</p><p>“I think you earned a break,” he said, which she appreciated. As he walked away, she closed her eyes. She earned a minute of shut-eye… maybe two.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Deciding on what to do next didn’t take much. I could have tried to decipher the writings on the wall, but with the leather-clad explorer next to me examining the walls with a focused expression, I could see that asking her would have been the easier path. </p><p>Of course, I couldn’t just come and ask her about that, not as a random mercenary. It would be suspicious of me to ask her about that … so instead, I decided to pick a more ordinary path. Flirt with her, and impress her a bit, so she works to impress me. </p><p>Hopefully through giving a lengthy breakdown of the situation. </p><p>Not exactly a bad strategy since I had nothing else to do. I used our closeness to examine her once more. As she leaned forward to put the finishing touches on my bandages, her jet-black hair spilled in front of her face, blocking her beautiful face, leaving me with no option but to examine her outfit. </p><p>I had to admit, her leather ensemble looked good, especially as it looked like it showed some wear and tear that showed a lot of adventures — and not all of it particularly close. She must have been very familiar with going around dangerous locations. </p><p>Admittedly, she hadn’t been particularly impressive in terms of combat, but still, not folding in panic as the horde of mana shadows attacked was enough to show she was not unfamiliar with danger as well — just not that same intensity. </p><p>It seemed that my old ‘friend’ had been careful while he trained her. </p><p>While she worked, I turned my attention to my surroundings, a few glowing crystals illuminating the environment. I didn’t know how they worked, but throttling their magical connection wasn’t that hard, subtly changing the lighting of the room to something that could be called amorous. The change wasn’t that impressive, but every little bit counted. </p><p>I followed it with a few other subtle spells, getting rid of some of the more annoying debris, creating a subtle yet nice smell that dealt with the stale air…</p><p>She was not particularly sensitive to magic — nor she had the necessary training — missing most of the magic tricks I had done. Though, she looked around in confusion as the smell changed, showing that she was still careful to observe her surroundings. </p><p>“Do you mind helping me get rid of my armor and shirt,” I said. “I don’t want to deal with their bloody messes?” </p><p>“Are you sure?” she asked. \"The situation might be dangerous. You have seen what happened. I wonder if they are alright with what was going on…”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I answered. “The captain is a very famous mercenary who made his reputation handling magical beasts. A bunch of mana shadows is not really a challenge.” </p><p>“Are you sure? There were a lot of mana shadows. How long do you think it’ll take to handle those.” </p><p>“I’m confident that they are all fine,” I told her as I patted her shoulder, using the excuse to get some physical contact. “Though, cleaning the monsters will take quite a while, at least a day or two,” I said. I didn’t want her to try to open the gate. </p><p>“Really, that long? What are we going to do inside with no help? We don’t know just how safe we are in here.” </p><p>“I doubt we have any problems, you seem like a very competent explorer,” I answered, greeting her a bit. A little compliment about her competency never hurt, especially during a task she was clearly invested in. “I’m sure we can handle it for a day or two, and then they could open the gate again once they arrived.” </p><p>The last part was not possible, not only because they were very much dead, but also because her blood was needed to open the door, but there the trick Mrin had pulled worked to my benefit. She didn’t know it was her blood that unlocked the magical door, so believed it was possible for the others to open it as well. </p><p>“Really, you trust me?” she said, looking shocked. Clearly, it was not a statement she heard a lot … which, thinking, wasn’t too surprising. At a glance, she had fulfilled every little check-box about spoiled nobles, and that was hardly something that gave people confidence — especially without any obvious martial or magical talent. </p><p>However, the way she moved around the ancient ruins, identifying traps and danger areas was certainly exceptional, enough for me to actually trust her in non-emergency situations. </p><p>And, I had enough experience to handle emergencies. </p><p>“Of course I trust you, you are very competent clearly,” I said, then gestured around. “And you clearly know about this place far more than I do, so it’s a nice bonus. Now, please help me get rid of his bloody mess.” </p><p>“Sure,” she said, but as she helped me to get rid of my bloodied shirt and armor, a blush spread on her face, the earlier adjustments helping even more by making the area slightly romantic. I could feel her hesitancy as her fingers dragged down along my body, exploring the accents of my body. </p><p>A bit faster than I expected, certainly, making me think whether I had made a mistake and used Tantric, but checking my presence showed that it was not the case. </p><p>It took a while for me to realize it was just the after-effects of the explosive excitement she had just felt, followed by being locked in a man who had just wounded to defend her — well, a bit indirectly, but good enough.</p><p>And my muscular chest certainly helped. </p><p>Sometimes, things just clicked. </p><p>As her finger lingered down on my arm, she looked at my bandaged hand sadly, looking guilty. “You’re wounded because of me, I’m sorry,” she whispered.  </p><p>I smiled at her gently. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s not the worst thing that happened to me,” I said as I patted her shoulder once more, though this time pulling her closer. “No help crying after spilled milk,” I said. </p><p>“You’re right,” she said, then chuckled. “Since we’re going to travel together for a while, we should properly meet,” she added. “My name is Audrum, what’s yours,” she said. </p><p>“Byron,” I answered, more out of amusement than anything else, aware that it was much less known than my actual title. I particularly doubted that she would assume the random mercenary she met was the dark lord just because of the name. </p><p>Sometimes, entertainment opportunities were hard to turn down. </p><p>She pulled back a bit after her initial flirting, clearly not ready to push for more. I let it go, as I needed to make her take the first step — and, I didn’t want to use any magic directly on her, not wanting to trigger any possible protective mechanism in the ruins in case they somehow registered her after she opened the gate with her blood.</p><p>Luckily, even without fun starting, I had enough to keep me occupied. I had a delicious eye candy for me to enjoy, wrapped in leather. She might be dressed in utilitarian pieces, but they were tight enough to make it fun, and the little marks of dirt on her face just made things even more attractive. </p><p>“I should check where we are,” she murmured as she stood up, her luscious dark hair, somehow managing to shine under a thin layer of dust and dirt. I paid more attention to her skin, still softly glistening. </p><p>“Any idea about where we are?” I asked as I stood up next to her as she examined the walls, though when I acted like my head was spinning, she was quick to support me. </p><p>“Still not completely sure,” she answered, quick to explain to hide her blush. “We’re trying to find the source of these ruins for almost a year, though no matter how much we worked, we’re yet to put a general timeline. We just know that they are old.” </p><p>“Really, older than the Empire?” I asked, acting like an uneducated mercenary. It was obvious that it was older than the Empire. </p><p>Significantly so. </p><p>“Certainly,” she answered, not smug about correction. “Probably by centuries.” She pointed at a certain part. “Look, this part describes the source of a battle, some kind of alliance forcing against the owner of the ruins, winning against them pretty handily as well, forcing them to escape into different countries.” </p><p>“Do they look like some kind of firebird?” I asked, pointing at a phoenix,” I said as I tightened my arm around her waist, amused by the way she leaned against my chest, her leather ensemble doing little to block the effect. </p><p>She was, even more, turned on by the recent danger if that was the way she acted. </p><p>How entertaining…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Come at me, little boy,” I said as I stood between the hulking player and the hoop, taking a simple yet perverse pleasure from referring to him as little. </p><p>Accepting the ball implied that he was the worse player, but he was already too angry to notice that fact. He rushed forward, intent on running me over to dunk. A good idea to show his superiority. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, even discounting all the benefits of my Traits, that was the worst choice he could have done. I was a football player, and if there was one thing I was not unfamiliar with, it was bodily contact. </p><p>I cut his path and straightened my stance … and he literally bounced off me. “Tacking drills, fun,” I said, not bothering to lower the volume of my chuckle while he stumbled back.</p><p>To his credit, he managed to hold the ball. I could have rushed to take the ball off him, but I was more interested in the Intent flow. I could feel a second domain being activated … </p><p>Athletics.</p><p>The sense of activation I received wasn’t as intense as the one I was feeling from Lust, but unlike Lust, it was rising faster. </p><p>An unexpected benefit, almost enough to make me let it slide when my opponent rushed toward me once more, this time trying to fake to the left of me before making a sharp turn. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, almost mercy was the same as no mercy. I acted like I had taken the bait, and he rose for an easy dunk … but I turned just at that point, and slapped the ball off his hands. “Nice attempt, little boy,” I said with a chuckle, not even making the attempt to pick the ball as it went out of bounds. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” he growled, and I just chuckled, not even bothering to answer even as one of his teammates passed the ball back to him. </p><p>This time, I saw him preparing for a mid-range shot, and rushed forward. “Enough warm-up, right,” I said as I started defending him, making him impossible to make a shot. He tried to fake me twice, and the second, I acted like I had swallowed it, earning a hurried shot attempt. </p><p>Another block, though this time, I followed the ball. Two blocks, back-to-back, were enough to show just how hopeless his attack attempts were, and while the boosts to the Intent flow were nice, it was hardly enough to stretch the game too much and fake competitiveness. </p><p>“Not a bad warm-up, right coach,” I said as I dribbled the ball, chuckling as I stood a step behind the three-point line, waiting to see if he was going to defend me. </p><p>He did not, so I rushed forward, copying his earlier attempt at a layup, but unlike his, my fake step was wildly successful, forcing him to overcommit to the left. He tried to recover, but as I rushed forward, my momentum destroyed his hasty defense. </p><p>My rush was hard to deal with even when he was perfectly balanced, let alone caught flatfooted. And, just like that, I dunked over him while he stumbled back. </p><p>A picturesque scene. </p><p>I glanced at Kim, who had set up at a distance. She gave me a thumbs up, showing she was happy with the pose, followed by another gesture asking for me to repeat it. </p><p>I rushed twice more, bullying him with my agility. Of course, I was nowhere near the limit of what I could really do with my Divine Traits, just keeping myself below my earlier limits. </p><p>I knew that I was already in the sight of at least two groups that were aware of the divine matters, and I didn’t want to alert them with my sudden improvement. </p><p>Admittedly, even revealing this much was a sacrifice, and if I was convinced that my enemies were limited to a few organizations, I would have played my cards much closer to my chest. </p><p>But, I still remembered the cursed fires that had been burning the house my guide had forced me to visit. Combine that with the pattern of incidents I had managed to infer from my web searches — starting from two years ago, and getting more frequent each month — the faster I gathered the intent, the better. </p><p>Even if I had to reveal some secrets in the process. </p><p>I was betting that a, due to their inability to harvest Intent on a wide scale, the other groups would treat my actions less as a determined effort, and more as a thoughtless rush to get rich after getting a semblance of power. </p><p>As my mind drifted, I continued playing. After three more dunks, the coach made a gesture, and my opponent focused on defending only the hoop, waiting for me to walk forward. </p><p>They must have decided I couldn’t shoot. A realization that I could disabuse them … but why waste the opportunity. First, I rushed toward the basket once more, this time ‘barely’ achieving a lucky layup against his focused defense. </p><p>“We shouldn’t waste much time like this, coach,” I declared arrogantly. “Why don’t you send two more players so that I can show just how terrible your players are,” I declared, this time letting a hint of Taunt infect my voice. </p><p>“As you wish!” the coach growled, and gestured two players to join the game.  One of them was a pivot, nearing seven feet, and another six-nine player, even burlier than the unlucky guy I had been torturing. </p><p>“Oh, coach, you’re nasty,” I said with a chuckle, watching as they covered the perimeter aggressively. It was clear that he wanted to make it impossible for me to rush inside. Looking at the angry faces of the players — justifiable considering I had been humiliating their teammate for the last few minutes — if I rushed forward, the tackles I would receive wouldn’t be much weaker than the football field. </p><p>And, as much as I wanted to do that, I had a simpler plan to handle that. With a smile on my face, I pulled behind the three-point line, and let a gentle shot fly. </p><p>“Another point for me,” I declared smugly as I looked at the coach. They passed me the ball, and I bounced it a couple of times, waiting for them to approach. One of them did, but a little dribble between his legs was all I needed to leave him behind, and while he scrambled to catch me, I took another three-point shoot. </p><p>“You can shoot threes as well,” the coach said, his face getting even more purple. Ordinarily, regardless of the circumstances, a coach should be satisfied by discovering a genius player in his school, but his reaction didn’t surprise me too much. </p><p>After all, there was a reason Coach Juana asked me to target him. He wasn’t like Coach Spencer, but that didn’t mean it was any better. Coach Spencer had run his part of the team as a frat house, as he was rich enough not to care about anything. </p><p>The old man I was facing didn’t share the same richness, so he was reputed to make some shady dealings to distribute his scholarship spots and other irregularities. </p><p>“Of course. It’s simple compared to throwing a sixty-yard pass while four men are rushing to kill me,” I said, underrating the difficulty. It was not a fair statement, but I didn’t care about fairness. </p><p>“Let’s see how good is your handle, then,” he said, and made quick changes, replacing his new additions with point guards, dedicated to defending me at the perimeter. </p><p>“Good, you want me to humiliate the whole team together,” I said as I bounced the ball happily despite the double team, moving among them. I could have rushed through them to break past them using my physical advantage, but that wasn’t as fun. </p><p>Instead, I moved between them, the ball dancing between my legs — and occasionally theirs — as I gave them a quick but harsh lesson about handling. “And, time for a three-pointer,” I declared suddenly as I jumped. They raised their hands, trying to contest, but they jumped late, and the ball didn’t even touch their fingers. </p><p>It was a perfect shot. </p><p>Too bad someone wanted to act like a jerk. My unlucky opponent — no doubt triggered by his girlfriend cheering happily for me — rose up and slapped the ball before it could go in. It was an obvious goaltending attempt, but I didn’t let it bother me as I moved and grabbed the ball. </p><p>I had much better ways of finishing the game than a boring argument about rules. </p><p>“That’s how you guys want to play?” I said with a chuckle. “Let’s play,” I said as I rushed forward. I slipped through one of the point guards with a little dribbling trick, while slamming the other with my shoulder and pushing him away. </p><p>The unlucky power forward tried to cut my path, but before he could do so, I threw the ball, letting it bounce off the board. For a moment, it treated my throw as a poor hurried shot, which was a big mistake. </p><p>He couldn’t prevent it from going in either way, but at least, he could have avoided it turning into a poster dunk, flying back as our bodies collided, while I stayed hanging at the board. </p><p>At a distance, I could see Kim immortalizing it through her camera, and the Intent flow was already getting more intense — with a corresponding strengthening of the Domain echo from Athletics. </p><p>I had a feeling that Megan would be very happy with her marketing campaign… </p><p>And, hopefully, I would finally have some spending money. </p>",

    "content": "<p>A frown popped to my face as I watched Miriam’s swaying hips, my mind lost in thoughts. Of course, no matter how amazing Miriam’s hips were, they weren’t beautiful enough to hypnotize me like this. No, I was lost in trying to understand the feedback I had received from her. </p><p>Which had the potential to be the first key to resolving what the Domain was. I watched as they disappeared. Lost in thought, I didn’t pay much attention to the footsteps that approached.  </p><p>“Wow, just got dumped, and already swinging empty,” Kim said with a chuckle. “I didn’t expect the new king of campus to suddenly feel the pain of lost love like this.” </p><p>I chuckled as turned and looked at Kim, her redheaded beauty spectacular as always, wrapped in leather pants and a simple t-shirt. “You’re late,” I said. </p><p>“Does it matter?” she answered. “Without the approvals from the school, we can’t really start—“  she started, only to stop and examine the permits I had just received from the department about image rights. </p><p>While she carefully read the document, I put my hand on her waist and pulled her closer. </p><p>“Be professional,” she said, but didn’t bother pulling off my arm. While she stayed there, I focused on the feeling she gave out, to understand if there was feedback from the Lust Domain. </p><p>Interestingly, just like when Coach Juana was concerned, there was none. </p><p>Curious.  </p><p>I chuckled even as I let my hand dip a bit lower, ignoring Kim’s angry glare. After all, the reason I was teasing her wasn’t just to test the mechanics of the system. “You’re quite capable,” Kim said after finishing reading the document. “It allows us to use our photos commercially almost without any restriction.” </p><p>“Benefits of giving the city a taste of victory,” I said with a chuckle, not mentioning the other reason. </p><p>No need to act crass. </p><p>“So, what’s the plan,” she said as she passed me the bag. I checked, and saw it contained a bright t-shirt, and some kind of shorts. “That’s the outfit,” I said with distaste. It was far too bright for my taste. </p><p>“Yes, Megan decided to make a splash with the first line,” Kim said. “It doesn’t have to sell too much. It just has to be memorable to establish a strong brand presence.” </p><p>“I don’t care much,” I said with a shrug as I quickly changed, ignoring the fact that we were still in the parking lot. No one was around us, so it was not a big problem. I didn’t ask more questions about branding as well for two reasons. </p><p>First, it was not my area of expertise, and I didn’t want to deal with it. </p><p>Second, and more importantly, I didn’t really care. As long as it added to my fame and gave me an excuse to have money, I was okay with it. I was aware that the benefits of money — especially the amounts I could get legally in the short term — wouldn’t compare in any way when compared to the benefits of the System. </p><p>And, to unlock more, I needed fame. </p><p>Pity becoming a professional athlete was not a viable path. Even under the best of circumstances, I could play in the next season due to the bureaucratic structure of the league … and once I became a professional athlete, my time would be even more tightly controlled. </p><p>“Win some, lose some,” I murmured as I walked toward the stadium, Kim next to me, carrying her equipment. </p><p>“Did you say something?” Kim asked. </p><p>“I was wondering what’s the plan for the show?” I said. </p><p>“What plan,” Kim said. “I’m just going to stay in a corner, and you’re going to make a commotion while I record it. Do we need to call it a plan?” </p><p>I chuckled, admitting that she was right. That was all we needed. “You’re right,” I said. “Any preference?” </p><p>“For what?” I asked. </p><p>“The source of the chaos, of course,” I answered. “Do you me to deal with the coaches first, or the players.” Then, I chuckled. “Maybe I should start with the cheerleaders.” </p><p>“Leave the cheerleaders to the last,” Kim answered, but pinched me as she said that. “Now, go.” </p><p>I wanted to tease her a bit more, but we had already arrived at the court, where both the players and coaches were there, waiting for me. The players’ anger was understandable, but the anger of the coaches surprised me. </p><p>“So, you’re the little kid that’s supposed to help us,” the head coach said. </p><p>Coach Juana pushed them more than I expected, it seemed. </p><p>And, since the situation already looked bad enough, there was no harm in stroking the first a bit more. A glance at Kim showed that she was recording. Even better, at the stands, there were several visitors recording it, including Miriam, knowing enough of my reputation to know that a scene was about to follow. </p><p>Good, I wouldn’t want a commotion to go to waste. “Hey, old man!” I called cheerfully. “I heard that you guys need some help from the football team to solve that horrible losing streak you guys are suffering.” </p><p>The face of the coach immediately started changing, turning into a deep purple. “Oh, I heard that your reputation is not exaggerated,” the coach answered. </p><p>Then, the boy that I had been dealing with earlier stepped forward. “Coach, maybe we should see if he’s good enough to teach us,” he said. “After all, it’s only fair to see how good he is.” Then, without waiting for an answer, he threw the ball toward me hard. </p><p>It was a bad pass, but catching it was trivial. </p><p>The coach didn’t look surprised at his sudden intrusion, meaning they had already talked about it. “Not a bad idea. After all, you’re supposed to teach us about basketball,” the coach said. </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, you want to turn our private bet into public, how fun,” I answered. As I said that, he flinched, and in a corner, I noticed Miriam giving out a smug smile. </p><p>Yet, it wasn’t the thing that I noticed at the stands. While Miriam gave that smug smile, I felt a sudden echo of Lust. It was weaker than the earlier sensation, and more importantly, the source was not Miriam, but some of the other cheerleaders that were looking at her in surprise. </p><p>I had a feeling that Miriam had already blabbed about the bet, which wouldn’t have been a problem in the slightest even without the unexpected benefit of finally giving me a clue about the source. </p><p>I could see who was interested in my presence and who was not … yet I could still see Lust didn’t perfectly correlate with it. What correlated more was a sense of wistfulness in their expression…</p><p>Like they were looking for a prize they couldn’t attain. </p><p>How fascinating. </p><p>I couldn’t help but think about what my guide had said. She was very determined to define what would empower me as worship … which was, ultimately, something that required a sense of unattainable devotion. </p><p>Miriam’s echo of Lust didn’t disappear because her arousal suddenly disappear, but she lost the impression that I was unattainable. </p><p>After all, we were going to fight for her. </p><p>I looked at her, winking, and she started to blush. I chuckled. Initially, I wasn’t particularly invested in her, and just wanted a reason to start fighting … but since, intentionally or not, she helped me to solve some of the mystery of Domains, she deserved a reward. </p><p>A spectacular one. </p><p>However, my plans to flirt with her a bit were aborted by the coach. “We shouldn’t waste much time,” the coach said. “I still have a lot of work to do, and I can’t waste the whole day dealing with the flights of fancy from our new sports director.”</p><p>A deliberate shot, as not only he had made sure to speak loudly, but also looked to the side to check if people were actually recording. </p><p>Not that I needed to confirm … the stirrings in the Intent flow told me that people were already watching us. </p><p>With greater numbers than I expected. Probably due to my reputation, everyone anticipated a scene. </p><p>Well, it would be rude to disappoint them. </p><p>I shook my head as I looked at the coach,, dribbling the ball calmly in the process. “Well, coach, if you think it’ll help to humiliate the nepotistic bunch you like to call players before we start the game, who am I to argue.” </p><p>And just like that, the whole team was my enemy. How fun. </p><p>“Let’s start with you, the little boy who volunteered his girlfriend to help me get over my most recent heartbreak,” I said as I turned to the power forward that challenged me earlier, though I didn’t even bother learning with his name. </p><p>I wouldn’t say that his anger was undeserved, but it was the wrong choice, because it made him unable to see the danger of the pass as I threw the ball at him. </p><p>It looked like it was going to bounce low, so he leaned down reflexively, only for the ball to bounce much higher due to the spin I added … ending up on his face. </p><p>“Careful, little boy,” I chucked as he looked ready to rush forward, but a gesture from the coach stopped him. </p><p>He said nothing as he moved toward the hoop, and I followed. I had some games to win… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment he noticed my approach — on a rapidly growing root — the lich stopped his attempts to seal the breach completely and started moving away, not willing to deal with an unknown enemy. </p><p>Unfortunately, he was just too tempting a target for me to let go. Not just because I wanted to get rid of a tempting target, but also because I noticed that with the breach still open, the undead army had to stop their attack and focus on dealing with the spreading Aether particles, banishing them back to their rightful place taking a significant dimension. </p><p>A good excuse for my huge treant to suddenly move faster and start dealing with the undead. </p><p>{+54 Purified Spark} </p><p>A death knight pulled late from the frontlines, turning into my food as I used the treant to absorb the spark once more. </p><p>A profitable endeavor all around, giving me another reason to chase the lich even as he tried to escape back to the main army.</p><p>He was fast enough to escape me if I relied on the root to follow him … so I cast another spell. From the halfway point, the root broke, but before it could fall, it sprout two thick branches, growing in opposite directions. Soon, those branches sprouted further, followed by leaves. The main root transformed at the same time… </p><p>And, soon, I was perched on top of a huge wooden dragon, one that was flying even faster than the bone dragon the lich had been using, each flap of its wings spreading a thick rush of mana, enough to momentarily suppress the necrotic mana. </p><p>It was another trick I had learned from the memories of the god. Apparently, gods loved to create draconic mounts — much to the distaste of actual dragons, if the scraps I got were any indicator — and even better, my memories had much more impressive specimens of the same spell… </p><p>Which meant, my fake draconic mount was not suspicious when cast by a diminished god who had just woken up from his long slumber. </p><p>Of course, the memories showed that such a beast would have required a sentient center and a lot of Divine Spark to function properly — and mine was essentially a pupped linked to my God Forest — but the show was sufficiently impressive. </p><p>“Being challenged by an actual god. As a little demigod of Necrodes, I’m honored,” the lich shouted even as I closed in the distance. </p><p>I chuckled at the dig the lich threw, trying to trigger the pride of a god to create an opportunity for himself. </p><p>And, amusingly, based on the memories I had watched, I could see that such an attempt actually had a high chance of working. The nature god had been a prideful creature, and he might have actually stopped because chasing a demigod was beneath his glory. The memories showed that, even as the battle that forced him to slumber turned desperate, he rarely took the role on any battlefield that didn’t have a ‘worthy’ foe. </p><p>Instead letting his worshippers die in droves. </p><p>“Do I need to bother horror when I slap down disgusting mosquitos that had disturbed my sleep,” I shouted back, my magically enhanced voice exploding in the opening, the mana radiated turning into mana arrows and destroying the zombies underneath us. </p><p>Along with that, I sent several wooden bolts dense with nature mana to the lich, but he easily dodged them. Nature mana was hardly the most fitting choice for a high-speed flying chase. I wished that I could use my light mana without raising too many questions, as it would have worked excellently during a desperate chase. </p><p>A good way to deal with them while still acting the arrogance of a god. </p><p>The lich didn’t answer, continuing to escape, though I had noted that he had already changed his direction, likely trying to bring me into a trap. </p><p>I was tempted to turn back, but seeing that the first stage of the undead siege was finally broken and elves were trying to recover from the intense battle, they could use the time to heal, rest, and erect some wards. </p><p>The wards I had established kept them safe from the ever-increasing density of Necrotic mana, while the sight of a god counter-attacking should be enough to temporarily dissuade the remnants of the undead from attacking — especially with the constant Aether particles making their lives more difficult. </p><p>That would change if they tried to counterattack, but I used my treant to give them another order, asking them to create a stronger defensive line. </p><p>Of course, even at a distance, I could see a few arrogant ones ignoring those orders and moving forward, but I ignored them. With the necrotic mana getting denser and denser, such an attempt was equivalent to a suicide attempt. </p><p>And I was too busy to save the lives of morons. </p><p>I ignored them and focused on my counterattack. My rush was valuable because it made the forward undead force shatter and retreat — which would be critical if I ever wanted to create a safe corridor for the tribal elves to arrive. </p><p>I continued following the lich deeper into his territory … but then, I felt a flicker from inside. I was about to write that off as another sign of damage, but another flicker followed … and I realized where it was coming from…</p><p>The necrotic spark. </p><p>It was suddenly far more livelier, moving with an intent, outside my control. </p><p>That was not good news, not at all.  </p><p>{+90 Purified Spark} </p><p>{-99 Necrotic Spark, Chosen}</p><p>I immediately followed it in two moves, which explained the mismatching numbers of the notification. First, I immediately converted the most into a pure spark, keeping it separate from the rest for a moment to make sure that effect didn’t continue before letting it be absorbed into the rest of my purified spark reserves. </p><p>At the same time, I pushed the remaining necrotic spark into the crystal, carefully watching its movements. It started to shuffle more as I followed the lich, for about twenty seconds, then stabilized. </p><p>If I hadn’t been familiar with a necrotic spark — both with using and storing — I might have been convinced that it was just a momentary magical effect, of the increasing necrotic mana intensity around me, but I was able to notice it. </p><p>The necrotic spark was … for the lack of a better term … obedient. </p><p>That couldn’t be good news, especially with the subtle route change of the lich. I was being led by a trap, clearly, but I started to feel that the trap was not just there to delay me while the lich retreated. Luckily, testing was easy. </p><p>I pulled back the mana output of my wooden dragon slightly, as if I was slowly reaching my limit as  I got away from the capital. A good display of fake weakness that explained my sudden slowing. </p><p>The effect was not too pronounced, as I acted unaware as I sent another wave of wooden projectiles toward the lich, the kind that he easily dodged several times. Yet, this time, one of them clipped the wing of its bone dragon, and it slowed down slightly. </p><p>Just to make sure I still had the hope to catch him. </p><p>It gave me all the evidence I needed to confirm my guess. Whatever trap he had was not about saving his life — well, unlife — but taking me down.</p><p>Whether it was to disable, injure, or kill, I had no idea. I wished I could cast some diagnostic spells to check, but unfortunately, at this point, the increasing density of Necrotic mana worked against that option, ready to disperse anything but the strongest and structurally-sound detection spell. </p><p>And, any such attempt would shout that I had detected their trap, making them act earlier. I could turn and retreat, and the distance would make their planned ambush much less effective  … but unfortunately, that option was blocked due to another reason. </p><p>The arrogance I had displayed earlier. </p><p>It was a beautiful tool. The pointless arrogance of a god provided a convenient explanation for many of the seemingly stupid moves I had done, preventing my allies and enemies alike from digging too deep. It was too convenient to lose. </p><p>Instead, I decided to double down, and suddenly ordered my wood dragon to stop and dive. The lick took a second to react to that sudden change, and at that moment, the dragon had already landed on the empty field, the plants already dead — and a few hundred zombies easily demolished. </p><p>“I don’t have all day chasing a useless pile of bones,” I said as I waved my hand, and a forest started to grow around me. It was something an arrogant nature god could do, creating a new forest rather than chasing the enemies further, like they could be dealt with any time. </p><p>Of course, the fact that a growing forest around him could be weaponized very aggressively against an attack was just a coincidence. </p><p>Certainly. </p><p>The only thing that saddened me was the inability to draw some of the Divine Spark of the Forest to ready myself for the upcoming battle. With the forest split between two locations, it was tempting to bring all of my lagging stats to twenty. </p><p>Would that make a great difference … no, but it would have given me some psychological confidence. </p><p>Pity. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 19    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 19    Perception: 19</p><p>Agility: 19     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 19       Intelligence: 19</p><p>Endurance: 24      Wisdom: 19}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 2600}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 5800  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 26458}</p><p>Elven Priestess - XXXX}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I could sense the movement outside the barrier getting more intense as a significant part of the Undead Forces started focusing on my little ‘rebellion’ rather than the ongoing siege. </p><p>I was confident in meeting their charge, but that didn’t mean I wouldn’t turn my nose down to some extra insurance. After a quick calculation, I started feeding my Stats with more Divine Spark, and soon, I felt the familiar and welcome burst of energy filling my body and soul. </p><p>{-6083 Purified Spark} </p><p>{+3 Strength}</p><p>{+3 Precision}</p><p>{+3 Agility}</p><p>{+3 Speed}</p><p>{+3 Perception}</p><p>{+3 Intelligence}</p><p>{+3 Wisdom}</p><p>And, as an added benefit, the improvements helped me to handle the technique I had used prematurely, finally feeling like I could cut loose without risking the destruction of my soul. The improvement wasn’t as intense as the Endurance, but under the circumstances, it was still welcome. </p><p>This time, I needed to give an explosive display. </p><p>And, while the state of the Aether dimension, slowly filling to the brim with Necrotic mana, was horrible news, it did give an excuse about how a previously unknown lich among them could explode with such explosiveness. </p><p>I wanted to leverage the opportunity as much as possible, displaying greater competence than the other necromancers to destroy them, and then hopefully writing it off as some kind of accidental display of capability. </p><p>Just to make it more convincing, I started building a horrible, butchered version of a teleportation ward, one that would just create a temporary breach between Aether and Physical planes, one that would flood this side with intense Necrotic mana. </p><p>Of course, there was a reason most didn’t do such a silly thing, because aether particles that weren’t broken down into mana were very dangerous. There were ways of pushing them back to Aether Dimension, but it was enough to occupy a qualified mage for a decent time. </p><p>A rather explosive method, but considering I could even deal with Primordial Aether, hardly a scary proposition. </p><p>Soon, I turned my attention toward the next stage, and started transforming the wards, which were already buckling under the constant attacks of the elite. “Oh, they are strong,” I murmured as I took note of the intensity of the attacks, glad that I didn’t confront them directly. </p><p>Their empowered state was no joke. Even with the God Forest constantly filling me with mana, I doubted that I could win against them. </p><p>That made me change my mind about the nature of the attack. It might have been a bit more suspicious than I preferred, but I started using my crafting to create a huge number of earthen arrows, easily shattered, each holding a small flicker of light mana combined with Proto-HP inside. </p><p>Despite its low mana requirement, I wasn’t able to create a lot, as the little amount of Light Spark I had showed its limits even with the perfectly purified mana I was feeding to quicken the process. I barely managed to concoct a hundred of them before the wards finally reached their limits. </p><p>The moment the first ward shattered, it triggered an explosive reaction that spread through the undead forces, and I used the chaos to target several stronger death knights among them, hoping that it would slow them enough, while their relative lack of magical capability would cause them to miss the trick. </p><p>I wasn’t afraid of the liches noticing my trick, not from a distance while all that chaos was going on. In this particular case, the influx of necrotic mana actually worked against them, easily destroying the light mana before they could start assessing the reason for their death knights’ intense injuries. </p><p>Of course, they rushed forward, racing to destroy me before taking back all the Divine Spark crystals I had gathered, unaware that they had been long absorbed and turned into my stats. </p><p>There, the second part of my plan started. I triggered the ward I had prepared, and the wall between Aether and Physical weakened, a veritable flood of Necrotic mana and unbroken Aether hitting the arena. </p><p>The telltale sign of a suicide attack. The fastest ones found themself in the Aether dimension, before I could even steal their Divine Spark. I used the opportunity to change my disguise and teleport.</p><p>Just like that, I was in the middle of the undead horde …  while they were blinded by the necrotic mana. The intensity of Necrotic mana was supposed to help them, but such an intense amount was enough to blind them. </p><p>I set up a ward around myself to protect myself, then I started dashing among them, a huge sword of necrotic energy in my hand, every swing taking down a death knight or a lich.</p><p>Of course, there was no way pure necrotic mana could kill them easily. It was just a bridge for me to hide the flow of Tantric mana, rapidly draining their Spark for my purposes, the numbers rising more and more. </p><p>With their own spark and the crystals they had carried with them, it was an incredible harvest. </p><p>{+2040 Purified Spark} </p><p>{+3153 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>Not a bad harvest, and it was just starting. As more and more leaders among the undead fell, it left their horde without a controller, and the flood of necrotic energy didn’t make things any easier — especially with occasional Aether particles preventing them from making easy use of that mess. </p><p>I was about to continue making use of the chaos, when a bone dragon rushed forward toward us from the back of the line, already casting spells, and the breach I had created started to close down. </p><p>A familiar face, I realized — well, metaphorically, as liches hardly had any identifying features in their actual faces.  </p><p>It was the lich I had seen when I first arrived, the one that had closed the breach at the outer wards. The speed at the breach closed despite the pressure off the flow showed that he was not a weakling. Ordinarily, the smart thing was to pull back and disappear while the strong lich dealt with the troublesome breach. </p><p>Unfortunately, his appearance meant that he would soon join the main attack, and considering I was the one that was handling the defense until Seldanna could wake up from her Apothesis, it was better to deal with him. </p><p>The question was, how. </p><p>I thought about challenging him as another lich, an extension of my current ploy, but after some consideration, I removed that. It was believable to have a rogue, overlooked lich could make an arrogant move to kill the rest, but there were limits to his abilities. </p><p>I had already faked the death of a lich, and if I appeared again, not only I would reveal the death was fake, but also I would have burst with enough power to overcome a top-tier lich. </p><p>Especially since I didn’t know I could actually take him down while acting as a lich. Using necrotic mana was not a simple thing. Even now, I could feel the strain of the cursed effect of wielding the energy anathema to life, and that was only when I used it for effects of trickery. </p><p>Facing a strong lich in a direct duel was not a challenge I was confident while restricting myself to necromancy. </p><p>Especially that, against a competent caster, I couldn’t easily slip tricks like my disguised light arrows. He would notice that immediately. And, a necromancer that could use the light magic was too much of a curiosity, possibly enough to inform the Eternals — especially if the extent of their cooperation was as intense as I suspected — ruining all the effort I had put into disguising myself. </p><p>Luckily, that was not my only option. I didn’t need to stay limited to necrotic magic … not with the convenient presence of a huge avatar. I focused on my connection with the God Forest, which had been recently beefed up by our connection. </p><p>As I tried to indirectly cast a complicated spell, another death knight attacked me at the same time with three skeletons, realizing that the ward around me marked me as a point of suspicion — that, or trying to score some easy Divine Spark in the chaos. I absentmindedly dodged it and counter-attacked, my retaliation dealing with him. </p><p>{+33 Purified Spark} </p><p>Not a huge reward, but better than nothing. </p><p>Before another death knight could notice me, a huge root suddenly burst out of the ground, and a huge flower exploded from its center, spreading hundreds of seeds, and the moment they touched the ground, they started turning into a small horde of treants, attacking against the horde. </p><p>The god forest had supplied them with a great amount of nature mana,  but with every inch of air filled with necrotic mana, that would be only enough to keep them alive for a few moments. </p><p>Not that I cared as I stepped on top of the root and changed my disguise once more, once again donning the outlook of the nature god. </p><p>After all, what was absurd about an actual god taking down a lich, no matter how strong. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 19    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 19    Perception: 19</p><p>Agility: 19     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 19       Intelligence: 19</p><p>Endurance: 24      Wisdom: 19}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 2465}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 5800  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Necrotic - Chosen 99</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 26458}</p><p>Elven Priestess - XXXX}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Darion had a smile as he walked forward, confident despite the fact that he was breaking and entering. He could have — and should have — returned to his home, but he was yet to arrange a new house for himself, and he didn’t want to go back to the dingy little studio apartment that was his official address, and his actual house was known to his gang. </p><p>A gang that he didn’t want to communicate with just yet. Not when he was having so much fun without any danger. </p><p>It was why he had returned to the same mansion he had arrived earlier, to visit his newest ‘friend’ to stay. </p><p>The same ‘friend’ who was rushing toward him, trying to look angry rather than aroused. He didn’t neglect to take her number after their earlier encounter, and just ten minutes ago, alerted her about his approach. </p><p>“Darion, I told you, you can’t be here. My host doesn’t allow overnight guests! You’ll get me kicked out,” she begged. </p><p>Darion smirked slightly as he took note of her looks. “Damn, you’re so sexy,” he commented. </p><p>She tried to hide it, but his words make her heart flutter. And, if the way she tightened her legs was any indicator, also made her core heat up, no doubt affected by the memories earlier. </p><p>“T-that’s not the issue. You can’t be here,” she complained, trying to act unaffected. </p><p>“Oh, really?” Darion answered. “It wasn’t what you said when I called and asked you for a date.” </p><p>She blushed even more. “Yes … but I thought you’ll bring me out … not a home date.” </p><p>“What’s the difference,” he argued. </p><p>“What’s the difference!” she gasped, her voice getting louder. “I just told you that my host doesn’t allow it, and I can’t afford a place of my own. I’m just lucky that I managed to find a rich woman who wants to support her alma mater and allowed me to stay just handle the cleaning!” </p><p>“As you wish,” Darion answered. “Just a kiss before I leave, then.” </p><p>“That would be —“ she started to answer before her word were cut.  </p><p>That was all Darion allowed her to say before he leaned forward and captured her lips in a searing kiss. She tried to push him back, but that only last a second before her hands lost their strength, her tongue responding to his invasion. </p><p>As he kissed, he let his hands down, testing his earlier guess about her core heating up. He found her core burning in arousal, confirming his earlier guess. Her core was truly burning. </p><p>He played with her for a while, letting her relax, then he suddenly lifted her up, her panties easily destroyed under his fingers. “What are you doing!” she gasped. </p><p>“Not so loud,” he reminded even as his fingers squeezed her naked ass, enjoying the way her hands clutching at his back panicked. “You don’t want our host to catch us, right?” </p><p>“No I — don’t,” she tried to say, unable to hold back her moan under his fingers. “You have to let me go!” </p><p>“Right now?” he asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she replied. </p><p>Darion did so, but only let her feet touch the ground while he hugged her from behind. “Better?” he asked. </p><p>She no doubt wanted to answer him angrily, but as his fingers started working on her clit, her argument died under her resolutely tightening lips. If she opened them, the only thing that would let out was an explosive moan. </p><p>Captive in her pleasure, she did nothing as Darion quickly shed his clothes without letting her go — not even stopping his fingers for more than a second as they danced at her core. </p><p>“Is this your —“ she tried to ask as his shaft pressed against her naked ass, but that argument died while his fingers worked on her core, each second making her tremble more and more. </p><p>“Yes, sweetie, that’s my surprise gift for you, one that I prepared to give at the end of the date. And since the date is canceled…” </p><p>She might have argued against it, but she was busy trying to keep her top on. “What if she comes…” </p><p>“I doubt it’ll make such a difference,” he said as he pushed her down. “Now, start working on your gift.” </p><p>He chuckled as she was quick to follow that comment. She knelt, taking his shaft deep inside her mouth. He didn’t let up for even a second as he fucked her mouth roughly and deeply as they lie together. </p><p>As he watched her enthusiasm, the little amount of doubt he had was quick to disappear, enjoying her process. There was no way she would stop now, he recognized, already enjoying the treatment. “Someone didn’t take her full treatment this morning,” he said, chuckling. </p><p>“Well, with that whore Lily dragging you away…” Mary said for a moment before slipping inside her mouth once again, showing her animosity toward her best friend. </p><p>Amusing indeed. </p><p>Unfortunately, before he could really get going, he heard some kind of voice approaching them. </p><p>“Oh, no, she’s coming, you need to hide,” she gasped. </p><p>“No, we need to be clever. If she asks who am I, tell her that I’m your swimming coach, and you’re trying for the team!” </p><p>“That doesn’t make sense,” she gasped. </p><p>Darion knew that it didn’t make sense, but then he had also seen her watching them with great interest from her bedroom window, so he was confident that she would accept that explanation. </p><p>“Of course it does,” he said as he lifted her up, and she wrapped her arms around him panicked, still wearing her gloves but nothing else to make the situation even more entertaining. </p><p>“Darion, please,” Mary gasped, but he ignored it as he moved toward the pool, and jumped in, their naked bodies sinking into the water. </p><p>“You told them that she’s a very concerned alumni, I’m sure she’ll accept that explanation. Just make sure you stay buried,” he explained. </p><p>“But—“ she started, but Darion cut her off as he grabbed her ass. </p><p>“Too late, she’s already here,” he said as he watched her approach. Though, as he watched her approach, his smirk widened. </p><p>At a distance, he hadn’t been able to get a good view of the owner of the house, and he had assumed she was just another old housewife, too ugly to get any action other than peeking at a bunch of young people. </p><p>But, as she walked closer, wearing nothing but a semi-transparent nightie, Darion was happy to correct that assumption. </p><p>She was an exotic beauty. </p><p>Just the perfect after-dinner dessert.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I waited even as the gate opened and the girl rushed inside, calling the other two to rush forward, carefully watching the old mage, who was gathering his mana. However, the moment I recognized the spell that he was forming, I rushed forward…</p><p>“What—“ was all the young man was able to shout as a huge bolt of black ice slammed into his chest, penetrating his armor and killing him immediately. </p><p>As I rushed forward, I cast an illusion spell, glad that the girl was looking at the other side. I didn’t want her panicking, so I showed her a view of sudden reinforcements arriving, one that wore the same type of armor as the young man who had just been killed, creating an intense show of battle … one that I contributed. </p><p>Of course, the old man had recognized the spell. He was too good not to — a fact that I knew from direct experience. Unfortunately, he couldn’t do anything about it, not when he felt a blade pressing against his throat. </p><p>“Hello, Mrin, long time no see,” I whispered into his ear even as I draw a rune to disrupt his magic, one that would temporarily leave him helpless. And, as an advantage, the magic over him dispersed, leaving a much more familiar face. One of my earlier rivals during my climb.</p><p>One that had disappeared three years ago, supposedly assassinated by one of his rivals. What an interesting encounter.  </p><p>One that I hadn’t slain mostly because he was smart enough to adapt to the new reality, too concerned with his personal safety. Of course, that only increased the value </p><p>“B-Byron,” he stammered in shock, quick to recognize my voice. “You were supposed to be…” </p><p>“Dead after the betrayal of your friends, while you thought you were successful in your attempted assassination,” I said with a chuckle. “It seems that the news of my demise had been greatly exaggerated.” </p><p>As I mocked him, I used the opportunity to cast a ward to keep the mana shadows away from us, giving me time for an impromptu interrogation. I had no idea why he was here, but if it was about his fake suicide, it meant he was working on it for at least three years, maybe even more. </p><p>Highlighting just how valuable the ruins were. </p><p>“But how, the Empire caught you—“ he started, but fell silent as I pressed my blade against his throat tighter. </p><p>“I know, what a horrible end for an uppity dark lord, right?” I said, then chuckled. “Too bad it happened just before a bunch of phoenixes came and took control of the dark lands, making the position completely useless!”</p><p>“You knew!” he gasped as he tried to look at me, his expression completely twisted. Of course, I had no idea, but there was no harm in selling my omnipotence, especially during the impromptu interview. </p><p>“Of course I knew,” I said as I pushed him against a wall, letting him take a glimpse of my weapon. </p><p>“I-is this blade of Shadows?”  he stammered. “That was supposed to be in the vaults of the empire.” </p><p>“Yes, and you were supposed to be dead. Life works in mysterious ways,” I answered. “Now, tell me, what exactly is below that makes you work that much. “</p><p>“The truth of our world,” he answered, letting out a hysteric laugh. “And the reason why those damned creatures of fire are back, trying to take what is mine, forcing me to act faster than I wanted!” </p><p>“And caught by me. Too bad you lost,” I commented. </p><p>He let out a dark chuckle. “I don’t think so,” he chuckled. “That girl here is the only one that can open the gates and take down the security measures. What do you think she’ll do once she watches you kill her trusty butler, the one that protected her after her parents’ unfortunate demise.” </p><p>“I see you are still the same,” I chuckled. “Pity she won’t see anything,” I added. </p><p>“What do you--\" he started, but then, he looked at her way more carefully, and noticed she was looking at an empty spot, lost in the moment. “Illusion spell. How?” he gasped, shocked. “Even you couldn’t maintain three spells at the same time while moving around—“ he tried to add. Then, I moved my arm, and he noticed the Tether of the Underworld around. </p><p>“Impossible! The Tether as well! Were you working for the Empire all along?” he gasped, somehow scandalized. </p><p>“Come on, Mrin, you know me better than that. Do you really think that I would work for anyone? I just made a small deal, and they were happy to pay greatly.” </p><p>“I see,” he murmured, but even as he said that, I felt his magic flicker. A horrible idea with the magic dispersing rune, but he clearly didn’t mind. He was trying to blow us up, maybe disrupting the illusion of the girl.</p><p>No, I realized a moment later. He had pulled some kind of shaped stone from his pocket, one that was glowing with a dangerous amount of magic. Not something I could make, and certainly not something I expected him to have. </p><p>“You better—“ he started, ready to deliver his threat.  </p><p>“You changed, Mrin, you used to be smarter,” I said, but only after I stabbed three times, the combination enough to mortally wound him. He still managed to trigger the magical device, but I managed to block it with the Shield of Aether. </p><p>“T-the S-shield as well,” he stammered, breathing his last words. I didn’t try to save him. He had some precious knowledge, but that knowledge also came with some dangerous tricks, tricks that I wasn’t willing to pull. </p><p>Anything he discovered, I could as well. Still, I went through his body and took everything I could. Then, I adjusted the illusion that the girl watching. A huge mana shadow appeared, one that ‘grabbed’ me and threw me toward the door before it rushed forward, and forced the rest, including the old man, to retreat the other way. “Close the door,” the old man in the illusion shouted. </p><p>Meanwhile, I rolled next to her. “You should be quick, we’re dead if that shadow comes here,” I shouted, revealing a bleeding wound. It was just a scratch I did myself, of course, but it looked worse enough to trigger her sense of mercy. </p><p>She looked undecided, but she focused on the other side of the door, triggering several parts. </p><p>“Y-you’re wounded, we need to bandage it,” she said, pulling several bandages from her bag to show she was prepared. </p><p>“Sorry for being a bother,” I said as I let her bandage it. “We just didn’t expect such a big army of creatures…” </p><p>“Speaking of your arrival, I didn’t know that we hired more mercenaries,” she said, her tone light, but I didn’t miss the subtle seriousness in her tone. </p><p>I shrugged, which I interrupted with a pained hiss. “I don’t know,” I answered her. “I’m a minion, following orders. I don’t even know where we are,” I said, looking around to take note of the drawings and the long text underneath. The text, I failed to recognize, but the drawings of phoenixes and elves were easy to recognize. Dragons and other beings, I recognized as well…</p><p>Interestingly, elves and phoenixes were depicted as defending several castles against some kind of monstrous wave. Even more interestingly, their position was much lower than I expected, showing them as disposable soldiers and weaker aspects, while the commanders had been depicted as human — at least, a variant of it. </p><p>An interesting mystery to solve. I just needed to decide on the priority…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Unfortunately, just because I looked like a necromancer didn’t mean that I could just destroy them. Indiscriminately. The way the necromancers acted showed that they had a complicated web of alliances between them, and while the betrayals were common, I could also see several that was not being touched despite the chaos around them. </p><p>Considering they were not particularly strong among the necromancers, it was not hard to guess that they were servants of the stronger beings. For the moment, I left those alone as well, looking for more appropriate prey. </p><p>As my skeleton knights spread around, I started looking around, looking for prey. Soon, I found my first one, a necromancer that was rushing back, chased by two mounted skeletons, his wounded state proving just how badly he had been defeated. </p><p>“Aner!” he shouted desperately as he shouted at a distance, probably to the controller of the skeletons, who had been doing his best to retreat. “Do you think you can just kill me without consequence? The others will make you pay!” </p><p>“Only if they survive,” Aner shouted back, several hundred feet away while his minions rushed forward, one of them carrying the crystal. I sent a skeleton forward, doing my best to empower it with speed… </p><p>But the skeleton shattered halfway. </p><p>“Okay, better be careful,” I murmured, realizing necromancy might be a tad more complicated than I had assumed. I didn’t have necromancy as a skill, so I was roughly copying the way I had animated the treants, using the necrotic mana to enhance the skeletons. </p><p>However, I had missed one important detail … treants were still living beings, and the excess nature mana just made them grow and strengthen. </p><p>Necromancy was the exact opposite. Necrotic mana corroded even the remains, and the excess mana hurt the skeletons. The true strength didn’t come from the physical power of the shell, but from the soul, whose power was forcibly plundered through the connection. </p><p>And, since I had no intention of mutilating the souls of the poor dead elves — I had my limits — I needed to find an alternative path. </p><p>Luckily, unlike the necromancers that were using the opportunity to kill and massacre, I had different options. The skeleton shattered after the empowerment, because it was weak, which meant, there was an easy answer. </p><p>Use a stronger skeleton. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t need to go around with a shovel and dig to find a stronger skeleton. Instead, I just targeted one of the shattered and abandoned zombies, and cast a spell to separate the flesh from the bones. Then, I targeted the bones with a flood of mana, using my full range of biomancy abilities.   </p><p>The treatment cost me a pretty chunk of mana, but considering the ordinary bones soon received a strength that could rival bone dragons, it was acceptable. </p><p>“Arise, my minion,” I muttered as I chuckled, finally raising a skeleton that could rival a strong skeleton warrior. </p><p>Though, I had no doubt that any necromancers would have been maddened by watching me waste such an absurd amount of mana, easily touching ten thousand barriers, just to raise a weak minion. It went against the whole principle of necromancy, its greatest advantage was its absurd mana efficiency. </p><p>During my experimentation, the skeleton knights had already managed to deal with the escaping necromancer, and captured its spark into a crystal container. They were already returning back to their owner, when they were ambushed by my new skeleton knights, and smashed. </p><p>And, before the necromancer could even react, it covered the distance and brought it to me. </p><p>“Thanks for the crystal,” I shouted happily as I used my mana to repeat the same process on the bones of a horse, and started running away. </p><p>Predictably, the angry necromancer chased me. “Stop, you bastard!” he shouted, but as I ignored him, he continued to chase me. </p><p>“Catch me if you can,” I shouted, a little absurd, but the allure of the crystal in my hand was enough to anger him. A good excuse, I decided as I used my empowered skeleton to steal a few crystals, and soon, I was being chased by a large group of necromancers. </p><p>The first few that joined the crowd were the ones that lost their crystals, but after a few, some greedy necromancers joined the mess without needing me to anger them. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t idle while running. First, I drained the crystals I had stolen until I had empowered my fake Necrotic Spark, until it reached a reasonable limit, allowing me to control a small horde of skeletons with ease, but not corrupting my soul any further. </p><p>{+65 Necrotic Spark, Chosen}</p><p>Once I had gathered enough Necrotic Spark to give a convincing outlook of a strong necromancer — necessary for the next step of my plan — I had drained the rest of the Crystals I had stolen, empowering myself. </p><p>{+562 Purified Spark}</p><p>Not a huge amount, but every bit counted, especially since the next step was going to be pointlessly difficult. </p><p>I ran, until I saw a nice small valley that would work for my benefit. It was clear that it had been a beautiful vista just a day ago, but the undead attack had already trampled it to destroy most of the vegetation, and the remaining plants were already dying due to the increasing density of the necrotic mana. </p><p>As I entered the valley, I was already crafting some destructive arrays, mixing Necrotic mana with Arcana to create some necrotic bolts that would be effective against other undead. </p><p>“Finally—“ one of the necromancers exclaimed as he charged with a burst of speed after noticing I slowed down, enthusiastic to get the first hit, but two of my skeletons ambushed him, killing him easily. They didn’t even carry a crystal, so I used my mana connection to absorb his Spark before he could react. </p><p>{+81 Purified Spark}</p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured even as I noticed the amount of Divine Spark he possessed, enough to make him a significant enemy — at least in the context of the amount of strength I was revealing — if he didn’t act too greedy. </p><p>Unfortunately, the necromancers might be greedy, but they were not idiots. After watching the fate of the first one, the others slowed down, while a few of them rushed forward to cut the sight of the valley. </p><p>Not exactly a problem since I had no intention of retreating. Instead, I ordered my skeletons to rush and destroy what the other necromancers had brought in. The amount looked impressive at first glance, but only because I could count almost fifty necromancers that had been split from the main group. </p><p>With that fact considered, the horde was relatively small, the majority of their horde too slow to follow up with the chase. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I watched my skeletons stand against the mismatched army of the necromancers that chased me, their job made even easier by the fact that the necromancers had no idea how to cooperate with each other. None of them worked together with each other, they were just some that attacked me randomly… </p><p>A few of the smarter ones tried to retreat. The first one succeeded — as I needed a bait — but the second one hit against a ward, bouncing back. “It’s a trap,” he shouted. </p><p>“Smart, but too late,” I said as I waved my hand, casting another illusion, one that, paradoxically, looked like I had just broken my illusion. I looked like an ancient lich, radiating necrotic mana to reinforce the. View. </p><p>“Just attack together, he can’t destroy all of us,” one of them shouted. “We just need to resist until the rest of our horde catches up, and destroys the wards from outside—“ he tried to explain, but that was all he was able to say until a necrotic bolt hit him. </p><p>He didn’t even try to dodge, feeling that the bolt was not a threat. The necrotic bolts still hurt them rather than benefit them, but their resistance was strong enough to treat that as a nuisance. Unfortunately for him, I had used the necrotic bolt just as an anchor, and the real work was done by the Arcana mana in it, exploding to destroy its whole structure. </p><p>{+34 Purified Spark}</p><p>Not as strong as the previous necromancer, but still better than nothing.  </p><p>“We should attack,” one of the other necromancers said, but he stopped when I waved my hand, and an army of skeletons rose from the ground. As the army marched toward them, most of them decided to break the wards was the smarter choice. </p><p>Pity, as only the first line of skeletons was actually real, the rest was just statues of colored earth just giving the aura of the undead. However, without thousands points of mana to reinforce each of them, they would have shattered at the slightest touch… Making them only useful as tools of intimidation. </p><p>However, the selfish nature of the undead worked well, and fifty necromancers that had been happily chasing a great harvest turned to try and run … allowing me to easily harvest them. </p><p>{+3190 Purified Spark} </p><p>“Not a bad harvest,” I murmured as I took down the last necromancer. Not a bad one indeed, especially since I just stole their Divine Spark, and not the crystals they had carried. I had rapidly absorbed the Necrotic Spark first, turning it into Purified Spark, absorbing it easily, while I channeled the Nature Spark they had captured into God Forest. </p><p>{+2420 Purified Spark} </p><p>{+5128 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>“They had been working harder than I expected,” I said with a frown, realizing that I still need to protect the tribal elves that had been retreating back.

    "content": "<p>As much as I wanted to lay on the ground and slowly recover after casting my first proper godly feat, that was not something I could do. </p><p>Not when the undead that surrounded the capital received an intense boost to their abilities as the necrotic mana continued to fill the Aether dimension of the plane. It was yet to reach a point of diffusing into the physical plane, but I wasn’t the only one that could reach the Astral plane and pull some mana. </p><p>They just lacked my ability to break down Aether into mana, which limited the effectiveness of such a move significantly. But, at a point where the Aether was still being filled with an incredible amount of necrotic mana, that was not needed. </p><p>The first thing, I had given an order to the God Forest, and a great number of treants rushed forward toward the outer line to reinforce the battle, to get rid of the advance undead force before they could get even stronger. </p><p>I would have intervened directly, but creating a ward around the capital was more important. I rapidly worked, ignoring the strain in my body as I built a barrier between the Astral plane and the physical side, one that would block the mana flow — and, as an added benefit, teleportation as well. </p><p>I was copying another trick that I had seen in the memories of the nature god, which didn’t make erecting the barrier any easier. If I used just the principles of such a concept and focused on building a barrier, it would have been much faster…</p><p>Unfortunately, it would also risk shouting my true origin to the Eternals, who were still busy pumping the plane with necrotic mana. I didn’t know just how intensely they were observing now that they were about to leave. </p><p>They wouldn’t miss a ward that was larger than a mountain. </p><p>I squeezed my teeth as I focused on building the nature ward all over the capital, leaving only the roots of the Tree of Life defenseless, letting them die temporarily. If I had the opportunity, I would have saved them, but with the whole plane suffocated by the necrotic mana, doing so would give my enemies too many chances to attack, and I doubted I could stop those even if I revealed the full range of my abilities. </p><p>I was still far from the peak of my power and injured; not to mention a full-fledged necromancer assault confident enough to deal with a god was not a trivial attack. </p><p>Especially since it was still being supported by the Eternals. </p><p>As I continued to build the wards, I couldn’t help but think whether the Eternals pulled the same trick every plane they had intervened, or it was something they were forced to do because of my sudden intervention. I hoped that it was the latter, because it would mean their current attack was forcing them to waste some valuable resources. </p><p>I knew they were strong, but imagining them treating what had just happened as a disposable resource was too hard to comprehend. The necrotic mana in the Aether dimension was still growing, and the planar border had already changed its nature. </p><p>Before the attack, it was a relatively even mixture of necrotic mana and nature mana, conflicting at the edges, but as the Aether continued to fill with necrotic mana, the balance shifted.  The nature mana was demolished until it turned into a small point right at the top, a helpless small circle continuously supported by the Tree of Life … while the rest of the border turned necrotic. </p><p>I was tempted to cut the connection completely, but I could sense some thin connections between that border and Seldanna. I had already cut the roots of the tree which slowed her Apothesis significantly. I didn’t dare to do that last part. </p><p>Instead, I stretched a connection between it and the God Forest, ensuring enough supply of mana to prevent its collapse. </p><p>And, just like that, the preparations were complete… It was time to hunt some undead. </p><p>I stretched my attention along the border, and noticed that, at several spots, undead had been already reinforced. Interestingly, that reinforcement came in the form of liches and death knights using their flying mounts — bone dragons and other impressive beings — rushing toward the defensive line, which, despite the addition of the ward, already buckling down. </p><p>It was an impressive showing … but my frown was more about confusion than fear. Their approach was rather more chaotic than I expected, and actually reduced the impact of the force they could bear. </p><p>“Of course,” I murmured a moment later as the realization hit. They were not attacking … but they were racing forward. Now that they believed their success was imminent, they were more interested in stealing the most Divine Spark they could rather than making their victory perfect. </p><p>They clearly didn’t care about their losses but their individual benefit. </p><p>At a distance, I even saw a necromancer killing another, using the crystal to trap his essence. It didn’t surprise me. Even the elves were more than happy to betray their kind for power. </p><p>Necromancy wasn’t exactly an art famous for kindness and self-sacrifice. </p><p>I wasn’t complaining. Their habits worked excellently to my benefit. That meant, I had the space to pull a little trick. I cast an illusion spell, one that created a floating, wooden copy of the god, the same gold and white coloration of the Tree of Life — another trick from the memories — and sent it toward the most intense spot of the battle. </p><p>The speed of it was impressive, and the constant nature of mana it radiated was enough to entice the elves to fight harder. The undead looked hesitant as they pulled back, but rather than fully retreating, they sent hordes and hordes of undead toward it, while the strongest liches connected to it. </p><p>Yet, the moment some necrotic energy landed on the surface, a crack of diseased energy and rotten wood appeared. The treant let out a display of pain before it let out a huge flood of nature energy, recovering from the damage and empowering the nearby elves at the same time. </p><p>During that display, a group of leaves disappeared permanently, like the treant had made some permanent sacrifice for that burst. </p><p>The undead was too smart to miss that sign of weakness, and they rushed forward, unaware that they were attacking an empty puppet connected to God Forest, just a conduit for all the mana I had stored from the earlier attack. </p><p>That addition ensured that the most important defensive point wouldn’t collapse. Another illusion spell, and I had turned into an ordinary elven warrior, and rushed toward the weakest area… Once I arrived there, I cast another spell, and turned into a mere skeleton warrior, radiating necrotic energy. </p><p>The chaos of the battlefield was perfect as I rushed among the horde of zombies, not many people paying attention to the movement of the undead. Soon, I reached the first necromancer, who was yet to take his step into the lichdom.  A swing of my sword was enough to destroy him as I pressed a crystal into his corpse. </p><p>Of course, both the swing and the crystal were unnecessary. Just a small invasion of mana was all I needed to steal his divine spark, and purify rapidly. </p><p>{+34 Necrotic Spark, Chosen}</p><p>“Nice,” I murmured as I measured the amount of strength he granted to me, even though it had come with a sense of disgust. Holding Necrotic Spark inside my soul, I could already feel a sense of corruption radiating, showing just how unnatural its existence was. </p><p>Not something I wished to do, but the circumstances forced me to do so. The sight of a poor necromancer, fighting with his peers behind the battle lines was much less attention-grabbing. </p><p>Especially when I could already see dozens of duels going on. </p><p>With my body injured, I wasn’t in a position to just fight against the undead, and I doubted they would be still fighting against each other if I managed to assassinate them from a distance. It might force them to gather their forces together and deliver a coordinated assault — which was not something I could handle in my wounded state. </p><p>Worse, any hint of success might trigger the Eternals to act even more overtly. Ideally, I didn’t want to see what else they had in store, ever, but if I was going to see it, I preferred to delay it until I could completely recover. </p><p>First, I cast a spell on myself, changing my disguise from a skeleton knight, then, gathered some necrotic mana from my environment, and raised a bunch of skeletons that were under my direct command. Giving orders to corpses didn’t feel nice, but I ignored the disgust and ordered them to spread around... </p><p>I had a lot of undead to hunt. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 24      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 188}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 5800  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Necrotic - Chosen 34</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 18183}</p><p>Elven Priestess - XXXX}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>When I arrived at the basketball stadium, Kim was yet to arrive. “Hey,” I said as I called her. </p><p>“Sorry about that, it took longer to get everything,,  but I’ll be there in a few minutes,” Kim answered. “Have you finished getting the approval for the commercial release? That was fast.” </p><p>I paused. “Was I supposed to?”  </p><p>“Didn’t Megan mention it?” she countered. </p><p>“Nope, she probably forget in all the excitement,” I answered.  </p><p>“Company lawyers didn’t mention it as well?” Kim countered. </p><p>I chuckled. “I see that I’m not the only one that missed some important briefing,” I said, followed by a quick breakdown of what happened, including the ‘lucky’ break we had received. </p><p>“Interesting,” Kim answered. “But that means there are some problems.” </p><p>“Like what?” I asked. </p><p>“Getting the approval for the commercial release of the photographs is quite a hurdle. There are a lot of approvals to be received, and school lawyers are obsessive about every single detail. Normally, their company lawyers are supposed to handle it,  but…” </p><p>“I wouldn’t worry about that,” I answered. “Just be here in five minutes and we can begin.” After she ended the call, I called another familiar name. “Hey, how’s my favorite coach doing?” I asked. </p><p>“Trying to conquer a mountain of paperwork,” Juana answered. “This place is a mess.”  </p><p>“Good, since you’re busy with it, adding one more shouldn’t be a problem?” </p><p>“What do you need?” she answered, her voice sharpening immediately. </p><p>“Nothing much. I just need the approval from your department that we can use my photos in commercial activities,” I said. </p><p>She sighed. “Just tell the company lawyers to contact our legal department. That’s why we have them,” she said, ready to end the call. </p><p>“Unfortunately, I’m working with a small company that’s also founded by a student, and we don’t have the time to find a lawyer. So we’re hoping that the department will handle everything.” </p><p>“That’s not how it works,” she answered.</p><p>I chuckled. “As you wish, but it would mean I won’t be able to visit the basketball team and annoy the coaching team as you wanted. I don’t think I’ll have the time, not with all the legal documents I have to fill…” </p><p>“You’re annoying as always,” she growled. “I’ll make sure the legal department handles both. But, you have to make sure the head coach of the basketball team is distracted enough not to make too much trouble. It’s even better if he can skip tonight’s meeting.”  </p><p>“I can do that, but that’ll cost you extra,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“What else do you want?” she asked. </p><p>“A selfie of your beauty,” I answered. </p><p>“You’re truly shameless,” she growled in anger and the call ended. But, despite the anger, I recognized something in her tone, so, I wasn’t surprised when my phone was buzzed. </p><p>It was a photo of hers. She was on her desk, with her breasts pressing against the desk as she leaned forward. The pressure would have created a beautiful cleavage if she hadn’t already unbuttoned her shirt and gotten rid of her shirt, revealing her amazing tits for my gaze. </p><p>Yet, she was still wearing her blazer, which added to her allure. </p><p> Her face didn’t show in the picture, but the beautiful dusky hue of her skin left no doubt about her identity. I had spent too much time with her naked self to mistake her. And, even if that was not enough evidence, I could still see several hickeys that had been left during our previous encounter, functioning as her unique, beautiful ID. </p><p>‘Satisfied?’ she texted. </p><p>‘For now,’ I answered, which earned an angry emoji from her. I leaned against the car, waiting for Kim to arrive. But, before she could do so, someone else approached me first. A Middle-Eastern beauty. “Hi, Terry,” she murmured as she looked at me with a big blush. “Or, should I call you coach?” </p><p>If it wasn’t for my Divine enhancements, I might have had trouble recognizing her. Considering that the only time I met with her was at a party, with flashing lights making her look very different than the only other time I had seen her, I doubted she could blame me.  </p><p>“Hey,” I said with a smile. </p><p>She responded with a disappointed frown. “You don’t remember me,” she commented sadly. </p><p>I chuckled as I took a step forward, grabbed her hand, and brought it to my lips, enjoying her blush. “Oh, how could I forget my beautiful rook, who had gone all that trouble to dress for me,” I said, telling her that I remembered her very well. </p><p>She was a part of the celebration after our first monumental victory, one that allowed us to push for more. She was the one that dressed as a rook … and not wrongly. She certainly had the assets to justify it. </p><p>“But you don’t remember my name,” she complained, but it was far more different than her previous statement, playful and cottequish rather than angry. </p><p>I smirked as I took half a step forward, cutting into her personal space. It would have been classified as an aggressive move, but she leaned forward to cut the distance even more, showing she didn’t mind it. “Unfortunately, that’s not my fault,” I whispered throatily. </p><p>She shivered. “How so,” she whispered back, no less throaty.</p><p>“If you think back, you never paused to grant me your beautiful name…” I said as my gaze dipped down, looking down at her shirt. It wasn’t particularly revealing, but from my angle, I could still see a lot. “Instead, you were busy showing me some other beautiful stuff.” </p><p>She paused for a moment as the memories assaulted her, her blush spreading. “At least you remember them,” she whispered. “Otherwise, you might have shattered my fragile confidence.” </p><p>Though, she leaned forward a bit more as she said that, pressing her body against mine. I might have stopped her — to make the situation a bit more fun rather than anything else — but I was distracted by something else. </p><p>An echo … one that coming from her. For a moment, I panicked — thought didn’t give any outward sign — thinking that she could also use magic, but then, I realized it was not that. </p><p>It was something similar to Intent, yet stronger … it felt soft and fuzzy, yet boiling at the same time. </p><p>It was lust…</p><p>Or, more accurately, the Domain of Lust. </p><p>Even as I put my hand on her waist — far lower than it would have been appropriate, but considering everything else we had done together, not too shocking — I felt the sensation get even more intense. I couldn’t help but wonder why I felt that, and why I hadn’t felt it before. </p><p>Especially since I had such an explosive encounter with my beautiful coach — and her enjoyment of our naked dance was obvious — and Megan — whose desire for my body was not hidden, but she deliberately suppressed it nonetheless for her pride — but didn’t feel the same type of control. </p><p>No, there was something different with the situation, one that I needed to experiment with a little more. My hand slipped a bit more, cupping her ass … her desire for more intensified immediately, something I could read easily. </p><p>“Oh, I see that the gossip about you dumping that whore Megan is not wrong,” she whispered throatily, showing once again just how fast Megan had been working. I doubted that she claimed she had been dumped, but the cheerleader in front of me clearly wanted to use that opportunity to deliver a small dig. </p><p>That, I didn’t care much. I was more interested in the flicker of Lust I could feel in her. I had expected it to get more intense as I responded to her flirting, especially since I could see just how much she appreciated it. Her desire was clear. </p><p>Yet, the flicker I could feel got dimmer rather than getting stronger. </p><p>Curious, I leaned forward, and she reached to meet the kiss, enthusiastic, but the moment our lips touched, the special flicker of Lust I could feel from her disappeared. Interesting, I thought as my tongue invaded her mouth. </p><p>Only to be interrupted by an angry cry. “Miriam! What’s going on!” shouted a voice. I turned, only to see a tall figure rushing toward me. And, when I said tall, I meant it.  He was around six-seven, muscular, and from the speed he rushed forward, quite fast. </p><p>Miriam took a panicked speed back. “Hello, sweetie,” she said, with very little panic in her tone. “Terry was just asking me how to get into the gym, but I said it’s only for the basketball players.” </p><p>The boy calmed down as the girl whose name I finally learned obfuscated the satiation. “That’s good, sweetie,” he said, his anger toward her disappearing, showing he wasn’t exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer. </p><p>Anger was back on his face as he positioned his body between me and his girlfriend, and he poked me in the chest. “If I see you near my girl…” he started.</p><p>I could have easily solved the problem, either by confirming her story or slamming him to the ground … but feeling the flicker of Lust alive in her once more, I decided to do neither. Why bother missing such a great opportunity.</p><p>“A good threat, but how about we solve it in the basketball field, winner takes her,” I declared, curious whether it was just an unmet desire. Yet, that seemed not to be the case, as I felt the flicker in her go off once more even if her face contorted with pride and desire. </p><p>“That’s absurd—“ he started. </p><p>“If you’re afraid to play basketball against a football player?” I commented.</p><p>“I’m not afraid,” he immediately responded. “Deal!” Then, it clicked with him. “Honey, I’m sorry, I know that—“ he started. </p><p>Miriam met his gaze with a smile. “Oh, sweetie, don’t worry about it. I love your passion to fight for me, just demolish him,” she whispered, but didn’t neglect to wink at me, clearly happy that a duel would be fought for her. Then, she dragged his boyfriend away before it turned into a fistfight, leaving me back. </p><p>Her hips dancing far too aggressively not to be a show for me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“What’s the difference,” I murmured dazedly as I dropped a bill on the table and left the cafe, wanting to drive away. I didn’t want to be in a public location if the situation developed dangerously. </p><p>I drove for ten minutes, as fast as I could manage without getting a speeding ticket, and soon, I parked into a desolate emptiness. I closed my eyes and focused on my internal world, trying to understand what was the difference that was tickling me at the intent flow. </p><p>It was a subtle difference, the kind that I would never even notice if I didn’t have my most recent improvement… Even now, it was more of a feeling than anything else. Soon, I realized the difference. The Intent flow was a mixture of two different directions. One was just directly targeting me, flowing in the same usual pattern, which I was used to. </p><p>The second was more interesting. It came from a distance … like it was flowing toward a different target first before bouncing off from there and pulling toward me. I tried to follow the direction, but it soon faded. </p><p>I might have had trouble understanding what was going on, but the timing was too accurate to be related to anything but my most recent achievement of creating a scandal. A scandal that was already picking some national renown as some of the national news picked it. </p><p>Very fascinating, I thought as I realized what was going on, the possibilities significant enough to make me giddy. </p><p>I didn’t care much about the amount of intent I had been getting from it. It was even less than the little scraps I had been collecting from the chess tournament when I had first received the System. </p><p>I was excited by the method I was collecting it. </p><p>The Cloaked Hero. </p><p>A made-up hacker name that had no link to me, and couldn’t be traced to a different source … yet somehow, it still provided Intent for me. “Fascinating,” I thought as I started going through the other videos, and posted a few more — once again through bots that couldn’t be traced back to me. </p><p>It showed several more prominent people from the city, this time including Coach Spencer, intensifying the scandal. With the scale growing, some bigger news agencies soon picked up the news … and the Intent flow got several times higher. </p><p>Still negligible compared to the other sources, but only because the majority was dispersing at a distance. Wasting that was a little frustrating, but. I ignored that loss quickly, focusing on the possibilities. I had always thought that Intent was linked tightly to my identity. </p><p>And, my latest discovery revealed a completely different path for me. Of course, I needed to discover a way to somehow pull more than a fraction of the generation … but still, the possibility itself was enough to add a completely new layer of challenge… </p><p>Truly fascinating. </p><p>Of course, that meant a lot of work, not only to create a legend that allowed others to focus on, but also finding ways to focus on it. </p><p>But maybe, repairing the System would help. </p><p>[Intent Pool: 8.7%]</p><p>I turned my attention toward my pool of Intent, wondering if I could trigger the Repair process the second time. But, while I tried to repeat the process several times, it didn’t work as I intended. Stubbornly, I tried again, but this time, I received a warning. </p><p>Not as a notification, but more of a feeling, hard to describe and illusory. It told me that, if I tried to repair the System again, it’ll take much longer. Something that I had no intention of repeating, not when considering even an accidental discovery of a Totem Animal function gave me such an incredible benefit.  </p><p>Using the previous example as Benchmark, while I would be able to use the previous functions, I would lose the ability to acquire new abilities, which was not exactly preferable. </p><p>I wanted to explore Acolyte and Domains functions in depth before triggering the Repair and putting the System back to its sleeping state. I hoped that they would be able to help me generate more Intent one way or another. </p><p>And even if they didn’t work as well as I hoped, I would still wait until Megan’s business plan started. I wanted to see if being a model would give me some extra benefit in terms of Intent generation, so that even without any possible advantages from Acolytes and Domains, the repair would take much less. </p><p>“A decision for the future,” I murmured, shrugging as I walked to my car. With the nature of the mysterious Intent flow solved, I didn’t need to stay here for more. </p><p>Instead, I decided to handle what Coach Juana asked of me, and visit the other teams. Maybe I could find a way to generate more intent. </p><p>I wanted to see if the other sports could generate some more Intent. Before starting to drive, I sent a quick message to Megan, to check if it would work for her plans. Normally, I wouldn’t have bothered, at least not if she hadn’t used one of the favors I owed her,  but the fifteen percent cut I would receive from the success of the enterprise made kindness much easier to display.   </p><p>Earth didn’t just orbit around the sun, but also around the benefits. </p><p>Megan’s response came almost instantly, calling me. “Tell me, are you going to create another commotion?” she asked, not even bothering to ask for a greeting. </p><p>“Me, a commotion?” I answered, acting like I had been insulted greatly. </p><p>Megan chuckled at the other end. “Yes, I can’t imagine why I suddenly have that impression. You’re a man of humility and perseverance. Like a monk. I can’t even imagine you raising your voice.”  </p><p>“As long as you understand it,” I responded, then continued seriously. “You don’t mind if I go around a bit, right?” </p><p>“Depends.” </p><p>“On what?”  </p><p>“Whether you can actually make an impact or be defeated. You might not know just how exaggerated your reputation became. I’m sure the players would challenge you to a game while making their friends stream it…” </p><p>“And, considering my general reputation among the coaching staff, I doubt the coaches would do anything to intervene,,” I completed. </p><p>“Exactly, so don’t go and ruin my marketing campaign if you’re not confident.” </p><p>“What if I’m confident,” I countered. </p><p>Megan paused. “Are you serious?” she asked, her voice sharp. I just chuckled. “Then, wait half an hour, and I’ll ask Kim to visit you. She’ll make sure to get a better recording of the show, and bring some samples. Make sure to wear them while playing. It’ll help a lot for the campaign.” </p><p>“So, we’re launching faster than you first predicted,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Megan said, her voice cheerful. “The scandal couldn’t have happened at a better time. Normally, even under the best of circumstances, it would have taken a couple weeks for me to get into the production schedule, but the scandal made Marl’s company cancel their production orders immediately, leaving the workshop in a lurch. They are willing to give me a deep discount as long as I start the production today.” </p><p>“Excellent news,” I answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“One more thing,” Megan added, sounding hesitant. “We have to break up.” </p><p>“Oh, already discarding your poor boy toy,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>Megan chuckled as well, responding to my jovial tone. “Exactly,” she said. </p><p>“As long as you don’t get a boyfriend for a month or so, it’s alright,” I said. Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have cared that much considering ours had been a deal of convenience in the first place, but my reputation for virility was an official part of my System, and I didn’t want to deal with some gossip about not being enough. “I have a reputation to maintain, after all,” I added.  </p><p>“No worries,” Megan answered. “I can’t be dealing with rumors of a reputation now that I’m going to change my outlook to a serious businesswoman. I’ll even make sure that everyone knows the only reason I broke up with you because it’s not appropriate to date while we work together.” </p><p>“Therefore distinguishing further yourself from the current scandal, maybe even turn that into your own marketing, smart,” I said. </p><p>“It’s good that you know,” Megan said smugly, ending the call, clearly happy with the way her business ambitions were developing. </p><p>I was as well. At this point, breaking up with Megan was better for me. Not that it stopped me when it came to having fun … but it had limited my actions seriously when it came to making some public spectacles. And, those, I needed to test Lust Domain further. </p><p>Still, the progress was fun… Especially since that progress came with some significant earning potential.  </p><p>I wished that I could take full credit for the smooth development, but it was just vindictive revenge against a man who tried to insult me by trying to tow my car … the rest was just a beautiful coincidence. </p><p>As I drove back, I felt a flicker in the backseat. I checked the mirror, only to see my tortoise pet looking at me. “Are you bored?” I asked, ignoring the ridiculous feeling coming from talking to an animal. Considering he nodded seriously,  it was not a particularly big misunderstanding. </p><p>“Good, come watch me play some ball, then,” I asked. He made a subtle movement, one that was hard to decipher, but from the feeling it gave, it felt like the tortoise equivalent of a shrug. I looked at him, then paused. “I didn’t give you a name yet, did I?” I said. “Do you want one?” </p><p>He nodded. </p><p>“Excellent, how about Death, Destroyer of the Worlds,” I said, and exploded in laughter. The sight of a tortoise in the back seat, giving me a deadpan stare was too amusing. “How about George?” I followed. Negative. “Mike?” Negative. “Rex?”</p><p>This time, I received a frustrated glare as he leaned forward, put his front leg on one of my books, and flickered. I saw him outside of the car before he blinked back, but the book ended up discarded. A strong protest. </p><p>“Okay, no dog names,” I said, raising one hand in surrender. Then, I looked at him, and noticed a detail. His shell had darkened considerably since yesterday. “How about Mr. Black?” I asked.  </p><p>This time, he paused a bit before nodding. He found the name satisfactory. A beast of simple tastes… </p><p>And, just like that, a notification popped into my sight. </p><p>[Totem Animals, category updated. (Black Tortoise [1])]</p><p>Interesting, I thought. It felt like a significant change, one that needed to be analyzed more.  </p><p>I added it to my ever-growing mental list of tasks to be done… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As Janet took sight of his monster, any attempt to argue against his words died. Especially since she could feel her wetness dripping down… </p><p>\"I think you have had your fair share of foreplay,\" Darion said with his usual sharp tone that made Janet shiver helplessly even when she wasn’t naked and crouching down in front of him. “Now, show your appreciation.” </p><p>Even now, she was shocked by his size … but unlike the previous time, she was not intimidated. She knew she could handle it. She just needed to work hard. </p><p>She opened her mouth as far as she could as she leaned forward, once again filling her mouth with his presence. Even halfway in, his presence was threatening and suffocating … yet amazing at the same time. She went back and forth a few times to get used to his presence … but before she could complete her job, he grasped her shoulders and twirled her. “Let me help,” he growled. </p><p>She might have complained about the rough treatment, but a moan was the only voice she could make at the moment, but also, considering she enjoyed it greatly, there was nothing to complain about. </p><p>Darion let out a loud groan at the same time her head started to slide up and down between his legs, adding more to his pleasure. </p><p>She couldn’t help but feel amazement at the moment as their newest employee treated her as a toy even as she worked to handle his size. “Try not to gag that much,” he ordered. Janet wished that she could insult him back, but that was not possible. </p><p>Not when she was busy enthusiastically gobbling his monster fully into her throat.</p><p>\"Admittedly, you look cuter with something in your mouth,\" he added, treating her even worse … and she loved it. “But that’s enough.” </p><p>For a moment, Janet felt a hint of fear, afraid that he would stop and leave her, just as she was reaching a dangerous level of arousal. She prepared herself to beg, but that turned out to be unnecessary when his fingers wrapped around her throat, lifting her up. </p><p>His rough treatment told her that she wasn’t the only impatient one, which made her even more excited. “Someone is impatient—“ she started, trying to tease him, but her attempt died halfway. </p><p>Considering it was the sudden invasion into her core that silenced her with a moan, she wasn’t exactly complaining. </p><p>She just moaned, hoping that no one was near the bathroom at this hour. She certainly didn’t that that whore Sakura around, and not because she was afraid of her trying to tell this to Mia. No, she was too spineless to contemplate that. </p><p>Janet certainly didn’t like that smug bitch enough to share her reward, but she was also aware that she couldn’t stop Darion from targeting her once he truly noticed how easy to play with her. </p><p>Luckily, they had just met once, and as long as Janet kept them away, it wouldn’t be an issue. </p><p>All those thoughts happened in a corner of her mind, the majority of her attention was lost in the way his hips began to thrust up as it repeatedly slid between her legs, widening her core. “A good start, right,” he said, and before she could even answer, she found herself lifted into the air. </p><p>And, just like that, his hips turned into a merciless invasion, slamming again and again as he started to walk, treating her weight like nothing. </p><p>“Y-yes!” she shouted, unable to modulate her voice as he moved even faster. </p><p>After a few moments of vigorous pace, they were in front of the convenient seating area of the luxurious bathroom. She thought she could get a moment to rest as they found a new position … but that turned out to be a pipe dream when he tightened his grip on her hips as he sat down, not even skipping a beat. </p><p>“Enough foreplay, whore. It's time we do it for real,\" he grinned. “This time, we don’t have a sexy Asian to hide from!” </p><p>Janet wanted to argue about several points in that statement. She wanted to argue against calling it one of the most reckless impalings she had received as foreplay. She wanted to argue against calling that pretentious Asian slut sexy. She wanted to argue against the need to be hidden from her…</p><p>Ironically, being called a whore was not one of the things she wanted to argue against. Not at this moment, not the way she was dressed…  </p><p>Unfortunately, all of it was academic, as he was busy making her jump on his lap, each move making her let out another cry of pleasure, impossible to get in a word into the mix. </p><p>“Faster, bitch,” he said, but before he could even finish, he slipped his hands under her hips, showing he wanted to take control of her movements. Anyone else would have failed to add any power from that angle … but his muscles made that very easy. </p><p>He guided her over and over, her heartbeat going crazy along with the pleasure. </p><p>“P-please,” Janet found herself whispering, though whether she wanted him to stop … or get faster, even she didn’t know. The pleasure was simply too intense. </p><p>“You want to change things,” he chuckled. Before she could even decide on an answer, he flipped her, and she ended up on her back, her legs locked in a tight position, his weight stretching her flexibility to the limit. </p><p>“Wow, impressive,” he commented, but that didn’t stop his movements as his hips moved even faster, slamming again and again. It felt like a dream, but her legs parted open, allowing his invasion despite his impressive weight. </p><p>Janet lost her sense of self as he moved back and forth, each moment stealing more of her mind, making her moan even more. </p><p>But, she knew one thing. </p><p>Her fashion choice today was certainly not wasted.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the end, information was more precious than trying to maximize my safety, I decided as I pulled back, pulling shadows around myself even as I created a magical copy of myself. Even as I cast that, I felt a strong drain in my magical reserves, costing me a precious chunk of it. </p><p>No living person would have been surprised by that trick considering my copy was blue and glowing while I was slowly being wrapped by the shadows, but magical constructs didn’t see the world the same way. </p><p>Without intelligence behind the golem, it saw the glowing silhouette as the bigger threat due to the constant magic that was radiating off it, like it was about to launch a dangerous spell. Of course, it was just the mana leaking off its structure that I had pumped earlier. </p><p>There was a good reason that spell cost a scary amount of mana to pull successfully. </p><p>I faded into the shadows while the silhouette dodged the attacks of the golem several times. Impressively, it managed to deliver a hit despite the silhouette moving much faster than I could…</p><p>It was not a joke. I was right to wait for the other intruders. </p><p>The statue pulled back its earlier waiting place, unable to find me as I was lost in the shadows. I looked around — which was the full range of movement I allowed myself to have while waiting for the other newcomers. </p><p>Admittedly, I didn’t expect a great performance from them against the golem considering the performance it had already displayed, but I wasn’t particularly altruistic, especially since I had absolutely no responsibility for their presence. </p><p>A groan reached my ears before their footsteps. “Don’t tell me we’re going to deal with that creepy statue once again. That thing scares me,” someone said. It was a male voice, and it was pointlessly loud. </p><p>“Yes, that’s the job you’re being paid for, just stay silent and deal with the mana shadows,” another voice, an older man, called. </p><p>“Enough, Alfruce,” cut another voice, a young woman this time. “He’s the one that keeps us safe. The least you can do is to be respectful.” </p><p>“I’m sorry, mistress,” the old man answered. “I just don’t want him to disrespect you.” </p><p>“I understand, but this place is dangerous enough without angering our bodyguard,” she said. “I’m sorry, Gorbtro. Alfruce means well, don’t take it to heart.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, the gold you’re paying me for this is enough to buy a lot of forgiveness,” the young male answered, and the old man sniffed pointedly. “Like that disgusted expression,” he followed. </p><p>Curious, I thought as I listened to them. From everything I had seen upstairs, I was confident that their group was much larger. Which meant, there was something tricky was going on. Maybe they stumbled to it coincidentally as well, but I doubted it. </p><p>I did nothing as I listened to them getting closer, and soon, three people appeared. A young man, wearing leather armor and carrying a hammer. His hammer was not ordinary, dispersing mana shadows easily as he swung his hammer. </p><p>The old man contrasted the way he was dressed with some kind of noble servant outfit. I didn’t recognize the house he belonged to, so he was either from a minor house or a merchant house posing to be superior. </p><p>Then, a few seconds later, the third one of their group walked in. A young woman, dressed in leather, one that I would have called thin if it wasn’t for her curves just in the right places. Despite wearing leather and boots, she somehow managed to look like she belonged to a high party, walking with an incredible balance. Still, I was fascinated more by her jet-black hair. Almost supernaturally black. </p><p>The young warrior growled lowly. “Let’s go and deal with that big, ugly statue. I won’t want to be almost skewered again.\" He looked around in discomfort. “It won’t ambush us again, right?” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it’s not the first time I’m exploring those ruins,” she answered. “Their traps always reset the same way.” </p><p>With that, she moved forward, carrying some kind of glowing rune. I could feel magic spreading it, and soon it reached where the golem was located. </p><p>A wave of magic spread from the golem in response, one that was much subtler than their initial spell. It was subtle enough that the young ones didn’t react … but the old man twitched just a bit. </p><p>Which was all I needed to confirm that he wasn’t as simple as he looked. The spread of magic was spread enough that only an accomplished mage would catch it. And, accomplished mages — especially the ones that I would refer to as such — were not exactly easy to find. </p><p>Certainly not enough to coincidentally find as a servant of a manor house — or even less likely, a merchant house — which made me feel far tenser than I had been feeling earlier. </p><p>Not exactly because I couldn’t deal with him … but combined with the mysterious location, the situation was much more doubtful than I would have assumed otherwise. I might have turned and left at that moment, but two things stopped me. First, the inclusion of a competent mage in this situation risked destabilizing the Empire sooner than I expected — the irony being me working hard to protect it — and the second was …</p><p>The response from the golem’s spell. Unlike what I first expected, the magic didn’t focus on the rune she was holding, but on her directly. </p><p>“Stay in place and don’t move,” she ordered, her tone archaic as she declared that. But, from the tight manner she was holding the stone, she was clearly unaware it was her that was responsible for stopping the golem, and not the stone she carried. </p><p>“We can move,” she said, and started walking, unaware that she had picked another follower. </p><p>I followed them carefully, not daring to let them go forward too much. Clearly, her identity had some kind of significance for this place, and I didn’t want to risk deciphering the wards they unlocked easily. </p><p>I followed, watching as the old man walk in front of her, letting the warrior take the point. Convenient, as the more they moved forward, the more mana shadows they had to deal with, the mindless entities rushing forward. </p><p>“How the hell there’s this many mana shadows already,” the young man protested. “We cleansed them just a week ago.” </p><p>“There are just shadows, ignore them, unless you’re too cowardly to deal with them,” the old man called, ignoring the perfectly valid concerns of the young man in question. Worse, he was deliberately goading him further and calling him a coward in front of a sexy woman that he was clearly crushed on. </p><p>As a skilled mage, there was no chance he didn’t understand the risks of the increasing density of the mana shadows. Yet, he stayed silent as the young woman easily disarmed five more golems, the last two together. </p><p>Too scary to fight, but their scariness only made me more determined to go forward. The risk was getting more intense … but so was the opportunity, and I certainly needed something to swing things to my benefit. </p><p>“That’s the gate we got stuck the last time, use the other rune,” the old man suggested, and the young woman pulled a brush and started drawing something on the door. </p><p>I had to admit. I admired the hustle of the old man. The brush she was using was interesting, combining a small cutting spell and a healing spell, drawing blood from her before she could notice, and letting it mix with the ink. </p><p>“I still think that it’s risky…” the young man commented. </p><p>“Maybe he’s right,” the girl started. “What if the mana shadows are coming from inside.” </p><p>“I don’t know. If you think so, mistress,” the old man answered, outwardly reflective, but before they could answer, he cast a subtle spell … and, at a distance, I felt a small ward collapsing, and a small horde of mana shadows rushed toward their location. “There are too many of them, quick,” the old man shouted, and the young man positioned himself between the sudden attack and the other two… </p><p>The girl quickly finished drawing the rune … and just as the door started to open, the old man started gathering his magic…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t say anything as Megan declared her lifelong ambition, instead watching her. She looked determined at first, but as I didn’t answer, I could see her expression flicker with a rare lack of confidence. It was clearly something that was important to her, and I doubted she even let many people know. </p><p>I could see that, if it wasn’t for a combination of factors, which included our weird yet close relationship, her actual need for assistance around my fame, and the intense guilt she was feeling for almost putting me into a very problematic situation, she would have avoided revealing it. </p><p>But, she did, and my lack of reaction was making her self-conscious. Of course, with the way she handled it, it didn’t take long for her to assume I was acting dismissive of her dreams, treating her like a bimbo airhead that didn’t understand what she had just told me, and acted as if she could never be successful in that dream. </p><p>Of course, those emotions flashed on her face rapidly, and without my most recent improvement, I would have missed most of them. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said, just as she was tensing to stand up. “I’m guessing you already have a business plan.” </p><p>“Of course,” she growled as she looked at me. “Who do you think am I, a hack?” Though, as much as she tried to sound angry, she couldn’t hide the relief in her tone. The fact that I didn’t laugh at her but actually took her seriously made her relieved. </p><p>“Do you mind if I look at it?” I asked. </p><p>“If you think you can understand it,” she answered bitingly, but she still pulled a tablet from her bag and passed it to me. A spreadsheet was already open. Curious, I started going through its complicated sheets, most of the details going over my head as I lacked the necessary business knowledge. </p><p>Still, I could see a master plan, one that covered the next ten years and factored in more than a dozen businesses, some predictable like fashion, some surprising, like technology. Each industry had hundreds of different possibilities, entrance points, and segments that could be synergized with each other. </p><p>Far more ambitious than I had ever expected. </p><p>What an interesting girl, I thought with a chuckle, realizing that we had even more in common. Even before I had the fortune — or misfortune, as the jury was still out about the ultimate impact — of receiving the system, I had a plan, and I was doing my best to work for that. </p><p>Hers was more ambitious than mine, clearly. Mine was more about graduating without debts and getting a decent job, but that was more about our starting points in life than anything else. </p><p>And, with the System helping me, I was already updating my future plans. Those plans were very nebulous, reliant on the future capabilities of the System as well as the enemies it would bring…</p><p>But I could see the advantages of having some pull in the more ordinary world of business. I had already thought about that, but discarded it. The business was a complicated world, one that required more attention than I could afford to give… </p><p>And, except for rare situations, didn’t bring fame. And even in the rare cases it did, it was hardly the intense, explosive attention that the System clearly and desperately needed. </p><p>But, an alliance, on the other hand… </p><p>“That’s an ambitious plan,” I murmured as I went over it, taking note of her plans. “There are some fascinating ideas here. I’m guessing the idea was to ally with them to launch some kind of fashion line quickly.” </p><p>Megan looked surprised. </p><p>“Why the expression?” I asked. “Don’t tell me you didn’t expect me to understand what I had just read?” Her sheepish expression told me the answer. “You should have realized by now that I’m not just a jock,” I answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“The jury is still out,” she answered, and I chuckled at her expression before going back to the technical details of the issue.</p><p>“So, what are your plans for the fashion industry next?” I asked. </p><p>Just like that, the frown on her face reappeared. “It’s a tough call,” she answered. “I probably have to abandon those.” </p><p>“Why?” I asked. “I know they are a big producer, but they are hardly the only one even in our city.” </p><p>“It’s hard to be taken seriously by the local workshops without the support of an established player. And while there are other companies, none of the local companies will work with me with them blocking it.” </p><p>To her credit, she was aware that her own actions were the thing that forced me to confront Coach Spencer and didn’t try to blame me, even indirectly. </p><p>“What about the suppliers from the other cities, or the international ones? Can’t you make a deal with them? I remember your initial business plan was like that.” </p><p>“No, it wouldn’t work,” she answered. “I need a global team to arrange that, people to oversee production, work with customs, arrange warehousing… Not to mention, the delivery would take months, forcing me to lock my cash flow there. The risk profile is simply too complicated.” </p><p>“I understand,” I answered, looking thoughtful. “Pity, it seems that it doesn’t look like it will be successful unless they experience a big misfortune,” I said. I was tempted to launch the video immediately, as the timing would have been fascinating, but it would have been too suspicious. </p><p>I liked Megan. She and I were very similar. But it was the exact reason I didn’t trust her. Not in a criminal matter. </p><p>Instead, I decided to create an excuse. “By the way, I remember them talking about a reporter.” </p><p>“Yes. They had mentioned one from a national magazine had an arrangement. Having a short interview with her was a part of the deal as well…” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said as I reached my Intent, letting my voice have a convincing, hypnotic quality. “Still, I think it’s suspicious. Why should someone from a national magazine bother coming to our little corner? It’s not like they are important enough to earn that.” </p><p>“Favors, bribery, corruption? Have your pick,” Megan answered, not particularly interested now that her opportunity was lost. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said. “But there’s some suspicious stuff going on. I had already seen a member of their team walking around the office.” </p><p>“Really?” Megan said, intrigued. “Marl was complaining that they were late.” </p><p>“That’s the interesting part,” I answered. “He was at the reception at the same time as me, but he didn’t mention his correct name. I noticed his entrance card in his wallet, and he made sure the receptionist didn’t see it as well?” </p><p>“Maybe they sent someone to dig some dirt,” Megan said, enthusiastic and joking, but I could see that my tone already made an impression on her. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>“By the way, if you’re interested, I would be interested in cooperating more intensely on business matters,” I said. </p><p>“Really, what do you have in mind?” </p><p>“I could be the face of your male fashion line once you manage to launch it. I’m sure you can twist my identity as both a player and a coach to something fascinating.” </p><p>“Wouldn’t work. You can’t play anymore due to a health report,” she cut in. </p><p>“Already solved,” I said, and her eyes widened. “Meaning, I would be interested in that … for a decent amount of share, of course,” I added. </p><p>“Shares, that’s ambitious,” Megan answered, her expression immediately serious.</p><p>“Fifteen percent as a silent partner, take it or leave it,” I answered. It was not the maximum I could ask, but I didn’t try to maximize it. Some immediate cash flow, and the excuse to start making some moves was all I needed at the moment. </p><p>“As long as it’s just the fashion line and not the whole business, acceptable,” Megan said. </p><p>“Others, we can discuss separately as long as you need my cooperation,” I answered. “Pity we can’t launch it immediately.” </p><p>“Yeah, a pity,” Megan answered sadly. I let the discussion fade into the less important topics while I continued to drink my coffee. </p><p>Then, I finally noticed a news van pulling into the parking lot, giving me the timing I needed. Everyone would blame the magazine for arranging the hack and timing their arrival … but I hardly cared. More importantly, I had a feeling that, their bosses wouldn’t care much either. </p><p>With a smirk, I pressed a button on my phone, one that triggered the script I had set earlier … flooding the web with the news. </p><p>Megan ignored the first buzzing of her phone, but as it continued, she checked it, her eyes widening as she read it. “Holy hell, you were right!” she gasped as she showed her phone to me. “They actually had a plan.” </p><p>“I told you so,” I said, happy that she completely ignored the possibility that I had something to do with it. To her credit, it was really absurd to think I somehow arranged it in a few minutes I had been on the premises … but with my most recent improvements, I was that good. </p><p>She continued to watch the video, then her eyes widened. “It looks like we’ll have that cooperation after all,” she gasped as she stood up, already running. “I have a lot of things to handle, keep your schedule open,” she ordered. </p><p>I chuckled as I watched her dash away, happy about the change. But, that smile disappeared a moment later, when I felt a distinct stirring of Intent flow. Something was different…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was amused that the day after my great victory, I was being targeted once more. Admittedly, going down to give that little spoiled man a beatdown was tempting, but even with my growing reputation, I had no doubt that it would end up with me being arrested and fired.</p><p>Luckily, there were more ways to humiliate people than a direct confrontation. </p><p>And, what better way to do that than to use their own tools to achieve that. The studio already had many cameras, and the asshole friend of Coach Spencer looked just stupid enough to actually record things that had been going on in his studio. </p><p>I moved forward immediately. Not because I was feeling impatient, but because the security cameras in the corridor were placed horribly, allowing me to easily weave through them. I followed the cables, expecting to find a little juncture box that connected the cameras to the main security system. It would be challenging to hack through that connection, but not impossible. </p><p>Instead, I found a nice surprise. A door, hidden behind a secure keypad, the distinct sound of a server coming from inside. </p><p>And, a little telekinetic push was enough to open the door by pushing the hatch from inside. No lengthy lock-picking was necessary. </p><p>And, I found myself in the security room. There were only a dozen screens, which was not enough to observe a company of this size. It didn’t take long for me to realize the reason. It was just to handle the cameras of the studio, separate from the rest of the building. </p><p>I put on gloves not to leave fingerprints, then pulled the chair, ready to browse the recordings, ready to use several password crackers to see if I could break in … only to realize there was no password. “Weird,” I murmured. </p><p>Then, I glanced around, realizing that the room had too many expensive knick-knacks to belong to a security guard. He probably didn’t allow anyone but himself to enter, thinking that a locked door was enough to provide security. </p><p>With a smirk, I had gone through the hard disk, my eyes widening as I took the recordings. Not only it had recordings of the owner and several friends having a good time with the models, but also had many hidden camera shoots. </p><p>There were even several recordings where he was explicitly blackmailing the models. </p><p>“A moron and a criminal,” I murmured. Either of them was bad enough, but combined, it was devastatingly horrible. </p><p>“Amazing,” I murmured even as I watched Marl return, unable to hide his fury as he rushed back to his office, ignoring Megan while he started shouting at someone on the phone. I used the opportunity to play around a bit more even as I copied every single thing I had found in his hard disk. </p><p>“Maybe you’re even more stupid than I realized,” I murmured as I realized he actually kept the company account open. </p><p>“Why not turn it into a criminal crisis,” I murmured as I started poking around a bit. I used his authorization to transfer a great amount of money outside, using some dubious financial practices, and purchased a lot of dubious digital assets, then sent them into some newly created accounts. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had no chance to actually recover those funds — as any digital financial transition was extremely easy to track regardless of the situation — but I didn’t care much about that. Just sending them out, while framing them as payments to unknown parties, would add some financial crimes to his situation. </p><p>I might have felt bad to frame an innocent person, but he was a criminal. I was just adding a few that even his dear daddy would have trouble saving Marl from.</p><p>I was tempted to push for more, but I was afraid to leave stronger evidence. Instead, I installed one last trojan, one that I could continue to use the cameras without visiting again, and made one last check to make sure there was no evidence of my presence. </p><p>There was no chance the trojan wouldn’t be discovered once the police got involved, but that was intentional on my part. With the Trojan there, the police would have a reason to believe the system was hacked, and would have no reason to search for a break-in. </p><p>Then, sneaked out, leaving Megan behind — though not as helpless as that statement implied as I continued to watch the security cameras, and could easily intervene. </p><p>Until I decided otherwise, Megan was one of my girls, and I didn’t abandon mine.</p><p>Since my car was still in the parking lot, I couldn’t just sneak out. Instead, I used a window to sneak into the bathroom, and left. The receptionist was there, listening as someone shouted at him. </p><p>I waved to the people, not bothering to hide my laughter as I left, making sure people remembered me exiting the bathroom. Then, I took my car, and drove to a nearby cafe, one that could see the entrance, waiting for Megan to leave. </p><p>I was wearing a cap to avoid people noticing me. </p><p>As I waited, I leaned back on my chair, and a smirk on my face as I uploaded the first video after some editing. I didn’t bother much, just making sure that there was no identifying information about poor models that were trying to make a living — as they were not the ones that were trying to ruin my life —  and instead chose one that displayed Marl together with a few of his friends. </p><p>Spencer was not included, just to make sure. As much as I wanted to ruin his life as well, our beef was well-known, and his presence in the first video would be suspicious. </p><p>Instead, I decided to create a hacker persona. ’Laws can’t touch the strong,’ I added as an opening, then added a signature.</p><p>The Cloaked Hero. </p><p>I chuckled even as I created a new hacker persona, the kind that would be created by a thirteen-year-old little kid — another distraction. </p><p>My tech abilities were helpful to turn that into an immediate scandal. A hundred bots — the ones that I hadn’t used to boost my own social media presence — were ready to upload the video on different platforms, blasting without restriction. </p><p>However, I was waiting for one last detail. Before that, however, Megan called. “Where are you?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m here at a nearby cafe,” I said, and sent her the location. </p><p>“Why?” she asked. </p><p>“Because the receptionist made a point of not letting me in,” I said. “Did you know that the owner was a friend of Coach Spencer,” I asked, deliberately sounding angry. I had already checked and knew she was unaware of the important details, but it was a good lesson for her.</p><p>Due diligence was important. </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered. “But I can explain.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I ended the call, giving the impression that I was furious, having no problems making her sweat a little. And, maybe, I could finally make her talk a bit about her weirdly professional strategy to manage her image.   </p><p>As I waited for her to arrive, I played with the upload a bit, setting a few layers between me and the bots to make sure it couldn’t be traced back to me. </p><p>Then, before I triggered it, Megan arrived, wearing tasteful jeans and blouse combo, her beautiful face contorted with an unusual display of shame. </p><p>She said nothing until she sat next to me, her arm already around my waist. “I’m sorry,” she whispered. </p><p>“Sorry for what,” I said, but this time, I didn’t bother faking anger. The ride was enough as punishment. Her gaze widened as it clicked I was faking my earlier anger, but she didn’t say anything.  </p><p>After all, even if my anger was fake, her mistake was clear. </p><p>“Sorry for jumping to an offer without doing a background check. The offer was too good, and I thought …” </p><p>“You thought they were trying to latch onto my recent fame, and that explained their sudden hurry and their amazing offer.” She nodded, a rare genuine blush covering her face. “What exactly they offered you to make you feel this anxious. Normally, you are much more careful.” </p><p>“It’s your fault,” she murmured with a pouty tone. “I had a very good plan. Two more years until graduation, while I did my best to slowly play up my fame, every step calculated.” </p><p>“Then what?” I asked, curious. “Don’t tell me you want to be an actor or model?” </p><p>Megan let out a derisive laugh. “Of course not, I know I don’t have the talent or the passion to be a top-tier actress, and no one else has any power in the industry. Models are even worse. I might as well be an escort. It’s the same thing,” Megan mentioned dismissively. </p><p>Admittedly, knowing what I had just pilfered from the archives just minutes ago, she wasn’t entirely wrong. “And, what do you want to do? Why bother for fame?” Even as I said so, I stretched my intent over her, curious if I would sense any flicker of magic in her. She wouldn’t be the first one that used fame for magic in a more literal sense, after all. Arthur was one such example. </p><p>I was another. </p><p>I only relaxed when I felt no hint of magic from her. No need to ruin things. </p><p>“I want to establish my own business empire, of course,” Megan answered, her expression uncharacteristically serious. </p><p>How interesting. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as I gathered my mana to respond to the sudden flood of necrotic mana, I was thanking my luck that I hadn’t converted the Divine Spark I had collected earlier into Stats but left it with the Divine Forest. </p><p>If I hadn’t, I might have been forced to create a shield around the Tree of Life and retreat inside to protect Seldanna and abandon the rest of the plane. </p><p>It sounded absurd,, but the amount of Necrotic mana they were channeling using the tunnel was simply that suffocating, the kind that was counted in hundreds of millions by the measurement of the System. </p><p>Ironically, the only reason it didn’t obliterate everything immediately was the structure of the magical pathway. It was strong enough to survive the stress of the planar border, therefore it was strong enough not to shatter under the great flood of Necrotic mana, limiting their throughput. </p><p>Still, it was enough to be measured in hundreds of thousands for each second, a huge version of the river that I had dealt with when I first arrived. Naturally, the response was the same. I did my best to create a huge ward. It was a crude one, but against an unrolled wave of mana, elegance was not what the ward was supposed to display. </p><p>Resilience was. </p><p>Even though it was simple, the ward had three layers. First, the outermost layer; made from a mixture of Nature Spark and Nature Mana. </p><p>{-500 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>The outermost layer was deliberately weak, not even attempting to block the flow of mana and just letting it flow inside. After all, the only function of it was to hide the second layer from the watchful eyes of the Eternals. </p><p>I had no idea how much detection capability they maintained under the suffocating deluge of Necrotic mana, but better safe than revealing my greatest secret. </p><p>The second layer was made of Tantric mana. Luckily, unlike Divine Spark, Necrotic mana was much less resilient against manipulation of the Divine Spark, especially when it was used like this, without any shape or form of destruction. </p><p>And, my great reserves of Purified Spark allowed me to achieve that very rapidly. </p><p>I had pulled a lot of nature mana from the environment to kickstart the process, the elves around me crying in fear at the sudden draught of mana, their nature too aligned with it not to care about its absence. Busy saving the world, I ignored them as I shaped Tantric mana into a huge sieve, forcing the necrotic mana to pass through its gaps and purifying it in the process. </p><p>Then, the third part, a strong funnel made of Nature mana, connecting the purified flow into the God Forest, taking the purified flow and storing them in the depths of their structure. </p><p>I could have let the purified mana flood the Aether dimension, but that would be harmful in two ways. First, as it flooded the plane, it would give the undead some easy targets to exploit. And it would make the Eternals suspicious, making them question why a Nature God was producing pure mana rather than nature mana. </p><p>Instead, I let the God Forest devour the flood, even going as far as to force their leaves to suddenly turn brown, like they were straining under the great flood of energy. It had an immediate impact on the morale of the elves, especially when combined with the absence of the Nature mana, but I wasn’t in the mood to coddle them. </p><p>Revealing my secret to Eternals would have been much worse for them. Eternals were willing to destroy the plane behind them just to keep their presence a secret. I didn’t want to imagine the lengths they would go to catch me if they realized the true nature of my abilities. </p><p>Even just as a competition for their hunger for Divine Spark, they would target me, and the less said about my true identity and how they would react, the better. </p><p>I stood still, straining myself to the limit as I made sure the ward worked as intended, turning their devastating attack into nourishment for the forest. </p><p>Even as I did so, I couldn’t help but think about what had caused them to respond in such a devastating manner. Maybe they had noticed I had been fiddling with their artifact on this site and decided to prevent me from learning their secrets. </p><p>Maybe they were alerted by my fake god role and decided to retreat, not willing to face a god. </p><p>Or maybe, it was much simpler. They had just realized that the elves stopped arriving, and moved to the next stage of their plan. It wasn’t unlikely, especially since the sudden flood of necrotic mana was hardly something that could be put together at the last second. </p><p>It must have been planned beforehand. </p><p>“And, that answers whether they were just here as an accident or not,” I murmured. I was already suspecting that, but the nature of their response was further evidence that they were the ones leading the undead invasions — though whether the undead invasion force was aware of that fact or they were just unwilling puppets was another question. </p><p>One that didn’t have any important implications in the short term, especially since I was determined to hide my true nature regardless. I couldn’t be sure that the Eternals would stop observing the dimensions after that. </p><p>I was hoping that it would be enough, but soon, I noticed a shift in the pathway. Strong as it was, under the constant rush of necrotic mana, it was shattering slowly. I would have felt relief if I was having trouble handling the rush. </p><p>Unfortunately, the situation was the exact opposite. After the shattering of the pathway, the necrotic mana would spread around the Aether dimension, giving the undead a decisive advantage. And, while I could protect the capital, the same was not true for the rest of the world. </p><p>Luckily, I had some time to respond. I floated upward, opened my hand, and made a show of throwing seeds into the air, which glowed with a blinding green before they spread around four corners of the world. </p><p>It was just a light show, and at the same time, I reached Seldanna. She was still in a dreamlike state, and while our connection was mutating, it was still enough to use her as a conduit, which, in turn, allowed me to reach the Tree of Life. </p><p>And, there, through the roots, I connected with the plane … I wanted to celebrate, and I wanted to hurl in disgust, the sensation of being one with a tree not exactly the sanest of sensations. However, it was not a waste. </p><p>The Tree of Life was a unique entity, one that was connected to not only every living being living in this plane either directly or indirectly. It even linked to the plane itself… Enough for me to use it to give every living being one order. </p><p>It was not something I was trying to pull blindly. I was trying to copy a feat that I had seen in the memories of the unfortunate god that I had slain earlier, a method that he had used many times during his desperate battle to give commands to his forces regardless of distance or loyalty, accompanied by overwhelming compulsion. </p><p>RETURN TO THE CAPITAL!</p><p>It was an order that reverberated through the mana itself, accompanied by a great amount of mana — one that emptied all the mana my God Forest had been storing. The mana radiated across the plane, not only carrying my order around the plane, but also empowering all the trees and other immobile beings to react. </p><p>Some uprooted and turned into treants, dashing toward the capital with great speed. The plants too weak to handle it forced their Divine Sparks into their seeds, seeds that birds flew down and grabbed before they started their migration toward the center. </p><p>Small or large, every being started rushing toward the center. Elves could have rejected that call, their sapience giving them the chance to reject … luckily, they were not stupid enough to do so when every single plant, insect, and beast was desperately rushing toward the center of the plane. </p><p>“Success,” I murmured as I cast a large illusion around me. It was necessary.</p><p> I didn’t want the elves to see their new god collapsing on the ground, puking blood as he struggled to stay conscious. </p><p>Hardly a divine view. </p><p>Trying to pull that trick despite the conflicting nature had been challenging. I realized that, if I tried to pull that off without the Tree of Life as a medium, I would have extinguished my soul. Even under the circumstances, the damage was not inconsiderable. Luckily, the impact was blunted enough that I could feel my soul was still whole. </p><p>A little bruised, maybe, but nothing a little push wouldn’t cure.  </p><p>The same couldn’t be said for my body. </p><p>{- 3200 Pseudo-HP}</p><p>Even as the healing energies rushed into my body, I could feel the structure slowly collapsing. Desperate, I grabbed my Purified Spark, feeding it into my Stats to enhance my Endurance. </p><p>[-3084 Purified Spark}</p><p>{+8 Endurance}</p><p>As my body slowly got stronger, the collapse of my body stopped, and slowly reversed. I wanted to do nothing but lay down and sleep for a day … or a week.

    "content": "<p>“Your little tantrum is over, my sons and daughters, drop your weapons!” I shouted as I started radiating even more mana. Charisma came useful to make that order effective, but not as effective as the sixteen trees still growing despite the presence of the Tree of Life, similar in appearance, already taller than half a mile. </p><p>Growth magic was convenient. </p><p>“It’s just a trick, we can still  —“ one of the commanders started, only for a root to burst out of the ground to skewer him.

Which was good, because if all of them tried to retreat, I could have taken down only a fraction of them. Focusing only on one target made it much easier. </p><p>Not to mention, I didn’t want to kill them, not when they were useful against the undead. </p><p>“Bow down to your god!” I shouted like a megalomaniac, enhancing my voice with Arcane magic — even adding several illusions around me to make me more intimidating. Amusingly, it worked much better than I expected, and they started to fall to their knees. </p><p>“Good, now, you five, lead them to the defense of the capital,” I said, and five roots burst out of the ground once more. They panicked for a second, but the sudden flood of strength was enough to change their attitude. </p><p>“Thank you, my god,” they shouted as their Divine Spark melded into a Divine Sea, turning them into demigods. Then, since I had the connection, I broke the crystals they had in their possession, and pushed that amount into them as well, so each of them had about five hundred Divine Spark. </p><p>I didn’t exactly want them empowered, but I could always take that power back. As long as I kept an eye on them, it should be alright. </p><p>Their sudden empowerment worked better than I expected. I was trying to create some capable commanders that could hold the undead back, but I had forgotten most of them were ready to betray their kind for power — the existence of a god that could grant power made things much simpler. </p><p>“Now, go forth and fight for your land!” I ordered, and all elves knelt. </p><p>A fake god wielding punishment and distributing rewards was very effective, especially to a group that was already dealing with an existential crisis.

That made them freeze, and I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for my earlier display of empowering the five priests — who were still showing off their newfound power — they would have protested a lot. </p><p>Instead, most of them dropped their crystals on the ground, and roots appeared, devouring them.

The others didn’t, and ended up skewered in roots, injured and bereft of their spark — just a flicker left to prevent them from absorbing a new one. </p><p>Giving me another convenient burst of Divine Spark. </p><p>{+1420 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>[+301 Purified Spark}</p><p>“Now that the traitors are dealt with, go and destroy the undead, my sons and daughters,” I  said, raising my hand to pump a wild wave of nature mana, one that destroyed most of the advantage the undead strike force managed to collect. </p><p>They rushed forward, ready to show off to their seemingly omnipotent new god, and I flew above them, unaided,, radiating mana and providing courage. While I flew, however, I cast a spell to bring one of the remaining commanders with the highest rank. </p><p>The commander looked shocked, not by the fact he was flying — which was not impossible, even with nature mana — but by the intensity of mana that wrapped him. It was a wasteful move by me, but intentional as well. </p><p>I wanted them scared. I was too busy to deal with a rebellion. </p><p>“Where’s this portal leading, explain,” I ordered. </p><p>“M-my god,” he stammered. “T-that’s the arrangement of my priest, a tool that’s acquired from a group of mysterious merchants, leading our people into safety.” </p><p>“The same merchants that are buying the crystals,” I asked. </p><p>“Y-yes, my god, but you have to believe me. That was all Prince’s idea, and we tried to argue but he never listened,” he argued, doing his best to cut the connection with it. I didn’t care much either way …  not like I actually planned to rule them in the first place. </p><p>Too much work. </p><p>Instead, I split my attention. Part of it, I kept making sure the counter-attack against the undead didn’t cost any life — knowing that a flawless victory would do wonders to handle it. However, I limited myself to casting a few wide-area spells that would renew the dead zones around the capital to destroy the strategic advantage of the undead. Then, just to be safe, I summoned a few treants and linked them to the God Forest. “Go forth and destroy the undead, my children!” I shouted. “I’ll go and save the citizens from the betrayal of that rotten noble!” </p><p>With that, I turned my attention toward where the last few citizens were still using the portal to leave. Admittedly, while I cared about the fate of the citizens, it was significantly lesser compared to the attraction of the portal itself. </p><p>It was an ingenious production, just the capability enough to allow me to design half a dozen spells on the spot. </p><p>The ability to open semi-stable connections between two points, not just to teleport but also to allow the movement of the others was a very interesting concept. Unfortunately, despite the cursory similarities with teleportation, even a distant glance was enough to show the working principles were completely different. </p><p>Teleport just required shearing of the space barrier to allow a step into the Aether dimension, and using another beacon to navigate toward the other destination, the constantly shifting nature making the destination much shorter. </p><p>However, while that fluid nature made it easy to traverse great distances, it worked reverse on any attempt to build a semi-permanent pathway through it. </p><p>Luckily, while the elves were spoiled and arrogant, they weren’t entirely stupid. The moment I started flying toward the gate, they pulled back and started worshipping — one that already started to yield benefits. </p><p>{+1 Purified Spark}</p><p>Not much, but reminding me that saving them had important implications. I arrived at the artifact that was keeping the gateway open, stretched my mana, and started examining it. The first thing I noticed was … the artifact was a masterpiece, the kind I had to work on for years even to have a hope of copying. It was incredible, elegant … yet recognizable. </p><p>The touch of the skills was unmistakable.  It was heavily reliant on Arcana, but it was not the only thing that it was relying on. I could see the traces of Darkness, Light, Elemental, all carefully separated by the ingenious applications of crafting to prevent a cascading failure. </p><p>Then, after a minute of studying, I realized that it wasn’t even the real artifact. It was just a marker, not unlike my own beacon wards, just more advanced, guiding the pathway to here. The real task of maintaining the pathway was done from the other side. </p><p>And, there was no reason to build something that magnificent, that strong, just to move people in the same plane. It might have been a move of luxury, but while the Eternals could be wasteful, it was not to this degree. </p><p>No, I just needed to stretch my mana inside the gateway to feel the immensity of the distance it was traveling. The other end was not somewhere that was in this plane. For a moment, I wondered if the other end led back to my home. </p><p>If that were the case, I would have found myself in an important dilemma. </p><p>But,, after examining the ephemeral tunnel, I felt that it was not as strong to resist the chaos of the Primordial Aether. Tracing, I felt the other half of the artifact right at the planar border, cutting through the swirling mana shield, uncaring of the long-term damage it was leaving. </p><p>Then, before I could decipher more, I felt the artifact on my side growing chaotic, far too sudden and intense to be accidental. I could feel the different types of mana mixing together, about to explode. </p><p>I infused it with Tantric immediately to calm that mana down, which also ruined the device without any hope of working again — but not only it prevented the explosion, but also it saved the device for further study. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to ignore everything else and study the structure, I wasn’t able to do so. Not when I could already feel the destabilizing tunnel being flooded with Necrotic mana. It was a good way to prevent me from following them. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was very effective. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 3272}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 8000  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 18183}</p><p>Elven Priestess - XXXX}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As Janet walked toward the bathroom, to fix her makeup, she was having conflicting feelings. Her day had passed completely uneventful … too uneventful, which had been shocking. </p><p>That wouldn’t have been a surprise if it wasn’t for their newest janitor, the brute that had manhandled her as she toyed with her the day he had been recruited. In a way, he was the most difficult first-day employee she had to deal with. </p><p>She had a lot of tools to handle a difficult employee, but facing Darion, she found herself reluctant to use most of them … especially since his unruly actions had brought so much pleasure to her. Today, she had come prepared, conveniently hidden under her work uniform, ready to be unleashed … </p><p>Only to fail to find him all day. First, Mia had sent him to escort that annoying little girl, Lily, then, when he returned, Mia suddenly pulled him to an emergency meeting … and before she could check, Mia left early, which was uncharacteristic for her. She wouldn’t care, but Sakura was gone as well. </p><p>And Darion was nowhere to be found, which made her unique thematic preparation wasteful. </p><p>Janet didn’t want to lose her position to that upstart whore. </p><p>Lost in her thoughts, she didn’t expect anyone in the bathroom … certainly not a man. She panicked, covering herself reflexively. </p><p>Then she noticed the unexpected man was not someone she didn’t know … but someone she had been searching for all day. Still, his presence caught her by surprise. “Hi, Darion,” she whispered, trying to sound less scared and more alluring. “You scared me, I didn’t expect you here.” </p><p>“Really, why?” he said, his tone deadpan and his face sharp, but Janet could hear a hint of amusement hidden regardless. </p><p>“It’s the executive bathroom, and Mia only allows important clients to use it.” </p><p>“Oh, fascinating detail,” Darion said. “And, since she’s not allowing the employees to use it, you must be here as entertainment instead.” </p><p>“T-that’s rude,” Janet stammered, but it was less about being insulted, and more about her heartbeat picking up. Especially as his gaze landed on her red stockings, reading her outfit perfectly. </p><p>“Rude doesn’t mean inaccurate,” he said, and Janet shivered. “You’re dressed like a stripper, why don’t you show me how well you can work as one as well.” </p><p>Janet blushed, but that was all the reaction she had. After all, it was what she had been planning when she arrived today … one that delayed significantly as she failed to find him. </p><p>“You want a show…” Janet murmured as she reached to her jacket, unbuttoning it with a flick, one that revealed her breasts, imprisoned behind her favorite bra. She loved the way it worked with her hair color. </p><p>The hungry expression he had as she pushed her chest forward and give him an excellent view of her cleavage — and slightly more thanks to the transparency of her top. Under different circumstances, she would have stayed like that for a long while, teasing him a lot before moving to the fun parts. But two things stopped her. First, Darion didn’t seem like he would appreciate being toyed with…</p><p>More importantly, Janet was burning with arousal already, and didn’t want to take it long. Instead, she slowly spun around an imaginary pole as she got rid of her jacket, aware of just how good she looked. </p><p>Then, her hands landed on her skirt, a pull of the zipper and a shake of her hips were all that was needed to free her from her skirt, revealing her surprise. </p><p>“So, I wasn’t talking hyperbole when I called you a stripper,” Darion said. Janet blushed, but that didn’t prevent her from giving the most alluring pose she could give. She walked forward, aware of just how her long legs were accentuated by her garter belt and her stockings. </p><p>The way he looked at her burned her body with desire. </p><p>Then, she sat on the counter, positioning her arms in a way that highlighted her cleavage even more. “Anything you have in mind, Darion?” she whispered as he stared at her.</p><p>“Tough call, I need to see more,” he said. She shifted in place, giving him an even better angle of her body, enjoying his obvious interest. She hoped to trigger him so he moved, but he seemed to be determined to enjoy the sight without making a move. </p><p>Janet decided to break his will by making a show. “Come on stud,” she whispered as she pushed her bra up, giving him an even better view of her body. For all intents and purposes, she was naked as she took a step toward him, excitement burning in her. “It’s rude to be fully clothed while I’m doing my best, don’t you think?” </p><p>He chuckled as he got rid of his shirt, once again showing his muscles — which had played an important role in her dreams. She closed in the distance, a smirk on her face. “Come on, big boy. You can do—“ she started, but before she could finish, he grabbed her waist and pulled her against him. </p><p>“Careful, honey. One day, you’ll push your luck too much,” he whispered. </p><p>Janet might have said something, but that was hard to do with her hips rubbing against his crotch, triggering her desire even more than she expected. She just moaned as his hands mauled her tits mercilessly once more, making her shiver and moan. </p><p>Then, she found herself being pushed against the counter. She expected him to whip out his monster and teach her a lesson, but instead, he crouched down… She was shocked as his tongue jumped out, caressing her core. “Good girls get rewarded,” he said, his tone enough to carry her halfway to a climax…</p><p>Then, his tongue started dancing at her entrance with a display of skill that truly shocked her, making her helpless as she found herself leaning against the counter. The pleasure was simply too intense. </p><p>“On your feet,” he ordered, and she followed, too happy doing so as his tongue stayed connected, licking her aggressively. The pleasure was getting more and more intense …</p><p>But, before she could climax, she suddenly found his arms around her waist, flipping her to the other side, being kissed aggressively. She could taste herself on his lips, but as his fingers mauled her ass, she didn’t care much about that.</p><p>She cared more about his fingers, pushing her down. “Now, it’s your turn, slut,” he ordered. </p><p>She might have argued against his statement, but the speed she pulled his pants down, combined with the way she dressed … she had to admit that he had a point.</p>",

    "content": "<p>After a brief consideration, I decided that the merits of going down the mineshaft were the better of the two options. The construction of the ward didn’t imply a great deal of magical competency, which, in turn, suggested that whatever was hidden shouldn’t be too dangerous. </p><p>Hopefully.</p><p>I wanted to go down, more as a precaution than anything else. The capital was already a boiling cauldron of hot oil — with political battles, the financial collapse of the empire, the intervention from the dark lands, and not to mention, elves and phoenixes — and all that needed was a weak drop of water to throw everything into chaos. </p><p>I decided not to miss the opportunity to remove a possible piece from the board, especially if the said piece was this close to the capital. Bypassing the ward was trivial … which was why I used the elven casting traditions to slowly create the threads and weaken the connection between them; I only dared to do that because of the incompetence of the casters, the different parts of the ward rubbing against each other in conflict, making it impossible for them to set a detection ward in a way that wouldn’t be triggered by their own ward. </p><p>Of course, technically, it was possible. I could imagine casting one if I spent a couple of days on it … but if they had the skill, their initial ward would have been much stronger. I started moving down, noting that the deeper I got, the abandoned mines got abandoned. The signs of used torches, discarded food items, bugs, and other critters that had been killed relatively recently… </p><p>I had to deal with a few mana shadows, a frown blooming on my face.  The threat they represented didn’t get any higher, as I could deal with them even when using my unfamiliar magic, but the number of them was starting to reach a point that tickled my suspicion. The discrepancy made me frown as I started to use my shadow magic for concealment. Something was wrong. And, I was self-aware enough to realize antagonizing a faction of unknown strength and capabilities unless necessary. </p><p>The time to experiment was over. </p><p>As I abandoned the elven tradition, I started moving down the mine shaft much faster. The decision to explore might have been impulsive, but didn’t mean I wouldn’t take the necessary precautions. I had no intention of revealing my identity…</p><p>And it was for the best if they had never learned of my presence in the first place. </p><p>I walked twenty minutes before I came across another ward … one that couldn’t be more different than the previous one other than its inability to keep people out. </p><p>I had no doubt that, once upon a time, the ward I had been facing was impenetrable. Its magical structure was both elegant and strong at one time, before the ravages of time ruined its structure. </p><p>The ward put a frown on my face … for two reasons. First, the entrance was the source the mana shadows were constantly escaping — showing just how badly the defenses had collapsed — which implied there might be something more dangerous inside. </p><p>Second, once again I didn’t recognize the identity of what I had been facing … and considering I was about to face yet another potential disaster, it didn’t make me feel any better. </p><p>Was it pessimistic for me to assume I was about to find another dangerous trigger … if I asked someone else, the answer would be positive, but after everything that happened, it was just realism. </p><p>I frowned. I was still alive and well, but it was now abundantly clear I was about to suffer another dangerous situation, II didn’t feel any better. First, I went back,  but not out of the wards completely. No, I went halfway between two wards, and established one of my own. </p><p>It was not a ward that could keep people out, but then, it was not my objective. I copied the style of the first incompetent ward outwardly, and it could be easily destroyed, but unlike it, it wasn’t actually in conflict … meaning I could easily link an alert ward to it. </p><p>I was hoping that if someone faced the first ward, they would be inclined to underestimate the second one. Not the best attempt I could do, but a nice compromise between stealth, security, and time. </p><p>Sometimes, it was the best option.  </p><p>After that, I went back to the entrance. Bypassing the ancient ward was trivial, and I started moving down … and found myself in a marble corridor, decorated with gold and gemstones … making it very expensive. </p><p>Expensive enough to make me convinced whoever established the first ward failed to arrive there. Their limited magical knowledge already made them a poor candidate to breach the old ward … and there was no dust in the marble halls, but I would have expected them to take some of the gold and the gemstones. </p><p>But, the number of mana shadows rushing me, forcing me to kill a couple every minute made it difficult for me to focus on the historical remains. </p><p>I hoped that was the only thing that would have to deal with, but when I stepped to a certain spot, I felt a flare of magic. And, at the same time, I heard a hard, thudding footstep, the kind that couldn’t be made by any humanoid, suggesting a weight of several tons. </p><p>I rolled back, just in time as a blade passed through where I had been occupying. </p><p>A statue, I noticed, moving far faster than I had seen any golem. In the next attack, I used my shield to block, but it was more accurate to describe that as leveraging its strength to put some distance. </p><p>I quickly established a ward, one that would keep it away for a minute as I examined it. Not for long, as the ward that was supposed to last for a minute barely lasted two seconds, barely giving me enough time to examine it. </p><p>It was made of marble, gold, and other precious materials, half of it I couldn’t even recognize, and it was absolutely ruthless. I didn’t know a magical construct could be this strong, pushing me back easily in its lonesome, each step cracking the marble floor.  </p><p>“And, it’s doing it with damaged wards,” I gasped in shock. The golem hadn’t been damaged as bad as the outer ward, but the magic that was supposed to keep it moving was still damaged significantly. Also, not all material on its surface was pristine, some were cracked, some rusty. </p><p>I forced myself to separate from the golem as it rushed closed once more, swinging its sword mercilessly, its existence threatening to destroy me if I dared to destroy it. </p><p>I could still hit with magic, but there was something that was keeping me back. There were several magical links between the golem and something else, meaning its destruction had the chance of triggering a lot of things … including alarms. </p><p>I dodged as I did my best to understand the spells that went to its construction, its emotionless face and gem eyes tracking me. Worse, I didn’t want to use magic aggressively, afraid of triggering even more traps. </p><p>“I fucking knew this would be trouble,” I growled as I tried to use my sword to damage its leg, but it failed spectacularly, and I barely avoided the damage in turn. </p><p>Admittedly, not out of my expectations. The blade of shadows was an excellent weapon, one that earned its reputation by creating a sea of blood in its long and infamous history. Unfortunately, one word was the key … blood. </p><p>The blade was a famous tool of assassination, elegant, deadly, and capable of hiding its owner while he delivered a deadly blow. None of those details were relevant against a golem. </p><p>I shook my head as I tried to come up with a way to take it down without bringing the corridor down as well — either through triggering more traps, or damaging the corridor through my spells. I had some ideas that could be useful … but they required a lot of time and concentration. </p><p>And, of course, that moment was I felt an alert from the ward I had constructed, telling me that I had visitors. After the week I had, not exactly a shocking realization. </p><p>I stroked my chin as I pulled back, trying to decide what to do…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I decided to disguise myself as the God of Nature. </p><p>Was disguising myself as a true divine being disrespectful, certainly. However, I wondered if the fact that I had just killed the said divine being made it more respectful … or less. </p><p>Either way, it was just an idle question while I finished creating my outfit, using the fragments of memories I had experienced. I let my body slowly be covered with some kind of grown robe, and a living branch throbbing with Nature Spark appeared in my hand, and a hood covered my face. </p><p>Just like the way his memories showed him to act. </p><p>My first target was the elves. Or, more accurately, the civil war that was going on. The robed ones were already struggling to defend the tree, and I didn’t want someone to breach the defenses and kill Seldanna while I was busy with dealing the undead. </p><p>When I went out, I didn’t attack immediately. Instead, I cast a concealment spell as I flew down — the battle was mostly on the ground level — to understand the exact nature of the battle. I could see that the armored ones were gaining a lot of ground, with chants shouting the name of Prince Arun. </p><p>Which made the defending side the supporters of High Priest Ivasaar. </p><p>The battle was interesting, as both sides desperately used crystals to capture the Divine Spark of the fallen, allowing them to store more and more. They were desperate to generate some currency for their trade with the Eternals. </p><p>The army of the Prince was already close to victory, but the defensive wards of the priests were too strong, preventing a direct confrontation. And, to their credit, I was impressed with the wards, they looked weak, but had a deceptive strength. The High Priest had been clearly preparing for his ploy for decades — and my guess, only to be forced to pull the trigger early due to a sudden undead invasion. </p><p>No wonder he desperately tried to use Seldanna as a host.</p><p>A part of the reason for the battle was clear, but I wanted an even better picture. And luckily, there was an easy way to achieve that little trick, one that would put me in a good position. </p><p>I carefully manipulated the defensive wards,  weakening them. Not all across their defensive line, but creating a path between Prince Arun and Priest Ivasaar, pushing them together.  </p><p>“Push forward!” ordered the Prince as he rushed forward, thinking he was the one that brought down the defenses, and High Priest pushed forward at the same to block his path. </p><p>As I watched them approach, I started to stretch my mana tendrils outside, hooking into the Cystals that held the Divine Spark of the elves that had been slain during the battle. </p><p>None of the crystals I managed to find at the edges held a lot of Divine Spark. A few points here, a dozen there … but the combination was rather impressive. Half a day of battle cost a lot of elves their lives, and even a portion was able to help my God Forest recover most of its losses. </p><p>{+755 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>A welcome change, as moved around the Tree of Life, and placed sixteen seeds in a rough circle, preparations for a defensive bulwark, one that I was yet to trigger … because while I was dealing with those two aspects, the prince and the high priest was finally face to face. </p><p>I just watched even as they started to fight, even though the  High Priest was at an immediate disadvantage. I didn’t feel any guilt doing so, as neither the High Priest nor his men were my allies. They were just enemies that were conveniently blocking the path toward what I cared about.  </p><p>“It’s not too late, my prince,” the High Priest shouted even as he summoned a horde of roots and targeted the prince, who used his sword to chop them off easily. “You can still change your mind and go back on the right path.” </p><p>The prince laughed in derision. “Nonsense, old man. You want us to return to a distant path, where we were the servants of a tyrant monster. Why would we, when I hold the keys of fate in my hands! I will not be a slave.” </p><p>“No, you’ll be a weapon in the hands of our enemies, and take down the very thing that allowed us to survive. Do you think we could have survived the Great Disaster without his sacrifice? Yet, when it’s time  to pay back, you’re choosing to betray him.” </p><p>“Old tales, you can’t be serious to believe them! I’ll burn that damn tree if I have to. It’s the only thing that holds us back from our full potential.” </p><p>The priest laughed derisively. “Don’t you mean you’ll sell it to those damned foreigners, like I don’t know what your men were up to! Die!” </p><p>Their heated discussion gave me everything I needed to make a decision. I could go out and kill them both, but that was hard. I could see them fighting passionately, and neither of them was any weaker than me in terms of pure combat capability. </p><p>And each had an army. </p><p>Luckily, neither paid much attention below ground. I didn’t blame them,  as the roots of the Tree of Life were not a joke, ready to destroy any attacker — unfortunately, I had a rather good relationship with its new owner, so I was spared of that fact. </p><p>I started moving through the underground, and I positioned myself underneath the two. A few more careful changes of the defensive wards, gave the prince another chance to rush forward, and soon, the high priest ended up skewered. </p><p>The other priests immediately started to pull back the moment that happened, their courage faltering without their leader. I ignored that, making my move … in the form of a root that wrapped around the high priest. </p><p>{+1518 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>He had an impressive amount of Divine Spark in possession, explaining his impressive magical combat. I didn’t even realize keeping that much Divine Spark in chosen form was possible, but somehow, he achieved it. </p><p>I needed to copy that method.  </p><p>The prince kept his sword buried in the priest’s heart after taking off his head, confident in his victory. “Your leader is dead. Surrender—“ he shouted, which was cut short when the deceased high priest suddenly exploded with nature mana, his remains to turn into a mindless treant.</p><p>And, just like that, the prince was skewered with its roots, which drained him completely. </p><p>{+618 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>Both sides pulled back, trying to understand the sudden shift as their leaders had fallen simultaneously. Some of the higher-ranking officers were trying to make a point, but the double defeat was too sudden for them to react. </p><p>I didn’t react, which gave me time for the panic to spread. It wasn’t my intention, as I was busy integrating the sudden infusion of Divine Spark into my forest, but it was certainly welcome. </p><p>When the integration was complete, the forest was stronger than ever, and its mana generation capacity was significantly enhanced. And, before the two factions could decide what to do, the trees I had planted started growing with a shocking speed. </p><p>“You dare to hurt my loyal servant, traitor!” I shouted as I burst out of the ground, radiating an intense amount of nature mana, while sixteen trees started growing with a shockingly glorious speed. </p><p>It wasn’t just my appearance that shocked them, but the trees, each looking like smaller versions of the Tree of Life. Of course, the similarity was just cosmetics — changing the color of their bark and leaves was much easier than copying a divine tree that a god used as a weapon, yet still impressive enough to convince a bunch of elves. </p><p>“Impossible, that’s an illusion,” shouted some of the higher-ranking commanders of the prince while the others were just shocked, showing that their true objective wasn’t completely spread or understood. </p><p>“It’s true, we’re saved,” gasped the priests, elated with the sudden reversal even if it happened after the death of their leader. Though, the respectful way they had looked toward the treant I summoned was any indicator, some actually believed his sacrifice made it possible — my apparent anger confirming it. </p><p>I might have accidentally created a new myth of sacrifice, the heroic and loyal priest sacrificing himself to awaken his god. I thought about correcting them, but looking at the state of the priests, I decided against it after a shrug. </p><p>I had too much work to focus on something that was working. I still needed to subjugate the prince’s army, deal with the undead attack, and check where that teleportation gate was leading. </p><p>… so that I could start working on the real problems…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 842}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 8000  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 3043}</p><p>Elven Priestess - XXXX}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

He was about to be killed in any case. </p><p>I would have been more careful if the shift came from Seldanna, but ultimately, I would have continued and used my extensive healing abilities to stabilize her. That might cost her the nebulous opportunity to become a true goddess, but I was sure that she wouldn’t complain too much if she became an extremely strong demigod instead, and in time, I was confident I could come up with a way to elevate her… </p><p>If the source was the Tree of Life, it would have been a more difficult question. After all, it wasn’t just cultural importance that helped elves … many of them actually lived on top of it. Massacring thousands was not something I wanted to do, even for power. </p><p>Still, I could try to find a workaround if that had been the case as I assumed for a moment…</p><p>Yet, the problem was none of them.  It was the plane itself that trembled, not only the rotating planar border, but the very ground … giving me the feeling that the Divine Spark of the slumbering god intersected with the existence of the plane in a deeper way than I had expected. </p><p>Stealing more spark was not a good idea … not if I wanted to keep the plane in one piece. </p><p>Pity, as the additional Divine Spark would have been useful … and, if what I suspected about the impact of our little situation was even halfway accurate, it would be immediately useful. </p><p>I was tempted to convert my Spark into Stats … but a little examination showed that was not possible. Not unless I was willing to sacrifice Seldanna. Most of my available spark was occupied with cleansing the memories of the slumbering god.  </p><p>I just needed to maintain my touch to help Seldanna, so I pulled out, using magic to dress us both. As much as I wanted to keep her naked for my enjoyment, I chose otherwise. </p><p>As Seldanna slowly absorbed the Divine Spark from the Tree, its ability to block my senses had weakened significantly, and I could already hear the signs of growing chaos outside. I could sense not only flares of nature mana, but also necrotic mana, clashing against each other … with an intensity that surprised me. </p><p>I used a detection ward outside, to check how much time passed. “Wow, it’s already night,”  I said, loudly despite knowing there would be no answer from Seldanna. The passage of time surprised me. The mental battle with the slumbering god must have taken much more than I initially assumed. </p><p>I decided to take two actions. First, to deal with the tree. As Seldanna continued to absorb the Divine Spark, the mana production of the Tree of Life was dropping. It was yet to reach a dangerous point, still supplying both the planar border and the elven capital with their mana needs, but it would eventually happen unless I intervened. </p><p>A problem to deal with, but not immediately. I had a more urgent one. As Seldanna pulled the Divine Spark of the Tree, the chaos that tortured the tree for a long time was quelling. Technically, it was good news, as it meant the tree was suddenly free of one disease that had been torturing it for centuries, freeing a lot of mana it had been using to prevent its death free, boosting the combat capabilities of the elves. Unfortunately, it wasn’t good news for me, as it made it much likelier for the outside forces to realize what was going on. I needed to solve that immediately. </p><p>I started creating a ward, one that would fake the mana cyclone right under the bark to block any detection. Hopefully, with the battle going on, no one would pay attention to the tree. </p><p>As I built the ward, I started to pay attention to the progress of the battle, to understand when the elves would be victorious. They had to, considering the most recent mana boost they had received. Still, building the cyclone ward required some time, giving me a chance to observe the battle.  </p><p>Only to realize elves were losing … badly. </p><p>That surprised me at first, especially since I could feel the elven presence was stronger than the necrotic mana I could feel immediately around the capital. Due to the sudden nature of the battle, the undead had been lacking the most effective part of their arsenal. Their hordes and hordes of zombies and skeletons, create the necessary curtain for their dangerous members to handle the work — while also absorbing hostile mana and corrupting the environment as a welcome benefit. </p><p>Even without that advantage, the undead was steadily gaining ground … which was surprising. </p><p>Then,  I realized the problem, which was twofold. First, the capital, at least most of it, had been already evacuated rather than joining the battle, which was a big loss considering a majority possessed Divine Spark they could use to defend the capital. It was a waste, but not a decisive one, as the capital still had a significant army. </p><p>There, I noticed the second problem. Most of the army had been fighting against each other, leaving only a portion to defend against the undead. </p><p>A vicious civil war. </p><p>“Damn it, they are even more useless than I expected,” I murmured even as I examined the layout of the two armies, their armor distinguishing them. The first group was wearing predominantly robes, and defending the tree, while the ones that were attacking them were leaving heavier on the armor. </p><p>Also, the armored ones were the ones that were busy evacuating the city … through a stable gate, one that cut through Aether. Teleportation on that scale was not important, but very, very difficult; especially if they had been maintaining it for as long as I suspected. It relied on some kind of artifact. </p><p>A lot of things to respond to… and I needed to decide what to do first … before that, I needed to make sure Seldanna could stay safe. </p><p>Since the elves managed to defend for that long, a few minutes were acceptable. I pulled my own Divine Spark, and used that to establish a more stable ward around Seldanna’s Divine Sea, to make sure to handle the conversion, and with a persistent connection I maintained to alert me to any irregularities. </p><p>{-2000 Purified Divine Spark} </p><p>Luckily, the Tree of Life no longer interfered with my detection. </p><p>As I put the finishing touches on the ward, I could still feel the death throes of the god, but at this point, they were more of an echo. Whatever that was driving his awareness, it was finally gone. It was time to take action. </p><p>I could have dashed out immediately, but before that, I wanted to pull one last trick. What should I disguise myself as? And, while I could disguise myself as anything, it worked the best when a disguise both fit my immediate requirements, and was served in a way the audience found believable. </p><p>Quickly, I made a list of requirements. I needed to look in a way that kept my real identity and my core secrets hidden. That was nonnegotiable, especially with the Eternal presence I managed to detect. </p><p>Second, I needed a disguise that gave me an excuse to throw around as much power as I could handle; which was not a lot right now after I had drained my God Forest to save Seldanna. But, there was a civil war going on, and I could gather a lot of Nature  Spark to replenish that.  </p><p>Third, if possible, I needed a disguise that prevented the elves from attacking me desperately — though, when a pinch, a portion would do, considering they were in a civil war. </p><p>A smirk appeared on my face as I went through them again, a flash of inspiration giving me a very appropriate disguise.</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 22</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 842}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 8000  Mana: 15000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 152}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 12804}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As Darion left the office of his newest boss, he did it with a huge smile covering his face. He had been rather hopeful about his new job when he arrived, but he certainly didn’t expect the latest twist with his boss … especially when it was just a setup for something just as interesting.</p><p>Mia had the lips to make him a loyal employee — especially when that loyalty meant fucking a rich and sexy older woman, her power making her even more attractive. </p><p>But, there was a certain fun to tame a subservient woman … like the one he saw waiting for him in his horrible office, wearing a trenchcoat. </p><p>“How can I help you, my cute barista,” Darion said with a chuckle even as he took a note of the bulky trenchcoat, very aware of the reason a woman would arrive at a private spot wearing that bulky when the weather didn’t require it. </p><p>“I … I thought I would visit my new boss,” she whispered, her hesitant tone deliciously tingling, as promising as her outfit. She was yet to turn toward him, but he didn’t need to see her face to know what she was thinking. </p><p>“Make yourself comfortable,” he ordered, his tone leaving no doubt about what he meant. An order that was accurately received, considering the speed she dropped it … and revealed her underwear underneath. </p><p>A full-body corset that led to a nice choker, panties, and stockings. Darion would have said that she was overdressed … but her outfit was just transparent enough to make that comment useless. “Good work, now give me a twirl,” he ordered. </p><p>She did so, showing her body, nicely gift-wrapped for him, her shy expression making him even more enthusiastic to taste her. He had an exhausting day … but not enough to turn her away after she had gone all that trouble to keep him happy. </p><p>“I like your show of initiative,” he said, and she trembled in excitement. </p><p>“T-thanks, sir,” she whispered as she took a step forward. Darion grabbed her and pulled her for a kiss, one that showed domination rather than love, but Sakura didn’t seem to mind. Her legs wrapped around her body, bringing her to a more convenient height. </p><p> A couple steps, and Darin had her against the shelf, happy to test the integrity of his furniture. Sakura just moaned, her tongue dancing. </p><p>“By showing initiative, you deserved a reward,” Darion said. It was always a good habit to reward good behavior. </p><p>“Thanks, sir,” she moaned before she even knew what he had in mind. Meanwhile, he knelt before her, giving a much better idea. She trembled as the realization hit. “Really, sir,” she whispered. </p><p>“Of course, you deserve a reward,” Darion said even as he grabbed her calves and pulled her close, her panties destroyed in one pull. It ruined her outfit, but she chose to moan rather than complain. </p><p>Darion grinned at her enthusiasm only for a moment before his tongue slipped inside, exploring her depths aggressively … just because he was going down didn’t mean he wasn’t the one dominating… </p><p>“Faster, sir,” she moaned, showing she had absolutely no problem with his aggression, her dainty little entrance having trouble taking his tongue. It was shocking she somehow took his full length inside. </p><p>He encircled his arm around her ass while she moaned again… until her arousal hit his tongue.</p><p>“Good work,” Darion whispered, kicking his pants while her trembling legs failed to carry her and she collapsed, looking at his shaft. “Now, it’s your turn.” </p><p>“Do … do you want me to lick it, sir?” she whispered. </p><p>Normally, that would be his preference,  but the day had been too full of activities, and he decided to be faster. “No,” he said as he grabbed her arm and pulled her up …</p><p>And impaled her aggressively. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered. “Harder. Faster. Please!” </p><p>Darion lifted her easily as he impaled her, his small office filling with her beautiful moans. She got even louder as he rolled her nipples between his fingers. She was very sensitive … just like he loved. </p><p>He held her up as he pushed into her body again and again, her moans enough to drive him crazy. “Let’s try something new,” he growled. He could have slowly undressed her … but the transparent fabric was too fun to destroy. </p><p>And, just like that, she found herself naked other than her stockings, doing her best to hang onto his shoulder as she tried to hover up while he took her again and again. “Are you having trouble holding, sweetie,” Darion asked even as he slipped inside her again and again, enjoying her incredibly loud moans. </p><p>He was glad Mia was already out of commission, or Sakura’s cries would have brought her down. </p><p>“A — a little help, sir,” she moaned, though her hips didn’t stop. </p><p>“As you wish, let me help,” Darion said even as he shifted his hold, grabbing her legs. Creating an excellent view in the process. </p><p>“Yes, sir. Harder!” she moaned. </p><p>And just like that, his thoughts about Mia changed. It was a pity she wouldn’t come down to see the show. She could learn something … particularly the benefits of obeying her completely without obsessing over pesky things like authority blocking her enjoyment. “Tell me how much you like this!” he ordered. </p><p>“I love it, sir,” she moaned. “Please, don’t stop!” she moaned, desperate. Her moans got even more impressive as he shifted his hold once more, shifted her position so that she turned into a little toy he carried along … a very entertaining toy. She grabbed her head, like she was trying to make herself believe it was real, her moans spectacular.</p><p>He had a nice new job, indeed… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Waking up rested was a nice feeling, even if I had woken up once more as I felt the approach of the shadow assassins, but I didn’t even need to stand up. </p><p>My pet was able to handle them incredibly quickly. </p><p>“Thanks, little guy,” I said as I scratched his head, and went through my phone. My smile got even wider, as I noticed three surprises on my screen. </p><p>The first surprise was from the hospital. A nice, official apology from the medical team, forwarded to me by the sports department, apologizing to me about a mix-up of brain scans. The report was lengthy, and mostly useless, carefully written to minimize our chances to sue the hospital successfully, but it cleared me to play. </p><p>I wouldn’t have said no to a chance to take some settlement money as an apology. Pity. </p><p>The second came from my favorite coach, attaching a small list of struggling sports teams, asking me to give them a visit if I had time and have a talk with their coaches about what could be done. “Smart woman,” I said with a chuckle as I went through the names. With my habit of hacking people, I was sufficiently familiar with the internal political leanings of the most … and the list only included her most ardent political enemies. </p><p>She wanted me to weaponize against them, to reduce their power. Smart, if a bit rude. If someone else tried to do it, I might have reacted badly … but Coach Juana earned my goodwill in a very memorable manner. </p><p>And, I could always make her pay more if the task proved to be too difficult. </p><p>The third was from Megan, calling one of her favors. She said that she managed to arrange a fashion shoot for us, for the dream couple. I owed her, but what made it good news was that the photoshoot came with a nice offer of payment. </p><p>Five grand. Not as high as my new status deserved, but my rise had been contentious enough that well-paying advertisers would play it safe. Five grand was not a bad start. Not to mention, the potential to generate some more Intent.</p><p>A sexy photoshoot was exactly what was needed to make a bunch of people jealous, and a nice break from studying. </p><p>I sent a quick message to Megan, telling her I would be there, who then immediately made a social media post. Which had been picked by the boys I had rewritten the last night — which used several exploits that I only discovered due to my incredible increase of capabilities. </p><p>The bots triggered a long, pointless argument about yesterday’s match, one that turned into whether football was even a sport … and it turned into even more heated. </p><p>Which gave me almost a whole percent of Intent while I drove. Not a bad benefit for it. Pity it relied intensely on the spectacular nature of yesterday’s victory, and it was hard to replicate. </p><p>Soon, I parked in front of a large building, which functioned both as the headquarter and the photo studio for a mid-sized local clothing brand. After I parked, I walked inside, and went to the receptionist, who, unfortunately, was a dour-faced male. “Hi, I’m Terry, here for a photo shoot,” I said. </p><p>He looked at me dismissively. “We don’t have your name here, sir, please wait for a moment,” he declared, his smugness annoying … but also, weirdly intentional. </p><p>Probably a way for them to show off, I thought. I would have turned and left, but I was here to do Megan a favor, so instead, I went picked a relatively concealed chair and started waiting. Someone was trying to make a show. </p><p>Still, just because I was trying to do a favor didn’t mean that I wanted to wait. I called Megan … but she didn’t answer. Frustrating, I thought, wondering whether I should make a point … when I noted one of the cameras turning to catch my face.</p><p>Interesting, I thought as I shifted, hiding myself from the camera. I didn’t know what was going on, but clearly, it was not a simple thing. Instead, I looked outside. I could have left, but I felt moderately curious. </p><p>Soon, I noticed a movement outside. A tow-truck entered the parking lot, which was mostly empty. It was easy to notice the destination of the tow truck. It was my car. Even more curious, I thought as I looked at the receptionist, who started watching me with a smug smile, like he pulled a great prank. </p><p>Clearly, the tow truck was not here accidentally. </p><p>I wondered what was going on … Someone was clearly against me, but it was too petty and ineffective to be someone useful. Or not, I corrected myself, when I noticed the presence of the four men with suits at the end of the corridor, too bulky to be anyone but professional bodyguards. </p><p>They were well hidden, and I noticed them only through a reflection of a reflection. </p><p>Their presence changed the possible identity of who was poking around. Someone was trying to create an excuse for a beatdown, someone that was with enough pull to call a favor from the company, and with enough money to hire professional bodyguards — with a bonus to handle a semi-legal task.</p><p>The ploy was simple. They expected me to go and argue with the tow truck driver, who would probably throw around some insults. My reputation as a hothead was already established, so even if I didn’t attack him, they could twist the situation quite a bit. </p><p>Now, I needed to handle it. I thought about refraining to use Telekinesis, as the plotters could easily be the council testing me… But even if they were the ones, were hiding the right choice. My success with the team was already suspicious enough to give a sense of my abilities, and I continued to destroy those shadow assassins. </p><p>Telekinesis was not particularly dangerous. With a smirk, I waited until the truck was next to a very expensive sports car, and sent a magical push … and the tow truck lost one of its front tires explosively, veering off to ruin it completely. </p><p>The car alarm exploded loudly, alerting the whole building about the commotion. I didn’t know if the owner was on the plan, but if not, he could deal with my plotters. </p><p>“No!” the receptionist shouted in alarm, and dashed out. Two bodyguards left just as quick, but no one looked at me. Which gave me a chance to dig around the ridiculous plot I found myself in. It didn’t take long for me to discover the truth. The company was owned by an old, rich man, and his son, Marl, was currently the head of marketing. </p><p>A brief social media shot showed a lot of photos of the models that worked for his company, with suggestive comments about sex that gave the impression of trying too much. I had found several photos of him with my old coach Spencer, solving the mystery of his problem. Also, there were many photos he had taken himself, claiming to be an expert photographer. </p><p>They were ugly and pretentious. </p><p>Also, a lot of photos with the car I had just ruined, referring to it as his baby a disturbing number of times. </p><p>Talk about a lucky shot. </p><p>Barely a minute later, I watched him appear in the elevator, and start shouting. “You incompetent assholes,” I heard him shouting, and while going down with him was appealing, I chose to sneak to the elevator … people were too distracted to pay attention to me. </p><p>I went to the studio floor, which was mostly empty, with two people talking. One of them was Megan, the other woman I didn’t recognize. Interesting situation, I decided as I called Megan again, curious whether she was ignoring me intentionally, but she didn’t have her phone. </p><p>I stayed hidden, curious about the exact role Megan had played, which was revealed a moment later/ “Do you mind if I take my phone for a bit,” Megan said. “It’s not like Terry to be late, I should give him a call.” </p><p>“Sorry, sweetie,” the other girl answered, her tone amused and smug at the same time. “Boss is very strict about no phones in the studio. It ruins his creative juices.” With that, the ploy turned rather more obvious. They were also trying to keep Megan here … probably hoping to seduce her to make my humiliation even more newsworthy. </p><p>The newest hero coach, with his car towed, beaten, and cucked on the same day. I had to admit, it was a nice plan… Almost enough to make me respect them. </p><p>Too bad it was revenge time. </p><p>“And you went all that trouble setting him an interview, what a pity,” she followed. And my smirk got even wider.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Okay, this is interesting,” I murmured when I finally arrived at my office, right after dropping Coach Juana to her car. After the bet, she had trouble walking straight. </p><p>The target of my comment, was my pet, who was radiating a soft magical aura. “It must be the totem animal thing,” I murmured, even as I reached the System. Which responded quickly, as a benefit of its most recent repair. </p><p>Convenient. </p><p>[DIVINE SYSTEM I</p><p>Traits: (Divine Body I, Divine Mind I, Divine Aura I)</p><p>Domains: (Lust I, Command I, Athletics I)</p><p>Acolytes: ()</p><p>Totem Animals: (Tortoise [0])</p><p>Intent Pool: 24.2%]</p><p>My pet turned toward me … and looked at me in a way that was far too intense to be just ordinary. “You can understand me, right?” I said, and he nodded. </p><p>Admittedly, thinking that my pet could hear and understand me wasn’t the sanest thing imaginable; but after some consideration, I decided to add it to the pile, which included features like talking to an invisible sexy angel and slowly turning into Divine. </p><p>“So, any changes?” I said as I put my hand on his shell, trying to understand his magical potential — which he had now possessed, along with some kind of connection between us. I tried to focus on the connection, and — </p><p>[Totem Animals: (Tortoise [1])</p><p>Intent Pool: 4.2%]</p><p>I felt a sudden tug in my system, feeling the storage draining significantly, and, at the same time, the magical aura of my pet got stronger … several times. He started moving fast … fast for a tortoise, and tapping the side of the box. </p><p>“I’m sure you can free yourself,” I said. He turned to look at me, and somehow, I managed to read his deadpan expression — though the connection doing the heavy lifting on that aspect. Then, he followed it by tapping the side of the box, breaking it easily. </p><p>The cardboard wasn’t particularly strong, but still, it was not something a tortoise could achieve, especially not the ease he was able to do that. </p><p>“Interesting show,” I said as I chuckled. “Do you want me to carry you, or do you want to go to the car yourself,” I said. Another amused expression, and he took a step forward … but I didn’t expect him to disappear. The connection between us alerted me that he was just a few hundred feet away, roughly toward the personnel parking, where my car was. </p><p>“Okay, teleportation is more than I expected,” I murmured as I started walking toward my car, wondering what else he could do … and what his sudden intelligence meant. I didn’t know just how intelligent he was, but my guess, was he could rival a well-trained dog in a minimum. </p><p>I decided to leave that question for later, as I went to my car, and drove to my dorm. While I drove, however, my phone rang. I was surprised to see it was an unknown number … as I had blocked the unknown numbers from reaching me. </p><p>The app I used wasn’t anything fancy, just a free offer rather than writing something myself, as I was just trying to stop the spammers that flocked after my recent rise in prominence. A surprising number of local companies wanted me to do ads for them, though their offers had been insultingly low. </p><p>Hopefully, with the spectacular victory we had just earned, the offers would get better. I needed the money. But, I didn’t think about it much, instead answered my phone. The app I used might be simple, but the fact that they were able to bypass it with an ordinary call was interesting nonetheless. </p><p>It wasn’t supposed to be possible. </p><p>“Why did you keep me waiting, boy,” a gruff voice from the other side called. A familiar female voice. </p><p>“Hey, professor,” I said, chuckling. “Or would you prefer a doctor? Are you calling to congratulate me on my victory?” </p><p>The growl of anger that came from the other side was simply beautiful. </p><p>“Stop acting glib, boy,”  the answer came sharply. “Come to my hospital tomorrow, and we’ll talk about your health report. I might be convinced to rescind it.” </p><p>It was a nice offer. Coaching was nice, but I was afraid that the novelty would wear off quickly, and it would affect Intent generation. The repair process and the little accident with my pet showed that the System still required incredible amounts of intent. </p><p>I needed to go back to the field to make sure the Intent flow continued, which weakened my hand. </p><p>Luckily, she didn’t know that. “I don’t think so,” I answered. </p><p>“Boy, do you know what I’m offering?” she declared in an entitled manner. </p><p>“Something that I would like to have, but nowhere near as vital as you think?” I countered, and the call fell silent as her little power play fell apart. She was really not used to people not listening to her orders. </p><p>Especially after her little trick with the phone, which she probably thought to be intimidating. Pity, it would have been effective if I wasn’t an expert on the subject. </p><p>“But you know what, make sure you fix the medical report as a peace offering, and I’ll make sure to visit the hospital somewhere this week? How about that for a deal?” </p><p>She growled in anger again, and I bit my lip, holding back a quip. I felt that I had already pushed her to the limit, and further quips would be counterproductive. She didn’t say anything for a few seconds, then the call disconnected without an answer. </p><p>I wondered if that meant rejection, but I didn’t try to reach out to her. The fact that she called in the first place implied some kind of immediate need on her side. </p><p>I had nothing to do but wait and see. </p><p>The rest of the trip went without any interruption. “I’m guessing you prefer to move on your own,” I asked my pet, and he didn’t even deign to look at me before taking a step, once again showing his teleportation capability.  </p><p>Trying to copy that was tempting, but I decided to leave it to a time when I was confident I would not accidentally erase myself from reality in the process. </p><p>I was tempted to call Megan and Kim for another celebration, but, after some consideration, I decided against it. I had a lot of studying to do, both in coding and in magic. I had tested the physical benefits of my new Divine Traits. </p><p>Now, it was time to push the mental aspect to the limit. </p><p>I started with the familiarity of the two. Programming. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured as I looked at the code editor, my fingers dancing on the keyboard faster than I thought to be possible, especially since what I had been producing was not nonsense, but clear, crisp, and the perfect code. </p><p>It felt like a hacking scene from a movie rather than the reality. “Maybe I should extend that little search into the dark web as well,” I murmured, wondering if I could find any magical source there. </p><p>The presence of magical organizations made such a thing likely. I was sure that at least one traitor or a greedy guy had decided to scan the information and tried to sell it on the web. Unfortunately, validating the information about magic was a true challenge. </p><p>And,  it wasn’t the challenge that made me decide against it. No, it was just finding it. The dark web was not that easy to crack … not because it was some kind of magical, dangerous place. It was more like a clearance sale of the world’s biggest library, but the books not only didn’t have any kind of catalog and had their covers ripped, but also they had been forgotten in a moldy basement…  </p><p>Searching through the dark web without knowing where to go was a long and time-consuming exercise, even with my new Divine Traits. </p><p>Instead, I finished rewriting my web crawler, created an impressive number of fake social media accounts that looked like real people, tasking them to have constant arguments about me to keep people’s emotions relevant, and even redo my anti-hacking measures. </p><p>With that gone, I turned my attention to my magical studies. But, before I could dive deeper, I felt a familiar presence. I looked outside, only to see several shadows moving without an object to make them. </p><p>“I thought I had gotten rid of you,” I murmured in frustration as I looked at their approach. I wasn’t afraid of them, per se, but what they represented. </p><p>More sleepless nights, unless I decided to free my guide from the convenient magical spot she had been hibernating — which I didn’t want to do unless the pressure turned unbearable. </p><p>However, there, I received another surprise. This time, a pleasant one. My pet — and totem animal — looked at the shadow assassins, his magical aura flaring stronger. Then, he looked at me, as if he was asking for permission. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said, feeling curious. It paid off rather fast … when my pet tortoise blinked outside the window, floating. Then, a wave of magic spread out of him … popping all of the shadows at the same time. </p><p>“Wow,” I murmured, fascinated. “Someone earned a nice juicy lettuce,” I said. His gaze was unapproving. “Filled with enough healing energy to make it even more delicious, of course,” I added. His head lowered in approval. </p><p>‘You’re a picky beast, aren’t you,” I said with a chuckle, and decided to sleep instead of studying. </p><p>I didn’t need sleep today, but I still missed it. </p><p>And, after the day I had, I deserved a nice, long sleep…</p>",
