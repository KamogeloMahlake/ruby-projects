    "content": "<p>I stood still for a moment, not allowing even a muscle to twitch as I carefully grabbed some mana, creating a cloak around my body with great care. Yes, since the active wards were targeted inward, sneaking through them was easier, but that hardly meant it was a trivial achievement. </p><p>The magic field stayed centered on me as I sneaked toward the building. The field had two aims, to create an effect close to invisibility by creating a variable illusion around me that tried to match the background, and to block my magical presence at the same time to prevent the wards from picking the flickers of magic. </p><p>For most mages, maintaining a constant cloak of magic around them, strong enough to prevent detection by wards while also achieving a physical effect would have been exhaustingly challenging, but for me, the only part that was challenging was to suppress my natural magic, keeping it in a level that could be hidden by the cloak. </p><p>Especially when I felt a sudden warmth in my heart, flooding my body like an avalanche of solid fire, begging to be let out. I bit my lips, trying to suppress the sudden surge, considering whether I should go back rather than take such a big risk. </p><p>However, after a while, I decided to continue. I had no idea how long a sudden surge would last, and under the implied blackmail of that mysterious sorceress, delaying the visit was rather ill-advised as well. </p><p>So, I seized the source of my mana, suppressing it to the best of my ability as I continued to walk, a move that was as safe as trying to climb a mountain with my eyes closed, but I didn’t have any other options. Even waiting there until my control got better was not an option. Four guards were still on the window, watching us, and as much as the illusion effect I had cast was convincing, it wasn’t exactly a permanent solution.</p><p>Especially with the attention they were displaying.  </p><p>Something was really wrong with them, I decided as I threw a glance at them. They were watching the garden carefully, so carefully that they had no signs of boredom. No chitchat, no banter with the other guards, no smoking as a distraction. </p><p>No wonder the other guards were unsettled by their presence. The fact that they were able to maintain such a level of concentration despite not having any reason to do so was not something close to reasonable. </p><p>Unfortunately, that particular mystery had to wait until I could bypass the security. So, I carefully arrived at the edge of the building. </p><p>Interestingly, despite all the protection measures, there were still several windows on the building, allowing me a better access point than the main door, which was no doubt protected by several guards from inside. I couldn’t help but wonder about the reason for that. </p><p>Though, considering it was in the middle of the estate, maybe those windows existed to prevent the building from completely destroying the mood of the garden. It wouldn’t be the first security risk that was created to look better. </p><p>Almost invisible, it wasn’t exactly the biggest challenge to avoid the attention of the guards to arrive at the building. However, as I finally stood next to the wall, I didn’t try breaching through a window immediately. After all, the active wards were still in place, making a breach dangerous.</p><p>First, I needed to deal with the observer. </p><p>I pressed my hand against the wall, letting my magic slowly infuse into the mana flow of the ward. It was hardly a simple achievement, requiring a lot of mana and control at the same time, delivered through a careful application. Normally, gathering the required mana to deal with such a big ward was a challenge, but it was when my sudden flare of magic came useful. It was much easier to gather the required mana. </p><p>I stood there almost five minutes, slowly creating an outer later around the ward, thin enough to avoid triggering any kind of alarm, like I was trying to sneakily ride a mad stallion. A mistake, and the whole structure of my spell would collapse against the ward, possibly raising all the alarms in the process. </p><p>But that was a risk I needed to take. </p><p>I was able to create the full web, and with the success, I slowly started to search for the control node, where the unlucky mage responsible for controlling the wards was connecting with the structure. I continued to channel until I found the access point before I started gathering my mana, turning the web into a stab, creating the magical equivalent of a thin needle. </p><p>“Sorry, bud,” I murmured even as I let the spell go, and felt the wards flicker. </p><p>The moment I felt the flicker, I put my hands on the wall, using magic to quickly climb the second floor with the assistance of magic and unlocked an empty window, slipping inside. I had apologized, because what I had done essentially targeted the mind of the controller. I didn’t use a needle as an excuse by accident. It wasn’t a deadly attack, or just a distraction. A magical equivalent of poking someone’s shoulder with a needle to get their attention — through turning a deadly attack when the target was juggling a dozen magical axes. A moment of distraction was enough. The wards would handle the rest. </p><p>I expected him to collapse at a minimum, at that was assuming he stayed alive. Not that I allowed that to slow me down, of course. The more time I spent outside, the more likely it was for the guards to catch my presence. </p><p>Yet, my sudden hurry proved useful, because soon after I had arrived at the room — thankfully empty, used as a storage room filled with guard uniforms — I felt the wards flicker once more, and it turned active once more. “Fuck,” I murmured, and for two reasons. </p><p>First, I was effectively imprisoned inside, because the same trick couldn’t be copied from inside the wards — the whole point of using active wards. </p><p>The second reason, I didn’t expect the mage responsible to regain control that easily, even assuming he managed to avoid all side effects. The much likelier option was to have a second mage waiting in the wings, taking control the moment the first one failed. </p><p>Which was certainly excessive, even to keep a sorceress a prisoner. </p><p>At this point, the answer was not too far away, I decided even as I pulled my magic tighter against my body, letting a sliver slip under the door to work as a detector. I sensed several rooms were occupied with sleeping people, though with a number that surprised me. As I expanded the detection range, I had managed to identify four guards that were watching from the windows, but to make things worse, they weren’t the only ones that were awake. </p><p>Eight other guards were patrolling the corridors, which was another suspicious security choice. Noticing one of those patrols was about to pass near the corridor, I waited in the room, watching from the keyhole, realizing that, even when they were patrolling in the corridors, they were extremely serious, which highlighted their weirdness even more. </p><p>Interesting choice, I thought even as I waited for the guards to pass, using the time to put one of the discarded uniforms on, before lashing into action. Before I started searching for the sorceress, however, I first moved to one of the rooms that the guards were using as barracks — my subtle detection spell still active to prevent any kind of ambush. </p><p>I trusted my battle capabilities, but killing the guards was not an option, because of the sheer number of guards in the building. The number of sleeping guards surprised me. I had expected a few dozens at most, but almost every room was being used as barracks, and I could easily detect hundreds of guards sleeping.</p><p>Ominous.  </p><p>I timed the movement of the patrols before dashing between hiding spots, until I stood at the entrance of one of the barracks, which allowed me to examine the magical presence in the rooms without using my own magic — which I tried to minimize to stay hidden. </p><p>I found a subtle magical effect in the room filled with sleeping guards. It was not something I had ever seen before, but I was competent enough to understand the general idea behind it. At a glance, it felt like a permanent healing ward, but it wasn’t targeting blood or muscles. It reminded me more of a painkiller spell, but more complicated, targeting the brain in a way I didn’t understand. </p><p>Yet, the lack of emotion the guards displayed, along with their noticeable lack of emotion, suggested quite a bit about the potential effects of the ward. </p><p>How very interesting, I thought as I continued down the corridor. As much as I was interested in the completely novel application of spell, it was too complicated to be unraveled in a few minutes. And I wasn’t exactly in a location to freelance. </p><p>Instead, I started poking around the ward once again, though this time not directly to avoid triggering, trying to find the control location, which, I was unhappy to note, was not above ground. Carefully, I started climbing down the stairs, happy to see that there were no guards between the floors, but that only lasted until I had arrived at the ground floor, only to notice there was only one basement entrance. </p><p>“Damn,” I murmured as I stood at the corner, realizing I needed to do something else. Luckily, I had already changed into the guard uniform, cast an illusion spell on my face to make me look like one of the guards patrolling upstairs, then I went to the entrance once more. </p><p>I walked to the entrance like there was nothing out of the ordinary, ready to unleash a sleeping spell as I passed through the entrance. In a different place, I would have kept the sleeping spell as a precaution, but here, the moment I noticed the first guard opening his mouth, I had cast the spell, distracting all of them at the same time. </p><p>It was not something I wanted, as once they woke up, they might as well be suspicious, but it was the best among the several horrible options. At least, it was not as efficient as killing them.  </p><p>The power of the active ward was much stronger in the basement, dancing aggressively enough to make me glad I didn’t try to dig a tunnel inside. Instead, I took a note to identify the location of the control center before I started walking down more — avoiding two more patrols in the process — before I had come across a secondary ward, one that I was able to bypass much easier since it was not an active ward. </p><p>And I had found myself in a cell. A very luxurious cell, but a cell nonetheless, housing the certain sorceress who blackmailed me here, who was still awake. </p><p>“Good morning,” she said as she noticed me, a small smile on her face as the illusion didn’t trick her even for a moment — which, considering she was a sorceress, was hardly shocking. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Unlike the endurance test, the following strength test held no surprise. I wasn’t horrible and managed to put some decent numbers, but ultimately, they were suboptimal even by the backup standards of Sunset college. </p><p>“After that exhausting workout, do you mind giving a little boost to my scores, coach?” I said with a playful wink, tapping into the assistance of Seduction Trait, which helped me to deliver it much smoother than I could have managed it otherwise. Without the assistance, it would have come across as too abrupt, destroying the goodwill I was able to generate with obvious flirting. </p><p>The Seduction Trait allowed me to deliver it playfully, with just an undertone of flirting, too light to be mentioned. </p><p>“We’ll see,” she murmured, a slight dusting on her cheeks as the unexpected delivery worked wonders. Though, the punishment wasn’t too far away. “Give me another forty reps first.”  </p><p>“As you wish, coach,” I said, once again returning to my calm tone, letting her think that she had imagined my flirting. I bit my lips as I benched the weighted bar, loaded to one hundred and eighty pounds. It wasn’t high enough for a college football player, but considering I was pushing that after an exhausting training, it was still impressive.</p><p>Just the thing I needed to finish my performance-driven charm offensive to my conditioning coach. </p><p>Unfortunately, even with supernatural endurance, I barely finished the assigned forty. “No, t-that’s all I can manage,” I gasped as I carefully placed the bar back in place, feeling my stamina drained even with the combination of Recovery and Stamina. After that many repeats, no bar was light, no matter how little it weighed. </p><p>I left the bench. “I didn’t allow you to stop,” she said, trying to look angry, but still smiled. I just shrugged even as I tried to breathe. I pushed myself too hard, and a rest was a must. </p><p>“Too bad, coach, that’s my limit,” I said with a shrug, even as I leaned against the wall. “That's literally all I can manage at the moment. Any more, and I faint. Feel free to kick me out of the team if you feel my endurance is not enough.” </p><p>The acceptance of her power worked well to soften her attitude even more. “I’ll let it slide for today, since it’s your first day. But from tomorrow, I want complete obedience to my program,” she said even as she passed a bottle to me, and I took a deep sip, quenching my burning thirst. </p><p>“As long as you give me a program that I can survive, I promise.” </p><p>“You don’t have the luxury of bargaining,” she said even as her pen danced over the paper, recording the details of my last attempt. “Get some fluid. And you can go for an ice bath after we finish discussing your program.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” I said as I took another small sip, trying to suppress my wince. There were good things and bad things about competitive sport, and submersing myself in an icy tube while exhausted was hardly a pleasant sensation. </p><p>While I regulated my breath, she was writing furiously, then she passed the list to me. “What do you think? Can you handle it?” </p><p>As I checked the list, my eyes widened. It was an understatement to say that the training schedule was hard. Hellish was a better description, especially considering I wasn’t a full-time football player but a chess player as well. Even with the assistance of the Traits, it wasn’t exactly trivial to prepare for the tournaments. </p><p>Maybe it wasn’t just about her gender that she had free time to take over a new player’s schedule. If it was her usual habits, I could easily imagine players doing their best to switch to a different coordinator. </p><p>“This program has to be illegal,” I said between sips, not bothering to hide my smirk. “It can kill a weaker man.”</p><p>“A man would have no problem,” she said. “A boy, on the other hand…” </p><p>Smart, I thought, unable to suppress my smirk even as I forced a scandalized expression to my face. The blush that followed suggested that she realized just how easily that could be construed as flirting as well. I didn’t comment, letting it slide without additional comment. </p><p>“Don’t worry, coach. I can do it,” I said, letting it slide. </p><p>“Good,” she said, nodding in approval as she passed the program to me. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t have the luxury of rejecting it in the first place without making a lot of noise, not with my shaky position in the team in the first place. My physical abilities were barely up to par, I had already angered the Head Coach and all of the offense, and annoying my trainer on top of it was hardly a convenient strategy. </p><p>Though, as I examined the program more attentively, I saw it as workable. Horribly heavy, but still workable. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to guess her aim. She was clearly trying to lean on my recovery abilities and stamina to maximize my development as much as possible. “What’s the end goal of this challenging program?” </p><p>And it was challenging, one that would strain me completely even with the Traits supporting me. </p><p>“If your body responds well enough, I think we can get you to playing shape before the season ends,” she suggested. </p><p>“Really?” I said, surprised. </p><p>“Yes, that depends on your performance in actual training of course, especially your memorization abilities. There’s a limit to how much your physical abilities can help you, especially with Coach Bill. Someone else might allow you to play just because you’re fast and strong enough, but he’s an old-school coach. No one that doesn’t memorize the playbook could take a step on the court.” </p><p>“No worries about that aspect,” I said confidently. Her smile was dismissive, probably assuming it was another trick I pulled to look better in front of her. </p><p>She was wrong, of course.  If there was one thing I wasn’t afraid of even before the Heroic Traits, it was the study aspects of the game, and the tactical tricks made it only better. </p><p>“You’re lucky I’m good enough not to quit after your torture,” I teased her as I tried to catch my breath. “Do you push every player like that?” </p><p>“No, but I saw that you’re not the type to quit just because I was testing your limits. You’re not one of the soft, annoying rich kids.” </p><p>She was right, of course, but I doubted she truly meant what she was saying. It was just a complement to galvanize my pride.  </p><p>I let it slide, and not just because of her authority over me. With the occasional strands of hair stuck on her face, and a slight sheen of sweat glistening on her face, she was even more beautiful after joining me in a few exercises. And in my book, a beautiful woman always had more leeway. </p><p>And she was a perfect mixture of sexy and beautiful, enough to flare my hormones. Especially since it had been a while since I got laid — the amazing strain I had during the party back at the Den, cut short due to the annoying little trick Megan had pulled, hardly helped. </p><p>“Really?” I asked, fishing for compliments, curious how much she would push. </p><p>But I only received a sharp gaze, suggesting that I had pushed her a touch too much. She was clearly at the limits of her tolerance, warning me not to push too much. </p><p>Pity, I thought. There would have been some fun possibilities if she had been more desperate to convince me. Maybe something that was really interesting. I changed the subject. “What about the nutrition plan? I don’t think I can survive by the things I can cook myself.” </p><p>Her answer was another list. “This is your food plan. And you don’t have to cook yourself. The school has a delivery program. Each set is delivered in the morning, cooked and packaged. You just need to microwave them to heat up. Six meals, as well as the supplements you have to take.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. Not paying for my meals would help my budget immensely. </p><p>“Let’s go over the exercises,” she said, before giving a detailed run of every single exercise, far more detailed than necessary, though it was helpful. And I had a feeling that it wasn’t just about her love for the job. </p><p>My success would reflect well on her performance. </p><p>Sports were complicated, but most people mistakenly assumed that team was a monolithic unit, competing with other teams, while the remaining assumed that it might extend to players competing for a starting spot, but with a limited degree. </p><p>However, it affected the coaching staff as well, maybe even more intensely. At least, for us players, the performance was easier to measure, running faster, throwing more accurately, or, especially in defense, hitting harder. </p><p>Coaching was always more nebulous to assess, tactics and player development were harder to measure, too dependent on the conditions and players. And I guessed being a woman in a male-dominated sport, especially with a body that wouldn’t be amiss as a cheerleader, made it even harder to sell her success. </p><p>My success could easily be a promotion case for her success. </p><p>Of course, that wasn’t always good news for the target athlete. An excessively heavy training program helped me to be ready faster, it also significantly increased the risk of a dangerous injury, especially during the season.</p><p>There was a reason most players bulked up in the off-season.  </p><p>So much that, if it wasn’t for the supernatural benefit of the Traits, I would have rejected it and forced her to give me a lighter program. “Don’t worry coach, I can handle it,” I said. </p><p>“I hope you can, I don’t appreciate laziness,” she said, not bothering to hide her threat. </p><p>“As you wish, coach,” I said. She left, and I went to the locker room, throwing myself into the ice bath, which was as close to torture as one could reach after a long exercise. </p><p>“I didn’t miss this part,” I murmured as I squeezed my teeth, trying to suppress the torture I was feeling. </p>",

    "content": "<p>However, before delving deeper into the question of why my storage was better, I first needed to suppress the sudden flicker of doubt on the face of the headmistress. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had no option but to be honest. “I have no idea, ” I answered as I looked at her sharp eyes, doing my best to convey honesty. Though, amusingly, I used Speech and Charisma the same way if I had been trying to trick her. </p><p>The irony was hard to deny. </p><p>Luckily, the irony of my actions didn’t prevent it from working. “How can you have no idea? It’s your own spell,” she asked, delving into the operational details of my explanation rather than rejecting it. </p><p>I shrugged. “Hey, I have discovered it only yesterday. Pardon me if I don’t have a working theory about the exact performance of my spell.” </p><p>She frowned, but considering the validity of my excuse — albeit a lie — she didn’t have any right of pushing me on the subject too much. “Watch me create one, and see if you see any mistake,” she said with a frown, and created a copy of my simplified storage with great care, using her mana. </p><p>“It seems solid enough,” I said, frowning. Yet, the moment she put the smallest sliver of Divine Spark, it collapsed. “It should have worked, there’s no difference I can detect,” I said. “Maybe you should try again using the ordinary mana. It might be clashing with your unique mana,” I said. It earned a frustrated glare, as it was clearly something she had tried before. Yet, she repeated, only to explode again. </p><p>“Explain,” she said. </p><p>I frowned. “May I use the external mana to create one,” I said. </p><p>“What difference does it make?” she asked. “The mana provided by the system is perfectly uniform, there’s no compatibility difference.” Yet, she said nothing as I reached for the wards she had used, pulling some mana from the storage of the school, and fashioned another cage. </p><p>It also exploded. </p><p>“How,” she gasped, her frown much thicker, and she wasn’t the only one that had that particular expression. Because I had deliberately used nothing but pure mana to construct the cage, no Tantric manipulation, no Biomancy tricks, no Arcana enhancement. I didn’t even push the mana density to the limit to allow it to be copied easily. </p><p>Yet, the external mana shattered like a dry leaf. </p><p>“I have no idea,” I answered, though I had some suspicions, like the unique needs of my System and the constant demand for Divine Spark. Since I wasn’t able to replicate it, it didn’t seem to be a part of my abilities, but directly about the nature of mana. </p><p>A nature that was supposed to be uniform for everyone. </p><p>“Maybe we should experiment more to make sure we find the reason for it,” I offered before the headmaster could, showing a sudden enthusiasm for the idea, more to convince her that I had no intention of hiding anything. “A few hundred experiments should be enough.” </p><p>“We’ll continue tomorrow,” she said decisively, intimidated by my enthusiasm — though only with the help of her obvious exhaustion. And, since she had to supply the divine spark for every attempt, even if I was the one building the storage wards, it was more exhausting for her to test. “I have more important things to focus on first, we’ll do it tomorrow,” she said. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” I said cheerfully, doing my best to ignore the temptation to poke fun at her excuse, and left her, ready to conduct some experiments on my own. </p><p>Of course, the headmistress was not stupid,  but from her perspective, I wouldn’t be able to experiment alone, blocked by my lack of Divine Spark, unaware that I had managed to swindle her enough to conduct that experiment alone. </p><p>As always, the lack of information was the killer of sound decision-making.  </p><p>The only frustration I had was that I needed to suppress the desire to question her more about the planar structure of the dimensions once more, but considering even if she had a method of easily traversing the primordial aether, which wasn’t likely, she wouldn’t just share it dismissively. I couldn’t even rely on Janelor for that. If she had that, she would have used it to leave this plane. </p><p>And without a surefire method of traveling, I couldn’t reach Aviada. </p><p>I decided to focus on the nearest problem. When I left the headmistress’ room, I didn’t dally around, and left the school as well, traveling back to the same spot I had absorbed the Divine Spark to empower my body, once again riding an air elemental, ignoring Janelor’s warning about the elementals once again. </p><p>I found myself on the same opening that I used to absorb the Divine Spark, the wards still in place to dissuade any monster that might decide to act adventurous — though, at this point, it was more about avoiding a momentary annoyance rather than trying to survive against the deadly threat they had consisted just weeks ago. </p><p>It was experimentation time. </p><p>The first thing I did was to create another storage, the simplest I could manage, with absolutely no unique mana involved, before using the headmistress’ trick to inject some mana for it to contain. It managed to hold, which was not a surprise. </p><p>Nor was the notification I had received. </p><p>[Divine Spark Identified! Please absorb it to continue to support the operations of the System]</p><p>Yet, the difference with the notification I had received when I was with the headmistress was notable, burning with an urgency that lacked despite saying the same thing. </p><p>It was the difference between a dispassionate whisper and an urgent battle cry. </p><p>Interesting, I thought even as I created a larger cage around, using my own mana but keeping it connected to my soul space, not wanting it to waste by letting it evaporate. The ultimate destination was the same, the System, but one of them would be through my soul space, which seemed to be the smartest option. </p><p>After all, either my unique version of the System and the general System used the Divine Spark was completely independent, making the general system’s consumption a waste, or they shared the same source, meaning it would make no difference other than crediting me with its collection and giving me higher level cap — at least that was what I assumed due to my limited inference based on evidence. </p><p>Either case, there was no point in not letting my soul space absorb the Divine Spark that would escape. </p><p>Of course, I could try to capture and stuff it back into the storage, but I didn’t want to deprive of the System after it detected Divine Spark, just in case it had the ability to punish me for it. I had no idea whether that was possible, but it seemed smart not to poke that particular point. </p><p>It was one knowledge I was happy living without. </p><p>While my mind was idle, considering the implications of the System, I continued to feed the storage with mana, until it finally exploded, and my soul space greedily consumed it once the outer layer of my wards dragged those pieces back into my soul space. </p><p>[-682 Mana]</p><p> It took much less mana to burst the storage than the headmistress’ attempt, which was interesting considering I had tried to make it exactly as strong, but it didn’t take much to understand the difference. The System was once again trying to devour the Divine Spark, showing a much greater appetite than it showed toward mana without the headmistress’ darkness ward there to block its detection capabilities. </p><p>No wonder she didn’t go out casually. I doubted the added pressure would help her already-strained capabilities to contain the Divine Spark. </p><p>I focused on the experiment once more, this time creating the storage cage from Arcana mana, only for it to shatter instantly, not even able to contain the smallest spark, just like the headmistress’ cage, or the one I had built up from the school’s mana reservoir. </p><p>The result didn’t surprise me, as if Arcana — the single most common magical proficiency — was the answer, I doubted the headmistress would miss the answer for centuries. </p><p>Just to make sure, I replicated the test, adding some elemental nature. I started with Earth, considering it was the one easiest to mix with ordinary mana due to its stable nature. </p><p>Yet, it failed spectacularly. </p><p>This time, it wasn’t just the shattering similar to Arcana, followed by a containment failure, but a violent reaction, one that reminded me of the wild dance of the Elements — although not in nature, just in impact and explosiveness. </p><p>It would have been really convenient if those wild elements were a result of unlimited Divine Spark, but that was not really realistic.

    "content": "<p>When I arrived at the headmistress’ room, I found it decorated with crystal pillars once again, glowing softly as they charged with her unique-natured mana, pushing the oppressive darkness of the wards she used to block the System. </p><p>She was once again dressed in her gold-embroiled armor, carrying a sword, her beautiful wings carrying an impressive sight with their soft glow. Unfortunately for her, I had already seen her dressed like that before, so I noticed other details. Like the subtle hint of blackness under her eyes, indicating a sleepless evening. One that also implied exhaustion as well considering just how strong her supernatural body must have been. </p><p>And, it wasn’t the only extraordinary detail I had noticed. I could also feel the remains of a repeated spell, most likely wards, lingering in the air. A momentary focus had even revealed the type of wards she had been casting. </p><p>The storage ward. </p><p>Even with my exceptional Perception, I had barely been able to notice the lingering remains, but that didn’t mean she had cast it only a couple of times. </p><p>After all, pure mana wards, unlike the ones that had been created with the assistance of physical objects, left next to no residual once destroyed. For me to be able to pick them casually meant that she must have created hundreds of them during the night. </p><p>And, if her frustration — which, unlike her exhaustion, was much easier to notice on her beautiful face — was any indicator, her repeated attempts to create alternative storage for the Divine Spark had failed spectacularly. </p><p>How fascinating. </p><p>“Good morning boss. What a great morning, right?” I said cheerfully, amused that I wasn’t the only one that had gone through an extremely exhausting evening, though unlike her, I was able to hide it better. </p><p>Her twitching eyelid was enough to show just how much she appreciated my greeting. “Come on boss,” I said, pushing even more. “You’re an angel, shouldn’t you be more cheerful in the morning.” This time, it earned a growl, warning me to keep my mouth shut. </p><p>It was enough teasing, I decided as I took my position while she climbed on the platform wordlessly, not even warning me as her mana flooded me, much stronger than the previous time, enough to be classified as ill-advised. </p><p>A cry of pain escaped my mouth before I could suppress it, surprised by her move. A punishment, I noted, unable to hide my grin as I once again created a magical funnel leading to my fake soul-space, stealing as much as Divine Spark as I could manage. </p><p>Despite the pain her sudden flood had created, it was hard to say there were no benefits. A stronger flood meant more fragments, and more importantly, it meant she could pay less attention to the sudden disappearance of some of them, allowing me to steal more without making her suspicious. </p><p>When it came to an end, I had almost stolen five times the previous amount despite a similar duration, most of it safely locked in my body — a perk of the improved storage I had managed to develop — isolated from the hungry fingers of the System, a sliver of it went to the fake soul space, improving the Light Node, showing the headmistress that her great effort hadn’t gone to waste. </p><p>However, she seemed to miscalculate the drawbacks of her not-so-subtle punishment, because the moment she cut her mana flow, she trembled, leaning forward as she was going to fall. </p><p>Luckily for her, she was in the room with a perfect gentleman! I didn’t waste any time before standing up and wrapping my arms around her. “Don’t worry boss, I got you,” I said cheekily. </p><p>“Stop hugging me,” she gasped as she pushed me back, her face blushing much harder than I expected. “And stop calling me boss!” </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” I said, smiling cheekily, enjoying her frustration as I acted significantly laxer. A cheekiness she could not push against too hard, not when I was her only way of keeping her important dragon guest happy, unaware that her guest was much more helpful to me than her, and I would have paid a great price for the privilege of accompanying her if she had presented the deal differently. </p><p>Especially since I had resolved the misunderstanding about the exact job description of a servant. </p><p>Still, watching the headmistress as she tried to swallow her anger at my playful jabs was beautiful, especially since she was even more uncomfortable compared to the subservience she had shown to Janelor. </p><p>Her thoughts were visible on her beautiful face as she weighed the importance of her problem versus admonishing me. However, ultimately, her needs won over her desire to reinforce her authority over my harmless rebellion. “Show me that storage ward again,” she ordered. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” I said cheerfully as I created the storage, this time even simpler to make it easy for her to copy it flawlessly, watching as she forced another piece of Divine Spark. The storage held the Divine Spark in without any issue. </p><p>I expected her to repeat the spell after examining it a few seconds later, solving whatever that was preventing her from completing it, but she surprised me by injecting more Divine Spark into the storage, as if she was trying to break it. </p><p>Much to her surprise, it held on, even after she repeated the trick two more times. “How?” she gasped. </p><p>It was lucky that she was focused on the structure, because even I had a frown on my face. The capabilities of my storage had exceeded even my expectations. I was tempted to delve deeper into that, but I had more important questions for the headmistress. </p><p>Aviada’s disappearance was more urgent. </p><p>“So, boss,” I said while she started poking at my wards carefully with her mana. “Can you tell me more about the world beyond the System?” </p><p>“Why?” she asked, turning her gaze toward me suspiciously. “ </p><p>“I think I can lead the dragon into spilling more important secrets during our discussion if I have more information to direct her, but if you think it’s not important…” </p><p>“No, it’s important,” she said, her suspicion replaced by panic, enough to make me guilty about tricking her. At this moment, it was hard to imagine her as a mythical being hundreds of years old, astute enough to manage a complex entity like Silver Spires without revealing her true nature. “Ask me your questions.” Though, as she said so, she pushed another sliver of Divine Spark into the storage, continuing to test its ability to hold Divine Spark. </p><p>“Let’s start with something simple. How exactly is the nature of the lands outside the system.” </p><p>Her expression showed that it wasn’t exactly a simple question, but she still started to explain. “Before the System was established, the worlds were much more ordered. There was the central material plane, a complete world, and the domains of Major Gods surrounded the material plane.” </p><p>“And where were those planes?” I asked. </p><p>“Floating in the aether, of course, but that’s not relevant for you. Aether is not something that mortals could step in. Even for the Demigods, it’s almost certain death. Only gods could easily travel in aether Dimension with the help of their avatars.” </p><p>I nodded in understanding, assuming aether was what I had been calling Arcana dimension. My attempts at teleportation had taught me just how hard was to successfully utilize it. I had only survived due to sheer luck. </p><p>“Can’t people just use teleportation formations,” I asked? After all, teleportation was not exactly a unique skill for me. It could be also done by ordinary mages, if one was willing to create two huge wards and spend an extraordinary amount of mana in the process. </p><p>Hardly something that could be used outside the direst circumstances, like reinforcing the capital during a disaster. And only then, it only made sense for some peak existences — at least, in terms of what the public defined as peak, like Titania — to use it. </p><p>“That’s only possible if both the target and destination are in the same plane,” the headmistress answered dismissively, not appreciating my interruption. “Without the shadow of the plane blocking the primordial aether flow, an errant wind would burn the wards easily,” she explained impatiently. </p><p>Interesting, I thought as I took note of it. I had no idea what primordial aether was, yet her tone implied it was something that was common knowledge, it was her distraction as she fed more and more divine spark to the storage yet it managed to stand, that was making her spill more secrets than she might otherwise explain. </p><p>Sometimes, even a word was more precious than gold. </p><p>Of course, it raised the question of how Aviada actually managed to survive such a deadly environment. I doubted my Empower Perk was enough to ensure her survival, especially with her absolute lack of magical ability. Yet, I had distinctly felt Aviada’s survival until the breach had closed. </p><p>The mystery behind her sword got even deeper. </p><p>“So, with the material plane blocked, does it mean the only other place is the domains of the gods?” I asked. </p><p>“More or less,” she answered. “There are some plane fragments big enough for people to live, but their shadows are hardly strong enough to establish a successful civilization. They might not exist—“ she continued, only to be interrupted by an explosion. </p><p>My storage ward finally reached its limit, but the explanation was strong enough to force me to create a shield to protect us from the after-effects. While we were talking, she must have put much more Divine Spark than I expected. </p><p>“How can your storage hold that much Divine Spark?” she turned to me suspiciously. </p><p>I frowned. It was a question that I wanted the answer to as well. The performance of the storage surpassed my expectations as well.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, w-what’s next,” a stammering whisper asked Naomi’s beautiful lips.  </p><p>“Whatever you want it to be,” I answered back. I could have pushed her to whatever I wanted, of course, but I wanted her to feel comfortable in what might be her first time if she wished, or waiting for the next time. </p><p>Admittedly, it wasn’t as big a sacrifice as it sounded when I had another sexy nerd in my bathroom, even hornier, probably more than happy to make me ‘pay’ for the extended delay. </p><p>“What if I’m not ready for anything,” she whispered. </p><p>“Then we stop,” I said seriously, only to follow with a chuckle as I looked down to my crotch, where her fingers were still wrapped around my girth, pumping up and down. “Though, if I were to guess from where your fingers currently are, you don’t seem particularly enthusiastic about stopping.” </p><p>Naomi gasped as she pulled her hand back in surprise, like she just registered where her hand was busy. “It’s an accident,” she gasped, but she continued to sit on my lap, making no attempt to pull away. </p><p>“I’m sure it is,” I said, accepting her unconvincing explanation even as I leaned forward once more, this time kissing her neck, making her squirm on my lap again, which didn’t help my erection in any way possible. </p><p>Her moans echoed on the walls even as I grabbed her ass once more, this time squeezing and mauling to my heart’s content, enjoying the perfect firmness that could only be attained with endless exercise and very careful dieting. She found herself unable to move when she tried to squirm once more, though, considering she continued to moan, it clearly wasn’t a big problem for her. Her arousal was burning even thicker. </p><p>However, when I glanced toward the bathroom, I noticed the mirror was moving even more erratically, making me afraid of an accident. If that mirror slipped off her fingers, it might ruin several very possible fun events. Yet, football taught me that trying to avoid every possible risk only ended in defeat. Only by bravely risking things, we could achieve perfect victory. </p><p>And, that fear wasn’t enough for me to stop and ask Naomi to leave, not after I had reached such a naughty point. </p><p>I decided to ask a very dangerous question, one that could ruin a lot of stuff, but with an incredible potential upside. Yet, I kept my tone barely above a whisper, preventing Sarah from hearing it. “You know that you’re not the only one in your friend group that’s trying to seduce me, don’t you?” I whispered even as I continued to squeeze her ass. </p><p>Her eyes popped beautifully as she tried to pull herself off my lap, but I didn’t allow it. Luckily, instead of anger, I found shock and shame, no doubt thinking of it as an accusation rather than permission. </p><p>I decided to let that impression persist. </p><p>“I … do,” she admitted slowly, though she didn’t try to pull herself from my lap, seeing that I had no intention of pushing her away. </p><p>“And you have no problems with that, even if things had gone, or might go, further with said friends?” I asked, deliberately avoiding mentioning Carrie’s name. </p><p>“N-no,” she said. “Actually, I have—“ she tried to add, but before she could finish her sentence, I silenced her with a searing kiss. I had all the ammunition I needed, and I didn’t need her explaining how she asked for Carrie’s permission beforehand. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly the nicest thing to do, but considering she had ‘borrowed’ me from Carrie like a toy, it wasn’t exactly something she could be outraged about either. </p><p>“That’s enough for me,” I said after pulling back from the kiss, only to realize that during the kiss, her crossed legs had finally unfolded. My fingers slipped down, dancing over her wetness.</p><p>The moan of pleasure she let out at the sudden touch after such an extended foreplay session was simply beautiful, her legs widening even further in invitation. Her hands dropped her sides helplessly as she did her best to process the unfamiliar wave of pleasure, my massive erection grinding against the side of her leg not making it any easier for her to gather her wits. </p><p>Though, things didn’t exactly change immensely once her hands started working, not when one of them landed on my abs, caressing my muscles while the other landed even lower, grabbing my shaft once more, stroking it lightly. </p><p>I would have loved a more aggressive approach, but her moans were sufficiently delicious to compensate for the lackluster hand service. </p><p>I kept palming her beautiful ass, the other hand busy with her wet entrance, increasing the intensity of her moans even further, even mixing in an occasional squeal. </p><p>“Maybe we should stop?” she offered, her voice soft, lacking conviction. </p><p>“If you wish,” I suggested. “Why don’t you start by pulling her hand away.” She dipped her head down shyly, but her hand stayed in place, giving her a perfect answer. “Excellent,” I whispered as my fingers continued to dance around her knob. </p><p>But the real surprise was my other hand. I swung my hand, my palm slamming to her toned ass with a loud clap, though her tight ass not jiggling even for a moment. “Ouch,” she gasped. </p><p>“I wanted to do that the moment I had seen your beautiful ass,” I whispered. “After you had worked so hard to perfect it, it needs some worship.” </p><p>“Be gentler,” she gasped. </p><p>I spanked again, though this time softer, my hand lingering for a long. “How about this?” I asked. “Is this gentle enough?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered, unable to hide her arousal spiking even further, especially after I had rewarded her admission with another spank, making her squeal with pain and pleasure. </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered as I leaned down to capture her lips once more, but this time, it wasn’t a soft, gentle kiss. No, it was a searing one, with all the momentum of a merciless invasion, my tongue dominating her mouth in seconds. </p><p>She let out a muffled moan, still helpless against my hands slapping her tight ass, again and again, suggesting that Carrie and Sarah weren’t the only ones with a submissive streak in their little — yet surprisingly sexy — nerd group. </p><p>Under assault from three different directions, she didn’t prevent me from changing our position — if she noticed our movement in the first place. Since she was under the assault of a wave of pleasure she had never felt before, it was not an unlikely outcome. </p><p>Between spanks, I grabbed her waist and raised her, making her move her legs, so that she was facing me properly, her legs at either side. It allowed me to kiss her even more aggressively, but it was only a fringe benefit. </p><p>The real benefit was the positioning of the treasure between her legs, rubbing against the side of my shaft, leaving her wet mark in arousal. “Damn, girl,” I whispered even as I spanked her beautiful ass once more. “You’re so sexy. Your endless hours of exercising certainly didn’t go to waste.” </p><p>“T-thanks,” she managed to murmur, not knowing how to handle such a compliment under the circumstances, but that didn’t prevent the relentless rocking of her hips, trying to push her into arousal. </p><p>She was reacting to pleasure even better than I hoped, and that was with the delicious benchmarks provided by Carrie and Sarah, though maybe it was the safety of my house that was giving her courage, compared to my first time with Carrie, in her car pulled to the side, risking a voyeur. </p><p>Of course, unlike then, we actually had a voyeur, but Naomi was unaware of that particular fact. But maybe I should tell her that, to prevent a future crisis…</p><p>And more importantly, push the situation to an even sexier end. </p><p>“So,” I whispered into her ear even as I slapped her ass once more. “You remember I mentioned your friends choosing a similar path, and might or might not be as enthusiastic as you…” I started, letting it linger deliberately. </p><p>“Yeah,” she said, but this time, her tone measured, unable to prevent jealousy from creeping in. Very understandable, considering our position. Though, her hips, quickening even further, implied that she was more than willing to handle that jealousy very directly. </p><p>“Well,” I whispered before leaning forward and giving her a short yet explosive kiss, leaving her breathless. “But what if the said girl was already here, maybe even watching us?” </p><p>“Oh, really?” she said, a hot emotion I was not able to identify infecting her voice. It might be anger, it might be jealousy… </p><p>Or it might be something even more interesting.  </p><p>“Glance toward the bathroom door, but only for a second,” I suggested, and she followed my instructions, only for her eyes to widen as she finally noticed the mirror that was being used to get a prime view of our sexy show. </p><p>Her eyes stayed stuck, so I leaned forward once again, distracting her with another searing kiss, one that lasted for more than a minute to make sure she was appropriately distracted. Since our lips were busy, I couldn’t ask her whether it worked, but luckily, her hips were kind enough to provide the answer I was seeking… </p><p>By rubbing against me even more recklessly. </p><p>I finally pulled back from the kiss, leaving her panting desperately, on the edge of a climax. The perfect time to suggest a naughty prank. “Do you want to mess with your cheeky friend?” I asked. </p><p>Her naughty smile was the perfect answer. </p>",

Though, even with that, I appreciated the morning sun on my skin… </p><p>Until a shadow blocked the warm light. “Don’t be too smug just because you completed the warm-up,” she commented as I continued to breathe further, but her words didn’t annoy me, mostly because I was able to catch a softness in her tone that was not there before. </p><p>She was clearly satisfied with my performance. </p><p>“Yes, Coach,” I murmured, noticing the flicker of a smile on her face before she managed to erase that, suggesting that it wasn’t just my performance that kept her happy, but also my willingness to push to my limits to keep her happy. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the exact case, as I had more interested in the speed my exhaustion evaporated, noticeably faster thanks to my Recovery Trait. Of course, I had no intention of informing her about that particular detail.  </p><p>“So, coach, what’s next,” I said, deliberately using her title again — even though the conditioning coach hardly qualified as a coach — doing my best to act like I was talking to Coach Bill, suppressing my amusement. No need to poke something that was clearly sensitive. </p><p>“Give me a plank,” she ordered, and I followed immediately despite still being tired. If she wanted to push me to the limit, I was more than happy about complying even without my Traits. I had always liked to push myself to the limit, and more importantly, it allowed me to focus on the present. </p><p>One advantage of the plank, the position allowed me to throw some interested glances at her beautiful legs, clear even with the loose sweatpants she was wearing. “Good,” she said after I reached the two-minute mark, my stomach burning with exertion. Normally, two minutes was not a challenge, but it was different after such an exhausting run. Yet, since she didn’t tell me to stop, I continued, curious how long I would be able to last. “Coach Bill said that you’ll be joining us for for a while, to see whether you’re worthy enough to occupy one of our precious roster spots.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” I answered. </p><p>“So, what’s your play experience,” she said before she took a deep breath. “Don’t tell me you are one of the track athletes that they pick just to fill the roster. Have you played before? Because if not, we might as well go to Coach and get you out. We can’t afford to develop a brand new linebacker this late into the season.” </p><p>I had no doubt that she was talking about Coach Bill, rather than Head Coach Spencer. </p><p>“Don’t worry, coach. I have played during high school, except my senior year when I switched to chess.” </p><p>“Chess,” she growled, her dismissal clear, but I let that roll off without comment. “We need to make sure that you can handle our training then. We don’t want to lose one of the precious geniuses of our school to fall victim to over-exhaustion.”</p><p>“As you wish, Coach,” I murmured, doing my best to suppress my annoyance at her sudden dismissal. It was expected, which was why I had mentioned it early, to handle the inevitable underestimation between two parts of the training, to be destroyed through my resilience and physical performance. </p><p>Sometimes, it was better to let the sensitive stuff slip early. </p><p>“Much better,” she said smugly as I continued to plank even as my stomach started to burn. She kept me for almost five minutes before asking for another five laps, then we moved toward the other aspects. We run through several basic exercises, sweat invading my face. The next session didn’t last long, barely fifteen minutes, but without a single break, exhaustion started to take hold despite the limited intensity. She called for another rest. </p><p>“Appreciated, Coach,” I said obediently even as I desperately drank some water. Toward the end, things were getting especially difficult as she was clearly pushing the training more than what was reasonable, but I kept my mouth shut. Her position was clearly fragile enough for her to make push aggressively. </p><p>Admittedly, her beautiful face played some role in me keeping my mouth shut. I was honest to admit that my personality was prickly enough to react to such actions rather explosively, but a pretty face — one that she did her best to keep it hidden to be taken seriously — went a long way to take the bite of her attempt to push her authority. </p><p>“Not a bad performance for a nerd,” she murmured as I breathed hard, trying my best to recover. </p><p>“Thanks, Coach,” I answered, once again using her title deliberately. </p><p>“So, do you think you can handle something a bit more serious than shuttle runs,” she said even as she grabbed her whistle. </p><p>“Yes, coach,” I answered, curious about what she had in mind. </p><p>She said nothing as she went toward a bag to the side, and picked up a ball from the bag. “Let’s run some angle drills. Five cuts, forty seconds of rest, and try to intercept the ball.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought. Technically, angle drills weren’t too different from shuttle runs in terms of the efforts that were required. It was just running, yet there was one important difference. Instead of just focusing on the speed and recovery, the player needed to focus on the ball the whole time, changing direction as required. It wasn’t a particularly difficult drill. </p><p>It was certainly more complicated than anything that needed to be run by a conditioning coach, because while it was simple, there were still a lot of technical details that needed to be optimized. It was perfect in my rights to reject her running technical drills, as bad technical habits might have been the most dangerous thing for an athlete, regardless of the sport. </p><p>It was certainly something I wouldn’t accept just because of a pretty face. Yet, despite her annoying desire to push for her authority, I wanted to see if she had the ability to run these exercises. </p><p>I just nodded as I started following her request, and started the moment she raised the ball, signaling the snap of the ball, running through five cuts in quick succession, before taking the required forty-second rest. The amount of rest she allowed wasn’t random. In football, between each down, teams had a maximum of forty-five seconds to recover before another attempt. </p><p>“Keep your eyes on the ball,” she ordered. “You have pulled your gaze away two times, and your center of gravity was off when you were planting your foot outside.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” I said, smiling. I was officially impressed. I had let my gaze drift away twice deliberately, and the second one was barely noticeable, yet she not only noticed it, but also called it. Moreover, she had managed to catch my unintentional mistake of slipping center of gravity — owing to my lack of practice. </p><p>Maybe she really knew what she was talking about. </p><p>“Repeat,” she ordered, and we run through the drill again, and again… I continued to run the maximum speed I could manage without slipping my position. “Now, backpedal and shuffle,” she ordered, moving to another training, running backward and making sharp turns whenever she used her whistle, while continued to take notes, and after some practice, moved to another drill. </p><p>After the fifth different drill, I could read a small yet pleasant surprise on her face, and I was definitely replicating her mood. She had the technical competence to run the drills and the sharp gaze to catch the mistakes. </p><p>Most importantly, unlike a linebacker coach that would run the drills for the whole position and mostly focus on the starters, she was focusing on me completely. “That’s enough for today, we still need to test your strength,” she finally called, but only after pushing me for almost an hour through various drills, looking at me with a renewed gaze. </p><p>I couldn’t blame her, as even I was surprised by my own performance. Normally, a strong drill session like that would have exhausted me enough to force a lot of mistakes during the drills — it was much harder to focus on the correct way to angle my feet when my lungs were burning. </p><p>Yet, with the assistance of Recovery, I managed to maintain my technique much better than I expected. </p><p>Of course, when I said much better, it was relative to the expectations from backup linebackers. I was not suddenly showing pro-level ability. And in terms of physical qualities, especially in terms of explosive speed, I wasn’t exceptional even when compared to other college-level players. </p><p>Yet, discipline and maintaining a high performance despite exhaustion were good enough to compensate for some of it. The combination of Recovery and Stamina worked even better than I expected. And, together with the discipline, I was determined to put into the work, maybe I actually had the opportunity to make it into the team. </p><p>And, after the events of the last night, that starter position was not only a bit I was using to trick my guide, but the best way to actually improve myself. It was inconvenient that my guide was devouring the Intent I was able to correct prevented me from gaining more Traits, but the sooner she recovered, the sooner I started recovering my strength. </p><p>“Not a bad performance for a chess player,” she murmured as we started walking toward the gym. </p><p>I grinned, though it was less about her words, and more about the amazing sensation of water traveling down my throat to battle the heat radiating off my body despite the cold weather. “I did my best to stay in shape, it helps.” </p><p>“Good, how about nutrition?” </p><p>This time, my smile turned sheepish. “Unfortunately, there I had been suffering a bit,” I answered. “I tried cooking, but…” I murmured, not finishing the sentence. Proper athlete nutrition was ridiculously costly. </p><p>“I see, we might need to give some boosters for the first month just in case, but it’ll depend on the results of your strength test,” she said, but her attitude was much softer compared to her sharp, unyielding introduction. </p><p>Another small win, I noted happily. </p>",

    "content": "<p>A smile forced itself to my face as I looked at her obedient moans, the decision about the next step easy to reach. She had deserved a reward. The dazed expression on her beautiful face suggested she was already daydreaming about said reward. </p><p>Such an alluring Queen to spend time with. </p><p>“So, Your Majesty,” I murmured, my voice enough to break through her reverie. “Do you think you have deserved a reward?” I asked, my hand slowly stroking her inner thigh, each movement sending shivers through her body.</p><p>\"Err, maybe...\" she murmured in an uncharacteristic confusion as she looked at me, battling against her own arousal while she did her best to understand what was going on in my brain. Not that I blamed her, because her body was being rocked with pleasure, preventing her from formulating a rational thought. </p><p>The time was logic was far too gone, replaced by the age of pleasure. </p><p>“Good answer, Your Majesty,” I whispered even as I positioned myself toward her entrance, my throbbing presence more than enthusiastic to finally dip into her depths. And the presence of the chains around her wrists, still keeping her prisoner like I had suffered for months, made things even more fun. “Too bad none of your loyal subjects are lucky enough to see completely divested of your clothes, chained against the wall, begging for it.” </p><p>“Then they should have worked harder,” she moaned back, surprising me with her answer. </p><p>“Yes,” I murmured in her ear, my seductive whisper bringing my hot breath on her ear to make her remember how my mouth felt on her body, not that she needed to go deep to remember that particular detail. “Those lazy idiots would have needed to work harder,” I said as my hand slowly moved up, sliding up to her hips, yet didn’t slip in her wetness yet. </p><p>A moan escaped her mouth as her mind was alighted with pleasure, not helped by the lazy rubbing of my shaft delivered gently around her entrance. </p><p>I stop for a moment, which was not by choice. The desire in her voice was simply too mesmerizing to do anything else. Yet, that didn’t last for long, as her legs parted even more even as she moaned, inviting me inside. </p><p>Who was I to reject the request of such a beautiful queen?</p><p>“Oh, yes,” she gasped as I pushed my hips slowly, proving her entrance with my shaft, her eyes closed as she leaned against the walls of the cell. I decided to help her a bit, adjusting the chains so that they were tense enough to keep her upright if she got too overwhelmed with pleasure. </p><p>She moaned even more as she realized just how tense the chains had got, enough to forcibly keep her arms open to prevent her from sitting down. Her legs weren’t chained, but still, her legs widened in her own accord, creating a beautiful spread-eagle look, helpless under the rush of pleasure. </p><p>“What a nice Queen,” I mocked her even as I pushed myself even deeper, enjoying the way she tightened around me. “Tell me how does it feel getting fucked by the same Dark Lord you have worked so hard to capture?” </p><p>“It’s—“ she gasped before a moan interrupted her, as I chose that moment to impale her harshly. She threw an angry glare at me. “Not like it’s the first time,” she finally gasped, trying to sound angry, but coming across cute. </p><p>“Well, it’s the best time you’re properly aware of it, at least,” I added even as I slapped her ass, enjoying her resulting moan. </p><p>That made her still a moment before she moaned again. “It’s better than serving a merchant,” she admitted, earning a chuckle from me. </p><p>“Too right,” I said, unable to suppress the temptation to slap her breasts, enjoying the way they swayed. That hardly helped her to contain even as I slowly moved in and out of her, my hands moving to her ass, firmly holding her hips in place.</p><p>She looked at me, her beautiful blue eyes clouded with excitement and desire, telling me that she had completely shed any pretense of denying what was going on in her body. I had no idea what played the most part, my amazing skills, the fact that she had surrendered repeatedly, the side effects of her tantric spells, the fear of losing everything due to upcoming danger… Nor that I cared. </p><p>From this moment, she was mine. That was all that was important. </p><p>“Tell me who do you belong to,” I whispered even as I kept my fingers on her quivering body, my hips picking up speed. </p><p>“I belong to you!” she moaned, her voice cracking, yet it was more delicious than an epic song. </p><p>“Such a beautiful statement,” I whispered. “Luckily for you, you’re going to have a lot of opportunities to prove your obedience in the short term.” </p><p>“Good,” she said as she let herself go soft, her quivering body a work of art. But as she loosened, I picked up speed, enjoying her wetness even more, pushing deeper and deeper into her core until my shaft started disappearing completely with each rhythmic thrust, sinking into her warm depths. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time she was stretching under my assault, but that did hardly anything to her harm her tightness, each push glorious as I invaded her persistent wrap. I grabbed her hips as I lifted her, making her body more angled. Her shoulders were still pressing against the wall, and the chains were helping her to keep up — though not completely painlessly processed for her, yet she moaned even louder. </p><p>For a moment, I said nothing, enjoying the way her tits swayed hypnotically under my assault, the angle I created giving them the free space for them to do so under my relentless fucking. Her tits danced and tumbled, creating one of the most beautiful works of art I had ever enjoyed as she only hold onto the chains for support. </p><p>Her beautiful ass jingled no less impressively with each thrust, her body adapting to my rhythm.  </p><p>It was a pure, unadulterated experience of pleasure as I slammed into her harder and harder. “Oh, gods above and beyond, yes, harder,” she started to gasp dazedly, breaking the silence. </p><p>“You love this, don’t you, my slut Queen?” I whispered as she grunted positively. “Good, this is your reward, after all. Tell me what else do you want?” </p><p>“Fuck me even harder,” she gasped. </p><p>“I don’t know,” I murmured jokingly. “It’s such an annoying chore for me, maybe I should think about it for a while.”</p><p>“Jerk,” she managed to gasp between her moans, though the momentary smile that appeared on her face showed she was just as serious as her statement. </p><p>“Okay, you win,” I said, amused by her reaction as I picked up speed even more while she spread her legs even more, more obedient as the queen than the dancer she disguised herself as. </p><p>I smiled as the sound of our hips colliding filled the room, the sound deafening as I plunged deep into her and spread her lips wide. “If that’s your wish,” I said, while she moaned repeatedly. I might have added a statement about ruining her for other men, but considering I had no intention of letting there be any other men for the rest of our life, that would have been redundant. </p><p>She was mine, and she was going to stay mine… </p><p>Her back arched under the pleasure as her tits pointed at the ceiling, every vigorous slam making her body rock dangerously as she rubbed against the wall. I had no doubt that her shoulders had started to hurt as a side effect, yet she made no complaint. </p><p>She was surprisingly nimble for a noble, though she probably owed that to her secret career as a dancer… </p><p>Time and environment lost their meaning as I fucked her to my heart’s content — which was an achievement considering the importance of the time under the mysterious circumstances we were facing, and the significance of our environment — each magical second bringing us closer to a climax that would no doubt be legendary. </p><p>Even with the life, I had lived, this moment was certainly a contender for the most erotic moment of my life, split between surreal and extremely realistic. </p><p>And what a great sign of the amazing life I was living, I thought in satisfaction as I enjoyed Sapphire’s warmth, for even such a moment failed to take undisputed first spot. </p><p>Yet, as her tightness suddenly intensified, grabbing my girth stronger than the chains around her wrists, I focused on the present, enjoying the reality of the situation. </p><p>A loud grunt escaped my mouth as I slammed into her for one last time, the sound mixing into her desperate cries as the climax hit her hard, leaving her a trembling mess. I closed my eyes, focusing on the unique pleasure of filling the soft core of the reigning Monarch of the Empire… </p><p>Nor that the moment lost any of its radiance as I finished filling her insides as I pulled back, enjoying the way she continued to shiver as her feet touched the rough floor of the prison once more, her legs lacking to strength to support her properly as the chains kept her upright. </p><p>She kept her eyes closed, moaning softly as she enjoyed the pleasure of our most spectacular time together. </p><p>Until now, of course… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I wonder just how busy their husbands are with politics and work to leave all those women so hungry for a proper session of bedroom fun,” I murmured as I looked at the two beauty that was sprawled on the bed, unable to handle my aggressive treatment. One of them was another noblewoman that I didn’t even bother to learn the name of, the other was Cera, who had finally exhausted herself after our sixth visit even if I didn’t focus on her particularly well. </p><p>Her exhaustion was understandable as I had been particularly aggressive during my last two visits, trying to create an opportunity for myself for a little adventure in the process. I carefully laid a spell on them to ensure their sleeping state before I moved to my next destination. </p><p>However, despite the plan Cera had informed me required me to visit the room Olivia and Atia were waiting for me, I had a different destination in mind. </p><p>I also had a different exit in mind. Rather than using the door that led into the estate, I had used the window to sneak out. </p><p>Not immediately, of course. First, I gathered my mana on my fingertip, my gaze already on the runes that created a subtle decoration along the wall, slightly faded enough to suggest that it had been a while since they had been reinforced. Though, even if they had been reinforced, they could hardly create a barrier against me. </p><p>The weakness of the ward that protected the room was a reason for me to make this room my last destination before I had moved to the next step of my plan, but it was not the only one. Because, ultimately, the wards that defended the building were weak, making it trivial to tweak and adapt a rune easily. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean the Estate was easy to infiltrate. The outer wards, responsible for protecting the estate against enemy assault and assassination attempts alike, were designed in a much more unforgiving manner, making it a hard target for subtle manipulation. </p><p>In companion, the wards around the building were much weaker, because they were mostly there to protect the nobles from any disgruntled guard or slave that might decide to exchange their lives for a pointless bout of sacrificial revenge. </p><p>It was like the difference between a city wall and a tent fabric, the latter easily breached as long as one had a sharp instrument. The fact that they were designed to defend against attacks from outside made them even weaker against manipulation. </p><p>The weakness of the wards wasn’t the only reason I had picked this particular room. The window itself was also looking at a particularly overgrown part of the garden — more intentional than accidental considering the number of slaves responsible for garden maintenance alone. </p><p>The number of servants was also a part of why I had chosen this exact moment to sneak out. It was just an hour until dawn, late enough for the nobles to stay up, at least in the garden, and too early for the servants to wake up and start the preparations for the next day. </p><p>Perfect time to skulk around in the garden. And as an added bonus, it gave the servants the opportunity to handle the noble ladies that had enjoyed my attention all night and put them in a presentable position before their husbands arrived from their political discussions. </p><p>Unfortunately, getting out of the building and into the courtyard without raising an alarm was just the start of my journey.</p><p>A journey that promised to be more difficult than I first assumed.  </p><p>I was unprepared for how bright the garden would have been at this particular hour considering even if the nobles were awake, they would have been inside rather than experiencing the morning chill. </p><p>Yet, the garden was still well-lit, maybe just in case a noble decided to enjoy a late-night walk. Unfortunately, that was just the beginning of my challenges. The guards were still patrolling near the outer walls, their attention split between the estate proper and the walls, their numbers surprisingly high. Even with a glance, I could see three patrol groups in my line of sight.</p><p>Luckily, even with their numbers, they were still showing signs of exhaustion and boredom, their attention focused more on the crude jokes they were sharing to impress their fellow guards than paying attention to their surroundings. </p><p>After all, what could go wrong in such a well-defended estate, stronger than a fort. </p><p>Their flickering attention allowed me to sneak toward one of the buildings closer to the outer walls of the estate, the same one where the imprisoned sorceress had been housed.</p><p>It was an interesting building, slightly different than the others around the estate. The rest of the buildings were built in a more traditional style, low, sprawling buildings with many windows and inner courtyards. Yet, the building that kept the sorceress in was different. It was a tall, rectangular building, reminding me more of a small fort than a comfortable house. </p><p>Still, with the help of my magic, it wouldn’t be hard to sneak in. Or at least, that was what I had the temerity of thinking before I came close enough to feel the magical stirrings of a ward. </p><p>It wasn’t that I was surprised that it was defended separately, but I was surprised because the ward was surprisingly weak. </p><p>It wasn’t that I expected one that could rival the ones surrounding the estate, designed to hold against a siege. Yet, those wards weren’t even strong enough to be compared to the wards that surrounded the inner buildings. Unfortunately, despite that, the ward was much more dangerous. </p><p>Because it was actively managed. </p><p>The difference between passive and actively managed wards was subtle, and only a few mages trained themselves hard enough to notice that small distinction. Ultimately, wards were structures that were created through a great effort, and only a few of them were flexible enough to be manipulated under a direct assault. </p><p>And often, doing so required a significant power differential between the attacking mage and the defending mage, making the ward pointless in the first place. </p><p>Unfortunately for me, there was one difference between actively managed wards and passively managed wards. </p><p>It was much harder to manipulate actively managed wards subtly. </p><p>“Maybe I should return,” I murmured, unable to measure the relative merits of disappearing completely and leaving for Egypt early, but it was nothing more than a momentary fancy. After all, there was no guarantee that Egypt was any safer than Rome, and here, at least I was aware of the culture enough to manipulate my way in. </p><p>With a sigh, I pulled more of my mana to the surface, carefully enveloping the building with a soft aura, weaker than a misty wind, ready to pull back and escape back to the estate at the first sign of an alarm. </p><p>It turned out that the lady luck hadn’t screwed me up completely, as a direct examination revealed that the wards were not erected to prevent attacks from outside. Instead, they were inward-facing. </p><p>“Smart,” I murmured. After all, holding a sorceress, even if it was one not focused on combat, was hard safest thing. An actively managed ward to catch any breach would help to keep a mage strong enough to be qualified as a mobile siege weapon.  </p><p>Yet, it was hardly the safest way of keeping a sorceress a prisoner. Several wards to completely immobilize her, or potions to keep her unconscious… Tricks like that certainly would have been better to keep her prisoner, yet, they chose to monitor her with active wards, effectively assigning several competent mages full time, risking their lives. </p><p>Ironically, it didn’t even require the sorceress to take any action to risk the lives of those mages, because managing wards actively was a difficult task. Not because it was magically exhausting, as unless the mage was forcing a change, it was hardly more exhausting than a cantrip. And normally, that would be it, because the mental load of the spells almost never was the bottleneck. </p><p>Unfortunately, for the unlucky sods that were responsible, the active wards were one of the very few exceptions to the rule. As a mage was forced to monitor the wards for hours and hours, the mental weight of observing the structure got harder and harder, an accidental slip enough to damage the image significantly. </p><p>Altogether, it was a very perplexing strategic choice, especially that, even with all the risks it discounted, it was hardly the most efficient strategy. If they were afraid of the sorceress breaking out, they would have used the more intensive methods like forced sleep, and if they were confident she would not act, they would have used a passive yet stronger ward structure to make it easier. </p><p>And if they needed to keep her magic capabilities intact yet they were still afraid of her breaking, they could have put the residence out of the main wards of the estate, making any potential breakout much less dangerous. </p><p>Even for a spectacularly-strong Patrician House like House Junia, a sorceress on the loose was not a simple affair. </p><p>Yet, they had done none of it, instead of risking the death of several competent mages to maintain a perplexing protection strategy. I was tempted to assume it was just a stupid decision, but it was a dangerous assumption to make, especially when a House proved itself by dominating Roman politics for more than a thousand years. </p><p>They clearly had a reason for this particular choice. </p><p>And, unfortunately, I needed to poke that area to see there was nothing out of ordinary. </p><p>With a sigh, I started to strengthen the mana mist around the building, slowly starting to poke the wards, my touch soft enough not to alert the mage responsible for maintaining the wards. If the wards were designed to defend against outside threats, it would have been impossible even for me, but their design gave me significant leeway. </p><p> Yet, I could feel my palms sweating. </p><p>It was time for a magical challenge. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The mark of existence for another source of Divine Spark was not exactly welcome, especially since it pushed an already-complicated situation to a new level, making Aviada’s disappearance an even bigger puzzle to solve. </p><p>Like things weren’t difficult enough with the elements acting wild and women disappearing behind the reach of the system. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t leave the area immediately after discovering the divine spark. I stuck around, spending the next couple of hours doing my best to discover some new evidence. I had analyzed the ground to understand how the out-of-control mana affected the area, did my best to take samples of the weakening shadow of the Divine Spark — which was particularly hard as the System had already devoured most of it — and recording other extraordinary details, no matter how insignificant they sounded. </p><p>I even took the risk to shift back to the Arcana dimension a couple of times to see if I could get any more clues — only after setting several guidance beacons to ensure I could return without a problem, naturally, no matter how much mana those temporary beacons burned — but the twirling magical energies was even worse in terms of retaining evidence. </p><p>Ultimately, all my extra work was in vain, yielding no new clues.  </p><p>Aviada was gone, lost in a place where I strongly doubted the System didn’t work, leaving nothing other than a bunch of clues too complicated to properly decipher, from wild elements to the ghost of a Divine Spark with a mysterious sharp nature. </p><p>Even worse, I couldn’t even understand the weird reaction of the elements. The easiest assumption about their nature was to say they were real elementals, but that wouldn’t be correct. First of all, elemental beings were denoted by their excessive purity, and those rainbow-fires and chaotic water were not exactly pure. </p><p>They were strong, far stronger than any elemental I had read about in the library, but they weren’t exactly pure in terms of their nature. </p><p>More importantly, elementals were feared because of their great intelligence, even the weaker ones having the survival instincts of animals — particularly mercurial and disobedient ones, even — which made them very difficult to control. </p><p>There was a reason I had used faux-elementals that worked strictly under my control despite burning a lot of mana rather than risking to summon real elementals.</p><p>Unfortunately, even there, I wasn’t able to come to a conclusion, because everything I knew about true elementals, I had learned from the books and notes of the other mages rather than my own experience — a direct consequence of lacking time to properly experiment with everything that was going on. </p><p>Yet, I also remembered the panic Janelor had shown when I dared to summon a faux elemental as a ride, which conflicted greatly with my direct experience until that moment. Ultimately, the existence of the wound in the Arcana dimension, together with the clear link between those out-of-control elements with the mysterious world behind the Dome, was a more reasonable reaction. </p><p>There was nothing else to be done,” I decided, not in the mood to take yet another mystery about why elements might work differently under the control of the System compared to outside. </p><p>I had more than enough problems already. </p><p>With a sigh as I summoned another air elemental mount for myself — though not before summoning a much smaller one, just to test whatever that made the elements go crazy was certainly gone — grabbed Carla, and went back to Silver Spires. </p><p>[-1190 Mana]</p><p>With the meeting with the headmistress coming closer, there was no point wasting time. While traveling, I kept Carla unconscious. Only when I arrived, I woke her up. </p><p>“Huh, we’re back,” she murmured sleepily as she glanced around, realizing the danger was truly gone. </p><p>“Yes, we are,” I said. The sleep clearly helped her after her close call with death. </p><p>“What about Aviada?” she asked, though this time, she didn’t panic as much despite the worry tinging her tone, clearly encouraged by my display of skill. </p><p>“She’s far away, so it’s going to take a while for her to return,” I explained once again rather than dismissing her. I needed her calm, after all. The last thing I needed was for her to go around, poking things unnecessarily.</p><p>“What should I say?” she asked.  </p><p>“I’ll handle informing the school, you just need to explain the fate of your patrol. If they poke, tell them you were already too far away to notice anything. Try not to talk about the rainbow nature of the fire, though,” I said. If that was as extraordinary as I assumed, revealing that would only make things more complicated.  </p><p>“But what about the other survivors. They had escaped quickly, but the flames were too big for them to miss,” she countered. </p><p>It was a good point. In the mess, I had neglected that part. I thought a bit about the merits of finding them and ordering them to silence using the authority of the headmistress, but after some time, I decided against it. </p><p>Unless I killed them, one of them would definitely leak it, and while it was something I wanted to keep secret, I didn’t want to keep it secret by killing several innocent people. </p><p>Even if they were cowardly enough to abandon Aviada. </p><p>“You can talk about it,” I finally said. After all, I had no real reason to put that much effort to keep that secret, especially since doing so had the risk of alerting the others to more than a few inconsistent reports from a lost patrol. </p><p>“What about the sword?” Carla commented. “Should I talk about how extraordinary it was?” </p><p>“The sword?” I asked, my thoughts coming to a halt as she mentioned it. “Why don’t you explain to me first what exactly happened, and why the sword is important?” I said, as a frown appeared on my face. Up until now, she didn’t mention the sword. </p><p>I wanted to be angry at her, but considering I had magically calmed her down before putting her to sleep forcibly as I dealt with more urgent things, it would be a bit hypocritical to do so. Ultimately,  it was my oversight. </p><p>That didn’t prevent annoyance from rising, of course. It was just pointed inwardly. </p><p>“It happened when the creature attacked. When she first started fighting, it didn’t look like she had a winning chance, so the surviving members of our patrol started running away. I stayed, trying to support her from a distance, but the defeat seemed inevitable…” she said, trembling softly as she remembered just how close she had come to death. </p><p>“Then?” I asked, prompting her to continue. </p><p>“She shouted, and her sword started glowing. Just like that, Aviada started swinging her sword faster and faster, each swings pushing the creature back. But when the creature attacked her with some kind of flame attack…” </p><p>“And…” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured. “That part is a blur. I remember Aviada swinging her sword, and with its glow, the sword managed to cut the flames. But when she cut the flames, it turned into an explosion. When the flames fell, Aviada was nowhere to be seen, and the place was covered by those rainbow flames. Then, you arrived.” </p><p>The sword had clearly reacted with Empowerment perk, I thought even as a frown appeared on my face, not sure whether I would be surprised or not. </p><p>In a way, it was not surprising, because I had used the sword, and knew it was superior to anything I could craft without improving my skills even further. It was a complicated weapon, with many mysterious enchantments limiting its usefulness to anyone but the designated wielder. For it to hide such a mysterious feature was not impossible.</p><p>Yet, I was also surprised, because the last time I had used and analyzed the sword, I was significantly lacking in terms of crafting knowledge, and assumed that while it was a very good sword, ultimately, its mysteries wouldn’t stay ahead of me. </p><p>Aviada had always been the focus. The sword had been just an afterthought. </p><p>However, Carla’s story, along with the evidence I had collected told me a different story. Aviada’s mysterious victory, the disappearance of Empowerment after usage, the wound on the Dome, even the existence of that wild elements… </p><p>If her story was accurate, Avaida’s sword somehow forcefully took the Empowerment, and somehow used that not only to kill the monster, but also to create wounds in the borders of the system. </p><p>A temporary one, but I doubted that trivialized the extent of the achievement. </p><p>It wasn’t the worst of it, however. It wasn’t hard to guess that the sudden ability the sword had displayed was tightly linked to the sharp Divine Spark I had managed to discover. </p><p>I had worked so hard to find a source, only to miss the one next to me. </p><p>Of course, there was no guarantee whether the sword itself was the source. There was much circumstantial evidence against it as well. I had examined the sword several times, and while I clearly missed several important details about the sword, both me and the System failing to detect Divine Spark hidden in the sword was a stretch.  </p><p>Ultimately, however, it was impossible to make a decision. </p><p>“Do not mention anything about the sword, it’ll only make her a target,” I said to Carla. I had no idea whether the sword had the Divine Spark, or it was an indirect effect created by Empowerment that I was reading inaccurately.</p><p>Still, before I could delve into it, it was best to keep it secret. </p><p>Even if Aviada was currently lost in the distant lands. </p><p>Luckily, I had two sources I could subtly question about the mysteries behind the event. Conveniently, I even had a meeting with the headmistress a few minutes later. </p><p>I just needed to find a good excuse to question her without revealing the truth of the event.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>I was already flaring my mana as I stepped back to the material dimension, afraid that crazy fire and water would have driven closer. Considering the impact they had on the mana, I had no intention of testing their impact directly. </p><p>Luckily, they were still tangling in the distance with all the intelligence and control of rabid animals, giving me a chance the focus on the more immediate problem. </p><p>The corrosive energies of the Arcana dimension, threatening to melt both my equipment and my skin. </p><p>I flared the mana I had gathered, dispelling the corrosive energies that could damage my body more. My clothing and the rest of my equipment weren’t as lucky, I noted as tried to save my clothing once again, but only being half successful. Helpless, I had reinforced the gaps with mana and temporary conjured material replicating the trick Janelor was quite the fan of.</p><p>[-690 Mana] </p><p>Unlike her, I didn’t construct the spell matrix excessively lightly, so the conjured material would hold a few days. And, luckily, this time, I wasn’t carrying anything I couldn’t replace easily — and only because I didn’t have time to rearm myself after the previous teleport attempt destroyed my weapons. </p><p>I really needed to put some time to make my instantaneous teleportation ability useful. Not just because it was a very functional utility ability, but it was obvious that I had no hope of following Aviada’s disappearance without perfecting it. </p><p>The chaos that was behind the dome, as revealed by the wound, was rather scary. I couldn’t help but frown as thought about that. I had known that the next crisis wouldn’t have been too far away, but I didn’t expect it to arrive without giving me chance to get a full night’s sleep. </p><p>Nor did I expect Aviada to be the source of it. </p><p>Apparently, I was still too optimistic. </p><p>“What happened,  is Aviada well? Where’s she?” Carla asked as she dashed forward to me, taking a step into the wards I had created without care. </p><p>I shook my head even as I pulled my gaze away from the battle of elements, turning my gaze toward her, barely holding myself back from giving her a lesson about the perils of walking into mysterious wards. </p><p>I decided against it after a momentary consideration. “Don’t worry,” I started instead, wanting to calm her down. “I have discovered that she’s still alive and well.” My words were only partial truth, as while I had detected Aviada was still alive at that moment, I was having significant trouble feeling her as the wound continued to close. </p><p>I had no way of divining her fate once it was completely cut other than wishing.  </p><p>But there was no benefit to Carla knowing that. Whatever Aviada was facing was not something her archer friend could help directly. And even if she tried to rouse the school, it was clearly not an issue that could be the rest of the faculty — at least not by anyone she could talk to. </p><p>It was a topic that even Titania knew precious little about, making the headmistress and Janelor the only reliable sources of information, neither a common student from the warrior department could access.  </p><p>And that assumed she knew what to say in the first place. </p><p>“How can we save her?” she asked, her panic replaced by enthusiasm as she heard about her status.</p><p>I took a sigh as I turned my attention to the battling elements once more, noting that they were getting weaker — but not at a speed that would make me calm down. Moreover, the water was once again starting to lose against the fire, so I reinforced it with another flash of mana. </p><p>[-382 Mana]  </p><p>“Unfortunately, due to a magical resonance, she had experienced a cascading teleportation failure, and it’ll take a while for me to go and bring her back, so, you should keep it a secret,” I said, not above reinforcing the impression with a judicious application of my Charisma, enough to ensure she wouldn’t go around trying to organize the weaker instructors to act. </p><p>The situation was complicated enough without others poking around, or worse, the spies in the school getting wind of the extraordinary nature of Aviada’s disappearance. I didn’t expect them to be able to follow Aviada, but it would be a problem once I successfully saved Aviada. </p><p>I steadfastly avoided any possibility of failure. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured as she fell silent, not knowing what to say, joining me to watch the dance of the elements. I was reasonably confident that even if the fire managed to defeat the water, it would fade away, but reasonably confident was markedly different from absolute confidence.</p><p>And the world was dangerous enough without introducing out-of-control fires with the ability to burn everything, including pure mana. </p><p>“Why is this fire still burning?” she asked, her voice calm. Too calm, even. Suppressing the shock medically made her effectively drunk, I realized. “Should we try to extinguish it?” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll handle it. You should rest a bit after such a trying ordeal,” I said, and before she could answer, I put my hand on her head, sending her to sleep and healing her wounds simultaneously. </p><p>[-281 Mana]</p><p>The last thing I needed as I carefully examined a dangerous phenomenon was a functionally drunk warrior that might decide to poke things exactly at the wrong moment. </p><p>Instead, I spread my mana carefully, examining the ongoing battle, the elements reacting with a destructiveness I had never seen before. I observed them, not only to control the battle, but also to understand whether there was any trick I could learn from their destructiveness. Unfortunately, that didn’t seem to be the case, as before I could pole poke their structure to get a better feel, my mana evaporated with the aftershocks of their fight. </p><p>So, I focused on healing myself, which cost me a nice chunk of the mana I had managed to recover as the wounds resisted my attempts to heal them. </p><p>[-2890 Mana]</p><p>[HP: 6528 / 6528]</p><p>I had no idea what the turbulence that escaped from the wound, but there was no doubt about the danger buried in its nature. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have taken that much mana to erase a glancing hit, one that didn’t even connect with me properly. </p><p>Even with the system, the world was dangerous. </p><p>After that, I waited for the fire and water to slowly extinguish themselves, and once they disappeared, I even went back to the Arcana dimension to check the status of the wound, though this time, I managed to step back before I could receive anything other than cosmetic damage, which was healed easily. </p><p>[-296 Mana]</p><p>Both the wound, and the elemental chaos in the Arcana dimension were gone. Only then did I dare to step into the area that had been utterly destroyed by the flames to do some magical tests. </p><p>Not that I expected much after the destructive battle, aftershocks enough to destroy the spells I tried to construct. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the area was in total flux, the mana dancing chaotically before the System managed to absorb it back. </p><p>Yet, the remaining echoes were interesting. The fire had left, for the lack of a better term, its shadow behind, and the sensation was certainly not something I had come close to replicating by fire magic despite my significant expertise backed by my stats. </p><p>Yet, some things were clear. It was not something that could be easily replicated by a simple spell, as it had an animalistic feel to it. I would have assumed somehow the beast Carla had mentioned was responsible for that feeling, but I could feel the same echo from the water element, whose source was my spell.  </p><p>Pity I had bigger priorities than delving into the exact nature of those interesting changes. </p><p>I didn’t expect to find anything else, but I still continued to search, not wanting to miss a clue due to laziness. </p><p>It was a good thing that I did, because, after five minutes, I found something even more interesting. The residue of a new type of energy, familiar yet different at the same time, distinct enough for me to properly categorize it even if I couldn’t identify its exact nature. </p><p>The Divine Spark.</p><p>Or, more accurately, A Divine Spark, because even if the residue that remained was too small to be properly interacted — more of a shadow than anything with a substance — it was clear that I wasn’t dealing with the Divine Spark of Light or Darkness. It was something different, with some kind of edge that was lacking by both. </p><p>Sharp was the best I could describe the shadow it left. </p><p>And just like that, things got even more complicated. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 7830 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Naomi’s sudden freeze as I patted the seat next to me was beautiful, as if she just realized the implications of our deficient clothing, “Come on, the food is getting cold,” I said, which was enough to trigger her move. </p><p>She tried to keep some distance in a vain effort to maintain a sense of propriety, but considering our current state of dress, it seemed to be in vain. </p><p>And if that was her aim, putting her sweatpants on would have been a more reasonable strategy. Yet, she didn’t even suggest that, or tried to move away once I slid closer to her and closing the distance, limiting herself to a beautiful tremble. </p><p>She was simply marvelous. </p><p>“You certainly earned your slice,” I said as I grabbed one, and brought it to her face. </p><p>“I can eat it myself.” </p><p>“I know, but since I had eaten the previous one from your hand, it’s only fair,” I answered, bringing the slice even closer. Her shyness wasn’t enough to finally take the bite of the delicious yet unhealthy slice that cost her more than she expected. </p><p>“Delicious,” she murmured after she swallowed it. </p><p>“All the junk food is,” I answered. “Too bad we have to earn with extra training if we want to enjoy it.” </p><p>“It’s the cost of living healthy,” she said before taking another bite. </p><p>“You’re right,” I said even as I wrapped my free arm around her waist, pulling her closer. I had been using my left hand to feed her pizza on purpose despite her sitting on my right. It allowed me to hug her before she could realize it. I caressed her stomach gently while her chewing quickened, enjoying the silky feeling of her skin. “There are certainly some beautiful benefits to our obsessive training.” </p><p>“R-right,” she managed to stammer before she took another bite, using chewing as an excuse not to answer. Pity that it only made my fingers more adventurous, gently caressing her smooth belly, enjoying the benefits of her robust exercise habits. </p><p>“You don’t have to feel self-conscious, you know,” I whispered after she finished that bite. </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“I know you want to check my muscles as well,” I said as I grabbed her wrist and brought her hand to my chest. </p><p>“I-it’s not necessary,” she stammered, but she also didn’t pull her hand away once I let her hand go, which proved her words lacked any intent. </p><p>My hand returned to her waist, caressing her belly and sides while she took another bite. Before she could swallow it, her fingers started to move. Subtle, hard to notice at first, trailing my muscles like a thief afraid of being caught, but as my fingers started to get emboldened, tracing the edges of her panties before going back up, she followed suit. </p><p>Feeling a movement on the edge of my view — thanks to my quarterback training, giving me an amazing peripheral awareness — and when I threw a glance, I noticed Sarah trying to get a glimpse from there using a small mirror she found in the bathroom. </p><p>I threw her a smirk before turning my attention back to Nicole. If she wanted to spy on another friend, it was between them. </p><p>I turned my attention back to Naomi, who was about to take the last bite from the slice, and let my fingers move higher, this time teasing the underside of her bra, the thin fabric not enough to insulate the heat of her skin, making her squirm. </p><p>She chose to take the last bite rather than trying to extract herself from the situation, her fingers steadily caressing my muscles. She trailed my muscles softly as she moved lower and lower, making me smile with anticipation. </p><p>“And that was the last bite,” she murmured, smiling, but when I met her gaze, she was quick to avoid mine, once again failed by her self-confidence. </p><p>“Aren’t you forgetting something?” I said to her. </p><p>“What?” she whispered, barely able to let out a word once challenged. </p><p>“I helped you to clean your finger,” I said with a saucy smirk. “I was hoping that you would return the courtesy.” </p><p>Her intense blush was very noticeable even with her complexion. I barely held back a chuckle as she hesitantly wrapped her lips around my pinky, licking softly. Then, she moved to the other fingers at a steady pace, making my smirk widen further. </p><p>I let her finish attending to my second finger before I moved my fingers to my next objective, the clasp of her beautiful bra, but she noticed that only when I actually unhooked it. Her eyes widened in shock as she pulled back, but too late to prevent me from pulling it free, revealing her perfect breasts to my hungry gaze. </p><p>“I realized I had made a big mistake,” I explained. “Since I’m wearing only one piece of clothing, it’s unfair for you to wear two pieces? Right?” </p><p>“I don’t agree,” she managed to answer as she put one of her arms around her chest, though the movement was certainly slower than I expected, as if she was doing her best to give me a glimpse before cutting off the show. More importantly, she used only one, because the other was still busy caressing my torso steadily. “You’re a man, it’s not the same.” </p><p>“It’s just equality, sweetie,” I said even as I slid even closer to her, making it impossible for her to sit without leaning against my body. Though, if her sudden shift to lean against me fully was any indicator, she didn’t have a big problem with the idea. </p><p>“Nonsense,” she countered, her smile widening. “Both of them together don’t cover as much area as your boxers. I’m the one at a disadvantage in this deal.” </p><p>“A good point,” I admitted, amused by the sudden expression of panic on her face, far bigger than earlier, when I pulled off her bra. She opened her mouth in a hurry, no doubt trying to dissuade me from my attempts to equalize things by letting her wear more. </p><p>I said nothing, curious what she would say, only for her beautiful mouth to make no sound, her shyness preventing her from saying something so outward. I waited for a few seconds, curious whether she would say anything, but only defeated silence radiated off her, like a runner who slipped and fell just a second before breaking the world record. </p><p>It was an expression that would have received my pity under any different circumstance, but here, I only chuckled. “It’s time to equalize things,” I said, and grabbed the edge of my boxers. I held there for a second, waiting for her sudden sadness to be replaced by shock before I pushed down, revealing my enthusiastic nakedness to her gaze. </p><p>“I don’t think you can complain about it being unfair anymore, can you?” I asked. </p><p>“No, I can’t,” she answered, surprisingly lacking even a hint of surprise as she looked down, enjoying the sight of my full mast. I said nothing for a moment, letting her enjoy the view. Though I certainly didn’t expect her wandering fingers to push the boundaries with each pass, getting closer and closer to the base. </p><p>Pity, she lacked the daring to just grab it. </p><p>I glanced at the bathroom door once more, only to see Sarah still watching from there, holding the mirror with her hand — through it was shaking rather suspiciously. </p><p>\"Well,” I murmured as I turned my attention back to Naomi, no matter how interesting the secret activities Sarah was conducting, tempting me to have another visit to the bathroom. “You can’t complain about it being unfair, but I certainly can,” I whispered. </p><p>The expression that bloomed on her face, arousal and shock mixing with panic, was simply beautiful, especially when I tightened my hold over her waist and pulled her onto my lap without a warning. </p><p>I especially enjoyed the way she trembled as her leg rubbed against my erection, her beautiful brown eyes widening beautifully. “I don’t know…” she whispered. </p><p>“What do you not know?” I asked even as I brought my face closer to her, my breath caressing her earlobe. “You were the one who claimed that the situation was unfair, so I took the only step that was available for me to fix it. Unfortunately, it threw the balance the other way too much, so I’m seeking to solve the issue once and for all. Is it wrong?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she whispered, but considering she made no attempt to pull away from my lap, it was more than sufficient as an answer, though the confirmation from the way she wiggled as she tried to settle like she intended to stay for a long time certainly helped. </p><p>Her numerous ‘accidental’ brushes to my shaft as she tried to settle didn’t hurt as well. </p><p>“Don’t you?” I asked even as I hooked my fingers around her panties, which didn’t earn much of a protest as I started dragging them down, but not before leveraging the position to maul her beautiful ass for a fleeting second, giving her a taste of what was about to come as long as she stayed on course. </p><p>She reacted, of course, but not in a way that could be construed as negative. One of her hands reached to my neck, using it as leverage as she raised her hips slightly, allowing me to slide off her panties without issue, though the moment they fell on the floor, she crossed her legs, giving me only a glimpse of her beautiful entrance. </p><p>Yet, despite hiding her own treasure, her fingers wrapped around my girth, once again fueling the inequality of our situation. </p><p>“Such a naughty girl,” I whispered, enjoying her promising shiver. </p><p>It was going to be fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Forty minutes after I left the class I was at the fitness center of the stadium, already dressed in my exercise clothes, warming up on one of the treadmills near the entrance, using the opportunity to get ready as I waited for the conditioning coach to arrive.</p><p>I already made more than the necessary number of enemies in the team. I could do without angering my conditioning coach as well. </p><p>Not that exercising was a chore. I had always liked to exert myself physically, and the fitness center of the football team was the single best location I had the pleasure of training. Every single piece of equipment was new enough to gleam, underlining just how much money was being wasted for an organization with a losing record.</p><p>Yet, as the treadmill rolled under me with the smoothness of the butter, giving me the smoothest running experience I had ever experienced, I wasn’t feeling particularly angry about the waste. Especially since the fitness center was completely empty — Mondays were the dedicated rest day for the team. </p><p>At least, physically. We still had the tactical meeting after the classes, which would have scared me shitless without the assistance of my Traits. Learning the playbook of a new team was hardly the simplest challenge. </p><p>I stepped down the treadmill when the clocks hit ten, not wanting to exhaust myself too much before the actual test began. Yes, the Recovery and Stamina gave me a significant boost on the baseline, but I doubted just the first level was enough to put me on an equal playing field with the players, especially the starters. </p><p>The more explosive I could act, the better. </p><p>Since the coordinator was yet to arrive, I checked my phone, curious about the latest gossip on social media, in particular, how the public perception of the weird triangle between me, Megan, and Kevin was evolving. </p><p>‘OMG, the nerds strike back,’ read one of them, simple yet devastating.  </p><p>‘It’s incredible that our backup quarterback loses his girlfriend to a new player on his first day. What a scandal,’ said the other. </p><p>‘Isn’t it ironic that the peacock that is responsible for the losing streak of our team had lost to a chess player,’ read another. </p><p>‘So, the football team had another Casanova, is there no hope for us yet,’ said yet another post, followed by several sad emojis. </p><p>I smiled as I read the comments, especially the fight that was going on the comments, involving a great number of students, including several players from the team, both defensive and offensive players. </p><p>Interestingly, I had noticed a significant difference in the narrative since the party. It somehow into some kind of heated battle between me and Kevin, while positioning Megan as the precious reward we were fighting for.</p><p>I doubted it was accidental, so I started looking for the news.  </p><p>Interestingly, Pattern Recognition showed its usefulness once more in a very different aspect, allowing me to notice a lot of messages written by different accounts, yet sharing a suspiciously consistent wording and message, reinforcing the impression that it was a manly seduction battle between me and Kevin. </p><p>Even the timing of those posts was suspiciously rhythmic. </p><p>I had a feeling that Megan was behind the whole thing, using the opportunity to get herself as a reputation as a blonde bombshell, with an added dash of a bimbo. Why she tried to create such an impression, I had no idea, nor did I care much. </p><p>I was more interested in the sudden performance increase from my Pattern Recognition in a way it didn’t work earlier with the news, which reinforced the assumption that it was more about the weakness of the current level of Pattern Recognition rather than incompetence on its nature.  </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have too much time to waste considering it, because I heard someone calling for me. “Hey, are you Terry?” </p><p>“That’s me,” I said even as I looked at the source, only to see a surprisingly sexy Latina lady just a few feet away from me, a tablet in hand. </p><p>My initial guess was she was in her late twenties. She wasn’t dressed well, but in a way that suggested it was an intentional choice. After all, the loose polo shirt and even looser sweatpants were both far too ill-fitting to be anything but intentional. Especially combined with her lack of makeup. </p><p>Yet, even they weren’t enough to hide the fact she hid an impressively curvy body underneath.</p><p>However, after the initial glance, I forced myself to keep my gaze up, recognizing the tight expression on her face. She clearly didn’t appreciate even a glance down. Understandable, as the football world was not famous for its egalitarian nature, and as a young woman, she needed to be extra harsh to be taken seriously. </p><p>And I doubted that her beauty made things easier. </p><p>“Good morning,” I said calmly, acting unaware of her disapproving glare. There was no benefit in confronting her directly. “I’m guessing you’re my conditioning coach?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, her tone biting, as if she was challenging me to reject her position. “Is there a problem?” </p><p>“Not at all,” I said. “I have warmed up with a fifteen-minute jog, and some active stretching,” I started before giving a quick breakdown of the moves I had used. </p><p>“Good, you’re proactive,” she said as she nodded, her tone significantly calmer. Though I doubted just how badly my dear teammates had been acting around her for my quick explanation to count as a positive interaction, I had no idea. “I hope you’re ready for an exhausting day,” she said, her tone still challenging, like she expected me to disagree. </p><p>“You’re the coach,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>My instant acceptance surprised her. She looked like she had swallowed several select words she had prepared in advance. “That warm-up is nothing enough. Let’s start with a proper three-mile warm-up run. Follow me to the field.” </p><p>“As you wish, coach,” I said. A three-mile run was rather excessive as a warm-up, but I had a feeling that it was a deliberate choice, so I swallowed my words. </p><p>I wondered just how many stupid discussions she had to deal with from the other football players to defend her authority as a coach if that was her reaction to a calm opening. If she was in any other sport, I might have blamed her for acting like a victim, but, considering the personality and the sense of entitlement of the average football player, it was hard to think her attitude wasn’t warranted. </p><p>Luckily, I was prepared for the possibility, and brought my cleats along. I grabbed my bag and followed her to the field, doing my best to keep my gaze away from the swaying of her hips, to avoid an even accidental misunderstanding. </p><p>It was ironic that it wasn’t the worst opening with the coaching staff. Compared to an incompetent head coach who had got his job through one of the worst examples of nepotism I had ever seen, I suspected, a beautiful woman with an annoying attitude was hardly a disappointment. </p><p>“Let’s start, twenty laps,” she ordered said as she gestured the field, and I started running. Twenty laps were certainly excessive, but complaining would bring me no benefit.</p><p>That didn’t prevent the annoyance to rise in my heart as her first order came the moment I started running. “Faster!” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” I answered, keeping that annoyance away from my face and my tone. Running faster during a warm-up run was useless. She was clearly stretching her authority, testing the limits of my obedience. And while I didn’t appreciate being a target of her experiments, I had already made an enemy of the head coach and the offensive side of the team.  </p><p>I didn’t have the luxury of alienating even more of the coaching staff — especially people that worked for Coach Bill. </p><p>“Faster,” she ordered once more as I was running the fifth lap, and I followed her order once more. It was better, because forcing me to go faster slowly started to turn it into a test of endurance rather than just a pointlessly-extended warm-up session. </p><p>Additionally, it gave me a more methodical way of testing the impact of my Stamina and Recovery Traits. When I finished lap fifteen, even with the hard pace she had asked from me, my breath was steady.  </p><p>The physical Traits were working even better than I expected. Even without them, I could have completed fifteen laps with this pace, but I would have shown some signs of exhaustion. </p><p>“Faster,” she ordered, and I picked even more speed during the last five. I wasn’t sprinting, but it wasn’t too far below as well, which meant that, even with the help of my Traits, I was feeling the bite of the exhaustion. </p><p>Yet, I managed to resist the temptation to slow down, not with the assistance of my Traits, but through pure willpower. </p><p>I managed to finish the last lap before collapsing on the turf, my breathing wild. Yet, a satisfied smile was on my face, happy to complete my first challenge. </p>",

    "content": "<p>With the assistance of my Traits, I was able to create the program I required in a shockingly short amount of time. </p><p>Unfortunately, even with the Traits, there was a limit for the impromptu program I had modified, its main performance limited to open-source news crawler, and more importantly, the horrible state of my painfully low-performance laptop. </p><p>Not the best tool to unravel an ancient mystery, but it was what I was limited to. As the cries of my laptop rose, running the program, I stood up, filled a bucket with water, and left the room. Since I had about an hour to kill, I might as well wash the car, at least getting rid of the worst of the mud that stuck to its surface as I drove away from the crime scene. </p><p>“Not a bad car,” I murmured as I carefully washed it with a brush. Pity that, despite the comfort, it was extremely boring to drive it. “I’m lucky,” I murmured as I continued to wash. After all, it wasn’t like I had the money to buy anything but another rust bucket to replace it, which would give me all the excitement I would need. </p><p>Washing the car took almost an hour, making me go back to my room to refill the bucket several times — which also allowed me to enter some new keywords into the program before launching another instance. </p><p>After I had finished, I returned to my room, reading more articles about the fire while the program tried to finish, trying to find something useful. Unfortunately, the chatter about a mysterious cult fire was hardly something that could be navigated easily. </p><p>When I finally received a ping from my computer, I was glad to abandon my phone, browsing the results the program had compiled. </p><p>This time, I wasn’t reading the news it had managed to extract, as it was hardly something I could parse in an evening. Even reading all the articles that were written about one little event was impossible, let alone all cult appearances in America. </p><p>No, I was delving into the numbers behind the news, trying to analyze the meta-data behind it, which, if used appropriately, could reveal an impressive amount of information about the topic or the target. </p><p>There was a reason both the tech companies — to sell the products and brainwash people to stay online longer — and the governments — to spy on people much more accurately — were obsessively focused on analyzing the meta-data produced by people rather than the content of their messages. </p><p>Of course, to achieve that level of accuracy, they employed thousands of genius coders, built dedicated data centers big enough to rival a football stadium, and even created their own backdoors to the physical devices people used to increase the accuracy of the data they collected. </p><p>A modified open-source program, an old computer, and the public data I could gather from the web were hardly the same scale. It could hardly document all the cults and identify which cults were just ordinary conmen, and which had actual supernatural ties. </p><p>That didn’t mean the results were completely useless, far from it. Even the simplest things, like the increase in the number of incidences. </p><p>The first pattern I had noticed was a significant spike in the results of the cults. Of course, when I say significant, I wasn’t talking like ten times, but a percentage increase. To be certain, twenty-one percent increase over two years based on the keywords I had searched. </p><p>It wasn’t a horribly high number, certainly not enough to trigger a government panic — especially since they hardly cared about the type of the people targeted by cults in the first place — but it was still a significant amount. </p><p>However, as I continued delving deeper into the results, I had found something scarier. Checking the police reports — only for the cities those records were public, which, unfortunately, not many — I had noticed another scary detail, a spike in the number of missing people, and the number of fires that were suspected as arson. </p><p>The percentage increase on those events wasn’t as scary as the number of cult incidents, but considering the number of people who burned their own homes for insurance money and people kidnapped for other things, the percentage increase wasn’t as critical. </p><p>The scary thing was not the percentage, but the timeline. Unlike the cult news, each city had a different time for the sudden jump they had experienced. For some, it was barely six months ago, for some, it went back almost a decade. </p><p>It wasn’t the most accurate data, but with the perspective my supernatural experience gave me, combined with what I know, it didn’t paint a calming picture.  </p><p>I tried to read some of the information released to the public, but it didn’t give me much. There were too many cases, and more importantly, I had too many interactions with the police in my youth to trust anything they had published. I had no doubt that the public version of the cases was sanitized to the death to absolve the guilt of any involved police officer, even if that meant erasing — or officially, using editorial discretion — each and every useful piece of information that could help the case to be solved. </p><p>I didn’t let that stop me, of course. I have scoured over the reports, news, and every relevant nugget while the program continued to run, providing me with more and more information. I had hoped that the Pattern Recognition would have helped me, but it was either too weak to work on such an unstructured topic, or it didn’t work as well on an area I wasn’t competent in. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, however, it meant that when the night sky started to turn blue, I only had an educated guess that whatever was at the root of the event, it had started several years ago, and for some reason, started to spread faster two years ago. </p><p>Such a change was hardly the most calming… </p><p>“Just the thing I needed to make things fun,” I murmured as I threw myself into my bed. I had a meeting with the conditioning coach at ten, and, at this point, getting a few hours of sleep was more important than trying to get some marginal benefits from my research. </p><p>If there was one benefit to a night filled with mind-numbing research and analysis, it was the assistance it gave to my sleep. I fell asleep the moment my face touched my pillow, only to wake up to my alarm. </p><p>“It’s just nine,” I murmured as I raised my head, barely three hours of sleep I caught hardly enough, but I still managed to rise to my feet forcibly.  </p><p>I looked around, expecting to see my guide floating next to me, bored, encouraging me to stand up. Yet, she was still absent. </p><p>It would be a lie to say a part of me didn’t cheer at the possibility, trying to convince the rest of my mind that it was just a fever dream, one that I finally woke up. Unfortunately, all I needed to disappoint that optimist part of my brain was to close my eyes and reach to that special place in my mind, housing both the System and my guide. </p><p>I focused on the feedback, one bright and throbbing softly like a heartbeat — though it lacked the previous intensity where she had pulled back to hide from the party, suggesting she was far from being recovered. Her presence was stronger than the last night, but only marginally so, far from the horrible source of migraine that I experienced the previous attempt, trying to burst free. This time, she felt like a gentle sparrow, resting.  </p><p>Yet, even as I focused on the mental space, I could see her continuing the devouring the thin line of Intent the continuing gossip about my naughty achievement provided. </p><p>Extinguishing the fire clearly took a lot from her. </p><p>Understandable, as the magical fire had created an overwhelming sight, and everything she had done up to that point shouted she was far from her prime. I didn’t know how strong her prime was, but considering she had name-dropped more than one Greek god in casual terms, I doubted her magical power ceiling was particularly low. </p><p>However, I didn’t have much time to waste on idle musings, so I focused on the other part of the equation. The System. </p><p>I reached to trigger its Trait-bestowing ability, only for nothing to happen. Not too surprising as I could see my guide devouring the generated intent despite the ongoing gossip. Though, I couldn’t help but feel like it was a waste. </p><p>After all, Monday morning was the apex of the pointless gossip, a clutch people used to dispel their Monday syndrome. </p><p>“I want my Traits,” I murmured petulantly as I closed my eyes, trying to tap into the flow of Intent to change direction, at least partially redirecting it toward the system instead, but after several attempts. With my situation,  getting stronger was much more important than quickening her awakening — especially since she had proved that she would push me into danger without even blinking.</p><p>Preventing her from waking up was too optimistic, but at least, I wanted to be as strong as possible before she awakened and pushed me into another dangerous situation.  </p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how much I tried to focus, I wasn’t able to redirect the flow of the Intent. Maybe I was doing something wrong, or maybe her pull was simply stronger than the pressure I could generate with my inexperience. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, however, the continuous failure was enough to make me stop. Not because I was particularly discouraged, but because  I had a meeting to go to, and before that, I needed to eat my breakfast.  </p><p>I grabbed a protein bar, the only thing I could digest before the training session before packing the rest of my stuff and going to my car. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until the conditioning test was completed, and they started delivering my meal plan. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You earned a proper reward,” I whispered to the beautiful queen, her eyes still wide after our searing kiss. </p><p>“Really?” she gasped, the hopeful tone of her voice especially beautiful. </p><p>I said nothing else as I grabbed her skirt, pushing it down to finally reveal her naked body to my anticipatory gaze, leaving the chains around her wrists as the only piece of coverage on her beautiful body — through a couple of inches around her forearm could hardly be counted as obstructing her amazing beauty. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to continue teasing her despite her surrender, driving the idea even deeper into her psyche before I finally buried myself in her wetness, but three things worked against that path. First, with everything going on, I needed to discuss a lot of boring politics with her, forcing me to spend my time more effectively. Second, she had finally folded, and it was certainly worthy enough for her to get a reward. </p><p>Third, even with everything that happened, it was very hard to resist the temptation of her busty body when she was chained against the wall, her magic blocked, quivering with unmet desire. </p><p>After all, I was only human. </p><p>“About the reward,” I whispered even as I put my hands on her knees, slowly widening them. “You need to take a big breath and relax, Your Majesty. I cannot do my job if you are too tense\" I said, acting like her state had nothing to do with me.</p><p>Sapphire froze for a moment, her lips parting open. I expected her to mention the exact point and blame me for her extended torture, only to be surprised pleasantly. “As … as you wish,” she whispered throatily as her legs widened, revealing her beautiful core for me. </p><p>I couldn’t help but look down in delight, though that expression slowly turned to awe as I slowly turned my gaze up, first catching her beautiful breasts heaving with her every breath, then her face, colored with absolute surrender. </p><p>“Too beautiful,” I whispered, which added another blush on her face, though different than the current pinkness of her body, underlined by shyness rather than desire. It was beautiful, because even just a couple of days ago, she would have been feeling fear and horror if she had been at this exact point, yet at the moment, the only thing she longed for was my touch. </p><p>Sometimes, I was truly awed by my own achievements. </p><p>I knelt down to get an even better view of her wetness, slowly leaning forward. “Now, let’s reward you,” I whispered as my tongue darted out, brushing against her core. </p><p>The moan that she let out threatened to break the walls of our little prison cell. </p><p>“Calm down, beautiful, it’s just a start,” I said, and my tongue darted out once more, brushing against her softness again to create another beautiful moan, this time even louder. </p><p>“I … I can’t help,” she murmured while I treated her wetness to slow yet sensual service, feeling a beautiful mixture of victory and a sense of worship at the beauty. </p><p>“You should,” I whispered back, enjoying the way her body started to tremble faster and faster with each measured brush of my tongue. My initial intention was to tease her slowly, in a measured manner, building another proper climax before exploding, but against the beauty of her bare pussy, those plans soon turned into ashes and cinder, replaced by a desire to bring her to a quick completion. </p><p>“That’s a good Queen,” I whispered as I put my hand on her inner thighs, parting her beautiful legs even further before letting my tongue cut loose, aggressively dancing around her knob for a while before dipping down to her wetness, filling my heart with desire and arousal. </p><p>Under the intense assault of my tongue, she drove steadily closer to an explosion, until her whole body clenched, and her juices started to flow. Then, a tremble so hard hit her body that her legs lost all their power, and she started collapsing despite the chains, helping her to hold her weight if she had used it properly. </p><p>I was quick to grab her waist, preventing painful collusion. “Don’t worry, Your Majesty,” I whispered into her ear even as I felt her weight over my body, happy to take that particular burden. “I’ll hold you.” </p><p>As she trembled, I pressed my lips over her neck, alternating between kisses and soft bites, leaving my mark. After all, she was mine, and there was no harm leaving physical evidence of it. Her soft yet appreciative moans suggested she didn’t have a particularly strong objection against the idea either. </p><p>“So,” I whispered into her ear as her trembles slowly subsided, breaking her reverie. </p><p>Her body jumped slightly, the familiar voice enough to remind her of the exact situation she was in. Yet, she didn’t try to pull back from my hug, showing just how far she accepted the idea of standing next to the same Dark Lord that had been her prisoner just a few days ago. </p><p> There was no doubt that she was hyper-aware of my presence next to her as our bodies rubbed against each other, her skin softer than silk. </p><p>I wanted to match her on the state of undress, but I didn’t want to stop hugging her beautiful body. Luckily, magic was useful for more things than escaping prisons and fighting against difficult odds, I thought as I flared my mana, which turned into a simple spell to remove all of my clothes simultaneously without forcing me to change position. </p><p>And Sapphire’s eyes widened at the display of power. Although the effect of the little magical trick was simple, achieving it without using any kind of pre-designed spell structure required quite a bit of finesse. Yet I achieved it easily despite my hands full with her beautiful body. </p><p>There was no harm in the occasional display of strength to remind her she had made the correct choice. Loyalty was something that needed to be nurtured carefully, supported by a combination of awe, desire, rewards, and the possibility of punishment. </p><p>“What do you want to do next, Your Majesty,” I whispered, still deliberately using her title, though, at this point, I didn’t even need to put a diminutive edge on my tone to make it a mocking reference. After all, her earlier declaration of obedience did that excellently. </p><p>“I…” she whispered, suddenly shy as the monumental nature of her earlier declaration hit her now that her mind wasn’t occupied by an overwhelming thickness of pleasure. Yet, she made no attempt to take her words back, or alter our deal by adding conditions. </p><p>Good Queen, indeed. </p><p>“Let me give you a few examples,” I whispered as I shifted slightly, lifting her up as I brought my face at the same level with her beautiful breasts, and my lips parted once more, this time to capture her erect nipples in their war prison. </p><p>Sapphire gasped as I started nibbling the hardened texture of her beautiful nipples, enjoying their gentle trembles. “Maybe,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“No need to hurry,” I answered as I pulled back momentarily, using the opportunity to leer at her beautiful breasts from a close encounter. “As you know, we have a lot of options. Let me give you a few more before you make up your mind.” </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned, her voice enough to make my naked shaft throb in anticipation, but I managed to suppress my desire to abandon our little game and slide inside her aggressively.  </p><p>One of my hands landed on her thigh, gently caressing to awaken waves of passion through her body. “It’s also an option,” I whispered as my fingers climbed up, caressing her entrance softly. Uncontrollably, she tilted her head back, her eyes closed as she let out a small moan, showing she was more than happy with the option. I smirked as I pulled my fingers back.  “Although, after our latest dance, it would be too repetitive.” </p><p>“T-there’s is no harm in repetition,” she managed to gasp between her quickened breaths. </p><p>“Of course, there is, Your Majesty,” I said. “Your Royal body certainly deserves the most spectacular treatment possible.” </p><p>Before she could answer, I learned once more, but this time, rather than focusing on her nipples, I started enjoying the soft texture of her amazing breasts, and her moans exploded as each soft bite burned as hard as a forest fire, leaving the mark of pleasure behind. </p><p>“Well,” I murmured softly as I pulled back. “Do you have any idea what you want as a reward?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she whispered, which surprised me. I looked at her beautiful face, only to see her eyes closed, pleasure covering her face as she lost herself in the moment. Though, it didn’t surprise me as much as her next words. “You can do whatever you want to me,” she gasped. </p><p>What an amazing offer, I realized. I just needed to decide what to do…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Getting serviced by a busty, older Roman noble was nice, but the presence of a younger one behind me, rubbing her body against mine as she stood behind my back, her lips dancing on my neck went a long way to make that sensation even more superior. </p><p>When I finally pulled back, the busty beauty started gagging and coughing, though even during that, her gaze was on my glistening shaft, wet with her saliva. </p><p>“Impressive work,” I said as I grabbed her hair, tightening my grip in preparation for another session. </p><p>“Impossible,” she muttered as she gazed on my shaft, acting unaware of my touch, fascinated by her own success. </p><p>“Nothing is impossible, honey, look how much you have managed to take despite your lack of experience,” I said, though while she busied herself looking at my shaft, Cera decided to take control as she lowered herself, until she could reach around to grab my erection, her hand gliding up and down, challenged with gaining traction as it slid easily along the lubricated part. </p><p>The busty beauty looked up, catching my gaze, anger and satisfaction battling, though the former was steadily losing ground. Her attitude was understandable, as I was leaning rather hard to the obnoxious and narcissistic gladiator role. </p><p>Yet, it was amusing how much forgiveness a muscular body and impressive manhood could earn.</p><p>For a moment, I was tempted to continue until she had managed to trigger my climax, but after a momentary thought, I decided against it. I had a lot of noble ladies to satisfy, and worse, I had a time limit for that before I could go and visit that mysterious healer sorceress. </p><p>I wasn’t willing to test her mercy after not following my promise — even if that promise was extracted as blackmail. </p><p>“It’s time for the real fun,” I said instead, using my leverage to push her toward the bed. Despite the pain making her yelp, she was quick to follow the movement, throwing herself on the bed, her back on the bed, her legs wide open. </p><p>My gaze was sharp enough to catch her legs trembling in anticipation. Yet I didn’t walk toward her immediately, but instead raised a finger. “Who said you can lay on your back?” I asked. </p><p>“I…” she started, only for her voice to fade beautifully. “What should I do?” </p><p>“I want you on all fours, ready for the entrance.” </p><p>The sudden flare of anger on her face was beautiful. “I’m not a whore,” she challenged. “You can’t treat me like one.” </p><p>Cera was smart enough to realize I needed the space, so she took a step back, allowing me to move forward unencumbered. I didn’t say anything. Sometimes, standing toweringly worked better than any statement that could leave my lips. </p><p>And our current situation, with my naked body hulking over her equally nude one, definitely qualified. Although, the current state of her legs, parted beautifully, trembling in excitement, hardly gave her any leverage to exert authority. I peered down, enjoying her discomfort. </p><p>“You’re not,” I said with deliberate slowness, enjoying her growing discomfort, and its beautiful clash with her arousal. “Because, if you were a whore, you would have listened to my orders immediately. On all fours, now!” I added, tapping into the authority of my magical power for a fleeting moment. </p><p>Her reaction as she burst into action was beautiful, especially since she ended up in all fours, her ass raised to provide a convenient entrance. </p><p>“Much better,” I murmured even as I swatted her ass, enjoying the way her flesh rippled. “I don’t get why you’re feeling bad about this position. You definitely have the ass for it.”</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but another spank worked wonders to replace her planned words with a cry. I was curious what she was about to say, but not enough to stop myself from moving forward, pressing against her entrance. </p><p>Though, she proved herself deserving of her noble reputation, her willpower allowed her to push through the pleasure to finally deliver her words. \"A woman should be judged on her mind and talents, not for her figure,\" she managed to murmur. </p><p>“Good point,” I said, unable to keep myself chuckling as I pushed forward, the head slipping into her wetness. “Then, tell me, what is your mind and talents telling you to feel at this exact moment.” </p><p>Unfortunately, as I slowly filled her, she had left my question waiting tragically, unfulfilled, without an answer. </p><p>“Sorry, what was that?” I said, chuckling at her beautiful moan even as her tightness wrapped around my girth, working wonders to continue the task her lips started, and when she failed to answer, I punctuated the question with a spank. “Answer when you’re spoken to!” I ordered. </p><p>“Please,” she gasped, struggling to speak, especially since I didn’t stop, continuing to slide inside her, overwhelming her with pleasure. </p><p>I turned to Cera, who had been watching the show with an aroused smirk, happy to see one of the stuck-up nobles occupying the role that would have been normally assigned to her. “What do you think?” I asked. “Do you think I should forgive her for not answering my question?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she answered, her voice demure, but she didn’t bother fixing her amused expression, confident that she was out of the sight of the noble lady. I was entertained by her confidence, even though I suspected it wasn’t the smartest decision. </p><p>“Why don’t you sit in front of her, so that she can earn a more committed answer from you,” I said as I suddenly grabbed her waist and pushed her forward, which earned a scandalous gasp from the busty beauty that was busy accommodating my thickness. </p><p>“You can’t expect me to “ she started, only for me to grab her hair, silencing her with a gasp. </p><p>“Why did you forget your lesson already?” I commented even as I slammed into her even harder, which, combined with the hair pull, turned her words into a crazy cry. “It seems that I need my barbarian cock to teach that lesson properly.” </p><p>“I didn’t—“ she started, only to lose the rest of her words in a soft cry, while I continued to pump her beautiful core. And when she recovered, she still lacked the opportunity to say anything, because I pushed her head down, blocking her lips with Cera’s beautiful core. “It’s only kind to pay her back for her great work,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>She let out a muffled moan. \"Come on, sweetie, it’s the fair thing to pay her back with the same service,” I said even as I spanked her ass again, even as I continued to pump into her beautiful core. “And you don’t need to feel self-conscious. With her expression, you are clearly better on this than sucking me, so just continue to serve.” </p><p>Despite being muffled, her beautiful cry carried a tone of protest, though that did nothing to prevent her from pushing her ass back, making my impaling even more explosive. </p><p>I decided to reward her with another spank to her plump ass, enjoying the sensation. “You’re certainly good for a noble lady. She shivered and moaned even as I pulled back, leaving her empty for a fleeting moment before it disappeared between her legs once more, enjoying her soaked core. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t reveal my magical abilities, because I would have loved to conjure a few mirrors to give her a better view of the show she was providing. Instead, I decided to give her a different reward as I leaned forward, grabbing her swaying breasts without even changing the pace, pinching and twisting her nipples to enhance her pleasure even more… </p><p>After all, she definitely earned her reward. </p><p>Under different circumstances, it would have been the moment I slowed down, teaching her the beautiful link between submission, obedience, and pleasure. Pity that, with everything going on, time was a great commodity for the evening. </p><p>So, I quickened my assault even more, roughing her wetness even more until she started tightening and trembling, the orgasm she deserved hitting her with all the strength of a collapsing building, which managed to trigger a climax of me as well.</p><p>And I had no problem filling a beautiful noble lady with my seed. </p><p>“Not bad, not bad at all,” I said as I pulled back, letting her collapse on the bed even as I met Cera’s eye, who looked a mix between disappointed and aroused. “Don’t worry, we have a few other noble ladies to convince working on your beautiful body,” I said with a chuckle. As I said that, I slipped a touch of magic to the trembling body of the busty beauty, making sure she continued sleeping for a while — I had no doubt the servants would put her in a more presentable state before her husband arrived. </p><p>And if they didn’t, well, it wasn’t exactly my problem. </p><p>“Maybe,” Cera murmured as she pulled herself under the noble lady that had been working on her pleasure. Her smile tempted me to stop there and work on her for a while. </p><p>Pity I had more important things to handle for the rest of the night, and it was not a luxury I could afford…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I stood still, looking at the out-of-control rainbow fire, my mind running wild as I tried to process what happened when Carla hugged me hysterically. Understandable, considering she had watched her patrol decimated, her allies escape to abandon her, her best friend lost in great peril. </p><p>“Help her,” she gasped as she tried to swallow her cries. </p><p>Although I understood her concerns, sympathized with that even, I didn’t have the time to cater to them in the middle of such an emergency. I put on her shoulder, calming her magically with a Biomancy trick. </p><p>[-43 Mana]</p><p>I simply didn’t have the luxury of doing it otherwise. </p><p>Then, I started speaking to her, bringing the full weight of my charisma to bear. “Carla, I need you to calm down and tell me what happened. That’s the only way I could help Aviada,” I said. </p><p>I wanted her to talk, because the fire was giving me a bad feeling, making me afraid of poking it. I would still do that, ultimately. I had no intention of abandoning Aviada, especially since I could still feel her companion node as I walked closer to the fire, but it was muted. </p><p>Like there was a curtain between us, preventing me from sensing her properly. </p><p>Unfortunately, I was under time pressure, because I had no idea what caused that muting effect, which meant I had no idea just how long Aviada would continue to maintain her state of living. </p><p>Yet, I waited for Carla to start speaking before taking an action, because it wasn’t an exaggeration to say the fire was extraordinary. It was burning trees, which was rather ordinary for fire. Burning the stones and earth underneath, less ordinary. </p><p>Instantly destroying the detection spell that I tried to use to see if there was a living creature, even more unexpected. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured, her voice slurring slightly as the calming spell worked on her mind. “We were patrolling when a large fire falcon ambushed us, killing two of the members immediately. It was at least Class Twenty, maybe even stronger. Yet Aviada managed to defend us, if only barely. If the others supported her, maybe we could have…”  </p><p>“Focus on what happened, we need to save her,” I reminded her. “Did something extraordinary happen? What happened to the beast.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” Carla gasped. “It looked like the beast was about to win, but then the glow appeared around Aviada, and she somehow killed the beast in a slash… But as the slash hit, the fire suddenly exploded in all those colors.” </p><p>It was probably my fault I decided even as I started to flare my mana again. The fire was too extraordinary to be created by just a monster, at least by a monster that Aviada could resist alone. </p><p>To extinguish the fire, my first reflex was to use water magic, which was the opposite element of the fire, which would allow me to suppress it, forming my mana into a huge water wave…</p><p>[-1690 Mana]</p><p>Only to fail spectacularly. </p><p>The moment the wave came in contact with the fire, an explosion occurred as I felt my mana being wrenched out of control, and similar chaos of color spread into the water. “Fuck,” I murmured as the fire flared even worse, threatening to burn us to cinders even in the distance, forcing me to shield us with a spell. </p><p>Luckily, the indirect heat didn’t create the same effect. </p><p>I was ready to pull back to find an answer, when the water wave rose as well, almost conscious as it slammed against the fire, making my eyes widen in shock. </p><p>Something extraordinary was going on.</p><p>I watched as the fire and water entangled, fighting violently, threatening to create a disaster, their rainbow colors cycling faster and faster. Unfortunately, the fight was not equal, and the water, despite the elemental advantage, looked like it was about to lose the fight. </p><p>So, I decided to reinforce it with another wave. </p><p>[-952 Mana]</p><p>My spell hit the wave from behind, only to melt into its structure rapidly, giving the water the much-needed opportunity to fight. I watched carefully, trying to find an opportunity, but that was a slow process. </p><p>With the Aviada’s echo weakening, I doubted I had the luxury of waiting until the fire resolved completely. It was time to take another ridiculous risk. At first, I thought she was weakening, maybe even dying, but after some concentration, I realized it was different. She was just getting away.</p><p>Yet, while that was better than her dying, it wasn’t that much better, because the way she had been getting distant felt foreign. It was hard to explain without knowing the reason, but it felt much different than physical distance. Rather than just walking away, she was sinking underground.  </p><p>I needed to understand what was happening. And for a quick result, I only have one option, the Arcana dimension. </p><p>Luckily, after my disastrous teleportation attempt, I had worked on some basic safety measures, like how to create a temporary beacon that would allow me to return to my own location rather than risking disappearing in Arcana dimension completely. </p><p>Pity I needed to work more to create one that wouldn’t degenerate after a couple of minutes at best. </p><p>[-1320 Mana]</p><p>After making sure the structure was complete, I threw a glance at the chaotic dance of the elements. They were still in a stalemate, so I closed my eyes, letting my body fade in the material reality…  </p><p>And step into the twisting nature of the Arcana dimension, the chaotic energies flowing wildly around me, worse than any tornado, threatening to destroy my whole being if I dared to rest there more than a few seconds.</p><p>Yet, all the twisting colors, the pain, and the threat of total destruction if I dared to dally too long managed to take the backseat, because of three new surprises. </p><p>The first, and the most noticeable, was the gaping wound at the giant dome that surrounded the Arcana dimension, giving me the glimpse of a show even more wild and chaotic. Unfortunately, even I had described the dome as surrounding all dimensions, thanks to the warped nature of the distance in this dimension, it was hard to say that it was far away. </p><p>“Fuck!” I gasped in pain as some kind of Arcana energy, yet more potent and wild slipped through the wound. </p><p>It didn’t hit me, but even passing near me, the damage it created was significant. </p><p>[-1230 HP]</p><p>Even worse, the sudden flow touched the second problem. Two mercurial presences, fighting in the Arcana Dimension, one made from fire and the other made from water, and the mysterious energy empowered both of them, making them lash against each other with increased aggression. </p><p>It would take a total idiot to miss the extraordinary nature of the fire, but even then, I didn’t expect it to only be a physical manifestation of whatever was going on in the Arcana dimension, much more overwhelming than the little mana-burning rainbow. Even worse, the water spell I had used had an equal echo… </p><p>[-281 HP]</p><p>It didn’t make much sense, so spent another painful second to examine them despite my constantly-draining health, only to notice some kind of line connecting to the wound, one that connected both of them as if it was empowering them. </p><p>Hardly a detail to be dismissed, especially if my theory about the dome as the border of the System was accurate.</p><p> Luckily, not all was bad, because the wound on the dome was recovering with a speed that was noticeable to the naked eye. </p><p>[-247 HP]</p><p>So, I turned my attention to the third issue, namely, the location Aviada. I managed to find her easily, confirming she was still alive, but that was the limit of the good news. </p><p>I was able to distinguish her location sufficiently, which would have been good news if it wasn’t for one very important detail. </p><p>Her presence was behind the Dome, and I was only able to feel her through the wound.  </p><p>A wound that was closing in great speed, making it impossible for me to pass through even if I was willing to take such a great risk. She was somehow still alive, but I couldn’t risk just pushing forward to see whatever that was protecting her would work to save me as well. </p><p>I turned my focus on the battle of fire and water, and noticed that they were losing their vigor rapidly as the wound tightened. </p><p>It was time to go back. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 4523 / 6528 Mana: 4981 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Sorry about the delay,” I said to Naomi, who was still on the couch, zapping between the channels. “I remembered to pick up the laundry.” </p><p>“Not a problem,” she answered hurriedly, though I had noticed one important change. She had removed her coat, revealing her clothes underneath. Unfortunately, they were not the clothes we had picked today. </p><p>What a pity. </p><p>My plan was to have a quick stop by the laundry room before stopping at the kitchen, when the doorbell rang once more. “It must be the delivery,” I said to Naomi, and I found myself wishing that was the case. Not that I didn’t welcome Carrie’s presence, but the situation was tricky enough without having another visitor to complicate it further. </p><p>Luckily, this time, it was actually the delivery guy, giving me my food. “You’re lucky,” I said to Naomi as I went back to the living room. “Pizza just arrived.” </p><p>“At this hour?” she asked, her voice much sharper as she looked at the box in my hands. </p><p>“Hey, after all the training I had done today, I earned my cheat day.” </p><p>“I don’t approve cheat days,” she said, the health nut hidden in her pushing to the surface quickly, her earlier shyness forgotten. “They have a tendency to multiply.” </p><p>“Hey, I don’t cheat without putting in the extra effort,” I said, which earned a disbelieving gaze from her. I could see why the girls did their best to avoid the topic of food or nutrition from her. If that was her reaction to me, her attitude toward the girls must have been much more intense. “What’s with the disbelieving gaze,” I said, unable to hide my smirk. </p><p>“Well, I heard that many times,” she said, her tone turning smug, showing she had already won the discussion. That level of sanctimonious superiority in a discussion might have been annoying in other circumstances, but I was more than happy to make an exception for such a sexy girl. </p><p>Still, unlike her friends, I had no problems attacking her on the same topic. I played to win. </p><p>“Really,” I said as I removed my shirt immediately, throwing it on the side. “Why don’t you show me where I’m gathering fat if those cheat days are so dangerous,” I said. </p><p>My sudden revealing move seemed to destroy her attitude, mostly because she was too interested in ogling my muscular chest than actually trying to come up with a counter. That would not do, I decided even as I flipped open the pizza box, and took a large bite from the first slice. “Amazing.”</p><p>“J-just because your chest is perfect don’t —“ she started, but I interrupted her. </p><p>“Ohh, you think my chest is perfect,” I said in a teasing tone, even pushing my muscles to highlight the show. I wasn’t exactly a bodybuilder due to the position requirements, but I certainly provided a nice view, confirmed by the sudden hunger in her gaze. </p><p>“N-not the point,” she managed to stammer, though only after I took another bite from the pizza, goading her to action once more. “Just because you don’t have any fat on your stomach or chest, it doesn’t mean that you don’t have anywhere else. Problem area is often around the hips.” </p><p>“A good point,” I nodded, looking thoughtful, which made her smirk victoriously, though it only lasted until I pulled my pants down, leaving only my boxers on. Under her shocked gaze, I put the pizza on the table, and did a twirl for her. “See, no fat anywhere,” I said smugly. “I can remove the boxers as well if you’re not convinced.” </p><p>“No … need,” she murmured, but unlike her earlier exclamations, that came pretty slow, showing that she would have no problems enjoying the show thoroughly if I didn’t listen to her. Instead, I decided to follow her request, and plopped next to her. </p><p>Not bothering to put my clothes on in the process, of course. </p><p>Soon, Naomi’s gaze was dancing between my food and my body, unable to decide what to do. “You still shouldn’t eat junk food,” she finally decided to say. </p><p>“The occasional cheating helps one to focus better,” I answered. “Why don’t you take a bite instead.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured, but when I brought the piece under her nose, the smell assaulting her, her expression flickered, showing that it was easier to preach the benefits of healthy living without the tempting smell of junk food. </p><p>The temptation for the win. </p><p>“Maybe a bite,” she said, but when she tried to bite, I pulled it back at the last minute, earning a questioning gaze. </p><p>“I don’t like double standards,” I said. “You need to earn your right to junk food just like I did.”</p><p>She was a smart girl, realizing what I meant immediately. Her mouth opened like she wanted to argue, but no words got out, unable to find an appropriate reply to my absurd requirement. </p><p>I was shameless enough to use her shock to my benefit, and grabbed the bottom of her shirt, and started lifting it, revealing more of her beautiful milky chocolate skin, her mouth widening even more in shock. </p><p>Ignoring that reaction, I dragged my fingers on her stomach gently, making her shiver. “Good, you don’t have any excess fat on your sexy belly,” I said, my words hardly helping her composure. </p><p>“O-of course I don’t,” she managed to say, the compliment on her body once again allowing her to retreat to her most comfortable area. “I have a two-hour exercise schedule to prevent fat from accumulating.” </p><p>“Impressive,” I said, my smirk widening. “Let’s see how the rest of your body responds to your amazing schedule.” With that, I started dragging her shirt up, slow enough to be classified as lazy, giving her ample time to prevent it if she wished, though only because I knew she wouldn’t do so, not after our little fun in the dressing room. </p><p>Her shirt was a loose, boring one, but when its hem reached her chest, the bra underneath was more than enough to compensate for it. I expected another sports bra, and seeing the bright orange edge as I dragged upward, I assumed it was the case. </p><p>However, as I continued to pull up, I noticed the lacy nature of her bra, too thin to work as a sports bra, a mere decoration rather than providing support — not that her amazing globes needed any assistance in defying the existence of gravity. </p><p>“Beautiful bra,” I commented shamelessly. “Did you buy that today as well?” Shocked by my comment, she just nodded before realizing what she had just admitted, the equivalent of dressing for me, avoiding my gaze even as I pulled her shirt completely, her arms rising to allow it. “You should have asked me to help you there as well, I could have helped you to pick even more fun stuff,” I whispered into her ear, using our closeness better. </p><p>“Maybe later,” she murmured, barely above a whisper. “But now, I want to enjoy the pizza I earned,” she said as she grabbed a slice. </p><p>“Not so fast,” I said as I grabbed her wrist, and took a big bite from her slice. I looked at my own lower half pointedly first, before turning my gaze toward her sweatpants. “It doesn’t seem like things are equal, does it?” I asked. </p><p>“You don’t mean—“ she gasped, only for me to cut. </p><p>“That’s exactly what I mean,” I said even as I took another bite from the slice she was holding, amused by her incredulous reaction after what had happened before. “I said it before, I don’t like double standards.” </p><p>She stood frozen, and I used the opportunity to finish the slice, but I didn’t stay there. I started licking her fingers slowly, starting from her pinkie, slow and sensual. The way she was shuffling in her seat as I licked her fingers was beautiful, though not as beautiful as the subtle moans she was letting out. </p><p>She was yet to act when I finished with her fingers, so I started going upward. I had no problems teasing her until she reached her limit and decided to act. She could stay passive despite my subtle goading, of course, but that was hardly a horrible situation as well. </p><p>I started with a gentle kiss to her palm, making her shiver, before moving up to her wrist, then trailing up to her arm, leaving a lingering path of kisses. Her moans were delicious, though it took quite a while for her to finally act. Only when my lips pressed against her neck did she stand up hurriedly, no doubt realizing I had no problem moving even higher — or worse, lower. </p><p>Despite her hurried jump, however, the next steps of her action happened in a lingering slowness. She turned away from me as she grabbed the waistbands of her pants, slowly pushing them down to reveal her matching panties. They were modestly sized, but their bright colors, along with the incredible tightness of her ass, worked wonders to turn it into an amazing show nonetheless. </p><p>As the sweatpants moved down, revealing more of her toned legs, the show was getting better and better. Then, she finished and turned to look at me, only to find me showing off a full mast. Her gaze stayed stuck, her eyes wide as a doe.</p><p>I gestured her to make a twirl, and she did so after a slight delay, allowing me to devour the sight of her perfect body. “Slower,” I said, and she repeated, giving me an extended show of her beautiful body, clad in bright orange sexy underwear. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, not bothering to hide my smirk as I patted the seat next to me. “You have an excellent body, and you earned your slice.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“W-wait—” Nancy stammered in fear, but it was too late, as Penny already slipped a finger inside, extracting a cry of pain.</p><p>“I can stop if you can’t handle it,” Penny said, her anger highlighting her cuteness even more. She was trying to look intimidating, but ultimately, she was as scary as a little kitten, her efforts only made her cuter. </p><p>Of course, in our current situation, the cuteness was a relative term. I had no doubt that Nancy, whose face was scrunched in a surprise invasion of Penny’s lubricated fingers. Yet, her expression tightened despite the pain, her competitive spirit coming to the surface once more. “I can handle anything you can dish out,” she said proudly. </p><p>Too proudly in my opinion, as I was never a fan of giving such categorical promises, though it was significantly different being on the receiving end — or in this case, a VIP seat to watch the show. </p><p>“Good,” Penny said as she pushed her finger deeper. Nancy bit her lips, trying to hide her pain, but she was too close to me to even have a hope of hiding the sudden tightness of her expression. </p><p>More importantly, it wasn’t the only part of her suddenly tightening. Her walls clamped around my shaft even tighter, making it much harder to prevent a premature explosion even when her hips were still, not rocking back and forth.  </p><p>Nancy seemed determined to tough it out, but it lasted only until Penny slipped another finger. Then, the pain overcame her desire to look superior, her mouth opening to let out a cry. </p><p>Luckily for her, I was a nice guy, so I leaned forward, capturing her lips to suppress the loud cry that was about to let out. Penny glared at me, showing the closest emotion she could to anger with her cute features, no doubt frustrated that I had stolen her little victory. </p><p>She wasn’t frustrated enough to pull back. </p><p>I grabbed Nancy’s hips, guiding her to move once again, helping her enjoy the closest thing to a double penetration she could experience in the current party without involving toys, especially when Penny added a third finger, making her let out a string of beautiful yet suppressed moans. </p><p>I had to gesture Penny to dissuade her from a fourth finger, as I could feel Nancy was already at her limit. Luckily, despite her sudden bravery, Penny was as obedient as ever, and a gesture was all I needed to stop her. No additional orders, no threats. Just a gesture. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I murmured as I pulled back from the kiss, which put a beautiful smile on both of their faces. Penny because I made eye contact with her while saying it, and Nancy because her eyes were still closed as her hips rocked, enjoying the position despite the occasional pain as Penny’s fingers moved aggressively. </p><p>I kept one of my hands on Nancy’s ass, enjoying her fit body while directing her pace, while the other sneaked toward Penny, landing one of her spectacular breasts, my fingers sinking into her inviting flesh, earning some beautiful cries as a reward.  </p><p>Thanks to the sensitiveness of her breasts, that had been enough to distract Penny properly, allowing me to focus most of my attention on Nancy, and not just to enjoy the way she was tightening around my shaft. I pulled and pushed her harder, making her pace even faster, which she rewarded by getting even tighter, clamping around my girth like a supernatural mixture of silk and steel. </p><p>Soon, her earlier distaste about Penny’s sudden initiative had been forgotten completely, replaced by a beautiful string of moans, singing the song of pleasure. Our unintentional cooperation was working perfectly, each push inside her — whether from my rock-hard erection or Penny’s naughty fingers — making her moan louder. </p><p>Soon, the pleasure hit her with all the subtlety of a truck, and she started trembling with an explosive climax I had never seen her experience before, the combination of surprise invasion and the frustration that stretched for a whole day working its magic. I wondered that, if we were in a bed at this moment, she would have collapsed unconsciously.</p><p>Maybe I should test that, I decided as I pushed Penny back a bit before grabbing Nancy’s waist, and standing up. Admittedly, with her weight pushing my shaft even deeper inside her, her feet dangling, it hardly helped her to process the tsunami of pleasure that followed her spectacular climax. </p><p>While our ultimate destination might offer her comfort, the journey to that comfort had been rather grueling for her, each step pushing my shaft deep inside her. She tried to push herself up to limit the impact, but with her limbs trembling softly under the invasion of pleasure that immediately followed her climax, it was a challenge she had failed utterly. </p><p>Although, while she had failed on that particular challenge, she didn’t look like her failure was the cause of great regret, if her cries of pleasure were to be believed. </p><p>“She seems distressed,” Penny murmured, but rather than following us, she had dashed inside, only to return to the bathroom, carrying a small bundle in her hands, trying to keep it hidden. </p><p>She failed on that particular task, but I deliberately neglected to ask about that, curious what little surprise she had for me. She had already surprised me with her performance today, and I was curious what she would reveal next. </p><p>So, I left Penny behind in the bathroom while I did my gentlemanly duty of helping an exhausted Nancy to move to the bed to rest. </p><p>Well, almost rest. </p><p>At least she would be laying on her back on the bed. </p><p>Nancy showed that she had appreciated the sudden change as her body hit on the bed, and that appreciation came in the form of a beautiful moan, soft, yet loud enough to echo against the walls. I pulled out, and let her rest for a few seconds to allow her to catch her breath before commenting. “Don’t tell me you’re already exhausted, and that’s all you can handle?” I asked. </p><p>“O-of course not,” she answered, her beautiful green eyes flashing with anger at the question, too competitive to accept that even in her state. Yet, with exhaustion and pleasure battling in her delicate body, an angry glare was all she could manage. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said. “So, you’re saying that even with exhaustion, you can handle enough to actually compete with Penny?” I said, seeing no harm in a casual namedrop to fuel her competitiveness even further. </p><p>Her reaction was so predictable that I wasn’t surprised the slightest as I felt her arms wrap around my neck and pull me a kiss — through the lack of surprise certainly didn’t mean a lack of enjoyment. I let her capture my lips in a searing kiss, even as I pushed my hips forward, ready to impale her again. </p><p>Just not through the entrance she was expecting. </p><p>“Are you—“ she started as her eyes widened, only to be replaced by a gasp as I pushed into her puckered hole, still slippery thanks to Penny’s earlier assistance. </p><p>“It would be rude to waste Penny’s helpful efforts, don’t you think so?” I asked as I hit her with a big smirk. She didn’t say anything, because she was busy biting her lips as I slowly pushed deeper. “Of course, if you think you can’t handle…” </p><p>At this point, her reaction was perfectly predictable, enough to make it actually boring if the reward I earned wasn’t so spectacular. She said nothing, nor did she need to as she wrapped her legs around my waist, and actually pulled me deeper despite the pained cry that left her beautiful lips. A rare feeling of mercy hit me, and I leaned forward to capture her lips. </p><p>That didn’t stop me from pushing my hips steadily of course, though I made sure to keep my pacing manageable as I slowly pushed inside her until I reached her current limit, stayed there for a moment, pulled back, and pushed again with the objective of breaking my previous record. </p><p>The progressive invasion of the last untouched part of her body challenged Nancy with a glorious mixture of pleasure and pain, each with its own challenge. The pleasure threatened to push her to the land of unconsciousness as it compounded with the joy of her previous pseudo-double-penetration, while the pain flared and disappeared based on the current progress of the invasion, forcing her to erase every sign from her face as she tried to sell her toughness. </p><p>She failed spectacularly, of course, but that only made her cuter. I took several breaks from kissing her pouty lips just to enjoy her fiery beauty as she struggled against the overwhelming pleasure, her eyelids fluttering repeatedly. </p><p>“It’s not too late to ask for mercy,” I whispered even as pushed even deeper, her puckered hole loosened just enough to allow me to assault from multiple angles, each bringing a completely new experience for her, her moans strong enough to eviscerate her determination to keep silent. Her moans exploded, filling the room even as I impaled her again and again, deeper and deeper, yet she took all of it like a true champion. </p><p>I was impressed. Not everyone had handled their first anal experience that smoothly. </p><p>I noticed a movement from the bathroom door, only to see Penny peeking as she tried to stay hidden, yet the door was still wide enough to reveal her jealous expression, underlined with impatience. Yet, despite her impatience, she didn’t enter the room, limiting herself to the show we were providing.</p><p>Maybe she didn’t want whatever she wanted to show to be overshadowed by Nancy’s amazing performance. And if that was the case, it would have been the correct call, because as my climax got closer, I was finding it rather difficult to pay attention to anything but the beautiful redhead moaning under me. </p><p>And then, Nancy raised her head to take initiative in a kiss, her tongue doing her best to invade my mouth only to be rebuffed in a counter-attack. As our tongues locked in a beautiful dance, however, I had finally reached my limit, and started painting her tight entrance with my mark. </p><p>Already on the limit, the endless throbbing of my thickness proved too much for her, and she started trembling under the endless flood of pleasure. Her moans started spectacular, but with each repeat, they lost power, exhaustion catching up with her, and when I pulled out of her, she was already unconscious, her weight buried in the soft bed. </p><p>And then, I turned to Penny, who was still watching us from the cracked doorway…</p>",

I wanted to enjoy her beauty, yet I wanted to make her suffer a bit to properly fit our environment. </p><p>Ultimately, torturing her with pleasure and with an unmet climax was the only acceptable compromise between those two aspects. </p><p>Amusingly, I thought even as I put my hand on her beautiful bosom, enjoying the sensation, that Sapphire was likely the most deserving person to such treatment. After all the times she had enjoyed teasing men for her own purposes, it was the time she had a taste of her own medicine. </p><p>She moaned as I twisted her nipple, yet to realize just how far I wanted to stretch our little teasing game. </p><p>“So, Your Majesty,” I said as my smile widened. “I remember we were having an interesting dispute about how to define the proper relationship between two of us. Do you have any new ideas about the topic, or would you like to defend your earlier position?” </p><p>“I’m not — your woman,” she gasped, interrupted halfway by a moan as I chose that moment to twist her nipple, giving her a fresh flood of pleasure, though even before that, her statement lost a noticeable amount of sharpness. </p><p>Understandable considering the unfamiliarity of the current situation. We had shared some compromising situations before, even in her throne room, she wasn’t as vulnerable. In the cell, wrapped in magic-blocking chains, dressed in the remains of her conservative dress that left anything above her waist naked, she was just a delicious prey. </p><p>A prey that I fully intended to tease properly. </p><p>“I admire your determination,” I said as I caressed her belly, though, with my smirk and mocking tone, it was hardly a sincere statement. </p><p>Her blush, creeping even deeper into her beautiful complexion, showed that she was very much aware of that. Yet, her embarrassment, combined with my ongoing admiration, worked wonders to keep her beautiful mouth shut, letting it pass without prompting. </p><p>“No wonder you’re the Queen of such a great Empire, You can reject the call of pleasure so decisively,” I said even as my fingers continued to stray lower, finally grabbing her dress once more. The moment I made contact, I noticed her nipples hardening even further in anticipation, making me chuckle. </p><p>This time, I didn’t rip her dress. No need to do so, when a stiff pull was all I needed to push it to the floor, revealing her nudity. “What a shame,” I murmured even as I admired her excited body. “Maybe the Empire is in an even worse condition than I expected. Otherwise, how could the Queen couldn’t even afford underwear for herself.” I chuckled again. “It’s not like such a vaunted political figure neglect to wear any underwear for the sheer reason of making a secret prison trip naughtier, right?” </p><p>She crossed her legs, trying to hide her growing wetness at my words. Unfortunately for her, after all the little sessions of pleasure, we had shared, her concealment attempts weren’t working as well as she intended. </p><p>“You’re wrong…” she started before letting her words fade, smart enough to realize it was not a topic she could argue easily. At least, not under our current circumstances.  </p><p>I stopped for a moment, enjoying just how sexy she looked while wearing nothing but a pair of chains. Her naked bust looked spectacular as her breasts pushed up repeatedly thanks to her out-of-control breathing, her nipples hard enough to create a safety hazard, though even that wasn’t as alluring as her long legs, crossed to hide her wet core. </p><p>Pity that I had no intention of allowing her to succeed on that particular task. </p><p>“Let’s start with your punishment,” I said as I closed in the distance once again, pushing my leg between hers, parting them enough to reveal the well-trimmed treasure between them. Though, despite my aggressive assault, her hips rose to match my movement — as much as she could manage under the circumstances — while my fingers got closer. </p><p>The shiver that danced along her body, making her curves tremble as I touched her core was simply beautiful. </p><p>She said nothing as my fingers danced. She tried to look calm, but hiding the impact of the sudden flood of pleasure was not something she was able to conceal successfully. Soon, she started moaning, unaware that I had no intention of letting her arrive at a quick climax. </p><p>The moment I noticed the signs of an impending climax, I pulled back. “So, since you had the time to consider my question, do you want to change your mind, or do you want me to continue your punishment.” </p><p>“Punish me,” she said, though it sounded less like a challenging declaration, and more like an explosive reflection of her desires. I had no problems punishing her, of course. </p><p>Though, I doubted she would be as enthusiastic if she knew my exact plan of punishing her. </p><p>My fingers landed on her body once more, but this time, rather than directly connecting with the treasure between her legs, they started from her calves, soft and inviting, before starting to move up in a slow, teasing manner. She moaned at first, but those moans soon lost their strength as they moved much slower than she expected. </p><p>She glanced down, but I was ready to catch her gaze, my grin managing to arouse a trickle of shame in her as her lips closed, killing the words that seemed to be ready to burst from her lips by informing her that her current plight was intentional. </p><p>“Any change of mind,” I said mockingly even as my fingers continued to climb up, arriving at her plump thighs, enjoying the speed they parted together invitingly despite her earlier declarations. The pleasure was difficult to reject…</p><p>Even if the target wasn’t a Tantric mage who was still struggling through the backlash of her own spells. </p><p>“Hurry up,” she soon whispered, proving just how badly the aftereffects of her spell were affecting her. I glanced upward, only to see her eyes closed — though, with the perks of the angle, it took a while to focus on her face. I couldn’t help but chuckle in satisfaction at her quick surrender, but that didn’t make my fingers move any faster. </p><p>“Why? Isn’t this supposed to be a punishment,” I answered calmly even as I scaled her inner thighs in a lingering slowness, enjoying the way her eyes popped open as the realization hit her? </p><p>“But—“ she tried to start, only to fade into a moan as one of my fingers moved upward, caressing her entrance for a lingering second, working wonders. </p><p>Yet, I pulled back again. </p><p>She tried to press her thighs together to handle it herself, but I pushed my leg between before she could succeed, preventing her trick from succeeding. “You’re evil,” she gasped. </p><p>I pressed my hand to my heart and gasped theatrically. “You wound me, Your Majesty. How can I handle being called evil?” She avoided my gaze as she realized the comical absurdity of blaming a Dark Lord for being evil, looking everywhere but me. “Maybe I should leave and take a walk to process this overwhelming insult.” </p><p>That suggestion was enough to suppress the shyness resulting from her earlier blunder as her gaze found mine, her eyes wide in shock. \"No, please!” she gasped, the last pieces of her dignity as a Queen abandoned in the face of unmet desire. </p><p>“You’re lucky that I’m not an evil man,” I said, unable to prevent myself from delivering that dig even as one of my hands returned to her wet core, caressing gently, while the other landed on her beautiful bosom, much more aggressive. </p><p>Yet, even during that glorious double-assault, I made sure to keep her away from the toppling point, each touch earning even needier moans. If she still had access to her magic, I had no doubt that she would have done her best to take that last step with her Tantric spells, but with her mana blocked, she was helpless. </p><p>“So tense,” I chuckled as I leaned forward, taking her beautiful nipple to my mouth, teasing it carefully through an alliance between my tongue and my lips. </p><p>“Please,” she gasped, her need echoing in her tone, enough to melt the heart of a more merciful man. Unfortunately for her, I might be many things, but merciful was one trait I had tried to cultivate, her needy gasps only triggering my desire to play with her more. </p><p>Not to mention, considering her secret identity as the exotic dancer that drove her customers insane with unmet desire, the irony of her position made the torture even more delicious. </p><p>“I don’t know, I might have displayed some kind of mercy to my woman, but you’re just a stranger. Why should I show concern to your needs?” I asked. </p><p>The expression on the conflict on her face was beautiful, especially since it barely survived a handful of seconds. “I surrender,” she purred beautifully as her gaze met mine. “I’m your woman.” </p><p>“What excellent news,” I said as I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a searing kiss, enjoying the feeling of her beautiful lips. </p><p>Though even as I enjoyed her kiss, a question danced on the back of my mind. Should I reward her, or continue to play with her?</p>",

    "content": "<p>“It’s good that you made the correct decision,” I murmured even as I closed the distance between us in slow steps. “I’m sure that you’re going to enjoy my tribe’s celebration ceremony.” </p><p>She said nothing, still looking shocked, like she couldn’t believe herself accepting my conditions. I could feel her determination flailing, like she was about to change her mind once again. However, once her gaze dipped down, seeing my naked shaft, dangling freely, she swallowed her words. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the only thing she swallowed tonight. </p><p>I continued walking, doing my best to look threatening, but not threatening enough to actually intimidate her. She continued to lay on the bed, trembling in anticipation, but making to move to increase the distance between us. </p><p>When I stood on the side of her bed, she shuffled, trying to align herself for a pounding. Too bad for her that I had other ideas. </p><p>“Not so fast, honey,” I whispered even as I grabbed her hair, holding just tight enough to give a sting of pain, though it was incomparably soft compared to the treatment Cera received earlier. Dominating the noblest ladies of Rome was fun, but ultimately, I couldn’t forget that, under the circumstances, I was just entertainment for them, and there was a limit for my pushing. </p><p>That didn’t mean I was going to act cowardly, of course, evidenced by the way I pulled her head toward my crotch inches away from her full lips. “You can’t be serious. I’m not a servant or a slave. If you think I’ll do something that disgusting—“ she gasped in shock. </p><p>Too bad for her that I was experienced enough to catch the excitement in her gaze even as she exclaimed her arguments, pulling her head even closer, pressing my shaft against her plump lips. “I told you I’m going to show you my tribe’s victory celebration,” I said even as the pressure grew, forcing her down, silencing her as my crown pressed against her lips. </p><p>She froze, excitement battling with shame. Too bad for the shame that excitement had a robust reinforcement. </p><p>I watched in amusement as her lips parted despite her submissive position, blurring the lines about who was the servant and who was noble, her lips wrapping around my girth as I pushed my hips forward. </p><p>It was a hesitant wrap, showing that despite all of her obvious sexual experience, she seldom found herself pleasuring a man with her mouth. </p><p>She shuffled until her knees sink into the soft bed, allowing her to get a better balance on the soft surface, but as I pushed my shaft deeper into her mouth, she managed to look up, arousal and shock dancing in her brown eyes. </p><p>Under my sharp gaze, she opened her jaw, even more, allowing my shaft to fit comfortably, which was exactly what I needed to slide inside her hot mouth mercilessly, the crown hitting the entrance of her throat immediately. </p><p>She gagged, unable to hide her shock, closing her eyes as she tried to process the sudden invasion. “Not bad for a pampered noble,” I said as I pulled my hips back, only to slam once again, this time slipping the head into her tight throat a bit, earning an even louder gag in the process. </p><p>While I was busy dealing with her, Cera sat on the bed, her gaze firmly on the show, though it was impossible to hide the glee she was feeling. She was clearly enjoying the ignoble fate of the noble lady who had been forcing her to serve just moments ago. Her legs parted, her hand disappearing between them as she enjoyed the show properly. </p><p>Good for her, I thought even as I turned my attention back to the noble lady that was struggling under my merciless assault. “Oh, imagine if the door opened, and your exalted husband entered,” I commented. “What would he say seeing his precious wife servicing a lowly gladiator.” </p><p>She trembled, fear mixing into the excitement that could only be given by a taboo. Pity that it didn’t magically solve her deficient oral abilities. </p><p>“Cera, come here,” I ordered. She was quick to respond, though our noble guest looked shocked. Even when I pulled out of her mouth, she said nothing, limiting herself to a helpless wheeze as she tried to catch her breath. </p><p>“Cera, show her how it’s done,” I said as I grabbed her hair, though before I could pull her down, she had already thrown herself over my glistening cock. I pulled her closer, forcing her to swallow more of my erection, her gags and wheezes filling the room. </p><p>However, she didn’t let her obvious discomfort prevent the completion of her glorious task, swallowing it with a surprising speed. A part of it was her experience from our earlier, very memorable, encounter, but I couldn’t help but feel the other part was her desire to one-up the rich noble that was dominating her earlier without showing her the slightest respect. </p><p>Such dedication needed to be rewarded, I thought even as I slapped the beautiful bosom of the noble lady. “Pay attention how she does,” I said, not bothering to hide my disdain. </p><p>Shame invaded her face, followed by shock as she realized the absurdity of the shame she was feeling. I didn’t bother hiding my chuckle, curious whether she would try to exert her authority by commenting on it, or refuting the impression. </p><p>She stayed silent, too focused on Cera’s achievement. </p><p>“Enough,” I said after a while and pulled out, only to slam it back on our noble guest’s throat once more, her tits dangling gloriously with each push. Cera was fun, no doubt about it, but I had a more important mission tonight. </p><p>The expression of shame didn’t disappear, but as my shaft started to invade the depths of her throat, pleasure joined the mix, even bringing in a hint of pride when she glanced at Cera, as if she was declaring her superiority. </p><p>Her reward, was a sudden change of pace. </p><p>She looked shocked as I pulled my shaft out, leaving her dazed and shocked at the sudden change of pace. “That was the first part,” I said. “Now, lick it.” Her gaze wasn’t exactly filled with enthusiasm, so I gestured to Cera. “We can always use her if you don’t think you can handle it.” </p><p>It was a simple trick, one that wasn’t supposed to work in a self-possessed and experienced woman like her. Unfortunately, she had two factors working against her. One, she was already battling with a confusing attraction toward me thanks to my glorious public fights and my physical attributes. Second, after the rough treatment she had received, she was deprived of air, impairing her decision-making even more. </p><p>And just like that, she reached up and grabbed my shaft with her soft hands, staring at the bulbous tip of my cock with trepidation. Still, she shuffled in her place for better balance before leaning forward slowly, her pouty lips already parted, her tongue pushing out. </p><p>Her inexperience was showing as her tongue darted out, going back and forth along my length as she tried to replicate the show she had no doubt watched countless times by those of lower birth of status. I couldn’t help but look at Cera, amused at her triumphant, arrogant smirk. She was lucky that our noble lady had more important tasks than paying attention to her. </p><p>If not, Cera would have paid for her disrespect after I left. </p><p>The tongue over my shaft danced faster, covering it with a fresh coat of glistening warmth as she tried her best to compensate for her lack of skill with speed. I was impressed by the speed she was adapting to her submissive position, no doubt helped by the assurance that it had no long-term consequences thanks to our statuses. </p><p>After her initial reluctance was broken, she adapted to her submissive role with surprising efficiency. </p><p>“That’s enough,” I said as I grabbed her head. “It’s time to open your pretty mouth again.” This time, she didn’t even try to complain as she stretched her jaw wide and took the head in her mouth, sucking the tip for a moment before I pushed it forward, the huge head pushing into her throat. She choked and gagged, creating a beautiful backdrop, but my grip didn’t allow her to retreat. </p><p>\"Just relax your throat,\" I advised her even as I pulled her even tighter, forcing another inch of my thick shaft to disappear into her precious mouth. She bobbed her head with great effort, showing her determination not to be a passive participant, impressing me. </p><p>I rewarded her with another slap on her gloriously big breasts, which made her speed up even more. </p><p>Teaching prestigious and sexy Roman nobles about appropriate behavior in the bedroom was such a beautiful privilege… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had left the headmistress’ tower behind with a purpose. Since I was going to visit her again in the morning to receive another infusion of Divine Spark, I decided to spend all I had been storing for a while. </p><p>I could have gone back to my room, but after staying inside for the whole day for some fun, and some not so fun, activities, some fresh air would do good. Not to mention, I was going to absorb several times more Divine Spark than my earlier experiments. Staying away in case of an unexpected reaction was for the best.</p><p>No need to inform the headmistress about my little naughty secret.  </p><p>Once again I sneaked out of Silver Spires and got away using an air elemental, but I didn’t go to one of my hideouts, not willing to hide underground in such a nice evening. Instead, I had reached a nice meadow, and after killing the beasts that used it as a resting area — a trivial effort with my power — I established a few wards that would hold for a couple of days, and sat down. </p><p>The Divine Spark was still locked in the storage I had created in my body, trying to burst out ineffectually. After my most recent studies, I could see several ways of improving the storage, not that it was necessary. Compared to what the headmistress was trying to hold, what I was holding was nothing more than a sliver, making it much easier to handle even with inefficient storage.</p><p>Of course, I would have no hope to a similar amount with the headmistress. The only reason she was able to do so was that she had achieved some kind of partial merger, aligning it with her pure mana.  </p><p>With a calm expression, I crouched, letting my mana rotate, to let it dip into the storage during a part of its journey before rotating all along my body, slowly strengthening. However, I didn’t start that at first, and instead just rotated mana in the same patterns I had seen Janelor had been using whenever she had excess mana, and did my best to replicate the pattern. </p><p>[-18 Mana]</p><p>[-290 HP]</p><p>“Fuck, that hurts,” I groaned as I tasted the failure on a level I wasn’t expecting from such a little amount of mana. Luckily, I didn’t try it with something more. </p><p>I healed myself before repeating the trick, only to end up with nothing but pain again. </p><p>[-13 Mana]</p><p>[-345 HP]</p><p>And again. </p><p>[-16 Mana]</p><p>[-490 HP]</p><p>And again. </p><p>[-8 Mana]</p><p>[-550 HP]</p><p>“Okay, I surrender,” I murmured as I breathed hard, trying to ignore the unfamiliar sensation. Clearly, whatever I was doing wasn’t going to work, especially with the pattern. The more successfully I replicated her trick, the more damage it created. </p><p>Maybe I was doing something inherently wrong, or maybe it was a vain act in the first place. Maybe it was something that could only be applied by a dragon. </p><p>Pity that I couldn’t even use that as an attack, as after penetrating that deep into someone’s body, there were easier options to kill them, and that assumed I could replicate such a complicated pattern inside them with their mana trying to fight against me. </p><p>Regardless, I took a pause to heal myself and refill my mana pool once again before starting to rotate my mana, this time letting it dip into the reservoir of Divine Spark rather than relying on just my mana, and letting the small sliver I had stolen to be absorbed into my body, losing its unique properties in the process. Since it was a process I had replicated earlier, I expected it to happen easily. </p><p>Yet, there was a difference in the process. My body absorbed it at the same speed with one very important exception. One of my fingers, was the same finger I had used as the target for my experimentation. That part absorbed the divine spark much faster, yet other than that, showed no radical change. </p><p>Interesting, I thought as I let my mind wander about the implications of it. Pity that the improvement I had received didn’t justify the amount of mana I had to spend — or the excruciating pain I felt — during the process. And that was without considering the potential danger of replicating the same trick in a more vital location like my heart. </p><p>I focused on depleting the remaining Divine Spark, feeling it empowering my body. It took barely an hour, and only because I wasn’t in a particular hurry. The rewards weren’t particularly impressive. It was hard to quantify since it didn’t react with the System, but I doubted the overall impact was more than a few points split among various stats. From a perspective of powering up, it was a total waste.  </p><p>Yet, I wouldn’t change it for anything. The more I learned about the System, the more I realized how unreliable the power it gives. Someone could block it the way I could block the others, leaving me powerless. </p><p>And I had no intention of finding myself powerless. Living two decades as the mule was more than enough. </p><p>After finishing the process, I was about to have a walk around the school, a mixture of relaxing trips and hunting beasts — as my reagent reserve was almost completely empty — when I felt a sudden mental flare. It wasn’t mine, but coming from an external source.  </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had felt that particular flare, a mixture of panic and loss of strength, but that hardly made me feel calmer, because the last time I had felt that, it came from Helga and Cornelia, and I had barely able to save them despite using Teleportation. </p><p>Yet, this time, it wasn’t even an option, because before I could even consider that, the feeling started to weaken, making it impossible to use as a guide. </p><p>It was time to take a risk, I thought even as I reached my other perk, Empowerment, even though my first experience with it hadn’t been any more successful than Teleportation. </p><p>Yet, it was better than the alternative, so, I threw it to the distance. </p><p>[Empowerment (0/1)]</p><p>Even as the counter of my skill dropped, I sensed the power of the Companion Node flare at a distance, turning into a flame from cinders. </p><p>Then, before I could do anything else, the sensation disappeared completely!</p><p>“No,” I gasped in anger as a sudden feeling of loss filled me. I conjured another air elemental, dumping as much mana as I could manage, and started flying at the full speed, making no attempt to stay concealed, uncaring the possibility of it being a trap. </p><p>It was reckless, of course, but recklessness was better than the sudden feeling of loss that filled my being. </p><p>I moved toward the direction of the flare. It wasn’t an accurate one, but it was the best I had, and certainly better than trying to teleport without a beacon. </p><p>While I moved, I focused inward, trying to understand the source of the feeling. I could still feel five Companion nodes, split across many directions. The two brightest ones — Helga and Cornelia, the carriers of completed nodes — were still together, with no sign of something wrong. </p><p>In a different direction, I could feel two together, though not as strong. Titania and Marianne, I recognized easily. And since the other one I could feel at the direction of the school, it suggested that Oeyne was safe as well. </p><p>It only left Aviada, the one that was most likely to overestimate herself to take a dangerous task. “Fuck, please be well,” I murmured even as I tried to focus on the absence of a feeling, only to come up predictably empty. I continued flying, hoping to find something that would give me a better target as I flew even higher on the sky, cutting whatever beast stupid enough to think that I made a good target, not even slowing down to pick any material from them. </p><p>A few minutes later, I finally found what I was looking for. A huge forest fire burning with all the colors of the rainbow, creating an extraordinary view. </p><p>I didn’t bother to slow down as I dived down, my perception allowing me to catch everything, in particular, a familiar redhead with a bow, trying to defend herself against the beasts, frenzied as they tried to escape the fire. I dispelled the elemental and dived down, already casting arcana bolts to kill everything that surrounded her without any risk of area damage. </p><p>She was my only source of information. </p><p>“You,” she gasped as she noticed me. “Help her, she’s in the middle of the fire!” </p><p>“What happened?” I asked even as I cast a modified healing spell, allowing me to detect any kind of life inside the fire, only to come up negative. There was no one inside. </p><p>Unacceptable, I thought even as I gathered my mana… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6241 / 6528 Mana: 1890 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>In my place, someone else might have spent several days interrogating Janelor carefully, creating a very comprehensive plan before finally challenging the angel with two Divine Sparks and one of the strongest factions in the Empire under her control. </p><p>Yet, I stood at the entrance of the headmistress’ tower, knocking recklessly without her summons, and it wasn’t just the — justified — confidence of my abilities to create a strategy quickly. </p><p>No, I was pushed by past knowledge. </p><p>I didn’t know if it was paranoia, or it was some kind of sixth sense I developed after handling several disasters in quick succession, but I could feel another disaster in the distance. </p><p>Maybe it would be the Eternals, discovering Janelor’s hideout, maybe it would be the Princess and her secrets proving more dangerous than the headmistress and the school could handle, maybe it would be Helga and Cornelia managing to put themselves in danger, forcing me to save them.  </p><p>I had no idea which one of them would actually result in a crisis, but I didn’t trust my luck enough to avoid all of those triggers. So, the sooner I started working on the headmistress, the sooner I could fix her misunderstanding about my employment status… </p><p>After knocking on the door several times, I had received a message from the headmistress, and I responded by saying it was very urgent. </p><p>I still waited five minutes before the door opened. “Come to my room,” her voice echoed, and I started climbing the spiral stairs. </p><p>Her room contained the full range of decorations it had when I had visited to receive the blessing of light, interesting considering they were not out when I had sneaked into her room and watched her purification ritual. She must have put them on hurriedly to maintain the same impression. </p><p>The slight dampness of her hair, no doubt lay forgotten as she hurriedly put on her armor, confirmed that I had stumbled on her in the middle of her cleansing ritual. </p><p>Pity, she didn’t invite me in immediately. I would have loved to watch her. </p><p>“What’s the emergency?” she asked, her expression as stiff as her voice, no doubt ready to bring out her fury if my interruption was unmerited. </p><p>“I have managed to get the dragon drunk,” I said. </p><p>“That’s it,” she said, her frown tightening as she looked at me. “That’s what you interrupted me for,” she added, her wings glowing as I felt her light magic flare, her aura of power blanketing the room, reminding me that she was not someone to be dismissed. </p><p>Luckily, she was quick to clamp on it. She didn’t have the luxury of using her powers casually, not if she didn’t want her Divine Spark to go out of control — an even bigger problem than I had initially estimated if her deal with Janelor was any indicator. </p><p>“She has loose lips when drunk, especially when speaking to a servant, and she had mentioned a couple of ways of suppressing the effects of Divine Sparks,” I said, then took a step back, like I was about to leave. “But if you don’t treat this as an emergency, we can talk about it during our next meeting.” </p><p>“Stop!” she gasped, her magic flaring once again, but this time with a chaotic feeling. “How do you know I need that urgently.” </p><p>“The dragon mentioned it, of course, while gloating about an unfortunate fate,” I answered. She looked at me suspiciously. “I told you, she has loose lips.” </p><p>“That …” she started, only for her to swallow what was without a doubt an insult, her anger clear in her tone. Her anger was understandable, considering she had accepted every single request of Janelor, yet she still blabbed about her secrets. </p><p>Secrets that revealed her deadly vulnerabilities. </p><p>She was not unjustified in her anger. Janelor spilled those secrets when she was drunk, though she was drunk of pleasure rather than alcohol. I didn’t even know whether alcohol had that effect on the dragons, though luckily, the headmistress didn’t question me about that part, busy thinking more important aspects. </p><p>Like whether this mysterious technique slipped from a dragon’s drunk lips could actually help her control the Divine Spark. </p><p>A nonexistent one, of course, as I needed an excuse to poke and prod around the headmistress’ own reservoir, in the hopes of stealing substantially more than I could during her transfers, hoping to discover something in the process.</p><p>“What’s the technique?” she asked after a long pause, which didn’t surprise me, not with the risks she was facing. </p><p>“She had mentioned several containment strategies, and one of those containment strategies was good enough to store the divine spark in your body, isolated from everything else,” I said as raised my hand, and a complicated, three-dimensional structure appeared in front of her, a variant of the little internal trap I used to store some of the Divine Spark after I had stolen from her. </p><p>In some aspects, it was better than that design, as working on the spear for a full day with no interruption helped me to understand its design principles more, making several improvements to my own structure. </p><p>“It doesn’t look very reliable,” she examined the structure carefully. </p><p>She was correct, it didn’t, because while I had made several improvements, I wasn’t showing her the full structure. “She showed it to me only for a moment, and considering she was very drunk at this point…” I said, not bothering to finish the explanation as I blamed it on the intoxication. </p><p>“Better than nothing,” she commented after she examined the structure for almost ten minutes. “Do your best to make her talk,” she ordered. “Getting the complete schematics is the priority.” </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said. “Do you want to conduct a test right now, to see if it works?” </p><p>“Maybe,” she said as she raised her hand, and a similar structure appeared on the air, barely bigger than a fist. The difference, the oppressing amount of light mana radiating from it, her mana type determined by her angelic nature. </p><p>A glance was enough to show she had made several changes to the structure I had displayed earlier, a couple worthy of being copied into my own design to make some significant improvements, showing that she wasn’t exactly a slouch when it came to magic research and analysis — though it might be also about no doubt the extreme research she had sunk into the subject. </p><p>I felt her pushing some of her mana, barely worth a couple of points, along with some Divine Spark. </p><p>And the structure exploded immediately. </p><p>“It doesn’t work,” she said with a frown. </p><p>A genuine frown appeared on my face as well. “It should have lasted more than just exploding immediately,” I said. “Could it be about the nature of your mana too similar to the spark, making it create some sort of resonance?” </p><p>“Maybe,” she said, thoughtful. </p><p>“Let me try,” I said as I raised my hand, creating a copy of her storage spell, though a few small mistakes to undersell my magical ability. </p><p>[-130 Mana]</p><p>“There’s a mistake here,” she said, pointing the most glaring error I had included, and I changed. Then, she put her hand, injecting the same amount of mana. Once she stopped maintaining control, the Divine Spark went wild, smashing against the limits of the container, but it easily contained the spark. </p><p>She watched my success carefully for a while before she flared her mana once again. But this time, rather than using her mana directly, she created a ward, pulling power from outside reserves, making the construction a longer affair, though the ultimate result looked well. </p><p>Yet, when she put some of her mana, it exploded once again. She turned to look at me suspiciously before her gaze dipping down to my structure, which was still stable. She examined it carefully for a while before replicating the same thing, only for it to shatter again. </p><p>Her frown tightened as she gazed at me, unable to hide her distaste before she replicated the same feat again. This time, when she injected the mana, the structure stayed stable. “Good work. Your discovery solves most of my problems,” she said, though I didn’t miss the tenseness of her tone. </p><p>Nor did I miss the sudden calmness of the mana in her latest container. I would have exploded in laughter if it wasn’t for my Subterfuge skill, helping me control outward signs of my amusement, and even with that, it was a close call. </p><p>I was amused, because I was familiar with the behavior of the Divine Spark after my own attempts to contain it, and it was certainly not as calm as that when mixed with ordinary mana. </p><p>The most reasonable explanation, my dear boss didn’t put any Divine Spark into her structure, trying to trick me that she was able to copy my structure. </p><p>I wondered why she was lying? Was she trying to look more competent than she actually was? Or was she trying to tell me that the vulnerability revealed by Janelor was not as bad as her words indicated?</p><p>Pity that her attempts were destined the failure the moment I noticed the changes in her mana. </p><p>“I’m happy to hear that,” I said. “Is there anything else I can help you with?” </p><p>“Not for now,” she said. “But you earned a reward. I’ll have to think something for you when you visit me again tomorrow for the empowerment.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I nodded respectfully before leaving, hoping that the nuggets of information I had revealed to her would be enough to lit a fire under her…  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 7960 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“I hope I’m not interrupting,” Naomi said, her gaze on the floor, unable to catch my eyes. </p><p>I found myself facing a monumental decision. I could give her a simple excuse and say that she arrived at a bad time, sending her away, leaving me to focus on Sarah. It was definitely the safer option considering Sarah was currently in my bathroom, half-naked, a mistake enough to create a controversy that would shatter their friend group. </p><p>Acting cold might even tempt Naomi more for the future. </p><p>But the potential fun of having Naomi tease Sarah was just too tempting to deny. “Please, come in,” I said as I gestured for her to come inside without asking. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured. </p><p>“So, what brings you here in a surprise visit, Naomi,” I asked, a touch louder than necessary as we arrived at the living room to alert Sarah that we had a surprise guest to prevent a very interesting face-off. I heard a soft gasp from the bathroom, and covered up with a cough of my own, keeping Naomi unaware of the other mysterious guest. </p><p>Normally, Sarah’s presence wouldn’t have been much of a problem. After all, she was a part of the friend group, and her presence was not something Naomi could point out without highlighting the absurdity of her own night-time visit. </p><p>Explaining her presence while she wasn’t wearing a shirt or a bra, however, was much more complicated. Of course, she could leave the bathroom with a towel, but that didn’t make the situation any less complicated. </p><p>I knew that, despite all her bluster about being the tough and brave one in their friend group, Sarah would fail to take that step, especially since Naomi was the visitor. Things might have been different if it was Carrie with everything that happened during that particular evening. </p><p>Naomi’s presence was not as simple. </p><p>Of course, after losing my last mental bet about her selection of bra, I wasn’t entirely confident of that conclusion, but since the alternative promised to be as amusing — if even harder to control — I was willing to take the risk. </p><p>“I come to talk about today,” she said. </p><p>I barely held back a smirk, amused just how similar their excuses were. And just like Sarah’s case, her excuse only worked if one didn’t think about it too deeply. Talking at the school was an option, and so was a phone call. Yet, she was here, to have a talk face to face in the middle of the night. </p><p>“As you wish, sweetie,” I said as I sat on the sofa, using the opportunity to kick Sarah’s shirt under the desk. “Why don’t you take a seat and tell me what’s wrong.” </p><p>She sat down next to me, but her beautiful lips stayed closed as she avoided my gaze once more, her face gaining a darker hue. I said nothing, letting her gather enough courage to speak, though it seemed to be taking a lot of time. </p><p>Before Naomi could speak, I noticed Sarah peeking from the door carefully. Luckily, Naomi was facing the other way, and missed it, while I caught her gaze, and waved at her cheekily. </p><p>The anger on her face was beautiful, especially since she had no choice but to swallow it and pull her head back before Naomi noticed her. </p><p>It took a minute for Naomi to gather enough courage to speak. “I want to talk to you about what happened today.” </p><p>“I understand,” I said before she could speak. “But in my defense, I had just finished my exercises and was exhausted, so it was hard for me to stretch properly. But I promise to you that I’ll do better the next time.” </p><p>“The next time…” she murmured before she widened. “Are you talking about our workout session?” </p><p>“Of course,” I said in a matter-of-fact tone. “And let me tell you just how much I appreciate you coming all the way to critique my workout schedule. I’m having so much trouble maintaining a workout pattern alone.” </p><p>“It’s not a bother,” Naomi answered, lacking the initiative to correct my ‘assumption’ about the event she wanted to talk about, her confidence lacking during anything but working out. She still opened her mouth like she wanted to continue, but facing my appreciative smile, that died quickly. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “And since you’re here, do you want to drink anything. Water, tea,” I listed, before smirking. “Wine, champagne…” </p><p>“Water is fine,” she was quick to take the offer, too shy to take my offer for alcohol. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I stood up. “Just give me a minute to wash my face, and I’ll bring it,” I said even as I passed her the remote. “Feel free to relax.” </p><p>Then, I left the nervous beauty on the sofa and walked to the bathroom to talk with an even more nervous beauty. </p><p>To her credit, Sarah managed to keep her mouth shut until I closed the door. “What are you doing!” she whisper, her anger still clear as she raised her hands. I wondered whether she didn’t care she was half-naked, or she was just too angry to care. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t too hard to check. I took a step toward her, my hand already rising toward her chest. As I made my move, her head dipped down, reminding her current state of dress. Her blush rose to a spectacular level as she covered her tits with her arm. “Where’s my shirt?” she whispered. </p><p>“It’s under the table, where I kicked it to avoid Naomi’s suspicion, of course.” </p><p>“Why’s Naomi here?” she asked, finally able to focus back on the actual problem after she had been derailed earlier. </p><p>“She wanted to talk to me about my workout schedule,” I said, deliberately smiling in a dreamy manner. “She’s very enthusiastic about it.” </p><p>The sudden flash of jealousy on her face was very beautiful, especially since she was still trying to cover her face. “Do you think it’s appropriate to hang with her in the middle of the night in your house?” </p><p>“Why, are you jealous,” I whispered back, amused that she was questioning the appropriateness of a nighttime visit under the circumstances, but she seemed to be immune to the irony of the situation.  </p><p>It managed to make her blush even more than remembering her naked state. “No, I’m not,” she gasped. “Why should I be jealous of you. You’re just a friend. Less than a friend even. An acquaintance. I’m worried about Carrie.” </p><p>It took quite a bit of my willpower to keep my mouth shut about the lengthy explanation of her trying to clarify our relationship. It would have been at least convincing if she declared we were just friends with benefits, but her desperate attempt to reject the connection between us just made her true feelings more obvious. </p><p>And the less said about the appropriateness of her worrying about Carrie’s feelings, the better. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I would have mocked and teased her for several minutes, but Naomi’s presence forced me to be more economical with my time. “You’re such a good friend,” I whispered throatily instead as I took a step forward. “Such a good friend.” </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer as she tried to take a step back, only to hit against the bathroom wall. And with my long legs, covering the remaining distance was nothing. She found herself trapped, but as I started leaning down, her arms fall to the side, revealing her tits once more. And just like that, another kiss started. </p><p>This time, her tongue managed to retaliate before I could slip inside, creating a beautiful battle halfway to create a background for the dance of our lips. It wasn’t the extent of my tricks, of course. One of my hands landed on her breasts, caressing, trailing, and teasing repeatedly to give her even more pleasure, something she was quite receptive to if the way her back arched was any indicator. </p><p>Lost in the aggression upstairs, she missed the significance of my free hand trailing down her stomach, arriving too her waistband, though she didn’t miss the significance as I pushed her sweatpants down, revealing her panties. </p><p>“Oh yeah, they are definitely not sexy,” I said as I pulled back, watching as she tried to cover them with her hand. Her attempts were effective, but only because her panties were tiny in the first place. Add in their lacy nature, and their sexiness was a given, especially on such a beautiful girl. </p><p>The color surprised me. “You surprise me, Sarah,” I murmured. “I wouldn’t have expected red from you.” </p><p>“I-it’s a perfectly normal, daily underwear,” she managed to murmur, her blush spreading. </p><p>“Really,” I said, only to receive a nod. I grabbed her waist before she could say anything else, and pressed my lips against hers to prevent her from making too much noise. However, this time, my aim wasn’t to enjoy her beautiful lips. </p><p>At least, not entirely. </p><p>I put her down after a short yet heated kiss, but before I did so, I had used my foot to pull her sweatpants away. When I put her down, she was breathing hard, her eyes shining with arousal, no doubt expecting me to continue. </p><p>Instead, I grabbed her sweatpants, and smirked at her. “Since you claim your panties are not sexy, you shouldn’t have any problem walking out, right?” I said as I turned back. It wasn’t a reasonable requirement, of course, but after she claimed her amazing panties were not sexy, I had no problems following her shamelessness. </p><p>“Don’t you dare!” she gasped, though still maintaining enough presence of mind to keep her voice down. Though that was a mistake, as it allowed me to also grab the hanging towels, depriving her of anything she could use to cover her beautiful body. </p><p>“See you around,” I said with a smirk, and left the bathroom, leaving her behind. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I finally stepped back to the comfortable messiness of my room, my hands weren’t trembling anymore, not that it surprised me. My decision meant that I had embraced my role in this mysterious new conflict. </p><p>And there was no room for nerves in a conflict. </p><p>I turned on the more complicated part of my dilemma. After all, deciding to take an active role in a mysterious conflict was just a direction, and not a plan. I needed a proper strategy for the upcoming strategy. </p><p>Unfortunately, real-life conflicts were not like chess, all required information sprawled in front of the player, waiting for the decisions that were only limited by their ingenuity and intelligence. In real life, sides were not equal, neither in power nor in conflict. </p><p>Though in my case, said inequality was rather extreme. </p><p>So, rather than going to bed, I turned on my computer and started browsing on the news — though not before creating a couple of Virtual Networks that doesn’t keep any log, just to be on the safe side. </p><p>The fire that I had likely risked my life visiting was a good point to start my search, and almost immediately, I had found a news article on the website of Brightwood Times, the local news agency. </p><p>Unfortunately, there wasn’t much much. </p><p>***</p><p>Today marks another mysterious act by the mysterious cult of Brightwood.  </p><p>Early evening today, the firemen responded to a routine fire call in the rural area. A routine call, after all, with the collapse of corn prices, more and more of those houses are abandoned, creating a permanent fire risk that the mayor still fails to react. </p><p>Unfortunately, soon, they realized it wasn’t just an ordinary fire they were dealing with, when their best efforts failed to do anything, and they soon called for help, and even then, the fire continued to burn down more and more… </p><p>Until the fire mysteriously vanished. </p><p>The medics expected the worst with the number of cars that were outside, but fortunately, there was no sight of any burned bodies in the building. </p><p>But that only deepens the mystery. </p><p>The experts suggest that the cult had used a petroleum-based chemical accelerator to start the fire. But the experts have denied specifying the type of accelerator to maintain the secrecy of the investigation.</p><p>Until now, police managed to identify twenty-three missing people linked to the fire based on the abandoned cars and communications with the family. Unfortunately, police have yet to find any link between those twenty-three people in terms of work, school, or social circle, which continued to leave us in the mystery about the identity of the cult leader. </p><p>Regardless of the method and the identity, however, one thing is clear. This mysterious cult had used a deadly fire as some kind of tribute to whatever crazy thing they believed before moving the next step of their nefarious plan. </p><p>And I’m afraid it’s not just singing a few songs. </p><p>I call on the mayor and the police to put the proper focus on that menace before we end up in another famous cult doomsday where hundreds of members are poisoned for whatever crazy tenet they follow. </p><p>The missing people … </p><p>***</p><p>I skimmed the rest of the article, including the identities and detailed description of the missing people, with several calls to action, begging to the public to come forward with any information they had. </p><p>Unfortunately, neither this article, nor the other snippets I was able to find were particularly useful, though at least, it gave me some knowledge baseline. </p><p>Some parts of the article were reliable, though its usefulness was rather questionable. </p><p>Apparently, the building was abandoned, and was being used as the meeting spot for a new, secretive cult. I would have liked to say I was shocked about the cult aspect, but considering it was the first thing I had come up with to follow my guide’s request if that was required, it brought something more similar to chilling realization. </p><p>It would have been me that disappeared in a tragic fire if I had followed her harebrained ideas. </p><p>The part about no deaths would have been suspicious, but since I had seen the medical teams completely idle during the fire, it was rather clear that they didn’t see any sign of life in the building. </p><p>However, I doubted it was just as simple as the cult walking away in their own will after the fire started. With the magical nature of the fire, some kind of abduction was the likelier option — and that was if this mysterious Darkness didn’t just kill them with a method that left no body. </p><p>I ignored the parts about the chemical accelerator, aware that it was the experts reaching for a convincing explanation. Understandable, considering blaming an invisible angel would hardly help their career, especially in a cult-related case — even if that was completely true.</p><p>The number of missing people, along with their significantly varied jobs and social classes, was rather interesting, but in that aspect, I was rather limited by the news. And I could hardly go and talk to their families without raising any suspicion about myself — my presence near fire had been dangerous enough. </p><p>Unfortunately, the rest of the assumptions and information about the cult was completely useless, because I had no idea whether the journalist actually had any reliable information about the cult and was following it, or just filling the rest based on the attitude of the other cults. </p><p>“It’s research time,” I murmured as I stood up, but this time, to make myself a large cup of coffee. A sleepless night awaited me, and I wanted to be prepared. </p><p>I started simple, searching other news about this mysterious Brightwood cult fire, and their other activities. </p><p>It turned out to be less than useful, because, in a small city, a mysterious fire and the disappearance of a significant group of people was exactly the kind of news that created a cloud of spectacle, the sheer gossip value killing any chance of me getting useful information.  </p><p>There were already dozens of articles popping on the web, not to mention thousands of social media posts, covering everything from religious rants to detailed opinion pieces about the ineffectiveness of the mayor’s fire policy. </p><p>The hundreds of attention seekers claiming to be friends with the missing people, each claiming that particular missing person was the cult leader for various reasons — from occasional mysterious actions to having three dogs that barked too much during the day. </p><p>That much inaccurate information was worse than no information. </p><p>The theories about the mysterious cult were even more outlandish. Some claimed that it was a witch coven that was going on hundreds of years, some claimed all participants already committed suicide, some claimed they were Satanists, and there were even a couple of them swearing that they had seen aliens picking them up. </p><p>The worst part was that I couldn’t even use common sense to disqualify any of the standard bullshit of the conspiracy theorist, not when I had an incorporeal angel goading me to build a cult of my own. </p><p>Who could say this mysterious Darkness wasn’t Lucifer reaching from below, or aliens coming from the sky. </p><p>Helpless, I expanded my search terms, hunting for other mentions of cults, in particular about possible mysterious disappearances, across America and the rest of the world. </p><p>It went just as horribly as I could have hoped. There were thousands of cults all around the world, from crazy people thinking of themselves as the reincarnation of Elvis, to weird sex rings disguised as ancient cults, and a cursory web search hardly helped me to limit the results. </p><p>It was impossible to find anything useful by searching directly. I needed a different approach. </p><p>Luckily, my major as a computer engineering student gave me some options. </p><p>A quick search later, I had found an open-source code for a rudimentary web crawler to catch and analyze news and social media post. I downloaded it. Of course, there were several tools that worked like that I could purchase, but that would leave a money trail, and until I could understand what I was facing, I prefer to be as untraceable as possible. </p><p>Also, the tool itself wasn’t too complicated, so modifying it for my needs before adding several keywords such as cults, mysterious fires, and disappearance wouldn’t take more than a few hours.</p><p>So, I started typing.  </p><p>Interestingly it took only minutes to finish the program. I wasn’t a particularly gifted coder, or interested in programming. Just like my chess career, I had picked my major due to easy employment opportunities rather than skill or passion, therefore, even by studying hard, I was a mediocre student at best. </p><p>And Sunset College was hardly an Ivy League institution in terms of competition, which worked excellently to pin my abilities — or lack of it. </p><p>I was able to code, but usually, my programs were riddled with logic errors and bugs, requiring a significant cycle of development to make them work compared to my classmates. It was why I had assumed it would take a few hours at best. </p><p>However, this time, I managed to run the program after a few quick fixes, while catching and fixing an impressive number of bugs in the process that the original author had left. </p><p>A part of it was no doubt my focus. After all, it was nothing like a deadly threat to make people focus. Still, at this point, I was familiar with the sudden improvement in my abilities based on my Traits, though the exact source was harder to pin down. </p><p>My best guess was Pattern recognition, especially when it came to catching bugs, probably with some assistance from my newest one, Calculation — and maybe some smattering of assistance from Tactics and Strategy in terms of understanding the general structure, but that part was doubtful. </p><p>Regardless of the exact nature of my Traits, however, the program was ready in under half an hour, and after one last click, started working… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I drove away from the fire, leaving the cops and the fire crew behind, though I made sure to drive under the speed limit until I was far enough to avoid their attention. Then, I pressed the gas, speeding up, cutting through the occasional puddle, not caring the mud and dirt it created, ruining the looks of my new, borrowed car.  </p><p>Without my guide looking from my shoulder, forcing me to stay, I had no reason to stick around. Yet, before I could even arrive at the limits of the city, I pulled to the side. </p><p>My hands were trembling. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as the realization of what happened, and more importantly, what might have happened hit me with the full force of a wayward truck. The presence of my guide worked well enough to suppress the weight of the moment, and even after her disappearance, the argument with the sexy policewoman with anger management problems gave me an excuse to focus on the moment. </p><p>But now, the pressure was gone, leaving me with the realization of just how close I had been to a disaster. If I hadn’t driven through the city to delay us, we would have arrived at the facility before the fire. </p><p>Meaning I would have faced whatever was responsible for creating that fire.</p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as the shivers hit me even stronger. I tried taking a deep breath to suppress it, but it turned out to be useless against the enormity of the moment. This so-called Darkness was supposed to be something that had been lost in the annals of history, completely irrelevant, not something that I could stumble around the god-forsaken City of Brightwood. </p><p>Even worse, my guide’s attempt to extinguish that fire showed me that I would have been completely helpless against whatever that was. If the residual of its power was enough to send my guide into some kind of hibernation mode, it was rather obvious that she would have no chance against them in a more direct encounter. </p><p>Not that I could trust her to defend me in the first place with her spotty memory even if she had the necessary raw power. </p><p>Luckily, not all was bad. I had been active for several days, and yet, whatever responsible for directly destroying the Ceremony didn’t come down — or up — to deal with me. </p><p>Combined with my guide failing to notice anything extraordinary about the others until the Ceremony actually started, it wasn’t hard to guess the Ceremony essentially worked like the magical equivalent of a lighthouse, easily detected, while the Heroic Traits was something subtler. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to reach that mental place that allowed me to access the System and my guide. My guide was still in her hibernating state, weakly glowing, and the System was still the same, cold and mechanical. Interestingly, however, I managed to notice something different as I focused. A thin line of energy, floating in my mental space before being devoured by my guide. </p><p>“It must be the Intent,” I murmured, though I was only able to notice because my guide was absorbing it rather aggressively, making it more noticeable in the process. She was probably using it to refill her magic after her exertion. </p><p>However, that realization prompted me to turn the car on once more and started driving, hoping to distract myself with some adrenaline before I made a decision. It wouldn’t have worked as well as drinking a couple of bottles of cheap vodka, of course, but wasting several hours was not something I could afford. </p><p>I needed to calm down before that decision. </p><p>One of the options was to fade into the background. Quit the football team, maybe even the chess team, doing my best to stop collecting people’s attention, therefore their Intent. It looked like a safe decision. It was a decision I hadn’t considered before because of the constant presence of my guide, constantly prompting me to act, with the implied threat of forcing me if I rejected. </p><p>And her ability to extinguish a cursed fire suggested that it wasn’t just an idle threat in the most visceral manner possible. </p><p>Yet, from what I had seen, she needed the Intent to recover. Intent she would have been starved for if I pulled back and started living like some kind of hermit in the middle of nowhere, keeping me away from all the nonsense. </p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how tempting was the idea, I couldn’t feel myself taking that path. It was against my whole personality.  </p><p>Someone more altruistic than me might have said that they didn’t want to leave humanity helpless against some kind of mysterious threat, especially since that threat was somehow linked to the biggest collapse of history, requiring more than a thousand years for the civilizations to recover from its effects. </p><p>That wasn’t me. Especially since I neither asked for it, nor I was the only one that was chosen, as evidenced by the Ceremony that had been happening just several miles away. </p><p>My mentality was simpler. If there was an upcoming disaster, I wouldn’t trust others to defend me against it. </p><p>If there was one thing my less-than-stellar childhood taught me, it was that trusting others was a fool’s errand. </p><p>“Damn it,” I murmured as I pressed the gas harder, enjoying the empty highway, not happy with the realization that I had already made a decision. After all, just because I had made a decision didn’t mean I had to be happy about it. </p><p>Especially if that decision positioned me against some kind of mysterious Darkness. </p><p>I was not a fucking hero. </p><p>Of course, just because I had made the decision to take an active role didn’t mean I had a strategy in place. I still had no idea what kind of danger I was facing, the depths of my abilities, or whether I had any allies — ones that were more reliable than an amnesiac angel — and what was the limits of Heroic Traits. </p><p>It was hard to put together a reliable strategy with that little information. </p><p>Still, some aspects were clear. For example, taking the football team more seriously. My joining had been a momentary fancy, something between fulfilling a childhood dream and a tool to distract a hyperactive angel. However, it was hard to deny that it was still my best bet to generate some kind of fame and renown. </p><p>Chess was another aspect that could give me some benefit, though not as directly. The benefits I gained from nearly winning a tournament showed that the direct benefits were not something worthwhile. </p><p>But the indirect benefits were another matter. I hadn’t missed the fact that a decent amount of gossip about my mini-scandal with Megan had been about my identity as a chess player. People clearly enjoyed the juxtaposition of two social roles, and it wouldn’t be hard to imagine it helping even further if I could actually play in Football games. </p><p>There were many decisions to be taken, but rather than returning back to my dorm, I continued traveling down the highway, hoping that the ride would distract me. </p><p>Unfortunately, I admitted after twenty minutes, it was not to be the case. The driving simply wasn’t as calming as it used to. It took a while for me to realize the reason, but soon, I noticed it. The ride was simply too smooth. </p><p>Who would have guessed I would miss that bucket of rust? </p><p>Yet, without its constant clanking and rustling, the drive was simply too effortless, making it a boring affair unless I had driven the car to the limit — which would inevitably earn the attention of the police. And I neither had the money to pay the fines, nor had I any desire to have a repeat encounter with the police so soon after the previous one. </p><p>Or ever. </p><p>With a sigh, I took the nearest turn, and changed my direction back to college. If the ride was not relaxing, maybe I could go back and do some research and put together a more reasonable plan. Though, since I didn’t enter the city to deliberately got stuck in the traffic, the journey took much less even with the extended detour. </p><p>With the college gates in front of me, I slowed down, giving myself some more time to think, though, as I drove, I felt rather empty. It was hard to admit, but that bucket of rust wasn’t the only thing I found myself missing. Without my guide on the backseat, watching her surroundings absentmindedly and occasionally making an inaccurate yet optimistic comment, the drive felt different. </p><p> It was interesting just how quickly I started taking an odd sort of comfort from her presence. </p><p>And it would be a lie to say her looks were hurting. </p><p>“Pity,” I murmured as I pulled in front of my dorm, abandoning that track of thought. </p><p>There was a lot of research to be done. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched the officer walk toward me, I pushed the other questions to the back of my mind — the questions such as if and when my guide would reappear, what happened in the ritual area, was that fire was really an act of this mysterious Darkness my guide was referring. </p><p>One problem at a time. </p><p>For the moment, my most important objective was to get away, and convince the police officer not to make an official record of my presence. And if I could learn from her why the city responded to a fire with such a serious police response, it would be a nice bonus. </p><p>Sometimes, one needed to be proactive to minimize potential future problems. </p><p>I turned my attention to the officer, finally letting myself get the details. A woman, I noted as I let my gaze dance on her, her expression sharp enough to make me think about the relative merits of escaping. Unfortunately, at this point, it was far too late. </p><p>I waited in the car, my hands still on the wheel as I did my best to look like I was watching the building that was on fire moments ago, the firefighters surrounding the building, their confusion visible from a distance. Understandable considering the extraordinary behavior of the fire. </p><p>Meanwhile, the policewoman walked closer, though luckily, her hand wasn’t twitching toward her gun. Still, I kept my hands on the wheel, displaying that I had no weapon with me. “Get out of the car, carefully,” was her first words when she arrived next to the car, her annoyance not particularly hidden. </p><p>I followed her request. Another lesson from the streets, always carefully listen to the orders of an irate police officer if retreating was not an option. No need to give an excuse for them to get rid of their stress. </p><p>“As you wish, officer,” I said as opened the door, finally letting my gaze fall on her. The first thing I noticed was her beauty, which was apparent even with her baggy and unflattering uniform. She was a brunette, dark brown hair, and hazelnut eyes to match. </p><p>Not wanting to make her more irate, I followed her orders immediately, opening the door casually, yet slow enough not to raise any alarm. </p><p>“How can I help you, officer?” I asked as I glanced at her, my slow movement allowing me to get a glimpse of her beautiful body. Though, the slow movement allowed me to get a more extended glance at her. </p><p>The details I managed to catch were rather interesting. She had a cute face. However, she was not one of the girls that were described as cute only because they lacked beauty. No, she was beautiful, yet the shape of her chin, her beautiful cheeks, and her wide eyes evoked an overwhelming sense of cuteness despite her beauty. </p><p>Ironically, she was cute despite what seemed to be her best effort. She was frowning, but as I looked at her, I was getting convinced that it was not her default expression, but something she deliberately pushed to look more serious. Her makeup, or more accurately, the distinct lack of it, supported that conclusion. </p><p>Almost all women used makeup even if it was something as simple as a soft concealer or a natural lipstick. Yet she had no hint of it. Before I could think about the implications of her deliberate choices, however, she started speaking. </p><p>“What are you doing here, in the middle of a crime scene?” she said, trying to sound serious, but, but her voice was just as soft and alluring as her face despite her attempts to sound harsh.  </p><p>I was interested in the fact that she defined the place as a crime scene, though that fitted the police responding alongside the fire department. It wouldn’t make sense for a regular fire. </p><p>I wondered whether I could get some answers from her without making myself suspicious, and whether it was worth the risk. Pity I didn’t have the best people skills, at least when it came to keeping them happy. Luckily, some of my Traits had the potential to help me, particularly two of them with Social implications. Intimidation, and  Seduction. </p><p>The former wasn’t exactly the smartest idea, and not only because I was in an environment with half a dozen coworkers ready to intervene if she felt uncomfortable. </p><p>Luckily, I had the latter option. </p><p>“Sorry, ma’am,” I answered as I put my hands on the car, doing my best to keep my smile bright, giving an aura of harmless playfulness. “I was having a joyride to clean my mind for the next week’s game when I noticed the fire. So I drove here to see if there was something I could do to help with the crisis,” I said. “Maybe a beautiful officer such as you could use my help?” </p><p>I decided to start softly, thinking that compliments about her beauty might make her flustered, since she was doing her best to conceal that fact about herself, hiding her beauty under the guise of seriousness. </p><p>It backfired spectacularly, evidenced by the subtle clues like her frown getting tighter… </p><p>Or the way she suddenly pushed my head down, my forehead hitting the car hard enough to make a bang. While I was busy yelping in pain, I felt the cold feelings of handcuffs around my wrists. Unfortunately, with my wayward youth, it wasn’t the first time I had felt handcuffs around my wrists. </p><p>“Are you trying to be funny, punk?” she gasped as she pushed me down. </p><p>I had another choice to make. The smart thing was to apologize profusely, hoping that it would resolve her anger. It might even work. But, from the corner of my eye, I realized another officer dashing toward us, his expression alarmed, I decided to take a riskier route to get some more information.  </p><p>With my guide in hibernation and some kind of mysterious enemy acting, a possible altercation with the police wasn’t as scary. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, all you need to ask nicely to put me in handcuffs—” I started, only to be interrupted by another pained cry as I felt her hands slipping into my hair, slamming me down again. </p><p>“Say that again, punk,” she growled while I noticed the other officer walking even faster. Excellent, I thought even as the pain hit. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, you can do better,” I said, only for her to raise my head again. </p><p>This time, before she could slam it down, the other officer growled harshly. “Molly, that’s enough. What are you doing?” he growled, though I would have respected him more if he didn’t look down and took the details of the car first. </p><p>I had a feeling that he was less concerned about doing his job, and more concerned about the backlash from a rich boy whose family might have reacted badly to their precious son getting hurt. </p><p>“He’s a suspect,” she growled. “I’m just making sure he can’t attack us.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, officer, she can treat me as hard as she wants,” I intervened as I looked at him despite my situation, doing my best to copy the smarmy smile Kevin and many other rich kids carried when they bullied and mocked the others, the belief that no consequence would come from their actions. </p><p>For the police, there was nothing scarier than an entitled rich asshole with a valid grievance. </p><p>The depressed sigh of the unnamed police officer was promising. “Not again, Molly,” he said. “Please let him go.” </p><p>“No, what if he was related to the cult, why else he would be here?” she growled in anger. I took note of it even as I did my best to process the meaning of her words. “We will finally have a clue about those bastards.” </p><p>That made the officer take a step forward and put his hands on her shoulder, and drag her away. “Keep your mouth shut, Molly, or do you want to get fired,” he whispered, though not soft enough for me to miss it. “And do you really think that a rich kid would deal with those weirdos?” </p><p>“Maybe if they have drugs,” Molly answered petulantly, her voice considerably louder, her anger still bright, suggesting problems controlling her temper. “He wouldn’t be the first idiot who dragged into a mess for pleasure.” Then, she paused. “And look at his clothes, maybe he stole the car.” </p><p>“Yes, and after stealing a car, he come to hang around half a dozen police officers and started flirting with one,” he answered exasperatedly. “You need to stop being so sensitive about your looks, or you’re going to put yourself into trouble the chief wouldn’t be able to dig you out.” </p><p>Her growl of annoyance was beautiful, though once again suppressed by the exasperated sigh of the other officer, even louder this time. He walked toward me, and unlocked my handcuffs. “I’m sorry about my fellow officer’s aggression, sir. She’s a bit tense because we’re dealing with an important investigation.” </p><p>“Of course, sir, not a bother at all. I receive worse hits every day during the training when the guys tackle me,” I said, carefully slipping my recent affiliation with the football team, trying to tap into the local popularity and trying to give the impression that I was a reckless idiot at the same time. </p><p>Prejudices could be extremely useful tools of manipulation when yielded carefully.  </p><p>“Oh, you’re a football player, I’m a big fan of our Pirates,” the officer said immediately, but his voice was too flat for it to be genuine, showing that the first part of my trick didn’t find a purchase, but the second part worked, which was better than nothing. </p><p>“Yes, I’m a linebacker. My father says that they had recruited me specifically,” I said, deliberately adding another little breadcrumb to make it more convincing. </p><p>“I’m glad our glorious team has people like you to defend the honor of Brightwood. And I’m glad that you want to help us, but it’s an active crime scene. It’s for the best if you leave.” </p><p>“Really?” I said excitedly. “A crime scene? Can I stay? It would be amazing if I can watch you guys!” </p><p>“Unfortunately, sir, that’s against the law,” the older officer answered. “But I’m happy to see our youth having a public consciousness.”  </p><p>I sighed in disappointment before turning my attention back to the brunette officer. “I’m sorry that our fun had been cut short, sweetie. Maybe next time, we can use those handcuffs in a more interesting manner,” I said smugly as I stepped into the car. </p><p>She growled in anger and took a step forward, the other officer took a step between us, his back turned toward me. And with him distracted by her anger, I drove away, with the knowledge of there was some kind of cult that was related to this building, a cult that had previous actions. </p><p>My head hurt, but it was a good trade-off. </p><p>Because they forgot to check for my ID, or even ask for my name. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I followed the trifecta mixture of the sirens, we left the city behind and moved to the rural regions that surrounded the city, which arrived quicker than expected. </p><p>Understandable, as Brightwood was hardly the largest city in America, or even in the State. Though, despite the name of the city, there weren’t many trees around. The area closer to the city had been cut clear decades earlier to make some quick buck and to open the area for industrial farming, creating huge swathes of fields, occasionally broken by a house or a farm silo. </p><p>Yet, the deeper we moved to the farmland, the creepier it felt. We were in the middle of the winter, the fields were empty and brown, giving the area an eerie feeling, which wasn’t helped by the damaged state of the abandoned residences that surrounded the area as more and more families abandoned farming, yet kept their lands in the hopes that the city would grow and their lands would worth more to a developer. </p><p>The lack of any kind of street lights didn’t help as I drove deeper and deeper, relying on the light of my car — and the light of the emergency vehicles in the distance.  </p><p>Admittedly, my fear had less about the environment, and more about my concerns of what awaited us on the other end of our journey. </p><p>Not a model of enthusiasm, certainly. “Maybe we should wait until—“ I started, testing my luck, even though at this point, I was more or less sure about the answer. </p><p>Her simple answer interrupted me. “No,” she simply said, delivered in the same scary voice that made me chill in my bones. I sighed as I obediently followed her direction. At this point, changing her mind was a lost cause. </p><p>I only had two options to slow things down at this point, rejecting her orders completely — which wouldn’t work, because I was scared of her more than I was scared of potential danger when she was serious — or crashing the car. </p><p>It would be a lie to say that I wasn’t tempted to do the second one even if the car was a loan and I would end up stuck in the middle of rural area with no way to return but walk a couple of hours, but at this point, I fully believed that she would force me to walk recklessly to the destination if the car got stuck. In the end, it would only deprive me of a tool to escape. </p><p>Not to mention, with so many police and firemen there, I had a better chance of escaping if things went wrong. Waiting until they left was even worse. </p><p>We drove, our destination getting closer, something I realized after I noticed a certain red hue on the nearby trees, flickering and dancing. The fire itself wasn’t too surprising as I had already heard fire trucks as a part of the emergency convoy, though it hardly helped me to feel calmer about our destination. </p><p>With a sigh, I corrected our route and started driving toward the fire, not even waiting for my guide to talk. No point delaying the inevitable further.  </p><p>Several seconds later, I found myself in front of a large farm building, covered in flickering flames. The fire was raging hard, ignoring the desperate attempts of the firemen to extinguish it, while the ambulances stood at a distance, the medics out with their medical stretchers ready, but not making any move. </p><p>The police created a large cordon around them, though their bored expression as they watched the fire suggested that they didn’t expect to take any action. Admittedly, even their presence was suspicious.   </p><p>An interesting combination, I thought, but before I could spend any time thinking about it, my guide interrupted once more. </p><p>“I can feel magic radiating from the fire,” my guide murmured. Her words scared me, though not as much as her following movement. </p><p>She raised her hand, her fingers glowing with a silver light, one that radiated a direct sense of power. “Stop,” I said even as my fingers tightened around the wheel. “Don’t use any magic.” </p><p>I had no idea how her magic worked, what was her target, or she was capable of anything worthwhile in her state — which was clearly diminished from her peak, not that she seemed to realize that fact — but it seemed like a terrible risk. </p><p>And not just because there were several police officers in the distance that might react badly to a potential light show. And startling people who carried weapons was hardly the smartest idea. I doubt that such an intense fire was the intention of the people that created the ritual in the first place, and I was afraid that the magic would get the attention of the people — or worse, the entities — that were responsible for the fire. </p><p>“Nonsense,” she said dismissively even as the glow around her hand started to radiate more. “We’re at the center of the ritual, and it’s clear that some kind of retaliation from the Darkness. The flames wouldn’t be cursed otherwise. I’m just helping our allies.” </p><p>Her tone wasn’t sharp and argumentative, but it made it worse, because she clearly didn’t care slightest about my opinion. I felt utterly helpless as I watched the bright glow filled the car more and more as her whole body was covered in light.</p><p>Her wings had the most intense effect, making it hard to continue looking at her, but I did my best to keep eye contact, because the light wasn’t the only thing I was feeling. </p><p>I felt a mental stirring. It was hard to describe, and not just because I lacked the words but mostly because I didn’t even understand it myself. A mental tickle, mixed with the sensation of getting the first glimpse of dawn while the spring breeze caressed my skin… </p><p>Magic, I realized. What I was feeling was magic. </p><p>Lost in the sensation, I failed to say anything as her glow intensified, spreading over the fire. Only then that I looked at the police, expecting them to rush toward my car, trying to think how I would explain such a spectacular show. </p><p>However, a glance was enough to confirm that they weren’t panicking — well, not more than an out-of-control fire required them — confirming that just like her physical body,  her magic was only visible to me. </p><p>At least, it was the case for this particular spell. </p><p>Her magic wrapped around the house, mixing into the fire. For a moment, the fires flared even harder, making it rise to the sky, making the firemen yell in panic as they warned their friends. Yet, only a second later, the flames lost their impassive size, returning their previous status, and shrinking even further. </p><p>When her glow finally disappeared, the building was still burning, but with much less intensity, making it an easy target for the water jets of the hoses and other chemical solutions.  </p><p>“Huh,” my guide murmured, and my eyes widened in shock. Her voice was different, not just tired, but reminding me of a party girl who just drank a dozen tequila shots. “Huh, the fire is still going on,” she murmured. “Let me…” </p><p>It was clearly a terrible idea. The fire was already about to be extinguished, making her help an unnecessary luxury. Moreover, whatever she had just done took a lot from her. It wasn’t just her voice. Even her body started to turn transparent. </p><p>Yet, she acted before I could even say a word, continuing her habit of making extremely ill-advised decisions. The glow surrounded her body once more, and the flames disappeared completely. </p><p>And she disappeared from the backseat. For a moment, I couldn’t help but think that it was the end, though it awakened hope and regret at the same time. After all,  as much as her presence represented danger, it also represented a way to change my life completely. </p><p>Before I could think about the implications, however, I closed my eyes, trying to meditate, only to feel her presence throbbing on the back of my head, though much less intense compared to the time she had disappeared at my request. </p><p>More importantly, the System was still there, giving the same mechanical feeling. I even tried to reach and touch it, only to receive a nice surprise, probably a delayed reward from my performance in the finals, as we had forgotten to trigger it after the huge rush I had felt. </p><p>[Calculation I, acquired]</p><p>It wasn’t hard to guess the source of that exact part. I probably received calculation due to very complicated losing battles I had to fight against Lauren, resulting in it another welcome bonus. It would certainly help me design more complicated attacks and allow factoring in the limits of the  </p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t in a mood to focus on that particular benefit. </p><p>I had more important things to focus on. Like why my guide had disappeared, why the site of the ritual suddenly disappeared. </p><p>Or, what I was going to say the police officer that was walking toward me.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>I took a step back, enjoying the sight of the Queen, chained yet still sexy. The fact that it was the same chains she had used to disable me for months was just a bonus. For a while I did nothing but enjoy the flickers of emotions on her beautiful face, pushing to the surface no matter how much she tried to keep her expression calm and measured. </p><p>It was hard for her to process the realization that the plots she had crafted carefully had been a part of her target from the start. That was not the truth in a technical sense, of course, but I had long since learned that truth was a soft, malleable idea, more than willing to show the designs of anyone that was careful enough to sculpt into easily-swallowed portions, though it was best delivered by the supporting facts. </p><p>From her perspective, the fact that she had been played from the start was the truth, and nothing but the truth. </p><p>Sapphire had no option but to believe my version of the events, because the sudden appearance of two mystical factions made it very plausible. It was still a bad plan, of course. If I had been trying to defend against them, I would have designed a plan that wouldn’t rely on the mercy of my enemies, but I had no reason to inform my cute Queen about that. </p><p>My cute Queen, who was looking suspiciously blushed in the chains rather than feeling afraid. </p><p>“Is this the fear I see on your beautiful face?” I asked as I took a step back, caressing her cheek gently, her lips parting readily as they dragged closer to her cheeks. </p><p>“Maybe,” she readily admitted. </p><p>I kept my gaze on her as I caressed her lips. “No,” I murmured. “I have seen this expression on your face before, and that time, you were certainly not scared. After all, you were just facing an upstart merchant, one that you could easily manipulate to spill information, with no ability to actually hurt the sole ruler of the Great Empire of Light. Am I wrong, Your Majesty?” </p><p>“No,  you’re not wrong,” she answered, and to her credit, she managed to deliver it smoothly. No flickers, no hint of frustration, nothing. </p><p>Too bad for her she was much less successful hiding the natural reaction of her body to the excitement. A glance to her bountiful chest was enough to confirm the state of her nipples, hard enough to push to her thick dress, shouting for attention. </p><p>“Nice Queen,” I said even as I caressed her cheek once more, very gently. “And what do nice Queen’s get?” Her blank expression at my words was beautiful. I chuckled before answering my own question. “Nice Queens get rewarded.” </p><p>“How—“ she started, only to receive a slap on her beautiful breasts, making them sway even in the dress. “This is not a reward,” she managed to say. </p><p>Her answer was another smirk. “Oh, really,” I said even as I let my hand travel down, caressing her skin and enjoying her out-of-control heartbeat at the same time. It had two functions, one was to serve my carnal desires, and the other was to let her enjoy the unique sensation of being powerless, something she clearly appreciated if her beautiful breaths were any indicator. </p><p>“R-really,” she said, but this time, her voice flickered. A benefit of my hand slipping into her beautiful cleavage, giving her a touch that reminded her of our other private dealings. </p><p>“I see, then I shouldn’t treat you like that for being a good Queen,” I said as I pulled my hand back, which caused her expression to flicker into dissatisfaction. She was too prideful to admit she enjoyed that treatment — even after the number of times she had unabashedly enjoyed the treatment — choosing to forgo the pleasure. </p><p>She was lucky that I was a nice man. </p><p>Well, kind of nice. </p><p>Actually… </p><p>Okay, she was lucky that I was rather short on time, not to mention keeping her in the prison for several days would create too many problems for me to handle. And most importantly, she was lucky that, under our current circumstances, her preferences matched perfectly with my objectives and desires. </p><p>“You’re right, and good Queens shouldn’t receive slaps to their beautiful tits as a reward,” I murmured, enjoying the feel of power her sudden disappointment brought. Another chuckle left my lips. “Unfortunately, you have just lied by claiming you didn’t enjoy it, making you a Bad, Bad Queen. And what do Bad Queens get?” </p><p>“This time, her answer was instant. “Punishment,” she intoned, her voice filled with desire. </p><p>“Excellent answer,” I said even as I ripped her dress in one move, letting it fall around her waist, leaving her beautiful breasts naked. She trembled in excitement, her nipples already rock hard, her breath pushing it up repeatedly. I couldn’t help but lick my lips in excitement. “Why are you cold?”  I asked. </p><p>“It’s cold in here,” she answered quickly. </p><p>“And whose fault is that?” I asked, which made her look at me proudly, showing that she was more than happy to cause me a great amount of discomfort in the process. Such a sassy Queen. “Still, I can’t let you suffer the same cold I had suffered. You’re lucky that I’m such a nice Dark Lord, doing my best to make prison comfortable to you.” </p><p>Before she could answer, I grabbed her breasts, doing my best to protect their beauty from the ravages of the cold. Unfortunately, it was too cold for my hands to be effective, especially with the amazing size of her breasts. Luckily, the solution wasn’t too difficult, let my hands move over her beautiful breasts, distributing the heat in the process. </p><p>“You’re still trembling, why?” I said, unable to keep myself from teasing her slowly as I enjoyed her chained beauty. I slapped her breast, which made her moan. “You should get used to answering immediately, Your Majesty,” I said even as I twirled her nipples, making her moan beautifully in the process. </p><p>“I will,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, my hands continuing with their rough treatment. “After all, it’s in our best interest if this doesn’t last long. You should know that I’m an honest, celibate man, and as a Queen, I can’t imagine you enjoying showing off your body,” I said, unable to make a dig at her part-time job as an exotic dancer. “I can’t imagine you enjoying teasing a room full of horny men, showing off your beautiful body that earned my loyalty than your policies to a room full of horny nobles just because you enjoy it.” </p><p>Of course, she hadn’t been showing off just because she enjoyed it, but also it gave her an excellent opportunity to improve her magical power through the application of some spells that had been made illegal by her own Empire. Still, I avoided that mention, because I wanted her to believe I had missed that particular application of her Tantric abilities. </p><p>Ironically, her thinking that she had a hidden weapon would only make her easier to control. And if she decided to lash out one day, I would much prefer her using a weapon I knew, rather than her trying to find a new one in the dark. </p><p>“Yes, I enjoy it,” she admitted, which was, ironically, also the truth. Not the full truth, but a truth nonetheless. Just because she was using it for an aim didn’t mean she didn’t enjoy the power she had over those very important men. </p><p>“Too bad that it’s going to stop,” I said even as I twisted her nipples once more. “After all, I’m a jealous man, and I don’t like my woman leered by a bunch of useless men, especially those so-called nobles that had power only because of a fluke of birth.” </p><p>“I’m not your woman,” she answered defiantly, which earned another slap to her beautiful breasts, this time hard enough to echo on the walls. She didn’t seem to mind it much, however, if the sudden blooming pleasure covering her face was any indicator. </p><p>She was enjoying her new status more than I expected, not that it was a problem in any case. Dominating the Queen that ruled the strongest Empire was good. </p><p>Dominating the Submissive Queen of the Empire was much better, even though that submissiveness was buried deep, waiting for a true man to unearth it. </p><p>“You’re not?” I asked, displaying a comical expression of surprise even as my hands danced over her body. “So, that means that you’re hating every single thing that I had been doing  since the beginning, right?” </p><p>“Of course,” she answered, her breathing quickening in excitement as she didn’t even bother hiding her anticipation. </p><p>“So, you must be completely dry,” I said as one of my hands traveled down, caressing her stomach softly until it slipped under her dress, arriving at a familiar, yet still a wondrously beautiful location. I felt my fingers drench in her wetness, which was enough to show her great pleasure even if her moans had failed to clue me on that. </p><p>“Yes, you’re completely dry,” I said even as I pulled my hand out, showing my glistening fingers to her. “Clearly, stopping is the only fair thing to do.” And with that, a click echoed on the room, identical to the sound of chains opening. </p><p>“No,” she gasped in panic as she turned to look at her chains, showing her lack of enthusiasm for the treatment to be over. </p><p>“I told you, I’m a very nice Dark Lord,” I said as I chuckled, because the sound she heard was the result of a small noise cantrip, and the chains were still around her beautiful wrists, keeping her immobile. Then, that chuckle turned into a dark, enthusiastic smirk, one that made her gasp in arousal. </p><p>“It’s time for some real fun…”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A servant walked to me, while the ladies looked at me hungrily. “It’s time to send you back, slave,” the servant said loudly. My gaze turned to Olivia, curious about the sudden change, but only to find a smirk on her face, suggesting the party was just about to begin. </p><p>Though, this time, they were clearly angling for something different than an open-air orgy.  </p><p>I said nothing, choosing to obediently follow the servant until she brought me to a bedroom, decorated with bright silk surrounding a huge, four-poster bed that radiated magic to make it even more comfortable. </p><p>Of course, no matter how well-decorated the room was, it couldn’t rival the sight of two naked figures, laying on the bed. One of them was a familiar figure. Cera, the enthusiastic brunette girl from an Equites family distinguished herself by working hard, earning herself a position with the higher classes. </p><p>Not a particularly comfortable position, as she was currently lying down, her head between the legs of a woman I didn’t recognize. The only personal thing I knew about her was that she was married — and I knew that only because her husband was also in the party, a deep discussion with Tiberius, trying to decide a political direction for their campaign. </p><p>I wonder if that was the reason Olivia sent me to this room first, keeping her happy so that she could nudge her husband toward a deeper alliance. It wouldn’t be the only bride that would allow such a thing. </p><p>Though, as my gaze danced on her naked body, I was rather enthusiastic about it. She was not as young as the others. I would guess she was in her mid-thirties. But she was one of those lucky women the time treated them very kindly — that or the immense amount of expensive treatments to prevent even the smallest defect from appearing on her skin. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, it didn’t change the fact that she was a delicious thick brunette whose curves reminded me of an hourglass, her flawless skin shining beautifully under the candlelight. </p><p>If pleasuring her was what I needed to do to make sure Olivia’s political activities went flawlessly, it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. </p><p>“You better not disappoint, boy,” the woman spoke haughtily, dismissal in her tone clear even as she gazed at my body hungrily. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it, esteemed noble,” I said with a smirk even as I removed clothes, each step leaving me more naked. “I’m sure you’ll be very happy with my services.” </p><p>She nodded, her gaze already dancing on my body. Which was a mistake, as if she had kept her gaze up, she would have noticed the peculiarity of my expression, and prepared herself for what was about to come. </p><p>I had no intention of rejecting her order, of course. I was just a poor slave, beholden to my betters, helpless to their dominance. </p><p>Right? </p><p>Even thinking about that, I couldn’t help but chuckle. Even after all the exposure, I was still unable to believe just how arrogant the nobles that were ruling one of the strongest countries, if not the strongest, of the world, were able to send the legendary legions to foreign lands with just a whisper. The arrogance of nobles in the province of Britannia was nothing in comparison. </p><p>Ironically, it was the arrogance and dismissal they were showing that made it so easy to infiltrate their homes and other sensitive locations. Maybe they didn’t expect a Sorcerer to infiltrate their exalted society that way, which would have been not too inaccurate. Every Sorcerer was a strategic weapon, even for a country as strong as the Republic, not exactly something that could be deployed as a spy. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but feel that it was not the strategic thinking but arrogance that prevented it from being used. </p><p>Luckily, I was there to help, helping those exalted Romans to realize pride was a dangerous emotion that needed to be abandoned. </p><p>One sexy noble at a time. </p><p>“Hurry up, you barbarian, don’t keep me waiting,” she ordered. “Start fucking this bitch from behind.” Cera’s hips rose, indicating that she had no problems accepting such a conclusion. </p><p>I just smirked as I climbed on the bed, but rather than slipping inside Cera, I climbed next to her, and reached for her breasts, their amazing size more than enough to fill my palms. “What are you doing, you barbarian,” she grumbled angrily. “I gave you an order.” </p><p>“I know,” I said even as I squeezed her breasts hard enough to make her gasp in pain, but not hard enough that it stopped being enjoyable for her. Though, with Cera working steadily downstairs, providing pleasure, the cutoff point was reasonably high. “And I ignored it.” </p><p>And I had no problem reaching that to the limits of it, squeezing her nipples hard. A moan escaped her mouth, but her brown eyes turned to me, angry despite the joy she received from the action. “You’re just a gladiator, you’re supposed to listen to me,” she growled in genuine anger. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said even as I slapped her tits. “Didn’t you ask your friends how the things the previous time had worked? I’m Peirous, and I’m not your servant. No one can command me in the bedroom.” Then, I paused for a moment, looking at her with a smirk. “Of course, I’m more than happy to turn and leave. I’m sure your friends love to hear that how you couldn’t handle a real man,” I added, thumping my chest just to highlight the impression even more.   </p><p>She looked at me, shocked at my daring while I smirked at her. Interestingly, my rough treatment of her was only possible because of my reputation as a barbarian. Roman women were prideful, and more importantly, they had the laws behind them, and if a husband started acting too arrogant at home, they might find themselves divorced. </p><p>Ironically, the attraction they had toward me came from that paradox as well, promising something that their husbands failed to give, but ultimately, in a setting that was safe for them. </p><p>Too bad for them that I was much more than they expected. </p><p>“Don’t be too arrogant—“ she started, but I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a searing kiss, my tongue invading her mouth. She tasted a delicious mixture of fruits and wine, helping my enthusiasm even more than the beautiful sight of her generous curves. </p><p>When I pulled back, I didn’t bother to hide my sense of superiority. “Tell me which one you want to pick,” I said even as I grabbed Cera’s head, pushing her down to make her continue to service the busty older beauty, while my smirk just widened, enjoying the conflict of her face. </p><p>Especially since her gaze dipped down several times, checking the treasure between my legs, no doubt considering whether abandoning her pride for a night was a worthy price for what I was offering, though her eyes, clouded in arousal, left no doubt about where her ultimate choice would lie. </p><p>The nod of approval came not too long after, putting a smirk on my face. I grabbed Cera’s hair and pulled her back harshly, knowing from experience that she enjoyed the rough treatment. So, her moan didn’t surprise me. </p><p>Unfortunately, I needed to attend our noble guest — well, the nobler one, technically. I took Cera’s place, but rather than lying down to service her, I positioned my shaft against her glistening entrance, already wet enough after Cera’s service. </p><p>Yet, rather than sliding inside, I waited, still pinning her under my smirk. It took a while for her to realize I had no intention of starting to move. She pushed her hips forward, only for me to pull back, maintaining the distance. </p><p>The expression of frustration on her face was simply too beautiful. “What are you waiting for, you arrogant slave?” she growled, which, I had to admit, enhanced her mature beauty even further, making me even more tempted to wipe it off, replacing it with a worshipful expression. </p><p>“I’m waiting for you to ask nicely, of course.” </p><p>“You dare!” she gasped as she tried to push herself up, but pressing my hand on her stomach easily stopped her. She might wield a lot of authority in her noble house, giving her considerable power, but that hardly transferred into physical strength. Despite her best effort, she stayed pinned under my hand, unable to stand. </p><p>“Of course, I dare,” I said with a smirk. “I took down a crazy Nemean Lion alone, do you think a naked noble scares me, no matter how sexy she is.” I stopped for a moment, enjoying the shocked expression on her face, though not missing the opportunity to slip a compliment. </p><p>Her sexy curves deserved it. </p><p>Then, I put a serious expression as I pulled my hand back. “But if you don’t want to enjoy my presence, I’m sure your exalted friends will have no problem starting earlier,” I said as I turned my back, looking determined to walk away. </p><p>I heard the distinct sound of a fist connecting to a pillow, followed by the sound of the same pillow, cutting through the hair. </p><p>Amusingly, despite our closeness, she managed to miss me, the pillow hitting the wall. I continued walking away, not even bothering to react to her. She only spoke once my hand touched the handle of the door. </p><p>“You win, you bastard,” she growled. “Come here and fuck me, dominate me. But I swear to Venus, if you leave me unsatisfied, I’ll have your head!” </p><p>Almost perfect, I thought. I could have done without the threat at the end, but I didn’t care much about that. After all, I had a couple of hours to teach her the lesson she deserved… </p>",

    "content": "<p>My sexy dragon’s eyes widened as she found herself filled to the brim after her accident. Her mouth opened, no doubt to complain, but her body had other intentions. </p><p>Like releasing another earth-shattering moan, showing that, even in this form, she had the lungs of a dragon. </p><p>“Careful,” I said even I squeezed her tits, enjoying their softness. “Try not to take anything you can’t handle.” </p><p>The slight dig to her pride once again worked excellently even when she had found herself in a position far farther than she had planned for. “I can handle anything you give,” she replied immediately, ready to defend her pride. </p><p>Though, she seemed less sensitive about where her pride was leading her. </p><p>With that, her hips started rocking once more, her movements much more enjoyable as she started to do her best to devour the entirety of my shaft. She failed, of course, but that didn’t blunt her enthusiasm. She deserved a reward, I decided. </p><p>[-680 Mana]</p><p>Of course, as she did her best to make my presence in, the pleasure started to get more and more overwhelming for her, her moans rising uninterrupted. So much that, her passionate rhythm started to stagger. </p><p>So, I brought my hands down, landing on her hips to help her maintain the beautiful rhythm she had started, every push widening her beautiful tightness. “Move faster, mistress,” I ordered, still emphasizing the last word to mock her for her daring to use me as a servant. </p><p>I was, as always, a vindictive bastard when the situation called. </p><p>That earned an angry glare, but nothing more, as she was busy moaning uninterrupted, pleasure long invaded her whole being. And her challenge to absorb all the mana I was providing only made it even more difficult to maintain control. </p><p>It was a good opportunity to examine her transformation process once more, I decided as I turned a part of my attention on the transformation that was going on in her body. I examined the layers and layers of construct she was building on her bones, slowly changing the nature of it. </p><p>After a couple of minutes, I decided to stop. Unfortunately, even with the lesson I had received from her, and with the assistance of my Biomancy, I wasn’t able to truly understand the nature of her trick, let alone create a viable copy for my own usage. </p><p>Whatever she was doing was either a special dragon ability, or something that required special training. Either way, I decided to shelve it for the moment, to be tested during the first feasible opportunity. </p><p>I turned my attention back to her reckless movement, enjoying her moans as she jumped up and down, doing her best to stuff her tiny pussy. With my hands on her hips, maintaining the pace, along with the tenseness of her slow approach earlier, it didn’t take long for her to climax explosively, tightening even further around me. </p><p>She collapsed against my chest, her breathing out of control, her desperate moans begging for rest. </p><p>Too bad that she didn’t earn the right to rest. </p><p>She failed to react as I grabbed her waist and twisted her, and she found her chest pressing against the softness of the bed once more. A soft murmur of comfort left her mouth, only to be interrupted halfway as she felt my hands grabbing her beautiful horns once more. </p><p>“What are you doing?” she barely managed to say between her labored gasps, still trying to throw off her latest orgasm. </p><p>“Continuing the massage, of course,” I said even as I pressed my hard shaft against her entrance once more. “Don’t tell me that you are too exhausted to handle it.” </p><p>“Of course, I’m not,” her answer came predictably, her pride ever-useful. “However—“ she tried to continue. Unfortunately, I would never learn what she intended to say, because I chose that moment to push forward, replacing her words with an urgent cry of pleasure. </p><p>Despite everything, her eagerness to enjoy another round was never in doubt, and she replied with a moan, even as I pulled her horns back, forcing her to bend into a very special shape even as I pinned her under me. </p><p>She tried to push her ass back toward me a few times, only to abandon that when she realized just how hard I intended to impale her. “Too hard,” she gasped. </p><p>“Why, mistress,” I said, once again mocking her even as I pulled one of my hands away from her horn to wrap around her hair, changing my hold into a painful pull, while using my free hand to slap her plump ass. “Don’t tell me that you, a great dragon, can’t handle a weak human?” </p><p>I loved her predictable her answer was. “I can handle anything you can dish out,” she gasped, even as her voice was strained. Since she was showing such kindness playing along, I decided to reward her with another flood of mana. </p><p>[-740 Mana]</p><p>As I picked up even more speed, I could feel that I was slowly getting toward an explosion of my own. The exquisite tightness and deafening moans of a sexy dragon were not easy to resist. </p><p>Of course, I had no intention of letting her succeed before I had thoroughly made her pay about her temerity to position herself as my superior. “Moan for me, mistress,” I ordered even as I spanked her ass again, hard enough to leave a red mark even with her physical resistance. </p><p>“I’ll make you pay,” she managed to growl. </p><p>“Oh, I’m looking forward to it, mistress,” I said even as I slapped her ass again, enjoying the way her plump flesh rippled. However, considering with all the strength and magic under her command, those words were the only thing she had used to dissuade me from it, I doubted she was hating the treatment as much as she tried to reflect. </p><p>I smirked as I started to enjoy the full benefits of my controlling position, slowing down and speeding up in surprise timings, increasing her pleasure even further, her body nothing but a toy under my command. </p><p>Another orgasm hit her, turning her moans into barely audible mewling as she tried to stay conscious. Even for a dragon, chain orgasms of explosive intensity were not that easy to handle. </p><p>For a moment, my gaze slipped toward her puckered hole, tempted to take her from there, but I decided against it for two reasons. First, she was already too far gone in pleasure. She was under the risk of collapsing immediately if I made such a radical move. </p><p>Second, dazed and filled with pleasure, it was the perfect time to interrogate her. </p><p>Without skipping even a beat, I leaned forward, my hands once again on her horns, pulling her back enough for her tits to dangle freely. “So, tell me about the deal between you and my boss,” I ordered. </p><p>Normally, I would have tried to be more careful in my interrogation, but at this point, she was far too gone to mislead me, maybe even understand the political significance of my question, that I wanted to learn about my ‘boss’. </p><p>“That upstart bird,” she managed to whisper between her moans as I didn’t stop my hips. Yet, despite that, she managed to convey the dismissal she was feeling. </p><p>“Yes,” I said, unable to hide my amusement. </p><p>“You shouldn’t work for that lowly bird, and instead work for me,” she managed to murmur dazedly. </p><p>“That’s a good offer,” I whispered suggestively. “And we know that you can keep this poor servant satisfied,”  I added, unable to suppress the temptation to mock her, which made her growl angrily for a second before pleasure melted her annoyance again. “But how can I work for someone I don’t even know the name of.” </p><p>“Janelor,” she responded immediately. “My name is Janelor.” </p><p>I chuckled. “It’s good to know, mistress. Now, why don’t you tell me exactly that weak bird wanted from you.” </p><p>“She wants me to save her from her arrogance, of course,” she managed to whisper between her moans, her dismissal clear. I did my best to listen, and not explode in amusement as she blamed someone else for being arrogant. </p><p>“How exactly?” I asked. </p><p>“She’s nothing but a lowly soldier of that annoyingly sanctimonious Host of Light, prancing around declaring their superior virtue, but the moment she found an opportunity to rise, she took it without blinking,” she said. </p><p>“You’re talking about the Divine Spark,” I guessed. </p><p>“Yes. I have no idea where she had found such a substantial piece of it, but she had wildly overestimated herself when she tried to absorb it,” she explained. </p><p>“Is there a special condition to absorb Divine Spark, or is it about her power,” I asked. </p><p>“Divine Spark is more trouble than its worth,” she declared, which, unfortunately, implied that she didn’t have deep knowledge. I doubted she would miss a chance to brag. “There’s a reason no dragon ever lowers themselves to absorb one.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought, though not exactly willing to dig deeper into her statement about dragons not deigning to absorb one, as there were too many probabilities, from a potential incompatibility to her being wrong. It wasn’t really important, not at this moment. </p><p>“So, she had overestimated herself, so what? Can’t someone help her?” </p><p>She managed to chuckle between her moans. “That’s the funny part, the one that could help her easily is her boss, but the moment she dared to absorb the Divine Spark of Light, she become a heretic.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured. “And she wants the help of your boss,”  I said. </p><p>“My friend! I have no superior,” the dragon growled angrily, quick to correct my assumption. I doubted that was the case, but once again, it was semantic that was not interesting to spend any time on. I had already learned what I needed from her. </p><p>“If you say so, mistress,” I said mockingly even as I sped up, the sound of flesh hitting flesh filling the room, mixing with her moans and my grunts, my grip around her horns as tight as her nether lips’ grip around my girth. </p><p>With my desperate ramming, it didn’t take long for her to reach another orgasm, but this time, I accompanied her in the direction, filling her with my cum and my mana as she exploded in ecstasy. </p><p>[-1685 Mana]</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes…” she moaned desperately as the pleasure and my power filled her directly, infusing her whole being. But this time, she failed to resist the call of exhaustion, slumping on the bed as I pulled out of her, my release drizzling out. </p><p>“Such a beautiful view,” I murmured as I quickly dressed, leaving her in her bed, my cum staining her, a great proof of my selfless efforts to keep my mistress happy. </p><p>Now, I needed to have a talk with the other mystical being who was under the impression that she was my boss. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 2890 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Being crushed under a dragon should be a scary concept, the kind that was supposed to make my heart explode in fear. </p><p>However, considering the current form of the little sexy dragon who thought herself to be my mistress, the current speed of my heart had little to do with fear, especially not when her hips started to dance over my lap. </p><p>The expression on her face was beautiful, a mixture of arousal and frustration, victory suspiciously absent. “You look frustrated, mistress—“ I started, only for her hand to appear over my face, shutting me up. </p><p>“Don’t you dare to speak,” she growled, smart enough to realize the direction of the words I had prepared, and with no intention of allowing me to mock her. Yet, her current frustrations with my attitude could not be compared to the burning need of her unmet arousal. </p><p>Otherwise, she wouldn’t have climbed on my lap, rocking back and forth as her weight pressed against my shaft. She didn’t take me inside her, but from the way she was going, I guessed it wasn’t too far away. </p><p>So, rather than trying to coax her, I put my hands under my head, enjoying the show. “Stop it,” she warned. </p><p>“Stop what?” I asked, not hiding my smirk. “I didn’t say anything.” </p><p>That earned another growl, but rather than trying to push me on the issue, she put her hands on my chest, using the leverage to rock me more desperately. Though as her dance picked up speed, I was starting to feel tempted to call off our little game as I pushed her against the wall or bent her over the table once again, taking her freely. </p><p>Yet, I stayed in my place, obedient. As much as the idea of taking her roughly was fun, it couldn’t compare to the idea of my lust-filled dragon getting so overwhelmed to take me. </p><p>Being ridden by a dragon was a unique experience. </p><p>So, I kept my mouth shut even as her delicate hands caressed my chest, her nails sharp enough to leave actual bleeding wounds on my chest — though they recovered only after a moment. She was almost straight looking up at first, but the more her hips repeated their glorious movement, the more she leaned forward. Her tits soon started to rub against my chest, but she avoided kissing me. </p><p>Amusingly, she wouldn’t be able to kiss me without changing her position even if she wished to do so. A humorous drawback of her shortness. </p><p>I managed to keep my opinion to myself about her height, courtesy of her sexy ass, rubbing against my shaft repeatedly. Yet, she was determined not to sink my shaft into her sopping wet entrance, repeating the same motion again and again. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of allowing that to be the whole theme, especially since, I had the ability to change it without actually taking back the control. </p><p>First, I brought my mana to the surface once more, coating the head with a generous amount of it and leaving the rest to the shaft, before I chose the exact apex of her movement, and changed the positioning of my shaft slightly. </p><p>[-610 Mana]</p><p>When she moved back once more, she noticed the sudden change of alignment, but not before the tip sank into her wetness. “No,” she gasped as she pulled herself back, only to stop halfway as I felt the mana around my shaft starting to be drained with an efficiency that surpassed her earlier attempts. </p><p>Sex was truly the superior way to deliver mana after it went through Tantric treatment. </p><p>I said nothing, just lay on my back, my hands crossed under my head, enjoying the sudden conflicting expression on her face. She said nothing at first, nor did she move, which was interesting because it left the tip buried in her wetness. </p><p>“It’s wrong,” she murmured, but her voice lacked confidence as she suffered a mental battle about the merits. </p><p>I could have whispered her suggestions that it was nothing, claimed that it was a step she had to take to get my mana, or even blamed her for cowardice. Any of those options would have made her move faster, taking us to the next step. </p><p>But I kept my mouth shut. None of those options were as entertaining as watching her struggle with her emotions, failing to come up with an answer. Why should I abandon her delicious conflict for a lesser entertainment? </p><p>Her plump ass started to tremble as she tried to come to a decision, going back and forth in her mind while her hips didn’t move at all, which would have been disappointing if it wasn’t for the crown of my shaft still buried in her entrance, allowing me to enjoy her warmth thoroughly, her wetness getting out of control. </p><p>She was a dragon, mighty, fascinating, and prideful, a combination that should have ensured the victory of her willpower. Unfortunately, she was also an unabashed hedonist with a weakness for finer things, not to mention her greed begging her to get more of my precious mana. </p><p>As much as watching her conflict had been fun, her decision was never in doubt. “Just the tip, there’s no harm in that,” she whispered. I suspected it was more about convincing herself than explaining it to me. </p><p>Her hands landed on my chest once more as her hips started to rock, making her beautiful tits sway to her rhythm, my tip slipping in and out. I expected her to be impatient, sinking deeper, but she showed incredible determination — for her standards — and managed to stay limited to the tip. </p><p>I was not above cheating, not when I could do it at the expanse of some more disposable mana.  I reinforced the mana coating my shaft, but this time, keeping the focus a touch lower than the tip. The perfect bait for a greedy dragon. </p><p>[-320 Mana]</p><p>It didn’t take long for it to show results, as her hips picked up speed. At first, she managed to restrict herself around the tip even with the increased speed, but then, in one of her rockings, she moved deeper. </p><p>It was a mistake that was corrected quickly, making me doubt the success of my strategy. Luckily, that doubts didn’t last long, as, after just a few seconds, the mistake happened again… And again… </p><p>Soon, she moved too far to define the situation as just the tip, even under the most generous descriptions. Not that I was complaining, not with my shaft parting her delicious pussy lips more with every repeat, even though it was a slow process, like she was trying to make me forget the previous limits by her rapid movements. </p><p> Suppressing the temptation to help her was extremely hard. Luckily, I had better control over my desires than her — when the said time was being measured in minutes and not days, if I were to be honest — and managed to keep my desires to grab her hips and sank myself into her depths. </p><p>Luckily, she was a very kind dragon, and her movements continued to escalate, my shaft parting her tight lips more and more. Slowly, the tip moved deeper as she took more and more of my hard cock inside her, drenching it with her wetness. </p><p>She closed her eyes as the pleasure started to intensify, like closing her eyes would allow her to reject the situation. Normally, I would have mocked her until she opened her eyes, but the sway of her tits as she quickened while she took even more of my shaft inside her was a good way of asking mercy wordlessly. </p><p>Her moans exploded louder and louder as my shaft continued to disappear, the pleasure reaching a high level, triggering my temptation as well. I finally let my hands move, grabbing her swaying tits — just to make she didn’t injure herself recklessly due to their extreme swaying, of course. </p><p>I was a nice boy. </p><p>As I squeezed her tits, the pain cut through the pleasure she was feeling, working as a reminder. Her beautiful emerald eyes popped open, looking down in shock, no doubt realizing just how far she let things escalate. </p><p>“I … I think that’s enough mana,” she muttered as she started moving, freeing my shaft of her presence. The only problem: it wasn’t the freedom that I wanted. Or she wanted, if her torturous slowness was any indicator. </p><p>I had no doubt that she would soon continue with her game even if she limited her actions slightly in the process. But I didn’t want to go through the same repeat again, not when things were just getting fun. </p><p>So, I cheated a bit. A simple Biomancy spell, weak enough to cost only a single point of mana — though it only affected her because the mana was already helpfully devoured by her, preventing her from resisting the spell — to make her leg twitch. </p><p>And just like that, her reluctant rise reversed, and reversed hard as she slid down, devouring the full length of my shaft as she slid down, her cry of pleasure worthy of a dragon. </p><p>Well, almost full length, I thought in amusement as I felt the head pressing against her absolute limit, not moving more, yet some of my shaft was still out. </p><p>After all, she might be a dragon, but in this form, she was still deliciously tiny… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 3942 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Pity that the forced pause worked too well to remind Naomi just how the situation escalated, making her pull back once again, this time dragging Carrie away with her. I was tempted to complain to Carrie — to tempt her for another visit rather than genuine annoyance, as our morning affairs were more than enough to compensate for the spectacular failure. </p><p>Still, even as she was being dragged away by Naomi, I had a smile on my face, because, while Naomi was paying for her purchases, Carrie managed to whisper a promise, that she would compensate my efforts tomorrow.</p><p>So, when I returned home, my plan was simple. Make a protein shake, kick back, and maybe even watch something other than game tapes before resting early. I even went far enough to order a small pizza as a cheat. </p><p>Not the most exciting plan for a Saturday evening, but considering the morning I had, it wasn’t exactly a huge sacrifice.</p><p>I was halfway into the movie when the doorbell rang, and when I walked there, I expected to meet with the delivery guy. So, instead, I met with Sarah, I felt surprised.</p><p>“May I come in?” Sarah said, yet walked in before even waiting for my answer. I let that slide, as considering everything she had done under my roof, she certainly earned the privilege to act rude. </p><p>But not without being mocked. “Of course you can, make yourself at home.” </p><p>Her angry gaze suggested that she didn’t appreciate my — admittedly weak — attempt of humor. Instead of saying anything, however, she grabbed the remote and shut off the TV before sitting down. </p><p>I had to admit, I was feeling curious, especially when combined with her clothing. She was wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants, both excessively large for her size, suggesting that she hadn’t picked them up just for comfort, but it was a deliberate attempt to look unattractive. </p><p>What was interesting, however, was the soft line of her panties that appeared momentarily as she sat down. It was barely noticeable, but I was a quarterback, and it was my job to see such small details. </p><p>And I was able to catch two very interesting details. Her panties were too small to be as boring as the rest of her clothing, and there was a distinct pattern on them, suggesting a lacy nature. </p><p>An interesting contrast with the rest of her clothing, making me very curious about what she wanted to talk about. </p><p>“So, what do I owe the pleasure?” I asked, a smirk on my lips. “Since you came here and interrupted my fun, would it be too wild to assume you want to replace the entertainment?” </p><p>“You wish,” she retorted, trying to sound angry. Unfortunately, the slight blush in her face worked wonders to destroy the intimidation value of her tone. She did her best to look intimidating, but after the night — and the morning — we had spent together, it was a difficult mood to achieve, and the brief competitive session where she had tried to match Carrie through naked selfies hardly helped. </p><p>“Oh, I certainly do,” I answered as I sat next to her, close enough to be inappropriate if that word had any meaning between us at this point. </p><p>“Jerk,” she murmured, her gaze dipping down momentarily. Then, she raised her gaze, doing her best to sound serious. “I wanted to talk to you about what happened last night. That was an accident, we can never do it again.” </p><p>“I see,” I murmured. “What about the stuff in the morning. Is that still viable?” </p><p>“O-of course not,” she managed to answer, but she was clearly shocked at my light reaction. “It was a moment of weakness, and we can never repeat that again. I don’t want to make Carrie sad.” </p><p>“Oh, I remember, you made your distaste in your messages very clear,” I said, acting as I had just remembered it. “Wait…” </p><p>“Shut up,” she growled, but that didn’t prevent her blush from spreading further, invading her beautiful, alabaster neck. Honestly, at this point, I would have been tempted to just agree and let her leave, as pushing aggressively after a mistake borne of passion was bad manners. </p><p>However, the flood of her beautiful selfies, each more revealing than the last as she somehow tried to win against her best friend, complicated the situation. It was clearly not something that happened at the heat of the moment, but a deliberate choice. </p><p>So, I decided to push her forward. “Okay, I’ll shut up, after one question,” I said with a shrug. “What kind of panties you are wearing under those sweatpants? Boring granny-style, or something sexy?” </p><p>“A … a boring one, of course,” she answered rapidly, her beautiful blush getting bigger. “How can you ask such a shameless question?” </p><p>I just smirked at her as I decided to ignore her second question for her sake. “Simple. It’s a bit weird that you decided to drop by my house in the middle of the night to have that talk, instead of waiting until Monday, or inviting me to a neutral space like a coffee shop. If you had sexy underwear underneath, I would be convinced that all of this would be a weird attempt to seduce me for a repeat. But since you’re not wearing anything sexy underneath, it’s clear that I’m misreading the situation.” </p><p>“R-right, I just want to talk,” she muttered. “We can’t do it again. We just can’t!” </p><p>“Sure, if that’s what you wish,” I said. </p><p>Her reaction was interesting. “What? Just like that?” </p><p>“Well, yes,” I said, doing my best to look confused even though I had understood the reason for her anger very much. It was an amusing reaction that I had seen in many girls. They loved to declare that the relationship was dead, and we needed to break up, but the moment their partner agreed with their suggestion without begging for a second chance, they got angry. </p><p>Of course, the thing between me and Sarah couldn’t be really defined as a relationship unless we used a very liberal definition of the word, but that didn’t change the emotion behind it. </p><p>Girls usually didn’t like the idea that they might be disposable. </p><p>I waited for her anger to grow for a moment before I spoke again. “Well, with one caveat, of course,” I added. </p><p>“What?” Sarah asked, still angry. </p><p>“I need to check your underwear, to see whether you told me the truth, of course,” I said, like what I was talking about was completely natural. </p><p>I couldn’t claim that I didn’t deserve her reaction, as my request was kind of ridiculous. “That’s unacceptable,” she gasped as she stood up, only for my hand to land around her wrist, preventing her from moving away.</p><p>“Why?” I said even as I pulled her on my lap. “Don’t tell me that after everything you had shown for me, you’re afraid of showing me your ugly panties.” </p><p>“T-that’s right,” she said. “They are too ugly.”  </p><p>\"Oh, sweetie,” I said even as I caressed her cheek. “Nothing you wear can be too ugly on your beautiful body.” </p><p>The unexpected compliment stole the winds from her sails, an opportunity I used perfectly to pull her on my lap again. “I still won’t reveal it,” she murmured. </p><p>“Whatever you wish, sweetheart. But if you don’t reveal it, I won’t believe you. Is this what you want?” I asked. </p><p>She said nothing, nor did I expect her to say anything. She had found herself locked in a trap. </p><p>Although, considering her actions earlier today, both at the breakfast and with the pictures, I doubted it was a trap she wanted to avoid in the first place. </p><p>She just needed some encouragement. </p><p>I said nothing as I put my hands on the small of her back, slowly trailing up and down, my touch soft. But her blush rose quickly, showing that despite the lightness, my touch had the intended effect. Still, she said nothing as I caressed her just over her shirt, giving her a layer of protection. </p><p>Her eyes widened when I slipped my hands under her loose shirt, however. “Hey—“ she gasped, only to be interrupted by a searing kiss of mine. My tongue slipped inside her immediately.</p><p>She didn’t react first, and even when her resistance arrived, it came in the form of a counter-attack from her tongue. On the surface, she was trying to push me out of her mouth, but her hands, landing on my neck, told me a different story. </p><p>A minute into the kiss, she let out no protest as I pulled her shirt off, returning to the kiss the moment her shirt was thrown to the side. I was curious what kind of bra I would find underneath, though I expected something black and lacy, presenting her tits perfectly while barely covering her nipples. </p><p>It was the exact thing a girl like Sarah, who thought herself to be edgy and harsh would pick to be sexy. </p><p>Unfortunately, I failed my mental challenge spectacularly, because it wasn’t the type of bra she was wearing. Though, it turned out that, guessing her bra type had been an impossible challenge in the first place. </p><p>Because, she wasn’t wearing one. </p><p>“I see where your confidence was coming from,” I said as I grabbed her breasts gently and started mauling, making her let out a beautiful mewling sound. “If you don’t wear any underwear, you win on a technicality, right?” </p><p>Of course, that was not entirely accurate based on the way I had created the challenge, nor it was the outcome I expected considering I had already seen the lines of her sexy panties, but still dazed after our beautiful kiss, Sarah wasn’t in a mood to confront me about such semantic inaccuracies.</p><p>Not when her attention was stolen by my fingers twisting and twirling her beautiful nipples, making her moan beautifully. “Should we check and measure your confidence,” I whispered. “Or would you like me to take your word on face value, and never bother you again?” </p><p>Her expression of confusion was beautiful, the pleasure ready to trigger everything. </p><p>Then, the doorbell rang again. “It must be the pizza,” I said. </p><p> “Why don’t you answer the door while I visit the bathroom?” she said rapidly as she jumped up to her feet and dashed toward the downstairs bathroom, not even bothering to pick her shirt as she run... </p><p>Creating a beautiful sight with her naked top, I decided as I stood up, cursing the pizza to arrive with such bad timing, only to swallow those thoughts when I opened the door. </p><p>And met with Naomi.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but laugh as Thad asked me for a ride. “I don’t know. I don’t deal with students too poor to even own a car,” I said. </p><p>It earned an even louder one from Thad. “Please have mercy, o great one,” said as he took the passenger seat, and we started driving. He stayed silent before speaking again, this time in a more measured, serious tone. “Keep it until the end of the semester,” he offered. </p><p>“That’s far too long,” I was quick to refute. I didn’t like to owe favors. Even with the fact that without my help Thad would have lost a car, borrowing one for a little while was my limit. “But I might keep it a couple of weeks, until I could get a new one.” </p><p>“Whatever you wish,” he answered, smart enough to realize it was a point I had no intention of changing my mind. Then, he smirked again, but this time, it was more of a hunter’s bloody grin than a cheerful one. “And keep the dashcam on, I would love to have the recording of Kevin or his buddies smashing my car if they get rowdy again.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said even as I shook my head. It was his car and his decision, even though the ability to sacrifice a car just to have leverage over a rival was not something I could comprehend easily with my limited financial resources. “Let me drop you to your home, then.” </p><p>“You’re very helpful,” Thad said, once again exploding in laughter. </p><p>Meanwhile, my invisible guide interjected. “You have such a helpful friend, how nice.” Then, she looked around the car happily as she settled on the backseat. “And this one looks even better than the old one.” </p><p>I ignored her in order not to seem like a crazy guy to Thad, and focused on following the route Thad had described. “So, how was the training today?” I asked. </p><p>“It was rough,” Thad answered. “With our match against our rival coming up, the coach is literally killing us, though, be warned. The real hell is tomorrow. We have a full night of film studies, and that’s the true torture. Coach Bill doesn’t let anyone who fails to memorize the whole playbook for the week.” </p><p>“Even a newbie like me,” I asked. </p><p>“Especially a newbie like you. Coach Bill doesn’t believe in coddling the newcomers, and he wants everyone to be ready for the match regardless of the likelihood of playing.” </p><p>“Sounds interesting,” I murmured. </p><p>“That’s not the word I would use,” Thad answered. “Pity you missed today’s practice. A physical one is certainly more entertaining than a glorified study session.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Unless football team decides to pay full scholarship for a fourth-string backup, or at least decide to guarantee my scholarship no matter what, I’m going to prioritize the program that’s keeping me in the school,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>“Fair,” he said. “So, have you had the chance to study our defensive schemes.” </p><p>“Not yet.” </p><p>“I recommend you to go through them, not unless you want to stay there until Tuesday morning,” Thad explained. “Though you need to go the stadium for the actual schemes we’re going to use for the match, as the coach doesn’t allow us to bring them outside, or allow us to bring any phones to the study room. He’s very strict about information leaks.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Sounds sensible. Luckily, I don’t have a busy day tomorrow, so I’ll definitely make sure to visit early and study.” </p><p>“And don’t forget to arrange a meeting with one of the conditioning coaches tomorrow if they didn’t get in contact with you yet,” Thad said. “Coach will definitely appreciate you being proactive.” </p><p>I nodded in appreciation. Thad wasn’t exactly sharing earth-shattering secrets with me, but that didn’t make them useless, not even close. </p><p>Thad was showing himself to be a surprisingly thoughtful teammate. </p><p>Our drive together took barely fifteen minutes. Apparently, Thad was living in a house near campus, a nice two-story with an impressive garden, fancy enough to be referred to as a little mansion, and an even more impressive garage. I could see two cars outside, both quite expensive, and the garage door was still closed, no doubt hiding even more expensive stuff. </p><p>Thad was even richer than I expected. A level that could clearly afford to give a car as a gift without blinking. </p><p>Too bad that my experiences growing up in the streets taught me that accepting favors from my ‘friends’, no matter how well-meaning they looked was a bad idea. </p><p>It never ended well. </p><p>“See you tomorrow,” Thad said as I dropped him off. </p><p>“Finally,” my guide said as she pointed toward our destination. “This way, go.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I answered even as started driving. Not full speed, of course, not even as fast as I could drive on this road. The later we arrived there, the better. Maybe whatever was happening would have already ended. </p><p>My guide was clearly unhappy with our performance. “Is this the fastest this carriage goes?” </p><p>“Unfortunately, yes,” I answered, quick to give her an excuse. “Any faster, and it’s against the rules. We might lose the car,” I explained. </p><p>“Really?” she said. “But why are the others are going faster if that’s the case?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, they have the luxury of paying the fines if the police notice them,” I explained. “I don’t have the money for it. So, unless you want to risk being delayed even further, you have to accept it.” </p><p>I had hoped that she would take that excuse, but unfortunately, not for the first time, my expectations were crushed by her. “It’s a risk we have to take, go faster,” she ordered, her tone once again gaining that scary quality that made my bones freeze. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said even as I sped up. </p><p>As I drove in relative silence, I finally had the opportunity to think about the sudden event. I had no idea why she was able to feel some kind of ceremony from such a great distance, but I had a feeling that it wasn’t anything good. </p><p>Not when the old Gods that relied on the system had disappeared into the stories and myths. </p><p>Maybe it was a glitch, I tried to convince myself. After all, it wasn’t like we would miss the existence of Greek Gods running around. Especially, in any account, they weren’t exactly subtle. But that didn’t change the fear I was feeling toward what was waiting for me at the end of our destination. </p><p>Luckily, driving slowly wasn’t the only way for me to delay. </p><p>“Which way?” I asked her several times, but only after picking a route that would push me closer to the city. It wasn’t exactly peak traffic hour, but even then, the city offered several ways to slow us down. </p><p>Especially with me picking the most crowded streets intentionally. </p><p>“Why are we not moving,” she asked in frustration as we got in the middle of a particularly packed stretch of road. </p><p>“There’s nothing we can do, there are too many cars on the road,” I said, doing my best to sound as frustrated as her despite my raging desire to smirk. </p><p>“Can’t we pick a different path?” she asked, but luckily, didn’t follow up when I stayed silent, her lack of knowledge and common sense working to my benefit for once. </p><p>Just like that, we stayed stuck in the traffic, delaying more and more. Luckily, unlike her angry face, her frustrated expression only underlined her cuteness — in an admirably sexy way considering she was still clad in a sexy leather corset — making the wait more fun than it would have been otherwise. </p><p>It took us two hours to even get out of the messy city traffic, though it expanded every little trick I could manage. “Finally,” she murmured once we got out of the gridlock and started driving once again. Though with her enthusiasm, I would have preferred to stay there for a long time. “Use the road at the right, I can still sense the ceremony,” she said happily. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked her, as the road she picked was not going through the safest part of the town.  </p><p>“Yes, now go,” she ordered, and since I lacked a useful reason to reject her offer, without getting too suspicious. I continued to drive, glad that Thad’s car didn’t look too expensive. It was a delight to drive, of course, but it didn’t look like a luxurious car from outside, meaning driving through a rough neighborhood wasn’t an immediate request to be gunned or robbed.</p><p>“Just a minute,” she said soon after, but this time, it wasn’t her words that caught my attention, but sirens, multiple types. And living in a bad neighborhood, I was a child when I learned how to recognize different sirens. </p><p>Here, I could hear all three big ones, firetrucks, police cars, and even ambulances. </p><p>They bypassed us quickly. </p><p>Unfortunately, they were driving in the same direction, and I had a feeling we didn’t just share a direction, but also a destination. I looked back to my guide, hoping to bargain with her about maybe delaying some more… </p><p>“Drive,” she ordered, once again scary. </p><p>I sighed as I started following the sirens. </p>",
