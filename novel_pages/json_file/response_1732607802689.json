Civilians are barred from entering the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Constructing the walls around the place was a herculean task. We needed strong walls and then fuinjutsu strengthening of those walls so that the beasts don’t break out and slaughter the people of the capital.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing we had discovered during these experiments was that the flesh of the chakra beasts was far more nutritious than normal beast’s flesh. In fact, even the milk of these animals was better, not to mention the quantity they produced was far better than normal animals.</p><p><br></p><p>The quality of wool from the mutated sheep was better too.</p><p><br></p><p>This made me change my plans slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>We began raising mutated cows, goats, pigs and sheep in large numbers. Raising and domesticating them from the start and in large numbers wasn’t something anyone had done before. Not to mention no one would think of them to be used for wars.</p><p><br></p><p>This way, I can create a new source of income for our country as well as create a stable and high quality supply of meat to feed my soldiers too.</p><p><br></p><p>Large scale production of mutated bears and more dangerous animals was still not possible and I had only a very limited number of them in my warehouse.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very long term project and would probably require a few years to complete. My own version of ‘Forest of Death’, both as a place for trials and raising chakra beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>But looking at the amount of work needed for constructions, I was planning to teach the students Earth Style Jutsu, to construct walls.</p><p><br>After all, not everyone has wood style like Hashirama and can magically prop up a village out of nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe someday, I will get to that level too.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still growing in strength right now, even without rituals. It’s better to gain some skills rather than just be all brute strength. After all, as I was right now, all it would take was a well aimed kunai to the eye to take me down.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to say I was weak.</p><p><br></p><p>I had mastered the Water Breathing Style, Advanced level Fuinjutsu and could open up to five gates.</p><p><br></p><p>Even without much knowledge of ninjutsu, I was still at a jōnin level of strength, maybe even elite jōnin if I went all out.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I lacked their experience, something I have been working hard to gain in the last few months.</p><p><br></p><p>Seraphim has been coaching me on how to fight against ninjas.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t just all spars but more basic things like avoiding attacks, dodging kunai and traps, fighting multiple enemies at a time as well as having better awareness of my surroundings. While these may seem basic, these things were the difference between life and death in a real battle.</p><p><br></p><p>After that came spars and the most challenging spars were with Toji and Kuroka, none of which I ever won.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them were stronger than me physically as well as incredibly tricky.</p><p><br></p><p>Spars with Kuina were relatively straight forward although that girl just keeps pushing herself more and more each day and every time she recovers, she seems stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if she had some kind of zenkai… she didn’t. I checked. It was just the ridiculous One Piece physique.</p><p><br></p><p>With the dedicated training and proper healing from Rose, her talents were coming out.</p><p><br></p><p>She had learned to open her fifth gate too and was now on par with me with her swordsmanship alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina was a bonafide genius in swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no doubt about it.</p><p><br></p><p>She even managed to incorporate the breathing styles and Saitō’s swordsmanship on her own and was still progressing even without anyone’s help. But I noticed that her speed was slowing down.</p><p><br></p><p>Before long, I would need to find a good teacher for her to help her with her swordsmanship skills.</p><p><br></p><p>The level of swordsmanship in her world is just at a whole other level compared to this world. Even the best swordsman in this world would not be anything in that world. That also meant that I couldn’t find a good teacher for her either.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe someone from her world would be the best as they would also be able to teach her Haki. I had some plans, but to summon anyone decent from her world, I would need at least a kage or above level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>We still had some time for that but right now I had to concentrate on the things at hand.</p><p><br></p><p>I had other matters to attend to right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Three big things were coming up and I needed to prepare for those. First was my marriage to Kasumi, which was just three weeks away.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, we were close enough to not feel awkward about the marriage. In fact, I would actually go to war with the Stairs Daimyo if they tried to pull back now.</p><p><br></p><p>The second was the deal with the Uzumaki village and the upcoming attack on Uzushiogakure. Just yesterday my search on the Uzukage was completed and I found out what she was planning. Thankfully, it wasn’t anything bad. In fact, I was actually looking forward to her visit.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to make a deal with her for the location of the demons sealed in this world by the Uzumaki or other people, maybe get their help too to get them for the Soul Ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was discovering, my soul’s strength was very essential in unlocking more of the Grimoire’s powers.</p><p><br></p><p>With the last two summons, I felt like I was nearing the limits to the number of summons whom I could keep with me. One or two more would be my limit as I am now.</p><p><br></p><p>As for how many I needed? That depended on several factors.</p><p><br></p><p>The summoned people were the fastest way to increase the overall power of my forces. While the training of my soldiers was going better than I had expected, it was going to take a lot of time so I had to make the most of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The third and last was the world travel.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning to go on a <em>‘business tour’</em> after the marriage. I had already discussed everything with Kasumi and she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>This move will also allow us to push back the date of the merger by a few months. We were already planning to push it till the end of the war to avoid being caught in between but this just gave us one more reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the merger happens, things will start changing and I wanted to be at least Kage level by then to face the challenges that will come right after.</p><p><br></p><p>The first world travel can change a lot of things and I intend to take full advantage of it.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was finishing, Sera appeared behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sera, what can I do for you?” I asked, without turning back, continuing to feed the mutated chakra beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Princess Kasumi has sent a message. She said that the egg you left in her care is shaking.” She reported.</p><p><br></p><p>This made me pause.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has it already started shaking?” I asked, surprised. “Alright, let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>I accompanied her towards the warehouse where Kasumi was currently staying due to her training.</p><p><br></p><p>I had given her the Ralts egg to care for and now that same egg was shaking, meaning it was about to hatch.</p><p><br></p><p>While on our way, I tried to make some small talk with Sera. “So, how’s life, Sera?” I asked, trying to think of anything I could talk to her about but failing.</p><p><br></p><p>She just looked at me with her same bland look. “Are you sick?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“No. A bit hurt by your reply but definitely not sick.” I put a hand on my chest and acted in mock pain.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, what’s up with you?” She asked, seriously once more, making me sigh lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just trying to make some jokes and small talk, you know. We don’t really talk much despite you being with us for months. I thought I could get to know you better.” I said, not making any excuses.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you trying to bed me too?” She asked, making my eyes twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this girl was always straight as an arrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everyday, three times a day after breakfast, lunch and dinner.” I replied with a smile. “Everytime I eat something sweet, I can’t help but think of you and your sweet voice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t do that, it’s disgusting.” She scrunched her nose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, really? I thought that line was cool. Took me a whole week to think.” I shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that what you do? Think of lines to bed girls?” She asked, nonplussed.</p><p><br></p><p>“As much as I would like to do that, there are too many people who depend on me. I can’t afford to take so much time for myself. Your thoughts just happened to have caught me in my free time.” I smiled. “So, how about we get to know each other better? Tell me what you think of this world. Is it any different from your previous one?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I was even doing this much is because she has chilled down a lot in the last month and now we were spending more time due to her helping me in my training. Knowing her more, I could see that she wasn’t rude for the sake of being rude.</p><p><br></p><p>It was more like her default state. She was just awkward with such things because she has never actually spent time like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Back in her world, things were still like in the Sengoku Period, at least for the vampire ninjas. They were trained to the bone from a very early age, leaving no time for a normal life… and very few people came out normal from such a childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>Sera’s case was similar. She was improving though.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s… alright.” She spoke after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her hesitation. It was already better than before when she would have made some rude and sarcastic comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Glad that you are enjoying your time here.”</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the room Kasumi was staying in and entered the room to find her standing near the egg.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya-sama!” Kasumi was the first to speak. “The egg started moving suddenly today. I didn’t know what to do.” She said looking worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing to worry about. It’s probably going to hatch. Let me have a look.” I went ahead and summoned my grimoire and stored it inside for a moment, reading the information. Sure enough it was going to hatch in around an hour.</p><p><br></p><p>After checking everything, I took it out and kept it on a cushion in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s going to hatch in an hour. The egg is in perfect condition so no need to worry. In fact, we can wait for an hour for it to hatch. Meanwhile, why don’t we prepare something for the baby Ralts to eat after hatching. Actually, I haven’t eaten anything all morning either.” I said remembering.</p><p><br></p><p>My diet had increased a lot, perhaps due to the increased energy requirements of my body. I now ate almost five times more than what I used to eat just two years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand how Naruto could eat all that Ramen and not get full.</p><p><br></p><p>We waited and had something to eat and sure enough, around an hour later, the egg flashed white and cracked, revealing a tiny figure inside.</p><p><br></p><p>It had pinkish eyes peeking out from under its green bowl cut hair. A layer of its skin seemed to flow around its body like a white dress of some sort giving it a very graceful feeling and finally there were two small red horns at the front and back of its head</p><p><br></p><p>“Ralts!” The adorable pokemon tilted her head as she looked at us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cute.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whisper was very soft but I was pretty sure I heard Sera say that and looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed my smile and her face went back to her usual frown.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and slowly picked up the baby Ralts.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s adorable.” Kasumi said too.</p><p><br></p><p>“She… this one is a female.” I said. The Grimoire had told me that. “She is a Ralts. They can feel the emotions of other people and only approach those they feel good emotions from. So, don’t be angry or afraid around her. Apart from that, they are very loyal to those they consider their master, going as far as laying down their lives for them. When they grow fully, they can become incredibly powerful too.” I rubbed her cheeks and looked at her trying to hold my fingers with her tiny hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Should we feed her?” Kasumi asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Get the milk.”</p><p><br></p><p>We had already prepared milk bottles for her.</p><p><br></p><p>I offered the Ralts to Kasumi so that she could feed her. She had taken care of the egg the whole time so it’s only natural that she gets the chance to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, with a Ralts around, she can also be protected more. She wasn’t much of a fighter and Ralts would be perfect to protect her or just teleport her out of a dangerous situation. This one already knew the Teleport move.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Sera looked at the pokemon curiously, surprising since she didn’t show interest in many things.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need a name for her. Would you like to suggest something, Sera?” I asked, taking the girl by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want me to name her?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We would love for you to name her.” Kasumi chimed in too. She knew Sera’s condition and they got along quite well in fact, I have never seen Sera act even remotely rudely towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eucliwood Hellscythe.” She said after some thought. “It’s the name of the creator of the Vampire Ninjas. She is a very strong person. Give her this name so that she may grow as strong as her one day.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>That name….</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Euclidwood it is then.”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave them the complete set of instructions on what to feed and how to take care of the Ralts. She needed to grow a bit before we could start training her.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I waited in the same place where I had met the Uzukage last time.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro had informed me that the Uzukage had asked for a meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already read the information about her and knew what she was planning so it wasn’t a big surprise for me.</p><p><br></p><p>With me were Kanae, Kuina and Saitō while Kuroka was hiding some distance away,  while Toji was hiding on a distant mountain, sniper rifle pointed this way in case something bad happened.</p><p><br></p><p>While I knew that the Uzukage was here with genuinely good intentions, we never knew what might happen in a negotiation.</p><p><br></p><p>Around fifteen minutes later, I sensed three chakra signatures approaching us and looked in the direction. Unlike the last time she was hiding her chakra and I could only identify because I knew her from the last time.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra suppression techniques can be really scary. The one I used could completely erase my chakra signature and presence. It was actually something invented and used by the second Tsuchikage, Mu, something which earned him his name, meaning nothing. It was extremely hard to learn though and I was only able to get started with it because the basic version was imprinted in my mind by the Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>Toji was doing his best to learn it and I’ll be honest. That thought scares even me.</p><p><br></p><p>He is already extremely hard to catch. With this, he will be impossible to find for anyone except the likes of Kuroka.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough the three people appeared in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro, Rina and Mina approached them and bowed to them while I just nodded politely at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the Land of Flowers, Uzukage-sama.” I greeted her. “Please come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Prince Katsuyoshi.” She nodded before turning towards the man beside her. “This is my husband, the Daimyo of the Land of Whirlpool, Genzo Uzumaki.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Daimyo?</p><p><br></p><p>This guy?</p><p><br></p><p>While surprised, I didn’t let it show on my face. \"Welcome to the Land of Flowers. We apologise for not recognising you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t mind it. We haven’t met before and it would be surprising if you recognised us in one glance.”</p><p><br></p><p>We went inside the room prepared beforehand.</p><p><br></p><p>I was the one who initiated the conversation this time. “Congratulations on finding the new continent, Uzukage-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a small twitch on the corner of her lips but she controlled it immediately and bowed. “Thank you. The Land of Whirlpool and the Uzumaki Clan will forever be grateful to you because of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t do this. We did what any decent person would do for their allies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. That’s not true. Not even close allies always come to help.” The Daimyo spoke, his face showing helplessness.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised a questioning eyebrow and the man explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mito Uzumaki passed away two days ago.” He dropped a bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… unfortunate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. She was a very kind person.” He agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are coming here directly from Konoha?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. As you already know, we are being monitored so both of us leaving at the same time was not easy. Last time Shiroyasha came to visit you, I covered for her using Clones. No one except the ones present here even knew about her visit.”</p><p><br></p><p>Damn…</p><p><br></p><p>“This time however, we had an opportunity and decided to make the most of it and visited here.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded, not knowing what to say to such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Konoha?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s best for us to not expect anything from them. They are facing attacks from all four sides right now, Suna having suddenly joined the fray. Their forces are spread thin. Not that we had much expectations from the beginning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were able to talk to Mito-sama and she actually sensed our hesitation and warned us that things are going to change after she passes away. This war has been very hard on the Senju Clan. Even her grandson passed away a while ago.” The Daimyo sighed and shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was bound to happen.” I shook my head, making them look at me with questioning looks. “The Senju Clan were too strong. It made people afraid… both outside and inside. It was inevitable that they wouldn’t want another Hashirama or Tobirama Senju to rise from somewhere and decide to nip the problem completely.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You think someone from the inside was responsible for this too?” He asked, frowning.</p><p><br></p><p>“The first two Hokages were from the Senju Clan while the third one was given the seat just due to a word from Tobirama Senju and the support of the Senju Clan otherwise do you think with just the power of the Sarutobi Clan and Hiruzen Sarutoji’s strength back then, he would be able to become Hokage so easily?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>In my previous life, perhaps all this might have seemed to be conspiracy theories but in this life, after witnessing everything around me, it seemed the most likely case.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t believe us, then tell us how many people from the Sarutobi Clan died in this war? Were they stronger than the Senju or the Uchiha?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man frowned but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not only that, I think outside forces, even the Daimyo of the Fire nation had a hand in all this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?” This took the man by surprise. It was understandable. Why would the Daimyo, at least the one from Fire Nation, do something like that?</p><p><br></p><p>“Fear is a great motivator. Isn’t that why you all are in such a condition right now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That doesn’t make sense. The Senju have always been loyal to the Daimyo, not to mention their biggest supporter. Losing them would mean losing a large chunk of power.” The Uzukage denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm true. But here’s something you need to understand. There’s a difference between the strong and the monsters. You can fight the former but the latter makes you lose the will to fight. Hashirama Senju was someone who caught all the Tailed Beasts. Even Madara Uchiha with the Kyubi couldn't defeat him. That kind of power… it makes people apprehensive. It made even other kage shiver in their boots so can you imagine what it would do to those powerless and cowardly Daimyo?” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hashirama would never…”</p><p><br></p><p>“But what of his descendants? What if someone else became similarly powerful and didn’t have similar thoughts? What if they wanted to change the rule of the Daimyo? What if they decided to conquer the entire continent? Konoha had two such clans and a coward at the helm of the Fire Nation. He obviously cannot allow them to exist. The Uchiha were already cornered by Tobirama which left only the Senju. It was obvious they had to go. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a deal between the five Daimyo combined?”</p><p><br></p><p>My words made them go quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thankfully, it seems that Tobirama Senju was indeed a wise man and had prepared for this too.” I added catching them by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Tobirama knew the Senju Clan were going to be targeted heavily till they went extinct and prepared for the eventualities. He, during his term as a Hokage, actually orchestrated fake deaths of several members of the Senju Clan, spreading them across the elemental nations, both as spies of the Senju Clan… and a way to continue the continued bloodline of the Senju… under other names. The fact that no one knew of this already tells us how much he trusted the other people under him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you serious?” the Uzukage asked, seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh very. In fact, we even know the descendants of one of these people. That’s how we found out about the whole scheme. Truly, one can never be too careful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We apologise for not being able to tell you the identity of the person without their permission but the person is the grandchild of Tōka Senju if you wish to know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tōka-sama’s grandchild!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you know Tōka Senju?” I asked, surprised by her reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Who doesn’t? She was one of Hashirama Senju’s closest aides. In fact, she was married to one of our Uzumaki Clan members too, an uncle of mine.The person was actually Genshiro’s elder brother. He had gone to Konoha as Mito-sama’s aide.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this took me by surprise. Even Genshiro was looking stunned at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“We had heard that Yuka Senju, her daughter, passed away on a mission.” Genshiro said, looking genuinely sad.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is indeed a small world. As for Yuka Senju, no, she didn’t die but rather went undercover where she got involved with a guy and had a child. She was suffering from an illness and passed away shortly afterwards.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Could you please tell us the identity of the person, Your Highness?” He asked, expectantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Again, we apologise. We would need to ask the person in question first but we promise to inform you as soon as we get the permission.” I assured him.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to check his information first and then ask Kasumi if she wants to meet him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“At least, we got to hear one good news today.” The Whirlpool Daimyo smiled. “And we have to thank you for this again.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad we didn’t have the foresight of Tobirama Senju to prepare for all this beforehand.” The Uzukage sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s do what we can do now.” Genzo put a hand assuringly on her shoulder, making her nod.</p><p><br></p><p>They had a good chemistry.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see how they ruled the Land of Whirlpools like this.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, will the Uzumaki be moving?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The lives of our people matter more to us than a piece of land. Although some of the old ones want to stay back. Those stubborn fools.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are really serious about it?” Genshiro asked and the Uzukage nodded in response.</p><p><br></p><p>“They plan to stay back to cover for us till the last moment.” She explained the decision of the old ones in the Uzushiogakure village.</p><p><br></p><p>“For them it’s taking their home from them… although we believe that without a family inside, four walls only make a house, not a home. A real home is where our loved ones live.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How do you explain that to those people? They want to put up a last stand against the attackers. I have tried everything to convince them but they have already made up their minds. One thing you should understand about Uzumaki is that once we make up our mind, it’s nigh impossible to change it.” The Whirlpool Daimyo said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s let them do what they want. The purpose of our visit here today is to keep our side of the bargain.” The Uzukage said, bringing up the topic of business.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them looked at me. “The information given by you was verified. The continent is indeed habitable. The residents of that place don’t even know about chakra so we can probably establish ourselves there without much danger too. It’s the best place we could have asked for. Since that’s the case, we have come here to complete our side of the bargain too. We will be sending three Seal Masters from our Clan to stay here and teach you and your people, all our knowledge as a sign of our alliance and gratitude.”</p><p><br></p><p>Wait, they didn’t know about chakra?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know that.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I didn’t know anything about that continent except the location.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should send people there and see if I can discover some resources too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I bowed, not rejecting their offer this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Secondly, I propose a marriage between Rina and Mina with you to solidify the alliance between the Land of Flowers and the Uzumaki Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, both of them?!”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman just shrugged. “I asked them and it was their suggestion. Ask them if you want to know the reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the two and it was Rina who spoke. “We have lived with each other our entire lives and shared everything. We do not wish to get separated. I apologise for asking this of Your Highness. If you don’t like this, we will accept your decision.”</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to find some words but nothing came to my mind.</p><p><br>“Oh come on. It’s not like you don’t have more than one girl in your life already.” The Uzukage rolled her eyes. “Be a man.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her husband just coughed at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… are you both sure you want this?” I asked the two girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This is something we had decided a long time ago.” Rina said. “We either marry one person or not marry at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at Kanae who was also surprised at their words and looked at me but nodded when our eyes met.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I accept.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Now, on to another topic. We were hoping you could assist us with something.” The Whirlpool Daimyo said.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still distracted by the whole twin thing and brought out a scroll from my pocket. “Here are enough supplies for three thousand people for three months.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked at me in surprise but I pretended like it was nothing. I had a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… well, isn’t this what you wanted?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes but… how did you know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...we have our sources.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>The man took the hint and didn’t say anything but kept the scroll. “Thank you. I will send the payment for this soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to. This is just some help from us. Instead, we were hoping to exchange some information if you could help us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Information? Sure, anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have heard that the Uzumaki Clan knows about the location of many sealed beings, like Demons and strong beasts throughout the continent. We wish to know about any such being, even rumours are fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you perhaps… planning to use them as weapons?” The Uzukage asked. “While Jinchuriki are not rare, those creatures are not like tailed beasts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We know. We do not plan on making any jinchuriki. We are planning on using them to power the barriers around the cities. As for them being dangerous, we have methods of completely destroying them if push comes to shove so you don’t need to worry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Using them as chakra sources to power barriers? You can always use people to power the barrier, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have our reasons. Still, if you are worried about us making Jinchuriki, you can rest assured. That’s the last thing we would ever do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, are you not attracted by their power? In fact, if we had made the deal with Hashirama back in the day and possessed a Jinchuriki of our own, perhaps other nations would have thought twice before attacking us.” The Uzukage said.</p><p><br></p><p>“We do <em>not</em> wish to make any jinchuriki.” I stopped her words in between. “In fact, while we respect Hashirama Senju, what he did with the Tailed Beasts… was disgusting. To use them as bargaining chips, selling them… for anyone else, it would have been different but not him or Madara.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>My words caught them off guard too so I decided to give them some insight about this world. Who knows what the Black Zetsu might pull. It’s never bad to have some more people in on this, especially people who are so adept in the art of fuinjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought long and hard about this and the Uzumaki Clan were an essential part of my plans. Here goes nothing…</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me Uzukage-sama, what do you know of the history of the Uzumaki Clan?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? Are you asking me what I know of <em>my</em> clan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. What do you know about the history, the beginning of the Uzumaki Clan?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our Uzumaki Clan began as a branch of the Senju Clan around three hundred and eighty years ago when they settled in the Land of Whirlpool to concentrate on our Fuinjutsu rather than fight continuous wars like the Senju. From there, we made our own name based on the whirlpools surrounding our village and came to be known as the Uzumaki Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about before that? Do you know about the beginning of the Senju Clan?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head and I spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Senju Clan was formed by a man called Asura Otsutsuki. He lived with his father and elder brother where he was taught about chakra and ninshu. He was quite dull compared to his brother who was a veritable genius. His elder brother was the one who created the twelve hindsigns to more easily manipulate chakra, giving birth to Ninjutsu.” I revealed to their utter surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Later on, his father sent both of them out on a test to determine his successor but ultimately chose his younger son because the older one didn’t consider other people and always relied on his own strength to solve all problems, always preferring to walk alone while the younger always took others together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As a good leader should.” The Whirlpool Daimyo said and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Unfortunately this would lead the two brothers to war… several times after their father passed away. That war had continued till the formation of the Konoha village. Can you guess who the descendants of the elder brother were?”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw their faces go pale. “Uchiha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. As a reward, we will let you know who their father was. His name was Hagoromo Otsutsuki but the whole world knows of him as The Sage of Six Paths.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“The elder brother inherited the eyes of the sage while the younger inherited his body and chakra. That’s why the Senju have such insanely strong bodies while the Uchiha have the Sharingan. It’s funny right. The whole world calls them Jutsu thieves and yet the whole world copied Indra to even know how to use ninjutsu?”</p><p><br>I laughed at it. Such an irony.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, the war between the brothers didn’t end there. Their chakra repeatedly incarnates in their descendants, continuing the war. The most prominent figures among the two clans are more often the incarnations of the two brothers, the last ones being… well you can take a guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let them understand the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, the reason why we are so mad is because Hashirama, that fool, actually subdued the Tailed Beasts, nine beings created by the Sage of Six Paths himself and sold them as cheap goods. The Sage called them his children. In a way, they would be siblings and he, that dumb moron, sold them like cattle.”</p><p><br></p><p>The look of shock was evident on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>“How… how do you even know all this? How should we even…”</p><p><br></p><p>“While We do not claim to be all knowing, there are many things about this world that We know. We can understand if you don’t believe us. You can talk to any tailed beast. All of them are intelligent creatures. They were originally the part of a completely different beast, called the Ten Tails, something which had almost caused the destruction of all life on this world. It was defeated by the Sage and his brother and sealed inside his body, making him the first Jinchuriki. Later on, he divided its chakra into nine pieces and thus the nine tailed beasts were born. Each of them has a name. If you talk to them, just use the Sage’s name and they will at least listen to you. So, if you ever have a chance, help those poor fellows out. They are not inherently bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the people in the room were quiet at this point and the Whirlpool Daimyo broke the silence after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have given us some life changing information. We require some time to think about it. It’s too much for us to take. It just sounds too unbelievable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We understand. It is outlandish. We were just hoping that if you encounter any of the nine, you will at least try to understand and talk to them. Just imagine the Kyubi’s case. One moment it was sleeping in some cave and saw a crazy Madara’s Sharingan and the next moment, it woke up, being sealed by Hashirama… how is that fair? Just recall what you did to that guy two days ago, nailed to a floating piece of rock. Any hate it might have is completely justified.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How do you know about the Seal.” The Uzukage asked, stunned and wary.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s where things become tricky.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have visions. Of things, of futures. We cannot completely control the line of these visions. It is through this that we were able to find a way for the Uzumaki Clan and it is through this that we have been able to find this…”</p><p><br></p><p>“That… makes sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>Huh…</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t look surprised. There are other people in this world with abilities similar to yours. For example, the Priestess of the Land of Demons has the power to glimpse into the future. Although her powers are not as potent as yours. Their warnings are taken very seriously even by the five Great Ninja Villages and their Lands are completely off limits.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you not wary of us?” I asked, curious.</p><p><br></p><p>“It would be foolish.” She replied. “After all, you came to our aid, put so much trust in us. We Uzumaki are not so ungrateful that we cannot return the same favour to you. What you do with the information is your own affairs. Either way, we will not be on this continent for long. Although there is one thing I don’t understand… why? Why did you tell us all this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for putting your trust in us. The reason we have told you all this is because of another vision we had… the visions of a one eyed beast with ten tails rampaging across the world…” I finished making them widen their eyes in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I told them about my plan… a plan that would fuck up all of Zetsu’s plans in the ass without lube and even make the violence in the Elemental Nations go down.</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few more things and they left the Land of Flowers promising to send the other three people they had promised.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzukage also gave me the information about some places where demons were sealed and promised to send the rest of the information soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving she gave Genshiro permission to teach us everything he knew about Fuinjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that went well… I guess.” I spoke, starting the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure about giving them all that information, boss?” Saitō asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pretty sure. The main enemy we might face is extremely vulnerable to Fuinjutsu and Taijutsu. This way, if they can take away even one of two tailed beasts… it would mean one or two kage level enemy less for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Almost half of the total kage level of the Five Great Ninja villages are Jinchuriki.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, while good, have no effect on the real top levels of this world. It’s one of the reasons why I am not training our people in those arts primarily. They still need to learn how to overcome those, however learning the actual art needs to be put off till the third year. Ninjutsu is just too useful to not learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. Just teaching them a simple Earth Wall technique can help us a lot in creating walls, setting traps and temporary fortification, even making roads. We can even make a hideout within the mountains and underground with that. It would be foolish to not utilise these skills.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, has anyone made any progress with the Rasengan technique I told you all about?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the only attack type ninjutsu I had given them.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, anyone who has watched Naruto must know how it is done.</p><p><br></p><p>The technique is obviously hard to learn. It was called an A Ranked Technique for a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>I had managed to master it due to my extensive chakra control exercises and the rituals. Now I was practising the technique to be able to use it instantly in a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Minato could instantly make a Rasengan and attack. I needed that kind of speed to fully utilise the technique.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. I completed the second phase. Just need to do the last phase now.” Toji said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Same.” Saitō added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not interested.” Kuina didn’t have any interest in anything that was not swordsmanship. “I am more interested in the elemental chakra flow technique though.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, with her insane physique, her chakra reserves were increasing day by day and yet she never tried to learn any special techniques except those assisting her in her swordsmanship. Then again, perhaps that one track mind is what makes her that good in what she does?</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae was working on the breathing technique and didn’t have time for anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>Sera was also more interested in chakra flow and swordsmanship techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>This was especially so after we discovered the fact that using Water attribute chakra enhances the power of Water Breathing greatly.</p><p><br></p><p>The original Breathing Styles were named after the elements because they were based on how the elements behaved and didn’t exactly manipulate the elements itself.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world however, for training the elemental affinity, one must manipulate normal chakra in a way the element behaves too, quite similarly to the Breathing Styles.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why when we tried using Water Breathing with Water Style Chakra Flow, the results were unbelievable.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack power increased by a lot. The water attribute chakra even extended from the blade like a whip at times and cut at a distance. A skilled user could control the length and shape of these water whips to increase or decrease the distance at which they cut the enemy. The swordsmanship had in turn started to look exactly as it did in the anime from my memories with actual water being used instead of just special effects.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to this, Water Attribute Chakra training and Chakra Flow techniques were added to the third year curriculum for the Samurai. Obviously this meant that no one was there yet as it was just their second year but this also allowed us time to master those techniques ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, after this I was actually planning to go to Kanae’s world as quickly as I could and hire masters of other breathing styles as well or at least get the methods of training in them. At least the five elemental methods.</p><p><br></p><p>My plan for the world jump is being delayed due to one thing or another and in this time, my Grimoire hasn’t stopped gathering energy. I estimate that by the time I come out from the first jump, I could gather enough energy for the second one too.</p><p><br></p><p>Just imagining the Lightning Breathing Style with Lightning Style Chakra Armour… yes. That would be extremely powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a good exercise for chakra control. I have completed it.” Surprisingly, it was Rose who had completed the Rasengan.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have already completed it?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her hand and concentrated for a bit and sure enough a ball of chakra formed on her hand. She kept it there for a few seconds before dispersing it.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a good way to train Shape Manipulation and as a Medic I need to train myself in Chakra Control.” She explained with a shrug.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how is your own training coming along?” I asked. She was trying to figure out most of the Medical Ninjutsu by herself from the notes I had given her, an extremely herculean task.</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked the Uzukage to help us get someone who can help us out and she said she will see what she can do.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Rose was extremely dedicated.</p><p><br></p><p>She trained the students during the day and then studied all throughout the night, continuously pushing herself to get better.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for this reason that her chakra was growing at an insane pace. She was already ridiculously strong physically, giving her much higher than average reserves and on top of that she trained herself on the verge of exhaustion only to heal herself and get right back at work. This was increasing her chakra reserves rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, she has chakra reserves similar to my own and great control too.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s slower than I would have liked but I think I am getting the hang of basic Mystic Palm Technique. A few more months and I will get it along with a few other techniques down perfectly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, take your time. We won’t have students ready to learn the technique for at least another year. Till then, you could reach a high enough level with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, Kuroka. I have a mission for you.” I addressed the newest member of our team.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want you to steal a few things.” I brought out a scroll from my  sleeves and passed it to her. “I think you are the best person for the job.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the paper and then at me. “All these?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Just be careful and it won’t be that hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay nyaa. I think I can get it done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As for our next immediate mission. It will be to investigate the demons whose information I have received from the Uzukage.” If we can complete the next ritual, my soul power will be enhanced by leaps and bounds and I might have more control on the Grimoire too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to focus on that first, boss? You are getting married in three weeks. The Daimyo has already started sending invitations and the city is already being prepared. The first wedding of the only Prince. Everyone is so excited.” Toji asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am actually worried, Toji. Worried about the number of spies who might come here or who have already come here. While most of our dangerous experiments are hidden away under the covers of normal research, I am still worried. We need to be at our highest alert at the time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave the security to us, boss.” Saitō assured me.</p><p><br></p><p>“The main problem will not be them but rather our allies. Kumo will also send people to greet us. Don’t let them catch a hint of anything awry. Always hide your chakra and keep it at a chunin level at best. Also Kuroka, remember to be back in fifteen days at best. I need you here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki trio have been living under disguise the entire time they were here, for the last six months or so and I had already told them to hide in one of the hideouts in the Land of Flowers during this time. Even Shirone was said to remain out of sight.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want them to be anywhere near the capital during this event.</p><p><br></p><p>After discussing several more security arrangements, we left for our own work.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Mhh, this is good. You are an amazing cook, Kasumi-chan.” I said making her light up despite the position she was in.</p><p><br></p><p>Kasumi was in my lap, facing me, both her legs on either side of my waist, her crotch directly over mine. Her kimono had risen up due to the position, revealing her milky white legs.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slid on her legs, slowly reaching her thighs.</p><p><br></p><p>She was blushing up a storm but didn’t stop her job of feeding me.</p><p><br></p><p>Training had been working wonders on her. Her body has become fuller due to the physical exercise and nutrition.</p><p><br></p><p>I was even planning on enhancing her bloodline further. It’s just that the ritual I had was only designed for me. As for how to enhance her bloodline without a ritual, I had a plan, but it will take time.</p><p><br></p><p>Even then, the raw materials needed for the ritual would be hard to get.</p><p><br></p><p>She finished feeding me and kept the plate on the table beside us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Was that all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I will go and get some more.” She was about to get up but I stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was talking about dessert.” With that, I pulled her in for a kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>We have been doing this regularly now and she was getting more comfortable, even responding to my tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slipped into her kimono and grabbed her ass, playing with the doughy flesh as she moaned into my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>Girls didn’t exactly wear underwear under their kimono traditionally. It was something introduced later. Good for me, it still hadn’t caught up in this world yet.</p><p><br></p><p>This meant I could feel her skin on the palm of my hands. It just went to show how comfortable she was with me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hard as iron and the rubbing was only making me harder.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to take it a step further, slowly pushing her down on the cushions behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the scene in front of me, her silky black hair spread on the cushions, slightly moist pleasure filled half open eyes, looking at me and finally her wet red lips with her tongue just visible.</p><p><br></p><p>Without waiting for a moment, I dove in to enjoy my dessert.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________ </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ruling by the Book'.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are progressing.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kazuya has taken the Uzumaki in confidence for his grand plan… As for what that plan is, that’s a secret.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see the effect of the butterflies in the next few chapters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Isekai Restaurant</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 18: Interlude 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I sat in the bath, eyes closed as I tried to calm my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>We had returned back to the Restaurant and Rimuru took Milim back to Tempest while Tohru took Lucoa back.</p><p><br></p><p>The lectures would come later. Although, a part of me didn’t blame them for anything they did.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna and Naruto had already been taken back home by Miu so it was only the elders who had been left behind at the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained everything to the Ryozanpaku masters and as expected they were pissed at the situation too.</p><p><br></p><p>While they were not the violent sort, they didn’t shy away from violence when it was forced on them.</p><p><br></p><p>I promised them that I would set a rule in the Restaurant to prevent anything like this happening ever again.</p><p><br></p><p>The scenes from the battle flashed in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim’s power…</p><p><br></p><p>It was unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew how strong I was after becoming an Archdaemon but I was pretty sure I would have been erased by that attack so bad that not even my soul would have survived it.</p><p><br></p><p>The realisation was frightening… as well as sobering. The multiverse was dangerous… very dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>“Man… running a Restaurant wasn’t supposed to be this stressful.” I sighed, rubbing my head.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of this, the door to the bath opened. I heard a familiar voice before I could turn around.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sil-kun. I didn’t know you were here.”  Lavy came, already undressed with a towel in her hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy. When did you return?” I asked, not surprised at her nonchalance. By now, all of us knew what Lavy was like. “Did the rest come back too?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just now. No. Shuna-chan and Sakura-chan went to do some shopping. I decided to take a bath before they return.” She finished as she took a shower before coming and standing beside the bathtub.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood what she wanted and moved back slightly to make space for her and she stepped between my legs, resting her back on my chest with natural ease.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was your day?” She asked, finally settled in my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was… hah… exhausting.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Were there too many customers today?” She asked, confused at my answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“No… it was…” Then I went on to explain everything to her. “They… called him a sacrifice… a human sacrifice… How can someone say that to a kid? How can they even think of using a kid like a weapon… how can people be so selfish… that’s… disgusting.” I spat out before realising that the water in the bath was shaking due to my demonic power.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and calmed myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>She placed a hand on mine.</p><p><br></p><p>“The world is a very large place, Sil-kun. There are all kinds of people. You feel pain and disgust at such thoughts because you are a kind man. Similarly, there are others who don’t feel anything as long as they get what they want. You shouldn’t get depressed over people like them. They don’t deserve your attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback at the seriousness in her voice. It was completely different from the usual bubbly Lavy we knew.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost as if it was the real her. To be honest, I was always confused by her personality. Lavinia Reni was either a very simple girl, or the biggest mastermind in the world… or maybe a bit of both. My bet was on the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I remembered her own situation and realised that the situation must have reminded her of her own and pulled her into a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Lavy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>The position we were in made me hard and she felt it too. She half turned towards me and whispered into my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look stressed. Let me take care of you.” She said, stopping for a moment and turning around and straddling my waist.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, the depression thoughts were scattered away. We have been a couple for almost two weeks now and except for the first day, we hadn’t done anything.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the reasons for that was Shuna being in the room at night. But now that I had the opportunity, I wasn’t about to let it go.</p><p><br></p><p>She however took some soap and started applying it on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>The sight of her wet hair sticking around her face and slightly covering her otherwise naked breasts as she concentrated on applying soap on my chest… this girl probably doesn’t realise how mind numbingly sexy she was…</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t hold back anymore so I leaned in, taking her lips into my own.</p><p><br></p><p>She was surprised for a bit but then returned the kiss enthusiastically, her breasts pressed tightly on my chest, slipping all over my chest due to the soap she had used.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed my tongue into her mouth and she accepted it, even playing around with it.</p><p><br></p><p>I took some soap in my hand and started doing the same. I started with her back before my hands snaked around to her butt and pulled her into myself, rubbing my length right above her core.</p><p><br></p><p>She moaned lightly into my mouth as her hand ran through my hair, gripping it as she kissed me back more aggressively.</p><p><br></p><p>Her actions however only served to make me more excited. I cupped her breasts in my hands and raised them to my lips before taking one of her nipples into my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahhhh…” Her hips moved, grinding her slit over my length while she ran her finger through my hair, pushing me into her breasts, her breathing getting heavier with each passing moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Water splashed around in the tub, spilling out everywhere as she hugged me closer.</p><p><br></p><p>I sucked on her nipple, enjoying her moans as my hands slipped into her crack, massaging her ass before sliding over her rosebud. She jerked suddenly, broken from the pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sil-kun!” I looked up at her and saw that she was blushing. Suddenly, I smirked as an idea appeared in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>My fingers circled right around her rosebud, not touching it directly and her body shivered every time I got near the part.</p><p><br></p><p>She was biting her lips to control her moans and I did something which made her control break.</p><p><br></p><p>I used a quick Clean Spell, something I had created to clean off the tables and my kitchen. An interesting fact about the spell was that it worked on human bodies too.</p><p><br></p><p>A water tentacle formed inside the tub and I guided it to her backdoor making her yelp and jump.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled back slightly, staring into my eyes with an embarrassed blush.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's important to clean each part well when bathing.\" I whispered. Her mouth opened at the absurdity of the situation. \"Even here.\" I didn't give her a chance to reply as I locked her lips with mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened but slowly her arms reached into my hair and back as my tongue slid inside her. Our tongues wrestled and the water tentacle did its job making her moan in my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued the treatment for a few minutes, our lips only separating for a few moments in between and felt her hips rocking in my lap with more vigour with each passing moment until her whole body jerked as she shivered and suddenly collapsed on my chest. I felt a kiss on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at my handiwork.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, she got back up.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sil-kun hasn’t gotten… cleaned yet. Sit on the edge of the tub. Let me clean you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did as I was told and she sat down between my legs, soap gathered in her hands as she started soaping my thighs. Her hands cleaned my thighs before moving towards my rock hard rod and started working on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost on a reflex, my hand went on her head, caressing her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>She finally cleaned the soap with water and slowly jerked my cock while looking at me with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>My dick twitched at her look, making her giggle slightly before she leaned in and kissed the tip slowly and then took it into her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghhh.” I groaned as the warmth of her mouth enveloped me.</p><p><br></p><p>She started moving slowly, her tongue rolling all over my tip. Her drool rolled down her chin as she licked my length from the balls to the tip before enveloping the tip again, bobbing her head, sucking me off. She was sloppy but that was also what made her insanely hot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy, I am going to be a bit rough. Tell me if you feel uncomfortable.” I called out to her and she nodded, humming slightly without taking out my cock from her mouth, sending pleasurable shivers down my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>I grabbed her hair and pushed her down on my length.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grgkk ghahh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” I asked and she just nodded, grabbing my waist with her hands and pushing herself more. “Alright. Just don’t force yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>I slowly pushed her down before pulling her back.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly I increased my speed, moving my waist, sometimes thrusting into her mouth, hitting the back of her throat, making her gag more.</p><p><br></p><p>The stubborn girl however didn’t back down either and kept going. Drool flowed all over my length even drenching my balls as she continued moving.</p><p><br></p><p>A few times she stopped and gasped for breath, her eyes watery but filled with determination as she dove back in. She was oddly competitive in this.</p><p><br></p><p>I was also reaching my limit so I held her head and thrusted a few times before releasing everything into her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled back and closed her eyes, swallowing everything before pausing and licking the corner of her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously this girl…</p><p><br></p><p>“Open your mouth, show me.” I said, feeling my sadistic side coming out.</p><p><br></p><p>She happily obliged.</p><p><br></p><p>I grabbed her tongue with my fingers and massaged her mouth, playing with her tongue, checking every nook and cranny. There was something incredibly hot about the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good girl.” I snapped my finger, cleaning everything and pulling her in for her reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy loved kisses so we kissed… a lot.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tsunade Senju -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She came out of the hospital room and found Jiraiya waiting outside.</p><p><br></p><p>The man… he looked old.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been working non stop since the incident. To hunt down any spies leaving the leaf village.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, he was supposed to investigate the things Danzo had done but the Uchiha Clan as well as several other clans of the village had downright denied that.</p><p><br></p><p>They did not want anyone related to sensei to be involved in the matter.</p><p><br>As insulting as it was, she could see and understand their reasoning too. After all, everything was happening under sensei’s nose. People would obviously doubt that things were not happening by his orders… or at least agreement with everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Let alone others, Tsunade herself doubted him.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally it was decided that the Uchiha Clan would be the one investigating the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, the Konoha Police force was under the Uchiha and this did fall under their jurisdiction too.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone had supported this decision. They knew that the Uchiha wouldn’t leave any stones unturned especially after that abominable arm was left.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade’s temper flared everytime she thought of that arm. If Danzo wasn’t dead, she would have ripped him apart with her own hands.</p><p><br></p><p>These bastards hadn’t even left her grandfather’s body untouched.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing she had done after the battle was have the bodies dug out but found them to be missing.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Their bodies had been missing all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>After this discovery, even the Hyugas had rallied against the Hokage with the Uchiha.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uchiha police had gone off to search like bloodhounds after that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>All the hate and alienation they had suffered had turned into anger and bitterness and they were channelling everything into this search.</p><p><br></p><p>Members of the Shimura Clan, Sarutobi Clan, Homura Clan and Utatane Clan were getting arrested left and right.</p><p><br></p><p>The tracking squads had all left to search for the leftover root members who had fled the village after Danzo’s death.</p><p><br></p><p>They were keeping their discoveries from the public until their leader returned.</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku Uchiha hadn’t shown his face for the last three days, supposedly healing from an injury in the fight. She didn’t see him injured but who knows.</p><p><br></p><p>He even denied her help saying his wife will take care of him and that her help would be more appreciated by the village.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the defeated looking face of Jiraiya.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way she pitied him a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>He was always the one paying for the selfishness of others. Be it Orochimaru, Sensei or even… her.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya looked at her as soon as she came out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“His condition is stable now but he cannot be a ninja anymore.” She replied. She saw the look of pain and regret on his face and added. “It’s still better than him dying. If anything you should thank that dragon. He was going to use the Shikki Fuin before she blasted him into a wall and the jutsu was unsuccessful.” A part of her felt annoyed at the man. “I guess he was planning to run away once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsunade!”</p><p><br>“What Jiraiya! Even after seeing everything, are you still defending him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya’s mouth clamped down but he still looked annoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you say that everything that was done here was all just Danzo’s fault? Everything? That sensei had no idea what was happening? That man was walking in front of him with that abomination of a hand and he had no idea! At this point, even if the Uchiha clan rebelled, I wouldn’t blame them. They deserve that. And what about Naruto Uzumaki? Everything that happened to him? Wasn’t he your godson? They messed up so badly that even Gods descended on the village to punish them… How can you still be so… dumb?” She gritted her teeth and took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsunade…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t… don’t talk to me Jiraiya. I don’t know what I am thinking right now. I might say something which I don’t want to, so… please, please leave me alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t even joking. With that, she left him alone.</p><p><br></p><p>After the fight, she had found out what that Uchiha brat had done to her to remove her fear of blood.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a power…</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade shuddered even thinking about it.</p><p><br></p><p>But with the knowledge of that technique, came a doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>Was removing her haemophobia the only thing he did? Or did he do something else? Were her thoughts even hers?</p><p><br></p><p>She knew that she didn’t want anything to do with the village and yet she was here. Why was she even doing all this? Were these her own thoughts?</p><p><br></p><p>The more she thought about these, the more it haunted her.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade shook those thoughts away with great difficulty and all it did was make her angry at sensei.</p><p><br>It was because of him that all this was happening.</p><p><br></p><p>A part of her just wanted to finish him off in his sleep but her pride as a medic wouldn’t allow her to do that. Maybe it would have been better if that dragon had finished him off… that way, he could have gone with dignity. She consoled herself by the fact that he will not be escaping this mess he created by dying in the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>She left the hospital and was met by an unexpected face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mikoto Uchiha.” She greeted the wife of the Uchiha Clan head. “Are you here to see your son?”</p><p><br></p><p>With her was her younger son, looking at her curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman nodded. “How is Itachi?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is still unconscious. The surgery was successful but he overexerted himself and lost consciousness.” She stopped. “I think we should talk somewhere else.” She looked at her son and added. “Alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman frowned but looked at her son. “Sasuke, wait in Itachi’s room.”</p><p><br></p><p>The kid was confused but followed.</p><p><br></p><p>She, on the other hand, led Mikoto Uchiha to an empty room.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Tsunade-sama?” The woman asked, almost wary.</p><p><br></p><p>“I checked on Itachi’s condition before his surgery. He has a disease slowly developing in his lung. It’s still in the first stage so the treatment is possible. If it develops further, then I am afraid that I won’t be able to do anything about it. I think you should start the treatment for him. I am not saying I am the only one who can do it. There are other doctors in Konoha who can do it too. You can consult someone else if you want a second opinion. The reports are all in his file.”</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the woman’s face paled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right now, yes. He is alright. But his condition will deteriorate slowly if not treated.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I am just doing my job. How is Fugaku doing by the way?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is recovering. He had overexerted himself and one of his old wounds had opened up. He will be returning soon.” Mikoto replied, although Tsunade couldn’t help but notice that she was a bit wary.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. In that case, please send someone to inform me. I need to talk to him as soon as he is available.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman nodded and took her leave.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not take the position of the Hokage.” She denied without looking up from the files. In the absence of the Hokage, she was chosen to take over the duties.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Tsunade, there is no one better than you who can take the position right now. Without a Hokage, the village is in a mess. Other villages are looking at us like bloodhounds, ready to jump at us at a moment’s notice. Not to mention those damn Uchihas… they are doing whatever they want.” Koharu Utatane complained.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade smashed the table in front of her into dust, taking the woman aback by the sudden bout of violence and making her shut up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough! I already said I will not become the Hokage. That’s final. As for the Uchiha, I think they are doing exactly what they were told to. The reason you are so agitated is because someone is actually doubting you. Well, news flash. You have all been doing the same to them for years now. How does it feel being on the wrong side of the blade?”</p><p><br>“Tsunade, you can’t be serious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am very serious. In fact, I think they are already restricting themselves by only keeping you under surveillance until the investigations are completed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked offended.</p><p><br>Was she really expecting her to side with them after seeing what they had done?</p><p><br></p><p>The woman then had the audacity to look at Jiraiya who merely ignored her. Jiraiya might not say anything to sensei but the advisors were a completely different thing.</p><p><br></p><p>He held no love for them at all.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened and an unexpected face showed up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Asuma.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked at the newcomer in hope. “Please Asuma, you need to make Tsunade understand. I think it’s the genjutsu that was cast on her…” she started to babble but the man ignored her completely and looked at her instead.</p><p><br></p><p>“Asuma Sarutobi, guard of the fire daimyo reporting.”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised an eyebrow but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Daimyo has sent me to investigate the matter from a week ago. The extent of damage and… what happened after that… and the rumours floating around… has the Fire Daimyo worried. He wishes to know everything that happened here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alone?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I have a friend and another member of the Fire Guardians with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Very well. You can bring him in and I will explain the situation.” She replied as she got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsunade!”</p><p><br></p><p>She ignored the words of the advisors and left the room, thankful for the timely arrival of Asuma.</p><p><br></p><p>Once outside, the man sighed a bit. “How is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him and then towards the way they were going. “Alive. He lost an arm and a leg. He will be retiring.” She had heard that Asuma Sarutobi had left the village due to a fight with sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>A look of pain passed over his face before a professional look appeared as they reached a monk.</p><p><br></p><p>“Chiriku, this is Tsunade Senju, the one temporarily in charge of the village. Tsunade-sama, he is Chiriku, a monk of the Fire Temple and a fellow Ninja Guardian.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded towards the monk and led them to an empty room and took seats.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of enemy could do this? I know there are rumours of a gigantic dragon hundreds of kilometres long and actual Gods are flying around everywhere. Each story is more ridiculous than the others. I know there was a big fight… the missing Hokage Mountain is a dead giveaway but I want to know what exactly is going on.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him strangely. “Who told you those were rumours?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, she went and explained everything she knew to them and by the end of the hour, they were just as flabbergasted by the whole thing as anyone who had heard it later.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious. Please tell me you are not serious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me, Asuma. I have many better things to do than to joke around here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Gods… are you sure?” The Monk asked, the look on his face was of terror.</p><p><br></p><p>His entire belief must have been shaken.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did hear the dragon say that the one who broke the moon to fix the land… was a Goddess.” She had been close enough to hear bits of their words. Now she wished she hadn’t been.</p><p><br></p><p>At least now they know the extent of their fuck up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not only that but there was another guy, the one who stopped everything and froze the water from the ocean. We later found from our investigation that the entire trench, up till  the ocean was frozen by him… almost instantly. The dragon called him Boss.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Fourth Raikage A -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find anything?” He asked as soon as Mabui entered his office.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and handed him the report from the Land of Fire.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly flipped the pages of the file and checked the information. After a few minutes, he looked up with a frown on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this some kind of a joke?”</p><p><br></p><p>“As much as I want it to be, no. This is the exact news I have received from several of our spies in the Land of Fire and Konoha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A dozens of kilometres long dragon? A God? And a trench which connected Konoha to the ocean. What kind of nonsense is this? I want information of what secret weapon they are using, not a story from the drunk fantasies of the taverns from the Land of Fire.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you really think it’s nonsense? Even after seeing what happened to the moon?” Mabui replied and he found his retort getting stuck into his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“It had to be a genjutsu. That… that kind of power is not real. It cannot be real.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet it is. Even according to the legends, the moon was created by the Sage of Six Paths. If that is so then I don’t think what we saw was really a genjutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his hands and looked at the file in front of him as if it was some kind of curse.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can it… is it really true? Are there really Gods in this world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who knows? But there are certainly beings with godlike powers… and Konoha has provoked several of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked blankly at the table and went in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>A part of his mind wondered what kind of beings they were and if they were beings like Tailed Beasts and if that was so, could they be captured and used for Kumogakure?</p><p><br></p><p>Then he remembered their powers and pushed those thoughts away.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Against that kind of power, they would have no other choice but to die.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the freaking moon, dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>The moon!</p><p><br>“A-sama. Konoha is extremely weak right now. Should we… should we prepare for a war? We could use this opportunity…”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes… what is the situation in Konoha right now?</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Wait till we have the full details of the situation. Find everything. Who were those people? Where did they come from? Why did they attack Konoha? How did Konoha survive such an attack? If they can indeed survive such an attack, they might have some trump cards of their own. What if they sealed such a monster into a Jinchuriki? Send more people near the borders and test them but don’t attack them outright. Take advantage of this situation to infiltrate the Land of Fire and find out all the details. That old bastard Onoki will also be looking for a chance. Let them make a move first.”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly gave commands to make them move.</p><p><br></p><p>The incident had left everyone in shock and fear. It was his duty as the kage to ensure that his people remained calm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Konan -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What are we going to do, Nagato? Are there really Gods in this world?” She asked, trepidation showing in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Nagato has been unnaturally quiet since hearing the report about the incident in Konoha village.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t disturb him either because she knew how worried he would be in such a situation. The news had been just that shocking and even she had a hard time believing it… even after seeing the moon collapse in front of her own eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“It… doesn’t matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter if there are Gods in this world. They aren’t doing their job well either way.” Nagato continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Konan looked at him surprised but he was looking down at the floor as he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“If they were really doing their jobs then there wouldn’t be all this pain in the world. But they aren’t, so… it’s time they stepped aside.” He looked up and there was a craze in his eyes unlike anything before. “If there are such cruel and sadistic Gods in this world who would take pleasure in seeing the pain of people… then I am going to bring them down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nagato!”</p><p><br></p><p>“No Konan… I am Pain… I am the pain of every person who has been suffering in this cruel world. The suffering which those so-called Gods have subjected us to… it’s about time they knew Pain…”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious. Didn’t you read the reports? Didn’t you see the moon crumbling apart?” She tried to reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“The moon was created by the Sage of Six Paths and the destruction they cause could be done if we can collect all the Tailed Beasts. I… can do it. With these eyes of mine. Perhaps, this is the reason I have been given these eyes… to bring those cruel Gods down and make them know pain…”</p><p><br></p><p>Konan looked at him with wide eyes and tried to reason with him but no matter what, he wasn’t ready to listen.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, she didn’t even know what to do anymore.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Fugaku Uchiha -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He opened his eyes and the world became clear again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there any problems?” Mikoto asked and he activated his Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>The power which flowed in his eyes… it felt much stronger than before. In fact, he himself felt far stronger than before. His chakra had risen. His vision was sharper. His power flowed much smoother.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at a mirror on the side of the room and pushed more power into his eyes. His eyes changed… morphing into a six cornered star pattern, different from his three cornered star pattern before.</p><p><br></p><p>The eyes of undying light, the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan…</p><p><br></p><p>Even through the mirror, he could feel the power in those eyes…</p><p><br></p><p>Mikoto quickly checked a few more things and finally let out a sigh of relief. “Everything seems to be fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “How are things outside? What was happening outside while I was unconscious.” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and reported everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Today is a meeting of the council. Everyone wants to know what we have unearthed from our investigations.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Okay, I will attend it.” He got up and looked at Mikoto who hesitated a bit. “What is it?”</p><p><br>“Fugaku… Itachi… he is… ill.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“When Tsunade-sama was treating him, she discovered that he had a serious illness in his lungs. It could become terminal if not treated soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>He paused at the news while she continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsunade-sama told me that I could verify the news from other doctors if I doubted her. I did. It was true. I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ask Tsunade what she wants. Get him the best treatment available.” He interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>Mitoko looked at him in surprise and he winced.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you really think I don’t care about him?” He asked, breaking her surprise. He shook his head. “The reason I am doing this is to show him the true face of the people he was siding with. Those eyes… I gave them to him for a reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>The power of those eyes… he knew the temptation and fear they carried. Even he himself wasn’t unaffected. But that’s why he gave them to Itachi…</p><p><br>Let him see the same people he was willing to betray his family for, turn against him due to those eyes… because there was no way anyone would allow such a power to keep on existing.</p><p><br></p><p>As for him using those eyes on the Clan… even if he were to somehow bypass the cooldown period of the technique, it would be for the best that he doesn’t use it… at least that way he can keep using those Mangekyo again.</p><p>   <br>He had sealed a technique in those eyes that would destroy them if the user ever tried to use Kotoamatsukami. But even without that technique, a pair of Mangekyo Sharingan was very strong. Just the normal Genjutsu capability and perception boost from it was far beyond a normal Sharingan not to mention the Susanno…</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku didn’t hate his son… but that didn’t mean he wasn’t disappointed. It chilled his heart to think what could have happened if this whole incident hadn’t happened. His son had really gone astray… and it was a father’s duty to show his son the right path.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Jiraiya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat in the corner of the room, waiting for everyone to gather for the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day the Uchiha Clan was going to disclose the results of their investigations of the whole incident.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one, people filled the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya was sure his sensei was getting removed from his position as Hokage… probably the first kage to be ousted from their position in the history of the Elemental Nations. Sigh…</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the picture of Minato on the wall… which had been replaced after the last one was taken by Naruto…</p><p><br></p><p>How would he feel if he were here now?</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya’s mind has been in turmoil… especially since he was summoned to Mt. Myoboku by the Toad Sages.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow the Prophecy he was chasing all this time… was void.</p><p><br></p><p>It was shattered and the Great Toad Sage had another dream. In this dream, he saw a figure with icy blue eyes and black hair. He stood in the midst of a frozen world. Even the lines of fates which approached him were being sliced to pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>The description only reminded Jiraiya of one person.</p><p><br></p><p>The Great Toad Sage has been in a critical situation since he saw that vision. Apparently, even just a glimpse of that person had injured his spirit greatly…</p><p><br></p><p>Just what kind of beings did they get involved with this time?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, Jiraiya was left with nothing…</p><p><br></p><p>He had lost his friend, lost his student and was probably going to lose his sensei too. He was really at a loss at what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could think more, the door opened and Asuma Sarutobi entered the room. Behind him was the Fire Daimyo himself along with the rest of his Guardians.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone stood up and headed to meet the Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jiraiya, Tsunade… so glad you both are here to take care of things. How did such a thing happen? Just what…”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are about to discuss exactly that, Daimyo-sama. The Uchiha Clan is about to present their report.” Tsunade replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good… in that case, we would like to witness it too.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and offered him a seat at the head of the table.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a minute later, Fugaku Uchiha opened the door and entered with several of his clansmen following him.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the Daimyo with surprise and bowed slightly before looking at Tsunade.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let the meeting begin. I think we all already know of the incident which happened a week ago but I would still like to jog everyone’s memory and report everything from my point of view.” Tsunade stood up and addressed the meeting and basically recalled everything she had seen that day.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the Daimyo’s face paling at Tsunade’s story.</p><p><br></p><p>“The attack was done because they had tried to prevent Naruto Uzumaki, who is presumed to have been the contractor of the Dragons from returning back to their realm against his will. The first attacks were made by Danzo Shimura at the green dragon and then towards Naruto Uzumaki and another child who was also a dragon. Their attack was a retaliation. Later on, the destruction of the Hokage Mountain and the… final attack which made the… countrywide trench was done because Danzo Shimura had tried to use his stolen Sharingan to take control of the two dragons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did they want, Tsunade? How did you all stop them and send them back?” The Fire Daimyo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They winced.</p><p><br></p><p>“We didn’t send them back… They left of their own will… on the condition that we will leave Naruto Uzumaki alone from now on. From their discussions, I could understand that the leader of the group considers Naruto as an adopted brother of his. He found out about the way Naruto was treated and Naruto has been staying there with them since then. This time Naruto had discovered his heritage and had come to take the picture of his parents from Konoha when he was stopped by the third Hokage… and the rest you all know. As for how we stopped them? We didn’t. Their leader didn’t want a fight from the start. He had even ordered them to not attack anyone unless they were attacked first… which they were. Even during the whole battle, they only retaliated when attacked first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So… they left? Just like that?” the Fire Daimyo asked, astonished.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do we know where they came from? Where is this Summoning Land of Dragons? I have never heard of dragons as summons before in my life, even in the old scrolls of the Hyuga Clan.” Hiashi Hyuga asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No one knew they existed before this. Not even the Toads of Mount Myoboku or Lady Katsuyu of Shikkotsu forest knew of them existing. We think they live in a completely different world separate from ours and Naruto was able to accidentally reverse summon himself there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So… you are trying to say that all of this was just a big coincidence?” Shikaku Nara asked, sarcastically.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. The attack itself was due to the hasty decisions of Hiruzen Sarutobi and his advisors.” Fugaku Uchiha spoke for the first time, getting everyone’s attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“As Tsunade-sama stated just now… they had only attacked in retaliation. Moreover, their entire reason for getting angry was the unfair treatment of Naruto Uzumaki. What Tsunade-sama missed to mention was that they had called Naruto Uzumaki a possession and weapon of the village, further provoking the ire of the dragons and then attacked the green dragon girl first.” That was something Jiraiya hated too but he hadn’t said anything back then.</p><p><br></p><p>From an objective point of view, not losing the jinchuriki of the village was a priority task but Jiraiya knew that today people were not here to logically look at things but rather to find a scapegoat to blame everything on and sensei and his advisors… were just too convenient to pass up.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh… he was right to stay away from all this politics.</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku continued. “This matter would have never arisen had they done their work properly and treated Naruto Uzumaki as the Fourth wanted him to be treated. Even then, there was a chance that things wouldn’t have escalated to this degree if they hadn’t attacked first and tried to negotiate with a non-violent enemy first. That way, not only could we have the village’s jinchuriki back but also gained the support of such… powerful beings.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is… is there no way to reconcile with them?” The Fire Daimyo asked meekly.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade shook his head. “We don’t know where they came from and where they went to. Naruto was… very lucky.” She then looked at Fugaku. “Do you have the reports?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and put forward a scroll and unsealed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Several dozen files appeared on the table and he passed them over to every member on the table, including the Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>“Danzo Shimura, an advisor of the Hokage and the leader of a secret branch of anbu under his direct control called the root has been involved in too many things. The files in front of you contain the information about whatever we could find about him. Too bad he died and his body was destroyed or we could have the Yamanaka check through their memories to find the true extent of the damages he has caused.” Fugaku began as they all opened the files and began pursuing the contents.</p><p><br></p><p>The more he looked the deeper the frown on his face became.</p><p><br></p><p>Human Experiments, dealing with Orochimaru, kidnapping and assassinating members of Konoha Clans for techniques and kekkei genkai, colluding with nuke nin of other villages, looting villages and merchants to fund their missions, threatening orphanages to recruit. The root training regime and graduation test made him disgusted… was this the Konoha they preached about?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this the Will of Fire?</p><p><br></p><p>And Sensei was allowing all this to happen?</p><p><br>At this point, even Jiraiya couldn’t ignore the mistakes of his sensei… this was just too much.</p><p><br></p><p>The further he read, the more disgusted he became.</p><p><br></p><p>Sabotaging people, spreading false rumours and propaganda… Apparently it was them who had spread the information about Naruto being the reincarnation of the fox and sensei had tried to cover it up as him honouring Minato’s last wish…</p><p><br></p><p>That bastard was also involved in some shady deals during the nine tails attack and had been constantly spreading rumours about the Uchiha Clan in the village.</p><p><br></p><p>“In fact, these are only the things that we were able to find out from our investigation. With the help of a thorough search from the Yamanaka Clan, we can discover even more information from their minds.” Fugaku completed, remarkably keeping himself in control. Especially considering the fact that the death of Shisui Uchiha was caused by Danzo Shimura according to the reports.</p><p><br></p><p>“H-how can this be happening in Konoha?” The Fire Daimyo started. “Did Hiruzen know about this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If he did then he was as guilty as Danzo Shimura for letting this happen and if he didn’t know anything was amiss, then he is clearly not competent enough to sit in his position anymore. As for what he is, you will have to ask him by yourself, Lord Daimyo.” Jiraiya felt bad but looked around and found that no one said anything to refute it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Either way, from what I have heard, he is not fit to continue as a Hokage after losing his arm and leg. The village has lost many ninjas, so soon after the Nine Tails attack. We have even lost the fourth, Orochimaru has rebelled and now this, not to mention the jinchuriki of the village has been taken by… Gods. We are in an incredibly dire situation right now with the other villages eying us. We need to elect a new Hokage as soon as possible and stabilise the situation.” Surprisingly, it was Hiashi Hyuga who said this.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya knew he wasn’t wrong either but tried to remember and recalled the incident of the Kumo Head Ninja where Hiashi’s brother was sacrificed.</p><p><br></p><p>While he understood that it was the best possible choice, trading the life of one person for the like for hundreds in a potential war, especially right after the nine tails attack, he could also understand Hiashi’s anger with sensei about it, although the Hyuga Clan head was too good to show such a thing to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes… then who is to become the next Hokage?” The Daimyo questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I propose Jiraiya-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think Tsunade-sama should take the seat. She is the granddaughter of the First and the grandniece of the Second, not to mention one of the Sannin. The village would regain its morale if she were to take the helm.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya raised his hand. “I do not wish to stand in the contest. My Spy Network needs me outside the village, more so now than before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time Tsunade also raised her hand. “I do not wish to take the position either but I recommend Fugaku Uchiha. The Uchiha Clan has been treated unfairly but even then has continued to contribute to the village. Fugaku and his son Itachi have been major contributors in the previous battle and he is more than capable of taking the position of the Hokage. In case everyone has forgotten, the Uchiha were one of the founders of the village too. Anyways, we can vote.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough there were some doubts in the people while some didn’t agree with the choice but the vote cleared everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The only one who could stand in competition was Kakashi but he had been running around, weeding out spies.</p><p><br></p><p>Guy hadn’t been in the village during the attack. When he returned he was immediately sent out on another mission, not that anyone would recommend him as the Hokage.</p><p><br></p><p>Shikaku Nara directly pulled back.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end, only Hiashi Hyuga and Fugaku Uchiha were left.</p><p><br></p><p>And so… Fugaku Uchiha became the fifth Hokage of Konohagakure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kaguya Otsutsuki -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Where was she?</p><p><br></p><p>She tried to remember and the last thing she could remember was being sealed by Hagoromo and Hamura and leaving her will behind to free her at a later time.</p><p><br></p><p>The following years were just her, powerless, all alone, trapped in eternal darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there was a sudden shaking. She felt the seal being cracked open but unlike what she was expecting, it wasn’t Zetsu who had freed her but rather, her seal being broken down by someone. The next thing she knew, she was buried in the ground below.</p><p><br></p><p>Her form was that of a spirit who couldn’t wander further away from her place.</p><p><br></p><p>She had no body and even her spirit was weak, almost fading due to the long period of sealing. She didn’t even have any chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, what she needed the most… was a body to latch on to so that she doesn’t fade away.</p><p><br></p><p>She soon felt a life nearby and quickly forced her spirit to move and latch onto it before she lost consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The last thing she remembered before losing her consciousness was seeing the towering figure of a girl… and Byakugan.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Hiashi Hyuga -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“How could that happen? Fugaku Uchiha, the new Hokage?” The elders clamoured between one another.</p><p><br></p><p>Their pride had been hurt when their biggest rival, the Uchiha had become a hokage.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, this would have been impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Every Clan Head knew how the Uchiha were treated by the upper management of the village, not to mention how the selection of the hokage happened.</p><p><br></p><p>It was always someone from the Hokage line.</p><p><br></p><p>From First Hokage to the Second, then Third and even the fourth was the student of the Third’s student.</p><p><br></p><p>Even last time, the only recommendations for the position of the Hokage were Orochimaru and Minato, both people related to the Third Hokage…</p><p><br></p><p>If some gained a strength and reputation comparable to them but wasn’t from the same line… they were removed.</p><p><br></p><p>A prime example would be Sakumo Hatake… or how could the information about such an important mission become public knowledge?</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone knew what was happening but no one interfered, afraid of facing the same end as the White Fang.</p><p><br></p><p>So, an Uchiha becoming the Hokage was the last thing anyone could imagine, especially after the Nine Tails fiasco… but who could have thought?</p><p><br></p><p>In the end, Hiashi’s name was given just so there was some competition. With Tsunade and Jiraiya backing away, and Tsunade recommending Fugaku, his ascension was all but decided. The Fire Daimyo was also in a hurry and quickly agreed to this.</p><p><br></p><p>But what surprised Hiashi was what happened later.</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku Uchiha’s first decision as the Hokage was to strip the elder council of their position and have them searched thoroughly by the Yamanaka.</p><p><br></p><p>If they found anything awry, the search would then move to Hiruzen Sarutobi too. Everyone knew they would find something, after all, they had been at the top for several decades. It would be a miracle if they hadn’t done shady things, especially with Danzo and Orochimaru running around.</p><p><br></p><p>The only relief for Sarutobi was that the investigation’s results will not be made public so as to not cause too much chaos in the village during this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if that first decision was expected, the next one was completely out of the blue.</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku Uchiha selected his new council and while many if not most expected him to choose from his own clan, he actually chose Tsunade, Shikaku and… him…</p><p><br></p><p>Yes… the Uchiha Clan head had chosen his clan’s biggest rival’s head as an advisor.</p><p><br></p><p>Third was the decision of dividing the duties.</p><p><br></p><p>Uchiha had always managed the Police Force alone. This had always put them at odds with the Konoha civilians. To reduce this, he had opened the police force to other clans.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hyuga were chosen for this as their Byukagan could help monitor the village just as well as the Sharingan could.</p><p><br></p><p>With just this small move, Fugaku showed people that he was not favouring his clan and actually taking power away from them whereas what it did was share their burden with other clans, removing the Uchiha as the sole target of the public’s ire when law was enforced.</p><p><br></p><p>As for taking away the power, Hiashi was sure the Anbu’s composition would change soon enough so no hair was lost on their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>It even made Hiashi doubt if the position of the Hokage suddenly made everyone a better politician because these were not things he could have expected from the previous Fugaku.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the… Gods did knock some sense into him while beating him up?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Gods…</p><p><br></p><p>It was something Tsunade had heard herself and after the show of power… no one doubted it either.</p><p><br></p><p>The purpose of the Fire Daimyo coming here… was to make Shrines to appease the wrath of the Gods…</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, one of the people investigating the incident from his court was also a member of the Fire Temple.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say the monk was beyond appalled at the news that actual Gods had descended and punished Konoha…</p><p><br></p><p>They were currently having the shrines constructed in place of the Hokage Mountain as a show of their apology.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fire Daimyo himself wanted to inaugurate the shrine in a festival while the monks from the Fire Temple had been called to offer prayers there.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiashi and the Hyuga Clan were in charge of this entire operation and he had sent his assistant, Haru Hyuga with his daughter Hinata to check the location before the construction could begin.</p><p><br></p><p>As the meeting finished, he stepped out of the room and saw his daughter who had returned, carrying… a bunny.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh… Hinata… he was always worried about what she might face if she continued to be so kind.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps, his new position could allow him to somehow change the age-old traditions of his clan.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, if an Uchiha could become the Hokage… there was no way the Hyuga couldn’t change.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Omake (Alternate End)(Crack) -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, there is no way normal ninjas can stand up to them. We need to do something.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hiruzen looked at the girl floating in the sky who was giving off a pressure far surpassing that of the dragon above and decided that he needed to do something.</p><p><br></p><p>At that point, he could only think of one jutsu which had any chance to stop them.</p><p><br></p><p>So taking one last breath he prepared himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He had committed many mistakes and now was his chance to correct them so he didn’t hesitate. He made the hand seals for the jutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>\"When the tree leaves dance, one shall find flames. The fire's shadow will illuminate the village, and once again, tree leaves shall bud anew.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, no!” He heard Jiraiya’s shout. He must have figured out what he was about to do but Hiruzen didn’t waver.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he felt a chill run down his back as the jutsu took effect.</p><p><br></p><p>He rushed the girl who merely looked at him without making any moves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shiki Fuin!”</p><p><br></p><p>A translucent figure appeared in front of him. It was a gaunt spectre with a demonic visage. It was much larger than an average human, possessing long, shaggy, white hair, from which two red horns protruded, as well as purple-hued skin. It was draped in a large white kimono and carried a set of prayer beads and a sword in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiruzen concentrated on the person he wanted to seal and the figure moved but rather than attacking the girl… it sheathed back his sword and then looked back.</p><p><br></p><p>A severe chill ran down Hiruzen’s spine when he was started by the blank dark eyes of the figure.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it spoke…</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>It spoke…</p><p><br></p><p>“You want to seal her?”</p><p><br></p><p>The words sent shivers down Hiruzen’s very soul but he nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>The Shinigami and the girl both stared at him for a while and Hiruzen’s mind and heart were running over their capacity… when the Shinigami opened his mouth again.</p><p><br></p><p>“You nuts, bruh…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>With that the Shinigami disappeared again.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiruzen on the other hand looked at the girl and the next second, he was embedded into the ground… an arm and leg mangled beyond recognition…</p><p><br></p><p>But beyond the pain, only one thought ran in his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>What just happened?</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am finally back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Some people had asked me to show what happened in Konoha after that… war?

My Shadow Clone was still there, keeping a guard.</p><p><br></p><p>I dispelled it when I entered the room and laid on the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>The result of the fight was as I had expected after all, I wasn’t expecting to defeat the Lord of the youkai with just a year or two of training. It was the process which surprised me.</p><p><br></p><p>He won with an illusion magic… no, yojutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had explained the difference between the different types of powers used by the Youkai. Nurarihyon’s illusion was his personal, unique fear or the yojutsu which runs in his bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>So many different styles of magic and each having their own advantages and weaknesses. It just goes to show how vast this world truly is.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the house, I entered the Training Dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not in the mood to summon Shanks. That guy would keep on teasing me the entire time. Same for Tobirama, who would keep on scolding me.</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi might not look like it but he was pretty savage in his comments too.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, Hashirama it is.</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned him and told him about the training and spar with Nurarihyon. Even the things he told me about the Senjutsu of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, is there such a thing? I didn’t know that was possible. Manipulating Nature’s Energy directly to do things sounds fantastic. I can think of several things which would give it an advantage over our Senjutsu style. At the same time, there are things our Senjutsu style can have an advantage in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Like?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, since you directly manipulate Nature's Energy, you don’t have to go through the complex process of taking in Nature's Energy, mixing it in equal proportion of Physical Energy and Spiritual Energy to make Senjutsu Chakra, thus eliminating the dangers associated with it. Even the time needed will be reduced depending on your mastery of the skill. Finally, you won’t be limited to ten minutes of Sage Mode since it wouldn’t just end with you using up all of your Senjuutsu Chakra.” He said after some thought. “This way, you can use the power for as long as you are not down.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the disadvantages?</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s see. I would have to see it in use to know exactly but I would say, you would need a strong body and affinity with Nature’s Energy to manipulate Nature’s Energy to that extent. Second, it could be weaker at initial stages compared to Sage Mode since you get added Physical Energy and Spiritual Energy on top of the Nature’s Energy. But as you master the ability more, you can manipulate more Nature’s Energy, making up for the Physical Energy and Spiritual Energy. You couldn’t boost your jutsu with this variant of Nature’s Energy as you would need it to be assimilated with your chakra.” He added after thinking a bit more.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man in amazement. He derived all that from the basic information I had told him.</p><p><br></p><p>The title God of Ninja wasn’t all due to the Asura’s Chakra maybe? The man was incredibly talented on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently he took my silence as a sign of me being depressed and quickly started reassuring me. “But all these are just my guesses. I don’t know much about the Senjutsu of that world so I can’t say much with certainty. You should take up that person’s offer and have him teach you the Senjutsu of your world. Learning new things is always fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Actually, do you think I am ready to learn Senjutsu? You know the type you use?”</p><p><br></p><p>I still hadn’t reached the point where I could learn it from the Toad Sages and the Snake Sages weren’t even shown in the Shippuden Manga so I couldn’t summon them either. That only left Jiraiya, someone who didn’t even know how to use Senjutsu perfectly himself and… Hashirama.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, there were the Toad Sage and Hagoromo himself towards the end but that’s a long time. Actually, there was also Katsuyu but I didn’t know if she knew Sage Mode. </p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you want to learn Senjutsu? Hmm, why not. Although my own version of Sage Mode doesn’t have any special techniques compared to the Sage Modes of the other two Sage Lands that said, it has the most amount of raw power. It’s just that… to learn my version of Sage Mode, you need to learn Wood Style first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wood Style?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Learning Wood Style would allow you to understand Nature more, understand how the energy flows in nature. You will then need to guide the energy into your body.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I thought your Sage Mode probably came from the Land of Slugs.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Land of Slugs? No, not really. Why would you think so?” He asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, because Tsunade uses the Slug Summoning Contract and they are known as one of the three Holy Sage Lands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, Tsuna got a summoning contract from the Slugs? They are good summoning beasts but no, the Senju Clan didn’t have that contract. I guess she must have found it herself. Good for her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>That cleared up the confusion I had for a long time… and also made me realise just how much of a monster Hashirama Senju was all over again.</p><p><br></p><p>With that, I started working on Wood Style. As Hashirama said, it helped me sense Nature’s Energy, something which would help me learn both world’s versions of Senjustu easily.</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I stepped down from the bus and looked at the group gathered in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone from my friends group had come… even Yura was here.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved at them but suddenly froze at the sight of another face among the members… What the hell is she doing here?</p><p><br></p><p>The mermaid I had saved back them… was she someone related to Rikuo?</p><p><br></p><p>Were mermaids even Youkai?</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit, that would mess so many things up.</p><p><br></p><p>Please, don’t recognise me. Please don’t recognise me. Please don’t recognise me.</p><p><br></p><p>My hopes were however crushed when she turned back and looked at me and her face lit up in what seemed to be realisation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tatsuya! You are here.” Jiro came forward and greeted me. The rest followed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the girl followed slowly, accompanied by Tsurara.</p><p><br></p><p>Did she tell them about me?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t use any supernatural powers back then.</p><p><br></p><p>What should I do?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sun Seto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched nervously from beside Tsurara as Tatsuya-san was greeted by his friends. It was indeed him.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who had saved her back then.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night she had told Rikuo-sama and the rest about the incident and they had told her about Tatsuya-san as well as the rest of their friends and told her to be careful around them so that she didn’t accidentally reveal her identity to them… especially to Yura-san, who was an onmyoji from the Keikain Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been scared stiff when she found out about her but had someone gathered her courage to meet Tatsuya-san.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, she was going to find an opportunity to talk to him and explain everything to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“How are you feeling now? How is Tobi-kun?” Rikuo-sama asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… yes, I am better now. Tobi is doing well too. Sae and Gin are accompanying him right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard you went on a trip to the Seto Inland Seas. How was it? I have heard it’s a very beautiful place.” Jiro asked.</p><p><br>“Well…” Tatsuya-san scratched his chin, looking hesitant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Beautiful and filled with youkai too.” The one called Kiyotsugu spoke up. “I have heard that the Seto Inland Seas are home to Mermaids. Many people claim to have seen them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sun stiffened at the comment but it wasn’t the end.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, it’s true. Mermaids live in those parts of the sea. They are mostly harmless, even saving people who are drowning sometimes but there can be dangerous ones among them too. They are managed under the leadership of the Mermaid Yakuza.” The Keikain girl said. As expected, she knew.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mermaids have yakuza?” Tatsuya-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of people are they?” Jiro-san asked, interested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mostly harmless to humans. They act like normal people and it’s very hard to tell them apart from each other unless their tail is visible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, I wonder how they look. Mermaids must be very beautiful, right?” Jiro-san said. “I wonder if I can see one if I go to the Seto Inland Seas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t want to do that. Mermaids are very particular about hiding their identity. They have a rule that if you see a mermaid’s tail… they will kill you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>Sun froze at the comment and looked at Tatsuya-san to see what he was thinking. She needed to clear the misunderstanding lest he became afraid of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Tatsuya-san looked stunned too as everyone talked among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how was your trip there?”</p><p><br>He scratched his cheeks looking awkwardly. “I… don’t remember.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well you see, something happened on my last day of the trip.”</p><p><br>“What happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it was raining heavily and I was out to explore the island and while returning…”</p><p><br>Sun was shocked. Was he going to say that?</p><p><br></p><p>“I slipped and fell down, hitting my head on a rock.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get hurt badly?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I was found by Shuri-san and she took me home. As for being hurt, I was.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was it bad?” Rikuo-sama asked, worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… it wasn’t bad… it’s just that…” He hesitated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen, Tatsuya?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just that… I can’t remember anything about the trip.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… Ehhhhhhhh!”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, Sun was frozen in shock for a completely different reason…</p><p><br></p><p>He then proceeded to move his hair and show them the scar on his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Man… why didn’t you tell us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… it wasn’t anything serious and I didn’t want to bother anyone. I didn’t even tell Tobi. He was already down due to Grandma’s passing away and I didn’t want her to worry even more. Only Shuri-san knew about this and now you all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You really had an adventure like that. Who knows, maybe it could be the work of some youkai?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not everything is the work of youkai, Kiyotsugu. Tatsuya-kun, are you sure it’s nothing serious?” One of the girls asked, worriedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Even the cut wasn’t deep and even the wound wasn’t bleeding by the time I got home. I haven’t had any problems since then so I am pretty sure it’s not a problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few minutes with each other before Tsurara introduced her to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is Sun Seto. She is a friend. I hope you guys don’t mind if she joins us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. It’s fine. Miss Sun can always join us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So where are you from, Miss Sun?” Jiro asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I am from the Seto Inland Sea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh! Can you tell us about that place?” They questioned her on the way to the trip and she answered.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Tatsuya-sama was talking to her normally… did he really forget everything?</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the day, she couldn’t bring herself to tell him anything…</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rikuo -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… and that’s the story. Tatsuya has lost his memories of the trip. He didn’t even recognise Miss Sun.” He told his grandfather who burst out in laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa! This is not a time to laugh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha, it’s… it’s just that I have never heard of a more ridiculous situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know right… and yet, he had an injury on his head too. He was acting completely normally with Miss Sun too. Tatsuya always avoids anything related to youkai or the supernatural mostly because he thinks it can be dangerous. It’s not like he hates them… It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe he’s just scared.” Tsurara added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… or knowing him, he just finds these things too troublesome.” He did have a penchant to avoid any trouble in general.</p><p><br></p><p>They had encountered many incidents with the Youkai and yet Tatsuya had avoided them all, either through directly passing up Kiyotsugu’s offer or due to some work.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are we going to do now, Grandpa?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… nothing there we can do.” Grandpa replied with a wide smile, rubbing his hand. “It’s not like the lost memories don’t come back. It doesn’t change anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo looked worried at his hand. “Is your hand still hurt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha, no not really. It was just itching a bit. Don’t worry. Anyways, everything just depends on Sun-chan. She can still get together with him.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… that works?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t see why not. Sun-chan is a very pretty girl and Tatsuya is a teenage boy after all. I don’t see why they can’t get together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will do it.” Sun said, suddenly clenching her fists.</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not let him die. He even got injured after saving me and lost his memories. If he had gone home directly, then maybe he wouldn’t have gotten hurt. I cannot leave him on his own… because… that would shame all Seto Mermaids!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well said, girl. Go on. Make him remember everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Thank you, Nurari-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No worries. It’s always fun to see children grow up.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It’s been a week since that dangerous encounter. Dammit, how could I get caught in such a mess?</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t seem like a cruel girl and Rikuo was also there… and I saved her life too… could she really come here to attack me?</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghhh!” I ruffled my hair in confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened, Nii-san?” Tobi asked, getting up from his push ups.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing. I was… thinking about the future plot of my manga. You carry on. How many push-ups have you done?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two hundred. What now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Two hundred sit-ups next. Then two hundred crunches. Go on, I want it done in the next hour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ehh! That much. I don’t think I can do that. Isn’t that like too much?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you have the energy to talk then you have the energy to do the sets. We haven’t even tried using weights yet and you are already faltering.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But… do we even need this much training to learn kendo?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously, you need the strength and stamina to learn kendo. Physical conditioning is the first step in any sport… well except E-Sports… but you understand what I mean. Go on, I will make something to eat after that. I need to go out for some work later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Tobio who was doing twice the Saitama workout in just two weeks of training. His body had gotten used to it. The Uzumaki Bloodline was working wonders and I had added the Monkey D. Family’s bloodline on that too. He will keep on growing at a rapid pace and I need to find a way to train him accordingly.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already taught him the basic stances of Hinokami Kagura so maybe I could teach him the entire style. It forces the body to perform beyond its normal limits. It will help him grow.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing I had recently discovered was an item in the System Shop.</p><p><br></p><p>Sea King Meat from the One Piece world.</p><p><br></p><p>It increases the strength of the body passively and fulfils the demand of energy for the intensive training.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then, I have started to use that for our food regularly. The meat was relatively cheap and I was getting more points nowadays with Naruto becoming more popular.</p><p><br></p><p>This is only going to increase even more when the anime for Demon Slayer comes out. But till then I had another place to visit.</p><p><br>After eating breakfast, I left home to visit a place I had been meaning to visit for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>The Monthly Comic Earth Star.</p><p><br></p><p>I called the number on the card which the assistant Editor-in-chief had given me.</p><p><br></p><p>The call was answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, am I speaking to Akii Tori-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Who is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Tatsuya Ikuse. We met in the Manga Store a week ago. I wanted to submit my manga and was wondering if we could meet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Yes, you are the white haired body who wanted to submit a shojo manga, right? You can come to the Monthly Comic Earth Star office anytime before 5 pm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will be there in an hour.” The place wasn’t that far and I could get there easily within an hour.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, as decided I was outside the building where the Publishing House had its office.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a relatively new company and thus was renting out a place.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside the building, Akii-san was standing. She showed me the way to their office. I observed the place. It was nothing compared to the Shueisha office obviously. There were only five people inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you brought any manuscripts with yourself?” She asked as she took a seat in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes.” I brought out the manuscript I had made for Kaichou wa Maid-sama and gave it to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She took some time to read it and finally kept it aside.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is good. But how long did it take you to make?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This? It’s fifty pages, so two weeks. I can make around twenty five pages a week. If you are worried about my speed, don’t be. I have over a dozen chapters planned and ready.” I brought out one volume which I had prepared and showed it to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly took it and read it carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is… it’s almost ready to be published.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you want to publish this in our magazine?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s a monthly comic and even if I get busy with my studies, I would have enough time to draw. It works perfectly with my current schedule. I just have a few requests.” I said after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do tell.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish to publish these under a pen name.” I started and made some requests like her calling me before coming to my place so that our schedules don’t collide with Koji-san or Shueisha’s schedule. That would probably be annoying. There were a few other things too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Very well. We can make a contract when you want and publish the pilot chapter for next month’s edition.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be great. Thank you. I will talk to my guardian and have the contract prepared.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about the details about the contract. The pay was obviously lower than Shueisha, much lower but it was also a new publishing house. It was already a lot that they were paying me this much even from their negligible income.</p><p><br></p><p>She then went on to introduce me to the rest of the members of the team.</p><p><br></p><p>Hana Sasayama, the girl who had asked me to buy the comic before reading… or well, begged me to, was the Editor-in-Chief of the company.</p><p><br></p><p>She was… well, enthusiastic to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>Next were Tsumugi Hararaki and Ringo Nishijima, both of whom were editors. The former was… a glutton. Ringo-san was however more mature and knew her work.</p><p><br></p><p>I was however unbothered with them. I didn’t need an editor.</p><p><br></p><p>After leaving the place, I called Shuri-san and told her about the contract. She was the one who had helped me make a deal with Shueisha and after grandma, she was my guardian.</p><p><br></p><p>She obviously agreed to visit me and help me make a contract.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________]</p><p><br></p><p>“Do we really have to run every day to school, Nii-san? Don’t we train enough already?” Tobi asked as we entered the school.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, Sae-chan is not with us today. I don’t see a reason we shouldn’t use this opportunity to train.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But still…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, no whining or I will increase your training again.”</p><p><br></p><p>That shut him up quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he was complaining about this, there was not a drop of sweat on his forehead due to the run.</p><p><br></p><p>The more I pushed Tobi, the more I realised how ridiculous the growth of these bloodlines was at an earlier stage.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t realised this earlier because I was already at a decent level when I used those bloodlines. Their effects were even more evident when the user was weaker.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate, Tobi would be an E Rank in just a year or so.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay Nii-san. I will go and join the club. Are you sure you don’t want to join us though? Coach was asking me who trained me and I told them it was you. He wanted you to join the club too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not really interested. I won’t get time for it either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will tell him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I separated from him and walked back to my classroom.</p><p><br></p><p>The new session of middle school had started. I was finally a senior this year.</p><p><br></p><p>How quickly the time flies.</p><p><br></p><p>I had arrived quite early so I sat down in my usual place, the classic protagonist seat, the second last row near the window.</p><p><br></p><p>It had a nice view of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one the rest of the students came in. Some of them greeted me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was at the top of the year so making friends was not hard. It’s just that I couldn’t connect that well with everyone as I had done with Rikuo and the others. Maybe because I had spent all my free time training or working and didn’t spend any time with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Back in Ukiyo-e town, Kiyotsugu and Jiro dragged me around even when I didn’t want to until they somehow managed to make me a part of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, our homeroom teacher entered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Today we have a new transfer student with us. Come in and introduce yourself.” She looked towards the door and ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up boredly but all of that boredom flew out of the window as soon as I saw the face of the person.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good morning everyone. My name is Sun Seto. I am new to this town. Please take care of me.” She introduced herself and gave an elegant bow as the rest of the class, especially the boys started making noise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seto-san, you can take one of the empty seats.” The teacher pointed towards the class and Sun looked around before finding me. A smile came to her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I sit there? I know Tatsuya-san.” She requested.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the stares of all the students of the class went in my direction.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of romcom situation is this?</p><p><br>No no. This is not a romcom.</p><p><br></p><p>She is probably here to kill me.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a horror genre.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you know Ikuse-kun. Very good. You can sit with him.” The teacher also permitted her and she walked to me with a smile on her face and took a seat near me and happily greeted me.</p><p><br></p><p>I did my best to ignore the looks of the class and nodded at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Wait… could it be that she has come here to check on me, to verify whether or not I have forgotten about that day?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean… she didn’t try to kill me yet… if that’s the case… I will never let her find out the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl sat beside me and gave me a smile and I returned her smile politely.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes… I will definitely not let her find anything.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I made the last hand seal and held it as a wooded dragon emerged from the ground and raced towards Hashirama. He dodged towards the side and the wooden dragon changed directions, making him stop and punch the head of the dragon off… only for the dragon to regrow its head and follow him back.</p><p><br></p><p>He too made a hand seal, with one hand and another wooden dragon rose from the ground faced mine. Both ending up in mutual destruction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good job. That’s it.” He said. “You are learning. Training with Clones is really great. I wonder why I didn’t think of this before?”</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down on the ground and took some breaths.</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably because you didn’t need it.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>As I started learning Wood Style, one of the first techniques I learned was the Wood Clone Technique.</p><p><br></p><p>These clones were amazing. They had some advantages over Shadow Clones too. Like, they didn’t get dispelled in one attack and could easily take some hits. Second would be that it could communicate with the original from a distance, making them give me information in real time.</p><p><br></p><p>There were however disadvantages too.</p><p><br></p><p>First was that I need to concentrate on them to make them perform to their full potential. If I was preoccupied, their performance fell. This is also why they couldn’t be used for training to the extent Shadow Clones could be.</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow Clones didn’t need this concentration and directly fed me the knowledge and experience of the activities. It was hard on the mind for sure, but the experience was detailed unlike the selective things which Wood Clone could send.</p><p><br></p><p>If one had to compare, Wood Clones would be like dividing the mind into several parts to do some work while Shadow Clones were like injections of information.</p><p><br></p><p>I personally preferred using Wood Clones to draw manga, something which increased my efficiency even more. Shadow Clone was used more for repetitive training like jutsu training, elemental chakra training, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>“You just need to keep practising at the same rate. The Sharingan only helps so much. You need to master the jutsu to be able to use them with lesser hand seals so don’t go on copying every jutsu you see. In fact, Madara, the best Sharingan user I know of, barely used his Sharingan to copy other jutsu. It has many flaws after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. He had explained this before too.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sharingan has many restrictions which were not explained in the manga. We only knew that it couldn’t copy Kekkei Genkai jutsu, Shape Transformation techniques like Rasengan which required more practice but there were other restrictions too.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the Water Dragon Bullet Jutsu. It needed forty four hand seals. The Sahringan could copy it, sure… but the more someone has mastered a jutsu, the fewer hand seals they need to use it. Tobirama could do that with a single hand seal.</p><p><br></p><p>This… was not something the Sharingan could copy.</p><p><br></p><p>If the user tried it, not only would it fail, it also had a chance of injuring the user.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes I think that the reason Tobirama masters all his jutsu is not to have an advantage in battle but to counter Uchiha alone…</p><p><br></p><p>Every jutsu he uses, he does it in one or two hand seals… he absolutely hated it if I used the Sharingan against him.</p><p><br></p><p>Hashirama on the other hand was far more chill. He actually asked me to observe the jutsu with the Sharingan so that I could know what was actually happening. Then he drilled me to master it. The guy was actually happier to see both the powers used so well conjugation.</p><p><br></p><p>This way was faster too.</p><p><br></p><p>Four months had passed since I sparred with Nurarihyon. In these four months, my life had settled down once more between training and drawing manga.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, Shanks had laughed and teased me for a whole month after I had told him about the fight. He had then proceeded to beat me up, continuing the high intensity training from before. His goal was to hone my haki to the highest point before I ate any Devil Fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, all we did was fight till death… my death that is. </p><p><br></p><p>The results were… terrifying.</p><p><br></p><p>My Stats didn’t lie.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: C</strong></p><p><strong>Body: (C-8)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: (D-51)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: (D-99)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: (E-25)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 32,112,028 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Kaichou wa Maid-sama, One Piece, Naruto</strong></p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: Training Room, Mentor System</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory: Nichirin Blade x 1, Gacha Tickets x 2</strong></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My body had broken through to the C Rank. The first stat to get to that Rank. My Spirit was close behind due to being pressured by the Conqueror’s Haki regularly.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, after getting to the C Rank, things have started progressing slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me one month to get the eight points in Body and each point was taking more and more time.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Shanks however, this rate was quite good already. His reason was that my body was still growing and there was a limit to how fast it could grow. I should give it some time and instead focus more on techniques in the meantime.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I was focusing on my Swordsmanship, Ninjutsu and Senjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Several things happened in these months.</p><p><br></p><p>First, Shuri-san came over and helped me make a contract with Monthly Comic Earth Star for publishing Kaichou wa Maid-sama there.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus the Monthly Comic Earth Star had a new manga among its ranks. Kaichou wa Maid-sama by Umetarou Nozaki.</p><p><br></p><p>Three chapters were out too and it was well received. My manga had become the best among the ones published in the magazine… which was not that hard to be honest. Still, it meant that the manga was selling more copies now. The income of points was low from it but it was better than nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>I also got to know the people of the publishing house better. They were new… really new. In fact, the Editor-in-Chief, Hana-san started this work just because she was very fond of manga. She is lazy and quite unprofessional and yet always gets the work done.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen her go beyond herself to help out other mangaka to publish the stories in time.</p><p><br></p><p>The Assistant Editor-in-Chief, Akii Tori was the one who actually managed the work. She was a childhood friend of Hana-san who was dragged into the company by her. She was extremely professional and worked the hardest.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the people at the new Publishing House were quite friendly.</p><p><br></p><p>Second thing was Tobi’s training. I had started drilling him with physical exercise. He was growing like no other.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate, after a few years, I could rest assured about his progress.</p><p><br></p><p>Third were my visits to the Ukiyo-e town. As Nurarihyon had promised, I visited Ukiyo-e town every week to learn about Senjutsu from Nurarihyon.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a hard skill to learn. Maybe it was my Senjutsu and Uzumaki bloodline or perhaps it was Hashirama’s words about Wood Style which helped me sense Nature’s Energy faster than usual.</p><p><br></p><p>I was nowhere near a master of the skill but I understood how to get started. Senjutsu was a dangerous skill in this world too.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, this world’s energy had the malice of the world. During Senjutsu use, we have to open our mind, body and spirit to connect to the world’s energy which also leads us to bear the mental strain of fighting against the malice of the world. That’s why to become a master of Senjutsu, one has to master their mind first.</p><p><br></p><p>If they can do this however, then overtime, their minds become stronger. This is why Sages like Sun Wukong have achieved Buddhahood, by achieving enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Nurarihyon, the pinnacle of Senjutsu was not becoming a Sage.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone who had mastered Senjutsu could be called a Sage. The true pinnacle of Senjutsu was Buddhahood… no, it would be more appropriate to say that Senjutsu was one of the paths to Buddhahood, a point where the mind and spirit of a person ascends to become something greater. It was, however, easier said than done.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, as old and experienced as he was, Nurarihyon said that not even he himself was close to being a sage.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, I had no need to think about those things right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Just mastering basic Senjutsu would give me some ability to hide myself. All I needed to do right now was concentrate on that.</p><p><br></p><p>Senjutsu was an urgent need for me.</p><p><br></p><p>For the last four months, Sun Seto has been in my school, sitting beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>Her behaviour was impeccable and she had become a star of the Music Club due to her amazing voice. I guess the stories of mermaids having a good voice is true after all. This coupled with her already pretty face made her incredibly popular in the school, especially among other boys.</p><p><br></p><p>This was however a tiring thing for me. I never thought that the common anime troupe about a female transfer student would be happening to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun was especially nice to me, always being helpful, even cooking bento for me sometimes. These actions however meant the boys of the class gave me a stink eye whenever it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Little did they know what exactly was going on here.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to summon Tsunade and learn how to assess poison in food and how to detoxify myself of poison in case I got poisoned sometimes. Only after that did I start accepting her bento without fear… not that there was anything odd with the bento… ever. Still, the fear was there.</p><p><br></p><p>After four months, I was starting to get confused. What exactly did she want here?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she really just keeping an eye on me?</p><p><br></p><p>Because four months was a lot of time to find a way to kill me.</p><p><br></p><p>And instead of doing anything even remotely suspicious, she always behaved nicely to me. She was very nice to Tobi too and Sae basically idolised her.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, Gin thought she was good too.</p><p><br></p><p>Was I just being paranoid?</p><p><br></p><p>Did she come here just to study and learn about humans?</p><p><br></p><p>If so then why did she not go to Rikuo’s school?</p><p><br></p><p>She would have been much safer there, with other Youkai, in Nurarihyon’s territory.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, she was here.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way it wasn’t related to me.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of it all, there wasn’t anything I could do about the situation so I let it be.</p><p><br></p><p>I left the Training Room and got ready for the day. Today Koji-san was going to come with some news.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past four months, I have been using Wood Clones to make Manga. Due to this I was almost done with Kaichou wa Maid-sama. Only the last chapter was left today and I intended to finish it by the end of today.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hoping to free the slot and get a new manga, something which can help me increase my magic stat. That’s one stat which has been largely ignored.</p><p><br></p><p>While I practised Buddhist Magic whenever I had time, the rate of increase wasn’t that high.</p><p><br></p><p>I finished the last chapter by afternoon.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobi, help me check a chapter.” I called Tobi to read the last chapter of Kaichi wa Maid-sama to finish the quest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, Nii-san, did you complete the chapter?” He asked, coming in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The last chapter is done. Give it a read and tell me if anything is wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took the copy and finished reading and I got a notification.</p><p><br></p><p>Two Gacha Tickets were received and one slot was freed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s great, Nii-san. I didn’t think I would like a shoujo manga one day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Manga is manga. What’s wrong with Shoujo Manga?” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… my classmates say that it’s girly…” He answered embarrassedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t listen to them. They’re idiots.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking, the doorbell rang.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked and it was Akii-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome. Are you here for the new chapter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Is it done?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Please have a seat. I will get the manuscript.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took a seat while I got the manuscript. In the meantime, Tobi got her some tea.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is good. We can directly print it as always. Sigh… you really make our work too easy, Tatsuya-kun. Sometimes I feel we are not working hard enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You all have a lot on your plate as it is. Just take a break once in a while. How have the sales been going though?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s nice overall. Your manga along with Shinobu-sensei’s manga are carrying the Magazine right now. We need more good manga, at least two more of them to establish a solid foothold.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her words gave me an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if you don’t mind, I have an idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, I just completed Maid-sama today. A total of eighty three chapters and one extra.” I said and saw her look at me dumbfoundedly. “I was wondering if I can submit another manga to the Magazine?”</p><p><br>“Another one? Are you sure you can do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… I have some free time so I don’t see why not. I will need some time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, take as much time as you need. I will have to inspect your work first though.” She said, clearly happy. “Just understand that I will have to put it on hold if your health or the quality of the manga falls.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to worry about that. I won’t let any such thing happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay then. I will check the new manuscript when it’s done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any requirements for what kind of manga you want?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, right now we are mainly dealing with Shoujo Manga to appease a certain demographic. One more of those could be good. It would help us make a foothold in this genre. We can expand later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will give you a new manuscript in a week.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Shoujo Manga… I had one in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Kimi ni Todoke, something I had already rolled would be perfect for this.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s one of the best stories out there, having sold millions of copies in my previous life for a very good reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>She talked to me for a while and left with the manuscript while I went back to my room.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to use the gacha.</p><p><br></p><p>Hope I get something good this time.</p><p><br></p><p>I spun the wheel and one of the tickets disappeared from my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>The wheel stopped at… Beelzebub.</p><p><br></p><p>That action comedy manga?</p><p><br></p><p>I think it had magic too but I don’t remember everything about it. I might check it later on. Let’s see the last roll.</p><p><br></p><p>The wheel rolled again, slowing down and stopping at… Inuyasha.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck Yeah!!!</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I was talking about.</p><p><br></p><p>I had realised something very important in the past few years.</p><p><br></p><p>The stronger the people, the more points I get.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the people in the Supernatural World read manga. But my manga was not targeting them before. Demon Slayer manga was not that famous in the Supernatural World while Naruto was. This was because the Supernatural world was more interested in things they could associate with.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to make something centred around the Supernatural world to attract readers from that part.</p><p><br></p><p>Inuyasha was perfect for it.</p><p><br></p><p>I could actually have Rikuo promote it and gain readers among youkai at least.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the powers in the world were nice and while a lot of them required and were youkai based powers, I knew things I could use too.</p><p><br></p><p>Kikyo was very good at purification and healing. She also used Spiritual Powers so maybe she could help me train in that art. </p><p><br></p><p>There was also the Shikon Jewel and the swords but I didn’t know if I could use those without youkai powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon Slayer has been for almost three years already. It will be over in one more year and I would get a chance to introduce one more manga. In that time, I can complete Kimi ni Todoke and even start Inuyasha.</p><p><br>It will be a proper long running shounen series. Now I just need to find a place to publish One Piece.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I started working on Kimi ni Todoke the very next day.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ikuse-senpai.” My concentration was broken by the voice of Midori Hayakawa, the vice president of the Arts Club of our school.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, we have a meeting for the Arts Club.” She said, hesitating slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah yeah…</p><p><br></p><p>Midori-chan was the Vice President but I… was the President of the Arts Club. These kinds of things were my responsibility.</p><p><br>Why did I take this position again?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, I was in my senior year and the rest voted me into the position.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, let’s go.” I gave her a smile and the girl cheered up instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Today we need to discuss what we are going to do for this year’s School Festival. Everyone is very excited.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they were indeed very excited. The entire club was abuzz with discussions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Taicho!” One of the guys noticed me and stood up. The rest followed.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a pretty great reputation in the club. This was due to many reasons.</p><p><br>First was me being at the top of my year. It made many of them look up to me with admiration. Second was due to Tobi, the current ace of the Kendo Club, who had somehow let it out that I was the one who taught him swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then, not only the students of the Kendo Club but also the Club Advisor had approached me several times to invite me into the club. They even had arguments with the Arts Club members who thought they were trying to poach their members.</p><p><br></p><p>The matter had only calmed down when I publicly denied their invitation and stated that I wanted to become a mangaka.</p><p><br></p><p>Last reason was… Sun Seto.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is everyone here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Taicho.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then let’s start the discussions. The school festival is at the end of this month and we need to make a show from the Arts Club. Does anyone have any ideas?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the discussions began.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can do a puppet show.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, who knows how to do that?<br><br></p><p>“How about we make an arts exhibition?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ughh, we do that every year. Can’t we do something new on top of that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Like what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know? The Games Club did a Maid Cafe last year and it was very popular.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ehh… no way. I can’t wear something like that. That’s so embarrassing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ano… how about we…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Midori-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm… why don’t we do cosplay?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah? Cosplay?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. We can totally cosplay anime characters. Many of us want to become artists or mangaka in the future. We can try to make our passions known to others and even promote manga among the students. We can do a presentation on manga as well as how the manga industry is not just some comics for kids but a large and expanding business avenue worth billions of yen.”</p><p><br></p><p>The room quieted down.</p><p><br></p><p>Manga and manga readers were looked down upon in this day and age. I knew that it would change a lot in the next decade or two but right now, these people face teasing and ridicule from others when they tell their dreams to others.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only reason no one told me anything was that I always aced in my studies. That said, even then, the Principal of the school had once asked me if I really wanted to be a mangaka.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… do you think it will work?” Someone asked, breaking the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who knows… but does that mean we shouldn’t try? It’s not as if we have anything to lose. If we are going to be called otakus and ridiculed either way, then we might as well try.”</p><p><br></p><p>Midori-chan was usually so shy but she was extremely passionate about manga.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right! What do we have to fear? We can totally pull this off.” I too gave them a few words of encouragement.</p><p><br></p><p>This topic… it was close to my heart too.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone looked at me. “Really Taicho?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. Go on, Midori-chan, tell us more about your plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Taicho. We can make the presentation from a technical point of view by introducing different types of manga and how manga are made, how much work is put into making even one volume of any manga. We can even make some decorations about different famous mangaka and their achievements. Don’t let anyone look down on how competitive this field is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that’s a great idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right? Then we can explain about other fields which are related to manga like Anime, Light Novels and games, all of which come together to create a mega giant of an industry which has many opportunities for all. In fact, it would have been even better if we could invite someone from the Manga industry as a guest to explain about the subject. But in case we can't, we can do something related to our favourite manga.” She continued.</p><p><br></p><p>She had thought a lot about this.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of thing?” One of the members asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… we can make artwork related to our favourite manga. In fact, I have heard from Tobio Ikuse-kun that it was Taicho who taught him the dance he did last year. He could totally pull a Tanjiro from Demon Slayer…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, what the hell is that about me dancing?” I interrupted her in the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl was really cutting close to home.</p><p><br></p><p>But the fire had already been set.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire club exploded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? That was you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah! That was actually awesome. And now that I think of it, it did kinda look like the Hinokami Kagura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right! Ikuse-senpai could totally do it better.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And we could also collaborate with the Music Club for this performance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not dancing. No way.” I waved the topic off.</p><p><br></p><p>“But senpai!”</p><p><br>“Taicho, didn’t you say you wanted to be a mangaka? We are promoting manga this time. We can make our entire theme related to Manga. The art can be manga related, the dresses, even the performance can be manga related.”</p><p><br></p><p>“All just to make me dance? Are you crazy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s for manga, Taicho. We are going to show all those people that Manga is art.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, we will prove that we are not useless otaku.”</p><p><br></p><p>Holy crap, just where is the conversation going?</p><p><br></p><p>“Taicho!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please Taicho!”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And just like that, I was surrounded by the entire Arts Club and forced into the whole thing.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you should do it, Nii-san. Remember that you were the one who told me that I can join the dance club too. Why can’t you do the same?” Tobi said, suddenly bringing out something from the past.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. I think Tatsuya-san would look good too.” Sae-chan said. “Don’t you think so, Sun-senpai?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… ah, yes.” The girl nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>She had started walking home with us since the start of the school year. Her reason was that she didn’t know other people… and it was a decent reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Sae-chan and Tobi being the helpful kind they were, welcomed her gladly.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have any excuse to deny either. There was no reason I could leave her alone with Sae and Tobi.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Grandma also said that it was a very pretty dance. Please do it, Nii-san. I did it before too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh… alright alright. It’s not like I can back out now. Everyone has already started working on the art already.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can prepare the costume for the dance if you want.” Sae-chan offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“No it’s fine, Sae-chan. I have a spare piece. I’ll use that.” The cost of the costume in the System was cheap. “Also, I will be using Yoriichi’s costume instead of Tanjiro’s.”</p><p><br></p><p>A good thing that I would be getting a mask to perform.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Koji Yoshida -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Really! But wasn’t it going to take six more months?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They have some new kind of technology which they used for this. The project will be ready to air in a month and a half. They have requested us to check it out and see if we want to make any changes since they have extra time on hand. The owner of the company has actually asked for a meeting with you and Kishibe-sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A meeting?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I think they might be trying to get him to serialise Naruto in their studio too. That series is picking up readers everywhere. I suggest that you talk to the owner first and then bring them to visit him. I have already mentioned that he wants to keep his identity a secret. They agreed to it.” </p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Chief. I will get it done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. By the way, how many chapters are left for Kimetsu no Yaiba?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Around fifty more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… a year more then? Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>They talked about a few more details and Koji left the office.</p><p><br></p><p>It was big news. Tatsuya would be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Drawn to Power’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tatsuya is stuck in an amusing situation right now and Nurarihyon is having fun.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>He has started publishing another of his manga under another pen name.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As said earlier, I am going to focus a bit on the manga part and the slice of life aspect of things for a chapter or two.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Then we go to the fighting part of the plot.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

How was your internship?” He asked, looking up from his paperwork.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was fine. I wanted to take a few days off if possible. I have something urgent coming up which needs attending to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, something I can help with?” He asked, worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Not really. Can you reschedule my classes to a later date?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will get that done. By the way, when do you want to start teaching other subjects?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought for a while. “Other subjects are those which already exist and I am not yet good enough to teach them. I will need some time to master them myself. I don’t want to give subpar lectures.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Neither do I son, Neither do I. Very well, take your time. I will reschedule the classes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I left the office and went directly to my room.</p><p><br></p><p>Matsu was studying with Kuroka sitting beside her and watching what she was doing with curiosity. On the side, Lavy was playing with Akeno and Shirone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei!”</p><p><br></p><p>The girls all greeted me as they got up from their places and rushed to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“How are you all?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t slack off while I was gone, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No.” They answered in a chous, their expressions looking as if they wanted my praise. Their behaviour brought a smile to my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very good. I knew you were all good girls that’s why… I brought gifts for everyone.” I brought out a small suitcase from my pocket and enlarged it before opening it and revealing the gifts for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enchanted dress for Lavy and Akeno. Latest laptop and mobile made in the Underworld for Matsu.” I handed them their gifts and looked at Shirone who was looking at the gifts with starry eyes. Seriously, this girl was too adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her and brought out a large box. “A box of the best sweets from the Underworld for Shirone and a book on Youjutsu for Kuroka.” I passed the gifts to the two girls, looking at the brightened expression on the younger one.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you nyaa~” She thanked, her tail moving happily.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was more subdued but thanked me too.</p><p><br></p><p>They all showed off their gifts to each other while Matsu was already exploring everything she could in the Devil network.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I am a bit tired. Have you girls eaten yet? I am starving.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okaa-sama is cooking. I will go and tell her that you are back.” Akeno got up and quickly ran to where Shuri was to inform her of my return.</p><p><br></p><p>She returned just a minute later.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what did you girls do while I was gone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I learned a new magic spell.” Lavy replied excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me too. I learned how to change a matchstick into a needle.” Akeno replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Awesome.” I pulled them into a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I learned how to do addition nyaa.” Shirone added expectantly, her ears twitching.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s great, Shirone. Who taught you?” I said, patting her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matsu nee-chan and C nee-chan did.” She answered excitedly, the swaying of her tail giving away her emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl who was swooning over the bundle of cuteness.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm… they didn’t know how to read and write so Shuri-san and I are teaching them and C.C was feeling alone so we invited her here to play.” Matsu replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s good. Learning how to read and write is very important. Good work. By the way Matsu, can I speak to you privately for a while?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Okay.” She nodded and we went to her room.</p><p><br></p><p>I snapped a finger and set up a barrier out of caution before looking at her. “I will be going somewhere for a while. I want you to use the Summoning Contracts to keep summoning me every hour and keep a check on me until I tell you otherwise. You don’t need to get worried if I don’t reply. I could be busy. Can you do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you going to… other worlds?” She asked, understanding the situation and I nodded. “Is that place dangerous?”</p><p><br></p><p>Dangerous?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes… it made DxD look tame in comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>My silence was good enough for her and she nodded. “Okay. I will do that. Just… don’t get in any danger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I will leave tomorrow morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked worried so I went ahead and gave her a hug. “Don’t worry, I am strong. I will be fine.” Her face lit up just from that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. My Ashikabi is the strongest.” She hugged me back.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the room when Matsu had all the hugging time she wanted and joined the others for food.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere at the dining table, the scene of everyone laughing and talking, having fun… it was healing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, will you be going out for work again, sensei?” Akeno asked when I told everyone about my next trip.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Got some urgent work.” I nodded casually.</p><p><br></p><p>“When will you be back?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Three days more or less but not more than a week.</p><p><br></p><p>I spent the rest of the day with them, teaching them new things or just playing with them and went to bed with Matsu and Lavy at night.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka and Shirone actually went to C.C because they liked her and thought she would be alone back there.</p><p><br></p><p>I laid on my bed with Lavy and Matsu on either side of me and after two days, I got a peaceful sleep. Back in the Underworld, I had stayed awake all the time because I was tense.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess sleeping at home <em>is</em> different.</p><p><br></p><p>I was awakened from my sleep late at night by a summoning call.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking around me, I saw Lavy snuggled to my side and Matsu on the other side, both sleeping peacefully.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up carefully but even then Matsu was awakened from her sleep and looked at me. It took her a moment to realise what was happening and she got up too.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, pulling the blanket on Lavy, I went to Matsu’s room which was attached to ours.</p><p><br></p><p>“Return safely.” She wished as she gave me one more hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.” I replied before opening a hole in space.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough on the other side was Kilth, waving at me.</p><p><br>“Good day, friend. Your sorcery always surprises me. And who’s the lady?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s…”</p><p><br>“I am his wife.” Matsu answered enthusiastically.</p><p><br>“She’s… well… yeah.” I nodded after seeing the look on her face. The words cheered her up.</p><p><br>“Wife? My word. You looked a tad bit young to be married but who am I to know what goes on in distant lands. Greetings my Lady. I am called Kilth Copper-bearer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello.” Matsu waved. “Please take care of him.”</p><p><br>“Obviously. Ace is a friend of mine.”</p><p><br>I smiled at his words and bid Matsu goodbye before jumping into the hole and landing near Kilth’s side. Looking back, I waved at Matsu again. “Remember what I told you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>With that I closed the hole and looked around.</p><p><br></p><p>The air… felt so fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are we, friend?”</p><p><br>“A bit away from Windhelm. You can see the place if you look over that ledge.” He pointed in the direction.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked over the edge and sure enough there was a town in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s not waste any time, friend. Time is money and what kind of businessman would I be if I wasted money?” I smiled and the man laughed at my joke.</p><p><br></p><p>“A terrible kind, I’d guess?”</p><p><br>“And your guess wouldn’t be wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then let’s go. I can’t let my friend be made fun of.” He started walking towards the place and I followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>The journey didn’t take us long. While it could have taken us shorter had I flown there or used Shambala to teleport there, I didn’t want to do anything to let anyone know I was an outsider.</p><p><br></p><p>Kilth had found the White Phial shop and directly led me there.</p><p><br></p><p>I offered him a bottle of alcohol and asked him to wait until I talked to Nurelion. He agreed. The guy was quite an honest fellow.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the shop were two figures.</p><p><br></p><p>The younger one greeted me as soon as I entered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome. We have a fresh batch of ingredients delivered today. All of the finest quality. What would you like to buy?”</p><p><br>I asked him about what he had and if he accepted payment in Gold. The man looked like he would argue but a slight bit of mind magic made things easier.</p><p><br></p><p>They had a fresh stock of many things, even dozens of books on Alchemy, possession of Nurelion.</p><p><br></p><p>I bought everything and then turned my attention to the old man. He looked ill and was sitting in a corner.</p><p><br></p><p>“This shop is named the White Phial. Could it be from the legend?” I asked.</p><p><br>“Oh! You know of the legend?” The man asked excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>With his excitement with a gentle push from Mind Magic got me the potion which was needed to open the Forsaken Crypt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. Here is something from me which should help you out.” I took out one of the rings with Aqua’s spells and used it on the old man, curing him of his disease.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, we are even.</p><p><br></p><p>With that, I left the shop directly to find Kilth.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to stay in this world any more than necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get what you wanted, friend?” He asked, taking a sip from the bottle I had offered him.</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit. Still need a few things. Could you show me around the place? I need to go to the marketplace first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. It’s just round the corner.”</p><p><br></p><p>We walked around the place and I was led to the stores by Kilth.</p><p><br></p><p>I directly paid in gold and bought all the things in the stores with the use of mind magic. Potions, Spell Tomes, ingredients, Apparels, Weapons, Books, anything…</p><p><br></p><p>This was a real world unlike the games so they had far more items in real life than they had in the games. In fact the items were of a higher level than sold in the game too which was an unexpected profit.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when I entered the last shop that I encountered someone interesting there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Only 200 for all these books? These are the finest books on Magic you can find in Windhelm. These could fetch me thousands in other cities.” An old man was shouting at the shopkeeper who looked bored.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then go and sell it in other cities. This is Windhelm. These gibberish on magic won’t sell here.” The shopkeeper commented quite rudely.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah yes. The Nords and their mistrust of anything magical.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me.” I called out, making the two men look at me and I addressed the older man. “Are you selling any tomes on Magic perhaps?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aye… unfortunately the fools in this city don’t appreciate the books which uncover the mystery of the world.”</p><p><br>“Oh. If you don’t mind, I would like to check them out. I am something of a fledgling mage myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Sorcerer, are ye?” He asked, looking suspicious so I raised a hand and a blade of ice was created in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s eyes lit up. “Ah, a Sorcerer. How rare in these parts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am travelling to find books to increase my knowledge as well as spread the subjects all over the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a noble thing you are doing, boy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. By the way, I just heard that you were planning to sell some books. Are those Spell Tomes or books on magic. If so then could I buy them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you want to buy my books? Sure, I’d feel much better selling these to someone who cares instead of those who think of these as useless junk. Come, come with me. I will show you my wares.”</p><p><br></p><p>We followed the man to the Palace of the Kings.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that the man was the Court Mage of Windhelm, Wuunferth, the Unliving.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, I don’t understand this. If you are the Court Mage of Windhelm, then why do you have to sell your books to get money? Can’t you get sponsorship from the Jarl?” I asked, confused.</p><p><br>“Tch… as if these people would ever understand the importance of magic. Researching magic takes a lot of money. The sponsorship I get is nothing compared to it. Just a drop in the ocean. If it hadn’t been for my research, do you think I would ever resort to selling my books to that oaf?”</p><p><br></p><p>Man… money mattered everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I would be interested in buying whatever you have. You don’t need to worry. Money will never be an issue. In fact, I can also trade knowledge of different types of magic from far off lands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. New magic. Can you show me something?” He asked, intrigued.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and looked around. There was a broken lamp on the side. I pointed a finger at that and snapped a finger, casting Reparo.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, the lamp was repaired instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of magic is that?” He asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a Spell called Reparo. It’s a completely different form of magic than what people use here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A completely different form of magic… sigh… no. I need to continue my research. Let’s get to those books first.”</p><p><br></p><p>He told Kilth to wait outside and led me inside his room.</p><p><br></p><p>The room had several dozen books, mostly magic tomes.</p><p><br></p><p>He mainly worked with Destruction Magic and had books up to the Master level in Destruction Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, Destruction Magic was the one I was least interested in. Other magic spells were or lower level but were still there.</p><p><br></p><p>I did the same as I had done with others and got everything from him for gold.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was happy to sell everything even without using Mind Magic. He even promised that he would contact me when he gets any new books.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed though I would probably just ask Kilth to summon me near the College of Winterhold. I was very interested in Alteration, Enchantment and Restoration Magic. I even bought the Arcane Enchanter from the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the Palace of the Kings and went back to the shop where I had encountered Wuunferth and emptied that too.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the day, I had several dozen books and stacks of potions. In fact, I had almost twenty five Spell Tomes too, all dumped in my trunk. Too bad I didn’t know any enchanters here or I would have commissioned them to Enchant some useful effects on some of the robes I had.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I will have to commission Kilth to do that for me later on. Some Resist Magic would always be welcome for the clothes I wear. Another useful thing I got was a World Map.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad I didn’t have time or I would have loved to go around. I am on a tight schedule and there are a couple of things I need to do.</p><p><br>Done with everything, we got into an Inn and got a room for the night. During this I took some time to talk with Matsu who had been summoning me every hour as instructed.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything taken care of, the two of us left towards the Forsaken Cave.</p><p><br></p><p>The journey itself was easy. There weren’t many people outside in the snow covered mountains, especially in these areas.</p><p><br></p><p>“You sure you don’t want a coat, friend?” Kith asked, looking at me who was walking in just my Mage robes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. This much cold is nothing for me.” In fact, I felt right at home in this kind of environment. My senses felt sharper, as if I could feel every movement in the ice.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster from whose blood the Demon God’s Extract was made also lived in a similar environment, in the Northern parts of the Empire, a place Esdeath was from.</p><p><br></p><p>When the cave was in front of us, Kith drew his sword.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be careful, friend. These caves look dangerous.” He warned as he took a lead.</p><p><br></p><p>I followed behind him, carefully looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>Very soon we saw what seemed like walking dead.</p><p><br></p><p>The monsters discovered us and raced towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>Kilth was about to go forward when I placed a hand on his shoulder. “Let me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But…”</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to speak when I snapped my finger and the undead were completely encased in ice.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was taken aback and looked at me in surprise so I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t be the best businessman in the world if any random person could come in and rob my shop, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked dumbfounded at my explanation but then started to laugh.</p><p><br>“Well said. Then let’s go and finish your task.”</p><p><br></p><p>And we did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>The undead were… quite disappointing.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight with Curalmil wasn’t that hard either. He was frozen solid and then shattered into pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>The door to the Forsaken Crypt was opened by pouring Nurelion’s potion into the basin. I entered the room and collected everything there.</p><p><br></p><p>On the platform was the White Phial.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the bottle carefully and it had a crack.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>It was really cracked.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something I was hoping to avoid.</p><p><br>Do I really have to do the entire repairing the phial quest?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I remembered something and brought out my Elder Wand.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered that the Elder Wand could fix other wands. Could it work on other magical items like the White Phial?</p><p><br></p><p>Please work… please, just this time… work here.</p><p><br></p><p>“Reparo.”</p><p><br></p><p>I waved the wand and suddenly felt a massive amount of my power drained from my body. The crack on the bottle however… it disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Did it work?</p><p><br></p><p>With my heart beating wildly in my chest, I took out a Lesser Healing Potion and poured in a few drops into the Phial and waited.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost five minutes later, I observed that the level of potion had increased slightly. Around fifteen minutes later, the level of potion increases even more.</p><p><br></p><p>It worked.</p><p><br></p><p>This… actually worked.</p><p><br></p><p>The Reparo spell worked only when the broken parts of the items were nearby and if there was a place where the broken parts of the White Phial could be, it would be here. It was for this reason I had taken this bet… and it worked.</p><p><br></p><p>I stored the Phial back into my magic trunk along with the Potions Table quickly and walked out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you succeed, friend?” Kilth asked as I came out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I got what I needed. Let’s go, have a party.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha let’s do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>While walking back to Windhelm, I asked him about a few things and even gave him some quests to collect specific items for me as well as summoning me when he went to specific places.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave him a dozen sets of clothes I had bought from the Underworld to enchant.</p><p><br></p><p>The effects I wanted were Resist Magic, Fortify Magicka, Fortify Magicka Regen, Fortify Stamina, Fortify Stamina Regen, Fortify Alchemy as well as fortifying different types of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>In return I gave him several weapons and different alcohols from earth and the Underworld to enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally around midnight, I accepted Matsu’s summoning and left.</p><p><br></p><p>“Safe journey, friend.” He waved happily at me as I went through the portal back to my world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, friend. Remember to summon me when you find anything I told you about or anything interesting either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Farewell then.”</p><p><br></p><p>I waved back before closing the portal back. Only then did I let out a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>That world… I would love to keep as much distance as I can keep from that world.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that the Phial… it was too good to let go.</p><p><br></p><p>Matsu sat down beside me. “Did you succeed?” She asked, breaking the silence in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… yes, I did. Hahahaha I can’t believe that worked.” I finally came to terms with the whole thing and couldn’t help but laugh loudly. I pulled her into a hug and she happily complied. “It worked.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, what worked though? You didn’t tell me what you were going to do there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… yes. I need to experiment. Where is Lavy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She has classes and will be returning after two hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Then come in. I will show you what I got there.” I expanded my trunk and walked in. She followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>With a simple flick of my wand, the things which I had just dumped back in Skyrim, all got arranged properly on the shelves.</p><p><br></p><p>In the middle, on a stand rested the White Phial.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and checked the potion inside and it had indeed refilled.</p><p><br></p><p>The checks showed that the quality of the potion was not compromised either.</p><p><br></p><p>With the types of potions I had now, I could totally open a new business. It’s just that the Phenex House would jump on me like rabid dogs if they feel their business is threatened and I am in no position to confront the richest house in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I am totally going to order a vial of Phenex Tears through Mephisto and check if it can produce more of it or not.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the potions, they could be used in the Empire or even Lelouch could buy them off of me.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another thing I could do… I emptied the Phial and used a spell to clean it. Then I brought another thing which had been kept in another corner of the room… the leftover Demon God’s Extract I had saved for my personal research.</p><p><br></p><p>Very carefully I poured a drop of it inside the Phial and then left the Phial back on the counter.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see if this can really produce every liquid.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember that the reason Esdeath’s Ice powers were so exaggerated were because she drank all of the Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, we need to remember that there had been several other people who had drank from the jar before and that there was supposed to be more blood in it originally.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Nurelion, not only could the White Phial produce more of the liquid, it could even purify and amplify the effects to some extent in some legends. That part needed to be checked too.</p><p><br></p><p>If that was true then I could only wonder what it would do to the Demon God’s extract or even the Phenex Tears for that matter.</p><p><br></p><p>So many things to experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the Spell Tomes and found some which I was interested in.</p><p><br></p><p>Ironskin, Ebonyskin, Soul Trap, Grand Healing, Healing hands and Close Wounds. The best collection was of Destruction Spells, something I wasn’t too excited about. I could however learn the Ice and Lightning Spells for Lavy and Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing I was looking forward to was the collection of books I had received from Nurelion.</p><p><br></p><p>There were over a hundred books on Alchemy.</p><p><br></p><p>I even got some weapons from Kilth which he was not using, one of them being</p><p><br></p><p>I stayed there and told Matsu about the adventure I just went on.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what did you get for me?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the things I wanted for you all are not here yet so I asked Kilth to commission them for me. They will be here in a month or so.” I wanted to give her some  jewellery to help with her Magic studies.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahh… too bad. Then…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how about a hug… you know, to make up for the delay in gifting.” She asked, looking shy at the request.</p><p><br>…this girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Well she did help me a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been working for eighteen hours straight to summon me every hour.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come here.” I pulled her into a hug and she happily jumped into my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked out of the trunk and sat in the room where she was getting her fill of Ace-energy, her words not mine.</p><p><br></p><p>I set things up and opened the portal and on the other side was a familiar face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well hello, Lucius. You are… earlier than expected.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked like someone had killed his puppy… no, that’s not right. He would probably get off on something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>No. He looked like he just found out that his mother was a muggleborn.</p><p><br></p><p>But enough of teasing him for these.</p><p><br></p><p>I had much better things to do.</p><p><br></p><p>“I take it that you are here to make the payment?” I asked and he nodded Picking up a trunk with great difficulty and passing it over to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the trunk and checked. It was a trunk similar to the one I had right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll be back in a moment. Need to check everything inside.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, I entered the trunk. There were mountains of galleons inside. Literally mountains of gold. There were also twenty creatures hurdled in the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>The house elves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did Lucius buy you all?” I asked, trying not to freak them out.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you bees the new master?” She… asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You can call me Ace. Do you have a name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I bees called Minny.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Minny then. Would you all have a contract with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The ears of the group perked up. “Master Ace bees wanting us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I would love to have you around. In fact, I have a lot of work I need help with and you all will be saving me a lot of trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several of them cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, we want to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then let’s make a contract.” The process was fairly easy.</p><p><br></p><p>After the contract, I told them to wait there while I took care of the deal. Before leaving I did confirm the amount.</p><p><br></p><p>Two million Galleons… not one galleon less as well as the books I had asked for.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside, Lucius was waiting nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems that you have kept your side of the deal.” I closed my eyes and snapped a finger. “There, all done. Go on. Tom Marvolo Riddle will never darken the steps of your world anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me, still pale… well paler but nodded lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great! I really like people like you, people who know how to make proper deals. Summon me if you ever want to make any more deals. Money, information, power… as long as the price is right, I’ll be there for your service.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be all.” He replied curtly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my. You hurt me, Lucius. I thought we were friends. We are, aren’t we?” I asked, narrowing my eyes slightly and saw him shiver. “Hahahaha no need to be scared. I have no intention of harming someone for mere words. Too much work, ya know. I am a lazy fellow after all. Alright, if you don’t want a deal, then so be it. Good bye.”</p><p><br></p><p>I closed the portal once more</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I did that, Matsu walked from behind the door and jumped at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was so cool! You were totally badass there, Ace. Like someone right out of those movies…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I was, wasn’t I? Now come on, I will show you something.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took her hand and took her inside the trunk and showed her the mountains of gold I had just earned for… doing nothing… The elves also needed to be assigned.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I obviously couldn't keep all of them. That would be too much to explain. One or two can be explained by an accident during an experiment but all… nope.</p><p><br></p><p>I had, however, already thought of what to do with them.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s it for today.” I completed the last Class for today. “Any questions?”</p><p><br></p><p>Some questions came up and I addressed them before the class ended.</p><p><br></p><p>I went directly back to Mephisto’s office from there.</p><p><br></p><p>A month has passed since my trip to Skyrim.</p><p><br></p><p>My schedule has become even more hectic.</p><p><br></p><p>Learning from Dumbledore obviously was a daily thing. I was progressing well.</p><p><br></p><p>It was learning the spells from Skyrim that was hard…quite hard… but it was worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially the Healing Magic which was extremely rare in Devils. The only form of healing Devils had was healing through passing Demonic Power to other devils through skin contact. This method however could be used normally, mostly only used by partners and even then it was quite slow to use.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously there were Phenex Tears but damn if those things weren’t costly.</p><p><br></p><p>Fifty million for one… no wonder the Phenex House were raking in money with their monopoly.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately I had the money to purchase one vial and Mephisto had the connections to order one for me.</p><p><br></p><p>The Phial had actually produced even the Demon God Extract and just like that so many avenues opened up.</p><p><br></p><p>I had produced several vials of Felix Felicis and several other liquids and observed some things about the White Phial in doing so. First, the Phial did indeed purify and amplify the effects of a substance. Not without limit, just to some extent.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, the stronger the substance, the longer it took to replenish. A Potion of Healing had taken an hour while a Draught of Healing had taken an hour and half.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon God’s Extract had taken three days to fill up. I had used these past weeks to fill up the entire Jar with the extract again. I plan to drink more and see if I can increase my power further. The extract was purified and amplified after all.</p><p><br></p><p>There were so many things I could do with it. Even in this world, there were so many things which could be produced.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember the blood of Dragons being able to grant power. The Blood of Fafnir was able to grant supernatural abilities to Seigfried, which was inherited by the kids with Siegfried DNA. Was it unique to Fafnir or could I get blood from other Dragon Kings and Heavenly Dragons too? I remember Issei’s blood allowing Gasper to control his powers.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also Amrita which could grant enormous power to anyone who ingests it but I doubt Indra would bestow some on me. As for the blood of the Dragons… I will have to find a way to get those…</p><p><br></p><p>I entered Mephisto’s office to find the man actually chilling in his office. There was another surprising guest inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace, come in. Have a seat.” He pointed towards the empty chair in front of him. The other chair was occupied by a dragon stuffed toy… or rather Tannin who had transformed into that form to enter his office.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave the dragon a nod.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wanted to ask if I could borrow a place for some practice. Me going all out will destroy the area we have here.”<br><br></p><p>“Ah… that won’t be a problem. In fact, if it’s just training, Tannin can help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What training are we talking about?” The former dragon king asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just want to fight so that I can learn how to use my new magic in combat.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>And that was exactly what I wanted to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I had realised that my progress had been stagnating a bit due to the lack of combat. I still remembered the demonic beast from my first hunt and how I had frozen. Now, although not in a situation like that, I still needed a place to train my combat skills.</p><p><br></p><p>While learning new magic was helping out a lot, needing to use them during combat was the real thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not a problem at all. In fact, I haven’t stretched my muscles for so long. I wouldn’t mind getting some light exercise. Even my peerage members could go for a light spar.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something the matter?” Tannin asked, sensing my hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I don’t want many people to know of my skills so can you just keep it between the two of us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, still being secretive huh? Alright, I don’t mind.” The dragon shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great!” Mephisto clapped happily. “Just curious. What kind of magic have you been working on?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. I guess I did owe him for this favour. “I have been working on a new magic. Perhaps a demonstration will be more apt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Go on. Do you need a bigger space for it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, not really.” I said as I pulled up the sleeves of my robes.</p><p><br></p><p>I put forward my arm and created an ice scalpel before making a cut on my arm.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I used the spell I had learned recently.</p><p><br></p><p>“Healing.”</p><p><br></p><p>A golden-white light flashed around my hand and slowly my wound closed up. As expected, Demonic Power isn’t really suitable for healing. The power of the spell is far lower than what is mentioned in the tomes. Thankfully, I had a lot of raw power.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up at the old devil who was gawking at my hand. He got up and took a hold of my hand and checked my hand once more and then looked at me.</p><p><br>“How did you do it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just something I have been working on recently. I still need time to work on higher level spells. It’s the most basic one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That doesn’t matter. No wait, hold on. Do you even know what you just did?” He asked, once more checking my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“I used healing magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that shouldn’t be possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet it is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Healing Magic is very rare. I have seen some rare Angels being able to use it. Some youkai can also heal through Senjutsu but that’s a different thing altogether. Devils… we don’t have any such thing. We use our wounds to close wounds, stop bleeding and the rest is done by medicines and demonic power’s natural healing effect. It cannot be used… like this. It’s why people who specialise in healing or have healing type Sacred Gears are valued so highly.” Tannin said. </p><p><br></p><p>“Really? I thought the Sitri could do this too.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man rolled his eyes. “Just because they own hospitals doesn’t mean they can use Healing Magic. They mostly hire people of other races or use highly advanced medicines and technology to cure their patients. You should take some time to read more about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, I see.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually hold on. Try it on me.” Tannin suddenly said, making me do a takeback.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the dragon. “I am not sure if the spell will be strong enough. It’s just a basic spell and you have incredible magic resistance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter. Try it. It would just be a scratch.” He said as he cut a part of his tail. Blood flowed and I quickly conjured a bowl below his tail to collect the blood and used Healing.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, his body was resisting the magic but I pushed through and the wound did close slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Marvellous.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As I said, it’s just the basics. I can’t use it to heal large wounds as of now. It will take more time to develop those.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then take it. Take as much time as you want. If you want, we can reduce the number of classes as long as you can fully create this magic, it doesn’t matter.” Mephisto replied.</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback by the seriousness of the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“It won’t be done any sooner even if you hurry me. This kind of thing… It takes time. Even this spell… it’s very inefficient. Had I taught this to a human or other races, they could have done it much more efficiently. I am still working on these matters.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So take your time. I am not telling you to hurry up, just to concentrate all your efforts on this. You have no idea how much of a revolutionary idea your magic can be for the entire Devil race. You could start an entirely new industry rivalling the Sitri and if you decide to share it with others, the achievement would be worthy of gaining a High Class Devil ranking, maybe even an Ultimate Class. Now… do you understand the gold mine you are standing on?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… see.” I found myself stunned at his words. “Ultimate Class? Are you sure?” I asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Depending on the effectiveness of the spells it is very possible. In fact, should you be a High Class and then reveal it, there is a very good probability that you can gain the position. I will make sure you do.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimate Class Devil… the position came with several perks which other High Class Devils cannot get.</p><p><br></p><p>First would be a territory, a large territory of several cities under their rule to do with as you pleased.</p><p><br></p><p>Second would be access. They can access most of the facilities of the Underworld. Things even High Class Devils can only watch from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Third, all descendants of Ultimate Class Devils would start from High Class. They wouldn’t have to climb the stairs one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>It truly certified one as one of the top dogs of the Devil race, just below the Satans. Among the thirty four houses, there were twenty three who didn’t have any Devil at that rank… at least not rank wise.</p><p><br></p><p>At this position, not even the other Pillar Houses can touch one carelessly.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and thought for a while. “We shouldn’t think about distant things. It will happen in time. What about the training grounds?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You want a training ground where no one can spy on you, right?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Done. I will arrange for it. Tannin can take care of your training.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a schedule and I got up to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I remembered something and picked up the bowl with Tannin’s blood. ”Can I take this?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Blood?” The dragon asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. The blood of a high level dragon… I can think of so many uses for this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha alright, suit yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that reminds me, your order of Phenex Tears is here.” Mephisto said, suddenly remembering something. He opened his drawer and passed me a vial. “Don’t worry about the payment. I can deduct it from your pay.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the vial containing a colourless liquid inside and kept it in my pocket and thanked him before leaving the room.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Saelena Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find anything there?”</p><p><br></p><p>The information they had extracted from Abigory Tishmah led them to uncover a plot by the Nebiros House.</p><p><br></p><p>Abigory was not one of the core members and even this information was flimsy at best but it was their own chance to find more. Over the past month, they had done just that and the information they found was… strange at best.</p><p><br></p><p>Nebiros House was searching for some Super Weapons left by the original Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, she didn’t believe the information. It sounded like some fairy tale made up by some people who couldn’t accept the results of the Civil War. If they really had any Super Weapons, they would have obviously used them in the Great War but there was no clue of any such thing ever being used.</p><p><br></p><p>There were, however, clues of live experiments done on other devils. One of them being used by Enakal Beelzebub who had turned into that giant miasma spreading bee with power beyond Serafall. Even she had to use her True Form to deal with him back then.</p><p><br></p><p>If they were indeed doing such experiments, then they couldn’t afford to overlook it.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. The lab was already destroyed by the time we got there. It looked like it was done recently. From what little we could find, it seemed as if they were doing some experiments on people of different races including other devils but that was not complete information. Just the bits we had managed to save.” McGregor reported. “Maybe they were finding some kind of way to increase the power of devils. Unfortunately we couldn’t find anything which could connect other people with the whole research.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They must have figured that their spy got caught and moved away after cleaning up the evidence.” Falbium suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, could be. Do we have any other leads?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. The ones we know of cannot be touched directly without any substantial proof. We can at best call some of them for temporary investigations on the words of a traitor. Even the labs were not discovered in their territories.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think they will open their mouths and then it will be our turn to answer questions. They are already angry about the whole Recommendation Games. We can only go forward if we have something substantial on them.” Falbium added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why don’t you use the same method you used to extract information from them?” Serafall suggested and they looked at Ajuka. “Can’t you figure out how to make those portraits?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, not really. The spell he cast on it was completely original. I have no idea what that was. Not to mention the runes on it were completely new. I tried to study them out of curiosity but the boy had enchanted it with a self destruction sequence so that if anyone tried to unravel them, the entire thing would be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh… the kid got one on you, did he?” Sera smirked, getting no reaction from Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not very trusting, that kid, is he?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cautious would be a better word.” Ajuka replied and she could sense a reluctant respect in his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, with the life he was living, he would be dead if he didn’t have at least this much cautiousness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Didn’t he try to bait you into a trade? Why don’t you ask him what he wants for the knowledge of the Portraits or just hire him to make a couple more paintings?” Falbium suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s check the other targets first. I will see what I can do.” Ajuka replied and none of them prodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“The spell was indeed very unique. Ace has a very unique approach towards magic.” I would love to sit down with him and discuss magic.” Mcgregor praised.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can go and pick him up this week in that case.” Ajuka said. “I would have asked Grayfia but if you are going there then I’d rather not disturb her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that won’t be a problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, Rudiger Rosenkreutz has made a request to meet Azazel in regards to his son’s situation. He thinks that Azazel might be able to help him since he is the foremost researcher of Sacred Gears in the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Yes, he came to me too. I will bring it up with Azazel but that guy would probably ask for some favours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it. The man has been worrying himself sick over his son’s health. It would be good to help the man out.” She said and Sera nodded in agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>They discussed some more things before the meeting ended.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving, she suddenly remembered something and looked at McGregor. “You will be the one going to pick Ace up this week, correct?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I was thinking about visiting Grauzaberer to attend one of his classes. I have read the book on Transfiguration and I want to attend the classes personally to see how things work more closely.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, bring Rias with you. See if she likes the classes there. She has been down lately. Maybe it would cheer her up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my Lady.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe meeting Ace could help her regain some confidence in herself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I sat in my lab, the portal open in front of me as the former generals reported the progress made by the ‘Ace in the Hole’ group in the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at the files while asking. “How is the process of contracting the people from Wakoku?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The current continent is divided into twenty two nations and is undergoing a fierce war with each other. We discovered that while the nations might be a bit behind the Empire in some technologies, their blacksmithing skills are very good. They use weapons similar to the Teigu and Shingu and the technology to make them is actually widespread. We can commission them to make weapons but we would have to provide them with the Danger Beast materials to make them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, what about sending their people to the Empire to make something here?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be difficult, not to mention costly. It just isn’t viable unless we have the raw materials from Special Class or Super Class Danger Beasts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” I thought of something. “Very well. Send envoys to all twenty two nations. Enquire who among them are the best in making Teigu like the Demon God’s Extract which uses the Blood of Super Class Danger Beasts. Talk to the ruler of that nation and offer them an alliance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The alliance will obviously not be from the Empire but rather from our group. As for what we can offer.” I summoned a crate of a dozen healing potions and stamina potions and passed it to her. “These potions can completely heal a person from injuries in moments. The other one can help recover stamina immediately. You said they were in a war. I think they would appreciate these. If they can send their blacksmiths to work for Ace in the Hole and successfully craft the Teigu I desire, I will  sell them the advanced versions of these as well as many other potions.”</p><p><br></p><p>Najendra looked at the potions with wide eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I haven’t forgotten about you all either.” I passed them five crates containing the same potions as well as a piece of paper. “The paper contains the effects of the potions. Use the Elixir of Glibness when you talk to the kings of the other nations and the Elixir of Haggling before deciding the prices.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know how those worked in other worlds but it never hurt to try.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How is the training of the members going on?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. The young ones are showing a lot of promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are the top five in the list?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The first would be Esdeath Patras. Second and third would be Najasho and Akame, the best among the kids trained by Gozuki. Fourth and fifth are actually people whom you told us about. We searched the capital and found the two girls. Leone and Sheele. Both of them are extremely talented and natural fighters. They have taken extremely well to the training and are progressing at an incredible pace.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the thing I asked about?”</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked them to make sure they were taught to tone down their bloodthirsty nature. Many of the people of this world, especially Esdeath had turned extremely sadistic. While a part of it might have been due to the influence of the Demon God’s Extract, some of it had come from her and her upbringing too. Right now, she is being carefully taught so that such a thing never happens. I appreciated the fighting skills and loyalty of the manga Esdeath Patras… not her sadistic and bloodthirsty nature.</p><p><br></p><p>She paused for a moment but nodded. “It’s being taken care of.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Make sure that’s your first priority when recruiting anyone. We are training protectors for the Empire, not cold blooded killers who cannot think about anything except killing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how is the cleaning of rebels going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are almost finished with the cleaning. The… help you sent was a great help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am glad. Those little guys are always in search of work. Treat them well and remember to praise them occasionally.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had actually sent the House Elves to assist them.</p><p><br></p><p>I had kept Minny with me and given one to the Young Emperor on his birthday. The guy needed someone loyal and friendly to him who would always help him out and who was better than some house elves. The kid was happy, extremely happy by the present. He said it was the best birthday present ever.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest were given to the Ace in the Hole group.</p><p><br></p><p>House Elves were… extremely useful.</p><p><br></p><p>I am kinda surprised how the Wizards treated them so badly.</p><p><br></p><p>Those creatures could have ended all life in the Wizarding world should they go rogue. But then again, it was perhaps exactly because of this that the Wizards had put them under such heavy restrictions. Thankfully, it’s not in their nature to do such things. They were quite adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>House Elves were able to teleport others anywhere in the Empire as well as spy on people. Their magic could also protect anyone easily. These skills were highly valuable as spies. My subordinates had suddenly gained eighteen super powered spies to help them and the result was a one sided routing of the rebels.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing which the Elves being there allowed me to do was open a portal to that world. I can use my connection to the Elves, who carry some of my magic to open a portal to that world whenever I want.</p><p><br></p><p>This meant that as long as Minny was alive, I could open a portal to the DxD world whenever I liked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and one last thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t overwork yourself. You are after all an essential part of the team.” I smiled, taking the woman by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh…”</p><p><br></p><p>I left her like that and closed the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>The Empire was doing fine for now and I had a class to teach.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ace in the Hole’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Several things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ace went to Skyrim and got himself a pretty nifty artifact.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lucius got scammed.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ajuka is pouting.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mephisto is having the time of his life.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ace got a training partner.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Young Emperor had the best birthday present ever.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see what experiments Ace does and what deals he makes in the future.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

It was quite similar to the Knight Quest but had added components as in he had to take a theory exam.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this game had an extensive theory for magic.</p><p><br></p><p>The most surprising part about it was that… all these magic theories… they were real. As in they were exactly what was taught outside in the human world.</p><p><br>Elaine identified this. She recognised some of the spells as things which she had studied in her time in the Golden Dawn. From there, Bina, Rose and Veena read the texts carefully and found that several other systems of magic were included in the texts too. Overall, it was a hybrid, more advanced system of magic which included several types of magic from the human world to create something completely new… which could… actually be used in the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>The implications of this… were frightening.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what in the world was the Game Master thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>Since this discovery, we had started to hoard every magic book we could find and make copies of them. We were even planning to explore as many magic classes as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Our team became stronger with Shiroe becoming the next T5 in the town. The Sorcerer had slightly higher power than Mage but its real power lay in field control.</p><p><br></p><p>To put it simply, even when I knew I would win against Shiroe in a fight… I would never fight him… because I will be half dead from annoyance by the time I win.</p><p><br></p><p>Sorcerers are annoying… if they were fighting against you.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s not true.</p><p><br></p><p>Normal Sorcerers are fine. They can be killed easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Skilled Sorcerers are annoying.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe… he could be mind numbingly frustrating to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why we were glad that he was on our side.</p><p><br></p><p>The quest to become a Sorcerer was hard too.</p><p><br></p><p>The magic theory exam was hard. Shiroe actually took classes from Elaine and Rose to pass the exam and even then there was a matter of luck involved.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, there was a chance that if he took the exam again, he would definitely fail. The fighting was divided into two parts. The first part was not that hard… at least for him.</p><p><br></p><p>He had to defeat four T4 Mages alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe had far more skills than an average Mage due to our Sabaody Trip and enough potions to help.</p><p><br></p><p>The next part of the quest was to hunt down… the Rhino…</p><p><br></p><p>There was however a problem with it too. The maximum size of the party could only be five members and the team would be restricted to T4. My level was locked to T4 and I couldn’t use the Man Slayer Class and its Skills during the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>That wasn’t the only bad thing either.</p><p><br></p><p>We had thought that the hole we had our guild members dug while we were going to Sabaody would be enough to take the monster down but as my luck would have it, the hole disappeared as soon as the Quest started so we had to do it the old way.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe obviously was far more prepared for the monster this time.</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie but it was the best performance from Shiroe I had seen so far.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had the potential to be one of the best magicians in the real world, Veena’s words, not mine.</p><p><br></p><p>The way he used the environment in the battle, with even the most basic spells to damage a foe which was more or less immune to magic or T4 Class… It was stunning to watch.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there was a time when the monster was about to use an attack in which it raised both front legs and stomped into the ground, creating a shockwave which could throw the enemies around as well as cause temporary stunning effects.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe used the moment it was raising the front legs to create an earth wall right under the hind legs, making the monster lose balance and fall on its side. Once it fell, we started bombarding it with our best attacks, using poisons and status effects on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe guessed that this Advancement Quest was a test to see if the Mage was qualified to become a Sorcerer. Sorcerers were someone who were masters of field control and that was the only way a team like ours could defeat that Rhino.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say, I pity anyone who tries to go for the Sorcerer Class next.</p><p><br></p><p>Having a Sorcerer on a team was absolutely amazing though. They could make the fights extremely easy.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, they had a spell called Shallow Bog which decreased the speed on anyone caught in it.</p><p><br></p><p>It made the ground soft and the monsters could get stuck in it, reducing their speed by almost 75% while they were there.</p><p><br></p><p>This Spell worked very well with Poisons which Veena sometimes used during fights.</p><p><br></p><p>“And how long would that take?” Star asked, while checking for the loot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Around half a month. Veena would probably get it in a week at best. The only reason she is even delayed is because she needed to level up both the Mage Class from level 1 while I had a seventeen level lead.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was also a Level 32 Pharmacist, something which she levelled up by making medicines alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The amount of experience we needed grew as we reached higher levels. With more members in the team, the amount of experience also became lower for each person. That said, the safety and speed of hunts increased.</p><p><br></p><p>Lives were the most important.</p><p><br></p><p>None of us wanted to lose ours because we were running ahead in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>I had however kept up my levelling speed despite being the highest level character here due to the experience bonuses.</p><p><br></p><p>“The next in line to get a T5 Class will be Star. Followed by Suikazura-san and Whistler. We can move to the next area then. By then things with the Guild will also be established.”</p><p><br></p><p>Coming to the Guild.</p><p><br></p><p>Fairy Tail was doing more than just good.</p><p><br></p><p>The Guild Members had loved the Guild Dorms idea. In fact, just because of this there were several other people who had come and inquired about when the next Guild recruitments will be. Both of the Fairy Tail dorms have been renovated and the second dorm started operating just three days ago.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, seeing the popularity of this system, we bought another rundown property and began the renovation to accommodate new members when the Guild levels up.</p><p><br></p><p>At the rate we were going, it would probably be in two more weeks at most.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine, Bina and Rose were extremely good assistants while Veena was excellent in management. Under them, our guild was getting quests all around.</p><p><br></p><p>I on the other hand spent most of my time in levelling up my skills. Kenneth accompanied me whenever he could but apart from that I even fought the City Lord a few times.</p><p><br></p><p>Arnold Straight, the City Lord of Llyne, was a Level 50 Lord Knight.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood what Kenneth meant when he said that the guy was given the position of the City Lord because he was as strong as a T6.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy was a beast, a true monster in terms of fighting. He was well balanced in every aspect, whether it be offence or defence, strength or speed. His reflexes were lightning fast and instincts sharp enough to match mine with Observation Haki. It was as if there were no holes in his fighting style at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I was always getting beaten up by him but that also meant that my Skill level increased rapidly and I welcomed this.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting him not only gave me Skill Levels but also experience.</p><p><br></p><p>For a game which was mostly about gaining Classes and Skills, it focused too much on learning the things rather than just using the menu to cast the skill. In fact, there was even a way to invoke skills by just using our power instead of using the menu and while it might be harder to do so… once practised, it was a lot faster.</p><p><br></p><p>The detailing given to the game was insane.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to these spars, I came to know more about Arnold. He was actually someone from a very humble background, the son of a woodcutter.</p><p><br></p><p>He was almost killed by a monster when he was a kid and he was saved by a kingdom knight.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s when he decided to become a Knight himself… and what a Knight did he become. He performed exceptionally in a war and was offered the position of a City Lord. The Knight who saved his life was actually Richard’s father and that’s why he asked for Llyne as his territory when he was given an option. Too bad Richard’s father passed away a few years later. He seemed like a nice man from Arnold’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Arnold, he was a very humble and down to earth man when he was not on duty. This made him quite famous with his Knights compared to some other stuck up nobles from the Kingdom.</p><p><br></p><p>He was the reason the Knights of Llyne were so cohesive.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>My sword clashed with Arnold’s once more as I was pushed back slightly. Getting my footing, I kicked him but he twisted his wrist and let my sword slide to the side and turned aside, dodging the kick.</p><p><br></p><p>Our shoulders pushed against each other while we tried to gain an upper hand in the match of strength. While I might be at a lower level than him, I had plenty of passives to put me on his level… well almost there.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly sensed the movement of his mana and he made some distance between our shoulders and I understood what he was doing and responded in kind.</p><p><br></p><p>A sound of crashing sounded in the battlefield as our shoulders clashed.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy… he was using Knight’s Charge, basically a charging attack at such close range to throw me and make me lose my balance.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I had similar skills… I responded with the same skill and matched him. We both were pushed back several steps due to the recoil from the impact.</p><p><br></p><p>“Much better. Then… shall we start getting a bit more serious?” He said as he held his sword straight and took his stance. “This is a skill which makes Lord Knights and Grand Knights so powerful. Go all out or you will lose.” He warned as his sword took on a slight glow.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t hold back either and directly used Armament Haki to reinforce my sword and got ready to face him directly.</p><p><br></p><p>What I wasn’t expecting was his speed…</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, both my Observation Haki and Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū were both things designed to assist me in high speed combat.</p><p><br></p><p>I clashed with him but this time, I was sent skidding several steps back from the clash.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn that was a heavy strike.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t hold back and we began clashing. I was pretty sure if I didn’t have Armament Haki, my sword would have been flung away by his attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, there was only so much I could do.</p><p><br></p><p>Over time I was overwhelmed and lost the grip on my sword but the fight… It was definitely the best one yet.</p><p><br>My Armament Haki rose by one level in that fight alone.</p><p><br>I sat down on the ground, heaving for breath. “That… was something else. I still have a lot to catch up to.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a seat in front of me. “Eh, I wouldn’t say that. You are doing far better than I had expected. In fact, no other Knight in Llyne could have done what you just did… well obviously other than me…” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is that Skill?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s called Battle Aura. More than a Skill, it’s a special way in which we use our Magic.”</p><p><br>“Magic? But I thought Lord Knights didn’t use magic. That was only for Magic Knights and Holy Knights.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah? Who told you that? We all use magic. It’s such a powerful thing. Why should we ignore it? What we don’t use is Spells like Magic Knights and Holy Knights.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Confused right? Well let me explain in detail. Holy Knights use Holy Magic to cast Holy Spells. Your Holy Blade is an example of that.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Magic Knights use their magic to cast spells like enchanting their blades with magic or throwing fireballs with the swing of their swords.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s at least what I had heard.</p><p><br></p><p>“What we Lord Knights do is use our Magic to enhance our bodies and swords’ power. This allows us to achieve strengths, speeds and defences far beyond any of the other two Knights. In fact, one of the requirements for a Lord Knight to advance to a Grand Knight is learning and completely mastering Beginner level Battle Aura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it a Class Skill?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes but it’s a tricky one.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“What trick?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, want to become a Lord Knight?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I like to keep some options open for myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha you cheeky brat. Well, this is something you will have to find yourself. I have already told you more than I should have. To be honest, discovering the way to unlock Battle Aura is a test in itself and it would be cheating if I told you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… fair, I guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, what was that Skill you used to match my Battle Aura? I don’t think I have ever seen that Skill here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s called Armament Haki.”</p><p><br>“Ah… the one used by the people from the other side of the Reverse Mountain. Yes, I have heard of it. I have heard that they have a very similar style of fighting to Grand Knights although I haven’t had the opportunity to fight one myself. It’s a good skill, quite similar to the Battle Aura. You should master it. In fact, let’s polish it in our fights. I need to get my Battle Aura to the maximum level before I can apply for the Grand Knight Assessment too. Don’t let me down, my friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.” I nodded. I mean, isn’t this exactly what I wanted? And now he has come out and said it himself.</p><p><br></p><p>No reason to look the gift horse in the mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, do you have any advice for me? Which skills should I learn? Which skills should I concentrate on more?” I asked. The guy had been a Lord Knight and a City Lord for a couple of years. He would know things which others wouldn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… rather than concentrating on individual skills, I would advise you to concentrate more on fighting style, like that Swordsmanship Style of yours. Obviously, if you want to learn Skills, try to go for those which enhance your abilities instead of one hit damage skills like Armament Haki, Battle Aura and other such skills. They obviously give lower returns at the start when compared to other skills but when trained to the peak… all your normal attacks hit like Skills. Your body’s defence and speed increases as if you are always using some Skill. As for Skills, getting something to deal with your weaknesses should be enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My weaknesses?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. For example, Lord Knights are not good against spirit, long ranged or flying type enemies. You can learn attacks which can harm them or something which can attack from a distance to make up for those. Oh and something to heal yourself if you can. Those are incredibly rare though. Learning a hundred Skills is not the way to get stronger. What you should instead focus on is to master the ones you already have. Don’t be a Jack of All Trades but master of none.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. </p><p><br></p><p>“Also, the Skills almost always have an extra bonus when they are fully levelled up. Some of those bonuses can completely change the Skill. It’s incredible. There is also a very less known fact that completely learning and mastering some skills could even unlock new classes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Didn’t I just tell you that one of the requirements for a Lord Knight to become a Grand Knight was to master Beginner Battle Aura?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… yes.” That’s something I didn’t even think of before.</p><p><br></p><p>“People often ignore these classes because mastering a Skill takes a lot of time. I have been stuck at the peak of Lord Knight for the last three years doing the same. You need patience and will power to stick to this because there are some classes which become unavailable to those who choose other options like Shield and Sword Knight cannot become Lord Knights. Not everyone has the willpower to do this when there are other, easier means to grow stronger in front of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a while after which Rose returned from her own training with the Knights.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally outsiders weren’t allowed inside the Knight Academy but she was allowed because she was with me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Finished your spar?” I asked as she approached us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” She nodded after bowing to Arnold.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I was done for the day too. Thank you for the spar, Arnold.” I said as I got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anytime my friend.” He replied as he stood up and dusted his clothes. “Oh by the way, Arthas. Before I forget it, you should go to Greenfrost with me next month. There is a gathering of the nobles under the Marquis of Greenfrost. You are a baron now and I have the same rank. It would be good for you to join us and at least show your face.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A gathering?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s an annual thing. Nobles under the Marquis of Greenfrost gather together on his birthday, get to know each other and discuss the political situation of the empire and business. You have acquired a territory, haven’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you have a guild too. You can make some good contracts and get jobs for your Guild if you go there. Not to mention, not going could be considered a slight to the Marquis so be ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…”</p><p><br>“Yes?”</p><p><br>“I don’t have any invites.” I asked, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh you will get one in a few days, don’t worry.” He patted my shoulder, laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. I will be there. I haven’t even seen my territory yet. I don’t know where or what kind of place that is.” Veena had asked me to check that place either way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a bit more and I asked him about a few more details after which I left for our home.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had reached level 40 and was out to get information about her Class Change Quest and Bina was in the Guild so it was only Rose and me at home.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am going to take a bath or would you like to go first?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I need to go to the Guild for a while so you can be first. Bina needs one of the files at home.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, alright.” I nodded and she left with the file.</p><p><br></p><p>I too went on to take a bath.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the peak of summer and enjoying a cold bath was always a pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>Since no one was at home, I left the bath, humming a song while drying my hair with another towel.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s when I left the room and got to the living room that something unexpected happened.</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened and in came Bina and Rose. </p><p><br></p><p>Both of them froze at the sight of me and I paused.</p><p><br></p><p>The ice was broken when Veena came in from behind. “Oh, you have taken a bath already? Good. I can’t wait to take one myself. It was tiring.”</p><p><br></p><p>She continued speaking as she walked past the two girls as if there was nothing wrong with the scene. But then again, knowing how she was, it probably wasn’t anything special for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Her words broke the tense atmosphere and I quickly wrapped the towel around my waist and excused myself and quickly went to my room.</p><p><br></p><p>This was something which couldn’t be avoided with the small house.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t the only awkward thing either.</p><p><br></p><p>The house was small with only two rooms which shared a wall… and no soundproofing. This meant the ones living in the other room could… hear us when Veena was loud… and she could be loud sometimes. What it results in is me getting embarrassed looks from Rose and a more stoic Bina the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was however not bothered by these things. It was just another day for her.</p><p><br></p><p>I did want to get a bigger home but Veena rejected saying that we were probably going to shift in a month or two and it would be a waste to buy the house.</p><p><br></p><p>Bina agreed with it too.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose, that girl was too polite to impose… also, she was the kind who would never spend a single penny more than necessary so she was also against the whole plan.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why we are stuck in this situation now.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, this was not the first time something like this has happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Twice before when they were new and I still wasn’t used to them living here, I had awakened late at night to drink water or just go to the toilet and encountered Rose or Bina.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t used to wearing clothes when sleeping, partly due to the heat and partly due to Veena’s influence… and that’s how I encountered them.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say, the sight drove away all sleep from our eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t help that both Bina and Rose were gorgeous and they dressed lightly due to the heat too, the thin white dress sticking to their bodies due to the sweat revealed their figures clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>The sight… was quite stimulating. Unfortunately without any clothes, my <em>stimulation</em> was clear for them to see.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt too awkward the whole day to even look them in the eye.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Veena, she had just laughed loudly when she had heard of the incident.</p><p><br></p><p>I got dressed and came out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere was slightly awkward but thankfully all of us ignored it.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was your quest?” I asked as I opened a book in front of me. It was a book on magic, something which Bina and Rose have been teaching me.</p><p><br></p><p>I had time and I was interested so the two taught me magic. It could be helpful in the future maybe. I did have the Mage Class and most of all… I am the Guild Master of freaking Fairy Tail. It would be odd if I didn’t learn magic.</p><p><br></p><p>“I passed the theory exams. Next part is killing a T5 Monster using poisons and magic only. We cannot physically attack it or the quest fails. Same five member teams and T4 restrictions as before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...that’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This means Shiroe’s guess was on point. Each Class Advancement Quest is actually aimed to check if the individual indeed has the talent for that Class. Such a feat should be easy for a Witch who mainly fights indirectly through poisons and magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t tell me it’s the Rhino again.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, thankfully it's not the Rhino. We can kill any of the eight bosses around Llyne.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t understand it.” Rose questioned, making all of us look at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t understand why the Game Master is doing such a thing? What’s the point of all this? If he wants us to play games then why add real magic in the game, why do all Class Advancement Quests have to be so… realistic?”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought of this too. In fact, I had thought about this more than once.</p><p><br></p><p>Several ideas had come to mind, both good and bad.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean the guy was just doing what he wanted. Playing God.</p><p><br></p><p>A typical reincarnator who reached that level of power where he could fight the whole world by himself and is now causing trouble… but I shook this thought off. While it was very probable, I just couldn’t believe that he would go through so much effort to create a game, a game which was no less than a real world… all for the sake of fucking around.</p><p><br></p><p>I had other guesses but those required more proof for me to verify.</p><p><br></p><p>“It could be role play. You truly underestimate how far ardent role players can go.” I shrugged. It was one of the ideas too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Role Play?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. Haven’t you heard of it? Pretending to be someone you aren’t for the sake of fun.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I have heard of it from Zeo. One of his new harem members was into something like that. She pretended to be a captured nun asking him to play the big bad devil. I thought it was quite amusing.” Veena laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Rose turned full red and I was pretty sure I saw a twitch at the corner of Bina’s eyes too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… that’s one way to do role play. But sometimes players decide to act like the characters they play, speak in the manner their game character speaks for a more… authentic experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Either way, it means that if the game were to end someday… we would have thousands of trained and yet unaffiliated magicians on our hands. Safe to say that the Supernatural World’s exposure would be imminent unless all Pantheons take action together.” Bina said, making the whole atmosphere tense again.</p><p><br></p><p>“That will happen when it happens. No reason to worry about it now. Not to mention that there would be nothing we can do either so why worry? All we need to concentrate on now should be how to complete the game. Only after that would anything else matter.” Veena said, calming things down.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>What we needed to concentrate on now was how to win this game.</p><p><br></p><p>“If that’s the case then we can try hunting the bear. It was the easiest one of them all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I was thinking of that too.” She nodded. “Anyways, we can plan for that tomorrow. How were things on your end?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, quite fruitful actually. I found some more information from Arnold.” I told her all I had learned about the Skills and Classes Arnold had told me. Then came the topic of the nobles gathering.</p><p><br>“Arnold wasn’t wrong. Such gatherings are very good places to establish contacts, especially for one such as us. Just a couple of contacts can help us level our guild at a much rapid pace. You should definitely go there. In fact, we can go there in advance and check your territory and even start work there. We were planning on going there either way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then let’s go there after you complete your Class change quest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>We worked on our own things and had dinner before we retired for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hot so Veena went on to take a bath before bed while I undressed and she entered the room after a while, wrapped in a towel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmh, what should I wear today?” She asked while looking through the wardrobe. “Oh! Should we try that roleplay thing too?” She asked, her face lighting up at the idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Now… I am not exactly into roleplay but… I would be lying out of my teeth if I said that I wasn’t curious too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and what role do you want to play?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, actually, how about a Knight rescuing a maiden and then getting rewarded?” She smiled. “Or we can try something like a maid servicing her Lord and Master. I even have the dress for that” She smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>Although inadvertently a face appeared in my thoughts and my dick twitched.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you like that idea. Then let’s do that… Master~” </p><p><br></p><p>Hiding my embarrassment, I changed the subject. “Where did you get a maid uniform?” I asked.</p><p><br>“I got some for the girls who work at the Guild because I thought they looked nice. I have some leftovers.” She directly switched her clothes using the Game Menu instead of wearing them normally. “How do I look?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wonderful.” I praised, not lying one bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… what may I do for you today, Master?” She asked, suddenly in a more serious tone reminding me of another person… sleeping next door.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, since she was so excited about the role play thing, let’s do it properly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am stressed from work today. Help me relax.” I replied as I got up and sat down on the edge of the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you command, Master.” She replied, still in the same professional tone as she kneeled down between my legs, and grasping my length.</p><p><br></p><p>I got more comfortable as she jerked me slowly, keeping that professional look on her face. It was a surprisingly great turn on.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will have to do better. I want to be relieved today, not in a week.” I spoke in a bored and imperious tone, keeping to the noble persona.</p><p><br></p><p>“My apologies, Master.” She bowed slightly before leaning forward and kissing the tip and then licking it.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s it.” I encouraged her.</p><p><br></p><p>She took her time, licking my length all over, running her tongue from the base of the balls to the tip before taking the tip in her mouth and began sucking on it.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly thought of something and held her hair, making her stop. She looked at me confused so I told her to wait for a moment and dragged the table in front of the bed and then made her get under it.</p><p><br></p><p>She raised an eyebrow at my action but then understood what I was trying to do and a smile came on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned a book and placed it on the table before looking down. “Get to work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master~”</p><p><br></p><p>And boy did she get to work.</p><p><br></p><p>The book stayed untouched on the table as I could only hold the edge of the table to control the pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stay passive either and used my toes to caress her panty clad clit.</p><p><br></p><p>She increased her efforts too, taking me deep in her throat, her drool trailing down my thighs and balls.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t hold on much longer and held her hair and pushed her into my crotch, her face pressing against my crotch as I shot ropes of cum into her throat.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled back after several seconds and looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>The look on her face made me hard instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Hair dishevelled, drool and cum running down the corner of her lips and there were some tears in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed the table back and ordered. “Get up.”</p><p><br></p><p>She followed the order quickly getting up.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed her on the table, making her sit on it and spread her legs before raising her skirt, revealing her leggings clad thighs.</p><p><br></p><p>My cock twitched once more at the sight in front of me. I noticed however a patch of wetness on her panties and touched it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh.” A soft moan escaped her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you enjoying yourself, Maid? Did sucking my dick make you wet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-yes Master.” She replied, pretending to be shy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Go on, you did a good job. I wish to grant you a reward. What reward do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hurry up, I don’t have all day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want your dick in me, Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And where do you want me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In… in my pussy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good girl. But I have a condition. I want you to tell me everything you feel.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>I lined myself to her sodden core and looked into her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you ready, Maid?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then say the magic word.”</p><p><br></p><p>“P-p-please…”</p><p><br></p><p>With that I pushed in and a loud moan erupted from her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rose -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She blushed deeply at the sounds coming from the other room.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t something new. She still remembered the first time she had heard it was during the trip back from Sabaody.</p><p><br></p><p>And it had become a daily thing since they started staying here. But even now, the sound made her turn red from embarrassment.</p><p><br></p><p>It was kind of unbelievable that those sounds were made by Venelana Gremory… that calm and composed woman who always had such a motherly smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was very open about her sex life with Arthas and while no one outside the residents of the house and Elaine knew about this relationship for sure, everyone had their doubts with the way they behaved outside.</p><p><br></p><p>These sounds always brought raunchy thoughts in her mind. After all, it was easy to let the mind wander after hearing the moans.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was a gorgeous woman and Arthas… he was very handsome too.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene from the morning flashed in her mind and she became red again.</p><p><br></p><p>His muscles looked as if chiselled from stone and yet his body was slender, not very bulky like most of the warriors from Asgard and then there was that part… down there.</p><p><br></p><p>Were all men supposed to be like that? So… big.</p><p><br></p><p>How could such a thing even go inside her…?</p><p><br><br></p><p>“Yes yes yes, right there. Ram it in, Master.” Veena’s pleasure filled voice broke her thoughts and she became redder when she realised what she was thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Master?</p><p><br></p><p>Were they… roleplaying as Arthas had said earlier?</p><p><br></p><p>A Master Servant role play?</p><p><br></p><p>The sounds of flesh slapping against each other got louder and so did Veena’s moans, begging Arthas to go rougher.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene of Arthas’ body from earlier flashed into her mind once more.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been in close contact with him several times, when teaching him or when training with him.</p><p><br></p><p>While thinking of this, her hands slowly crept between her thighs and touched her core and she felt a jolt of electricity run through her.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose hadn’t done this before, always concentrating on work and her studies. That had obviously landed her the job as Odin’s bodyguard but at the same time prevented her from getting any friends or… boyfriends, earning her the title of the Virgin Valkyrie.</p><p><br></p><p>She had always ignored them but now… now she had neither a job nor a boyfriend.</p><p><br></p><p>The thoughts angered her. Did she really waste her time? Now she didn’t even know if she would be able to leave this place out alive?</p><p><br></p><p>Would someone even worry about her?</p><p><br>Granny would… but other than that she couldn’t think of anyone else…</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh… just what had she done all these years?</p><p><br></p><p>The moans broke her thoughts again and she looked at the wall connecting the two rooms. Well, at least someone was enjoying themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena and Arthas also knew the situation and yet they seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>She had asked Arthas if he wasn’t afraid of what would happen when the game ended and Sirzechs Lucifer confronted him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t even know if I can get out of this game alive. If I am going to die then I’d rather enjoy whatever time I have to the fullest so that I have no regrets later on. What comes later will be taken care of later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a high chance she could die… or worse, end up in a situation like before.</p><p><br>If that were to happen, wouldn’t she have lived her life in vain? Always working and never getting any chance to enjoy her life.</p><p><br></p><p>What was the use of such a life?</p><p><br></p><p>The more she thought, the faster her fingers moved until she reached her peak and the world around her turned white.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose experienced her first climax that night.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Nyahahahaha one more drink.” She laughed as he downed another cup of beer.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are drinking too much, Kuroka-san!” Gaspy shouted on her side.</p><p><br></p><p>“But you just became a Blacksmith today, Gaspy. We have to party.”</p><p><br></p><p>It surprised her a lot and would probably surprise anyone else in the Game too.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, Gaspy hadn’t killed a single monster and yet, he had become a Blacksmith, a T4 Class through crafting alone.</p><p><br></p><p>All his Skill Levels from Apprentice Blacksmith were maxed out.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure he wasn’t the first player to get the Blacksmith but she could bet one of her tails that he was definitely the one with the best skill in the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka herself hadn’t been slacking off either. She hunted day and night, getting any quests she could do and it had shown its result.</p><p><br></p><p>She had reached Level 28 T3 Thief and would soon be getting a T4 Class soon too. After the last debacle and close shave with death, she had started working far more cautiously. She often changed parties, not staying in any party for more than a few days to not let anyone know of her address.</p><p><br></p><p>This allowed her to form contacts with many players in the town. Then she used her contacts to bring customers to Gaspy, helping him earn both money and experience from crafting.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, she was just waiting to get a T4 Class and they can then move on to Greenfrost. Gaspy’s experience gains were slowing down the more he levelled up.</p><p><br></p><p>Greenfrost was a bigger town and there they could easily get better commissions for Gaspy and would help him level up faster.</p><p><br></p><p>At the rate she was going, it should probably take another week at best to be ready to move. She had already started preparing for the move.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, do you know which Class you are going to get after Blacksmith?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… no. I don’t know about any Classes.” He answered nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>“No matter. We can always find what you will need. In fact, I will go and find more information tomorrow. I need to find options for my T4 Class too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“O-okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But today… today we party!” She hugged him to her side and cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>She checked around and found the road clear and quickly snuck into the Black Market entrance building.</p><p><br></p><p>Treading the paths she had become quite familiar with, she reached the place which sold information.</p><p><br></p><p>A shady looking man sat there. He looked up at her and his eyes widened in realisation. “Cat… has been a while since I have seen you here. I personally thought you kicked the bucket after that last hunt.” He spoke with a creepy smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Cat has nine lives, Keith. I am not that easy to kill.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh good good. After all, you were becoming one of my favourite customers. I was so sad when I thought you died.”</p><p><br></p><p>She rolled her eyes. “You are the kind of man who would sell your own mother for money. You, being sad about my death? Don’t joke.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that’s not wrong exactly but that’s also why I was sad. You bought information on so many people these past months. I was missing the flow of money.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, she had thought as much. In fact, she had a large doubt that this guy was the one who had sold her whereabouts to those people too. But right now she needs him. As much of a scumbag as he might be, he was also the best information merchant in this town. If she wanted information about potential Classes for Gaspy and herself, he was the best option.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, whose information do you want today? Another adventurer or is it a merchant or craftsman this time?”</p><p><br>“I don’t want any of that today. What I want to know is the information about the Advanced Classes of Thief and Blacksmith Classes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, Class Advancement. Sure sure.” He presented her with the rates and her eyes twitched at the price but she had money. She had more than enough money after that bastard Herbalist had returned Gaspy’s money and some extra.</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty Thousand for a T4 Class Tree and two hundred thousand for a T5.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, they had the money.</p><p><br></p><p>She checked the Class Advancements available for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Assassin and Rogue.</p><p><br></p><p>An Assassin focused on hunting people while a Rogue was better at hunting monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>When she had received the Thief Class, she had accepted it as it gave her a quick path to power. But the last few months had given her time to think.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe she was mellowing out due to Gaspy’s presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh…</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, she was basically given a choice.</p><p><br></p><p>What did she want to do going forward?</p><p><br></p><p>Did she want to continue on the path of killing people or did she want to change…</p><p><br></p><p>She paused as several thoughts went through her head.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason she had become a criminal in the real world was because she was forced to by the circumstances.</p><p><br></p><p>Did she want to continue that life…</p><p><br></p><p>Even in this game? A place where she could do what she wanted?</p><p><br></p><p>That life had separated her from her sister and from what she had found out from Gaspy, Shirone was afraid of that Kuroka… did she want to meet her sister as an Assassin or did she want to choose the path of a Rogue?…</p><p><br></p><p>Closing her eyes, Kuroka took a deep breath and made her choice.</p><p><br>Next came Gaspy’s Classes.</p><p><br></p><p>A Blacksmith had two options.</p><p><br></p><p>Master Blacksmith or a Magic Blacksmith.</p><p><br></p><p>A Master Blacksmith needed a Blacksmith to get all their Skills to Max. Level while a Magic Blacksmith needed a Blacksmith to get the Mage Class.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka knew how to get that one but she doubted Gaspy would agree to leave home and hunt monsters to level up the Scholar Class for thirty levels.</p><p><br></p><p>That only left Master Blacksmith… which he would have gotten if he continued working either way.</p><p><br></p><p>…did she waste two hundred thousand gold coins… for this?</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh…</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get what you wanted?” The man asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That will be all.” She paid the money for the transaction and left the Black Market directly. The longer she stayed there the more danger she was in.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting out, she changed her clothes and slipped through the alleys back to their home.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a lot of work to be done.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Akeno -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“That was amazing, Arthur. You are doing very well.Now we just need to complete your Quest and you can become a Knight.” Marielle praised.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, obviously he was amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>He was the descendant of Arthur Pendragon. It would be surprising if he wasn’t good. Still, a month to go from level 5 Squire to Level 30 was quite a feat. Although, he did have the advantage of having high levelled party members which they didn’t have so it was still understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, Akeno noticed that Arthur was far more skilled than even Yuuto with a sword. He could take down a monster at the same level as him by his swordsmanship alone, even without using any extra skills.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Marielle-san.” He bowed politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mou… just call me Mari or Mari-nee like everyone else. You’re too stiff. Look at Nao-kun here. He always has so much fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, Arthur. Chill out a bit. Actually, let’s go out and… ouch. What did you hit me for, Akatsuki-chan?” Nao-kun rubbed his head, looking aggrieved.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were probably going to say something stupid.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah! How do you know that? I was obviously going to just… ouch. Hey now!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t say it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, Akatsuki-chan. Violence is not good.” Mari chided and Akatsuki-chan looked away from Naotsugu with a huff. “What were you saying, Nao-kun?”</p><p><br>“Ah yes. We could totally go and check out some chicks in the entertainment district.”</p><p><br>“See… I told you he was going to say something stupid.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara ara, is Nao-kun interested in girls now? If that’s so, Mari-nee can help him out.” Mari held his armoured arm and pushed it between his breasts with a smile, making Nao-kun nervous.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno chuckled at his reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>She wondered when the fool would realise that Mari was actually interested in him. Looking at her usual flirty behaviour, no one would realise how shy Mari actually was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… I…” Nao-kun looked troubled when Arthur came to his rescue.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will pass. I still have to train my skills today.” He apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>Nao-kun obviously caught the chance and changed the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were walking, Akeno noticed something but didn’t halt her steps. She threw a look towards Arthur who nodded almost imperceptibly at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mari-san, I need to go to the market for something so I will separate here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I also want to go that way.” Arthur spoke up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, join me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take care, you two. Be back before dinner.” Mari waved at her as they left towards the orphanage on the other side of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Arthur and her looked at each other and walked to the other side and got into the alleys, and hid behind some barrels.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, some people stopped at that place and looked around.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you see where those two went?” One of them, a taller and lankier man asked his partner.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. You go and check that alley and I will check the next one. Dammit, why do we have to follow them around like this. Why can’t we just ambush them in the forest like others?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the boss likes the two girls. Especially the black haired one with huge breasts. He has heard that a noble, a Viscount, in the nearby city likes girls like that and he plans to capture them and offer them to the noble to get his support. With that, not even the City Lord of this small town will be able to do anything to us and we can do as we want in the town. Knights will not interfere if we can have the Viscount’s support. And with their team out, our Dark Fiends group could easily take over the town. They are the only players who could challenge our group in this town.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and their potions business is great. Do you know how much money those brats make without even having to go out and risk their lives? It’s not fair, you know. We slave around and can only earn a handful of coins and they laze around all day and earn more than us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah… so go and check on them. We will launch an attack in a week when we know their hunting route.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Meet me here in five minutes then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kay.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two dispersed and she got out.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur looked at her and she saw anger in his eyes too.</p><p><br></p><p>“When are you doing it?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No time like today.” She replied and he nodded in agreement and left the place together.</p><p><br></p><p>Five minutes later, they walked by the same place where those two goons had gathered and caught their attention.<br><br></p><p>As expected the scumbags followed them towards the forest.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Arthur and her hid behind the trees and waited for them to come to the place.</p><p><br></p><p>When they did, she directly used the Spell Heavy Spark.</p><p><br></p><p>Heavy Spark had a 20% chance to paralyse a target for 5 seconds. Luckily for her and and unluckily for them, both of them were paralysed from the spell and froze.</p><p><br>Arthur used this chance to use Paralysis Powder on them. When it looked like the other person was going to break from the paralyse, he used his Heavy Blow Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Heavy Blow could stun the target for 4 seconds. Akeno used this chance to use even more Paralysis Powder and stun both of them completely…</p><p><br></p><p>With the two enemies being unable to move, she brought out a rope and tied them up.</p><p><br></p><p>And then began the questioning…</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, several things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas is learning.</strong></p><p><strong><br>Shiroe got even stronger than before.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Veena is going to be a T5 soon.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rose made some resolutions.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kuroka made a life changing decision.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Akeno and Arthur… well, they are facing their own share of troubles.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see what happens in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

It’s because of this that I was putting so much stress on learning Fuinjutsu and even establishing a connection with the Uzumaki Clan despite the potential danger.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuinjutsu was the only counter to Tailed Beasts apart from Wood Style, Mangekyo Sharingan and Chakra Chains, all of which are Bloodline techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>This alone showed how diverse and strong this art was.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to say that sealing a Tailed Beast was easy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was anything but that.</p><p><br></p><p>The degree of difficulty varied depending on the number of tails or rather the amount of chakra the beast possessed.</p><p><br></p><p>For someone like Shukaku could also be sealed in a Teapot, made of chakra metals and reinforced with hundreds of seals but still… a teapot but this was not possible for the higher tailed beasts. They needed living vessels to contain them.</p><p><br></p><p>Luckily for us, Rōen was at Shukaku’s level, moreover, unlike the tailed beasts, it was just a mindless animal so it can’t resist the sealing as much as them.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t plan to release it here but rather transfer it into a… lamp, like a Genie.</p><p><br></p><p>This lamp was prepared over the last several months for this very purpose. Our method would be similar to what is used in the case of transferring Tailed Beasts from one Jinchuriki to another.</p><p><br></p><p>We quickly got into preparing the setup for the transfer.</p><p><br></p><p>A ritual like this takes an extensive setup and I had everyone practise it dozens of times in the last few months.</p><p><br></p><p>They were already at work.</p><p><br></p><p>With our combined efforts, the preparations were completed in an hour.</p><p><br></p><p>None of us used any clones as we needed every bit of chakra for the ritual later.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I placed the lamp in between the formation, in one of the two circles with the other being the Shrine.</p><p><br></p><p>We took the corners of the formation and I led the ritual while the rest just provided chakra for support.</p><p><br></p><p>My chakra connected with the Shrine’s and I felt an intense burst of malice and madness crash into my senses. It almost made me feel dizzy but my mental power and soul were far stronger than normal people and pushed back the feeling almost immediately and took control of the chakra and guided it towards the lamp.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest provided me with their chakra to keep the beast restricted inside the circle.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next five hours, I continued guiding the beast into the lamp. It also told me just how huge the chakra of a tailed beast could be.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit, this was just one tail level at best and it still had dozens of times more chakra than me. Hell, it had several times more chakra than Shiroyasha Uzumaki.</p><p><br></p><p>Just because a Kage could fight a Tailed Beast didn’t mean that they had tailed beast level chakra reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>The only shinobi with chakra reserves rivalling tailed beasts were outliers, all of whom were related to the Otsutsuki Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>Hashirama Senju, Madara Uchiha, Naruto Uzumaki, which one of them wasn’t a monster. It was one thing reading and a completely different thing, feeling it for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt like standing in front of a mountain while the mountain looked down upon me. It was… a very uncomfortable feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>The realisation also made me want to become a Jinchuriki but I rejected that thought almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>With my Grimoire, I could reach that level sooner or later. There was no need to become a Jinchuriki for that.</p><p><br></p><p>Haste makes waste, one step at a time.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, it was around seven in the morning, nine hours later, the sealing was finally completed and I stored the lamp inside my Grimoire and almost collapsed on the floor.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose came to my rescue, healing my fatigue, but she had already done that a few times already and now I was feeling sleepy.</p><p><br></p><p>Man, just how strong was Minato to do what he did with Kurama? Then again, he sacrificed his life and Shinigami was the one who did all the work so that didn’t count.</p><p><br></p><p>It also made me realise what utter monsters Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha must have been in their time and what kind of monsters I will have to face in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>The sun was already out and it was time for us to go.</p><p><br></p><p>To my surprise, the Kumanoi Clan head came to meet us before we left.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness, was your investigation successful?” He asked. “Can I help you with something else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. We couldn’t find anything here but we thank you for your help. If you find anything, please be sure to inform the Land of Flowers, I will make sure you get rewarded appropriately for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness is very kind.” He then brought out a scroll from his back. “We have heard that you like collecting Medicinal Plants of different types. These are some plants which only grow in the mountains near the Howling Wolf Village. I hope Your Highness will like them. This is a small gift and apology from the Howling Wolf Village for the actions of the Kodon Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man with a slightly raised eyebrow and then at Saitō who accepted the scroll. “Very well. We will not blame the Howling Wolf Village for the transgressions of the Kodon Clan. You can rest assured.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness.” He bowed politely and left after some more talks.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the village soon after. In the carriage, Genshiro-sensei was sitting in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki Trio didn’t ask me anything and I didn’t tell them anything either.</p><p><br></p><p>Some things were better kept to myself.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the Land of Medicine and took Kasumi before departing. Kuina and Kasumi had taken this time to buy several rare medicinal herbs and plants in the country.</p><p><br></p><p>Our entourage left the Land of Stairs soon after and headed back for the Land of Flowers at full speed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Genshiro -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They separated from the Prince’s entourage and headed for the place they were staying while the Prince directly headed for the palace.</p><p><br></p><p>This trip to the Land of Medicine had given him a completely new understanding about Prince Kazuya.</p><p><br></p><p>His intelligence network was beyond anything Genshiro had seen and while a monster at the level of one tails might not shake the foundation of any of the five Great Ninja Villages, the fact that he had discovered something which even the clan guarding it didn’t know, manipulated both the village and the daimyo of the land to drive the clan away and then steal away such a monster right under their noses… was a scary feat.</p><p><br></p><p>And even in doing so, he didn’t ask for their help.</p><p><br></p><p>Were they taken there to guard him, to act as backup for sealing the beast or just to show them what he was capable of?… It was something Genshiro couldn’t understand for the life of him.</p><p><br></p><p>He went directly into their home while Rina and Mina did some shopping and returned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa Shiro, you won’t believe what we heard.” Rina said as soon as she entered the house.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? Did something big happen?” He asked, smiling at her excited tone.</p><p><br></p><p>Rina was the more talkative of the twins and someone who had learned under him for a while so could be considered his student. In fact, both sisters were among the best of his students.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew the reason Shiroyasha had sent these two girls here. He had been someone who had witnessed Lady Mito’s wedding with Hashirama Senju and thus knew how these kinds of alliances worked.</p><p><br></p><p>His elder brother had been married to a prominent member of the Senju Clan too, when he followed Lady Mito to Konoha as her aide.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, he would have never thought that such an unbreakable alliance had dwindled to the point where he had to hide from them.</p><p><br></p><p>Back in the day, the name Hashirama Senju alone was enough to stop wars. With Tobirama Senju by his side, the Senju name was enough to shake entire villages and now… sigh. During that time the alliance between the Senju and the Uzumaki made the Uzumaki nigh untouchable.</p><p><br></p><p>And now Shiroyasha wanted to recreate such an alliance… with Prince Kazuya.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro had complicated feelings about it but a part of him actually believed that this could be the decision which could change the current fate of the Uzumaki Clan. This feeling had only grown stronger the more of the young Prince’s secrets he witnessed.</p><p><br></p><p>His chakra and talent in Fuinjutsu alone could have made sure that he would become one of the top figures of this generation and that was not even considering his ability to open the Eight Inner Gates and his charisma.</p><p><br></p><p>The young prince reminded him of a young Hashirama Senju in some ways like his attitude towards his subjects and his sincerity when asking for the alliance with their clan, and of Tobirama Senju in the way he kept everything in control.</p><p><br></p><p>Such people often had talents gathering around them as was seen here too.</p><p><br></p><p>He had seen their prowess against the group of ninja who had burned the village and while not at his level at their base, he wasn't sure he would be able to take them on in their Eight Gates mode.</p><p><br></p><p>And from the words of Rina, the Prince's group had finished their fight in minutes while they had to fight for around an hour, against a group of similar strength.</p><p><br></p><p>The more he saw the more sure he became that he could save the Uzumaki Clan from its current fate.</p><p><br></p><p>Konoha’s current unclear attitude didn’t fill him, Uzukage-sama or Daimyo-sama with confidence. They were continuously making excuses even in front of overwhelming proof of enemies eying Uzushio.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, Prince Kazuya has been risking everything just to establish a friendly relationship with them.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference between the attitudes of both sides was like heaven and earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro just hoped that the Prince gets the chance to grow to his full potential and Uzushio gains a new ally.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. Very big. We just got news from the Land of Rain. The Third Hokage’s students fought Hanzo of the Salamander.”</p><p><br></p><p>A frown appeared on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were they…?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>While he didn’t know much about the other two, one of them was the Princess of the Senju Clan, Tsunade Senju… the granddaughter of Mito Uzumaki, his distant cousin. He wouldn’t lie and say that he didn’t care about her at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were defeated.” Mina said with a serious face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are they alive?” He asked, suppressing his worry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Hanzo, the Salamander… let them go.” Rina answered excitedly. “He also gave them a title for surviving in a fight against him. Can you guess what that title was?” She asked, making him raise an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“What title?” He asked, amused at her excitement now that he knew that the Senju Princess was safe and alive.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Sannin. He named them… the Sannin…” She answered excitedly, making him open his mouth in surprise. “Just like…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just like the Prince had predicted…” he whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did he do that, Grandpa?” Mina asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… don’t know Mina… I don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I did after returning was talk to Grandpa about the village which was burned and found out that it was not a lone case. There were a total of five villages which had faced the same end. He had sent people to investigate but not much was found. Some indicated the involvement of Iwa but after the things we had found, we were not sure they were Iwa anymore. I took the name of the villages and planned to search for the culprits using the Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>“I swear that each and every one of the culprits will get punished, Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t let your emotions get the best of you, Kazu-kun. Leaders need to keep their calm at all moments. One wrong decision from your part can and will cause hundreds, even thousands of deaths… and there will be nothing you can do but grit your teeth and move forward. As much as I want to say that this was an exceptional case… it’s not. There have been cases like this in the past and will be cases like this in the future wars too. Not only in our Land but many others. You cannot save everyone so don’t let yourself get crushed by it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t see it Grandpa… those people… even the kids… newborns…” I spoke, almost in a whisper.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s something you have to learn to live with Kazu-kun. It’s the part of sitting in the position. The best you can do is prepare that such a thing never happens again… but even then always be prepared to accept a repeat. We just live in that kind of world.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>His words were heavy and yet I couldn’t argue back at all. He was right in the way things worked in this world. It was what he had seen in his entire life.</p><p><br></p><p>But there was something different in our ways of seeing things.</p><p><br></p><p>I, who had the Akashic Grimoire and means to do things which were unimaginable to him or anyone in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I will do just that.</p><p><br></p><p>I will make this country into something this world has never seen before.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I stood in the middle of the ritual room, ready to do the summoning once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the night of the full moon and the best day to summon a living person.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know what Kazuya? Instead of always summoning someone who is about to die, why don’t you try summoning someone who wants help. I am pretty sure there will be many people who want to get away from their current situation and accept your call.” Kuina said as I was preparing everything.</p><p><br></p><p>She did have a point but there was also the thing about them later regretting and I didn’t have a way to immediately send someone back and that would just cause them to resent me.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained the reason to them and Rose was the one who spoke then.</p><p><br></p><p>“There have been such cases in the Hero summoning too. How about you explain everything to them and give them a choice like serving you for a decade before you can send them back or something? Believe me, there are worse things than dying and this way you will have more room to choose from. Who knows, some might even just want to stay in a new world if they have nothing left behind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, let’s try this.” I set the conditions and started the summoning ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>I need someone strong to protect and make my people strong. This was the thought I had in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The light of the magic circle lit up and the lamp in the middle started trembling before smoke leaked from it and took the shape of a giant creature.</p><p><br></p><p>We had a barrier set up and everyone poured their chakra in the barrier to restrain the beast in case things got bad as well as keep the sound and chakra from going out.</p><p><br></p><p>As the beast took form, we saw the creature for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like a hybrid between a tiger and a wolf with chakra tentacles around its neck. Standing at the height of forty metres tall and around seventy metres length, it was by no means smaller than any tailed beast.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time I was glad to have built this ritual room so big and away from the main city because there was no way I could have contained this beast inside.</p><p><br></p><p>I poured my chakra into the Grimoire and a golden light covered the beast, its body disintegrating and changing into a much smaller form.</p><p><br></p><p>When the light faded, the figure became clear but before we could go ahead, the figure crashed on the floor below.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are those…” Kuina said as she stopped a bit away from the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cat ears?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rose, check on her.” I commanded, still trying to understand the whole situation. </p><p><br></p><p>I sacrificed a motherfuc… tailed beast level beast and I got a cat girl?</p><p><br></p><p>Is the Grimoire fucking with me?</p><p><br></p><p>“Her physical condition is fine. She is probably mentally exhausted.” Rose reported while I saw her closer.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had black hair and looked around the same age as Kanae. The most prominent features about her however were her ears and… two tails.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the colour of her eyes when Rose was checking up on her and they were golden.</p><p><br></p><p>While I could have easily temporarily stored her inside my grimoire and found out everything about her, I decided to let her wake up and listen.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl was my biggest investment in this world. I didn’t want to mess up any chances.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that it? Are you telling me that this cat girl inside is supposed to be equivalent to that giant love child of wolf and tiger curses?” Toji said, incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t judge a book by the cover.” Saitō replied, and then ignored the man.</p><p><br></p><p>While they were doing their cold war thing, I was trying to remember all the cat girls I knew of.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, there is no need to worry. We will know everything when we wake up.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl woke up around eight hours later and Kuina sent a message to me.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I reached there, the girl was already given an explanation about her situation by Kanae.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked directly at me as soon as I entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Kazuya Katsuyoshi. I take it that Kanae has explained everything to you?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Thank you for helping me out. I just have a few questions for you before we discuss anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you summon someone else for me too?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I cannot say for sure but I can try. It will depend on many things like for starters, how strong is the person you want to summon and will they want to come here?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“She will. Once she knows I am here, she will surely come. And she is not very strong but she can get stronger with training. She will be very useful, I promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If it’s your family member, they don’t really have to fight for me if they don’t want to. The reason I am asking about their strength is because summoning stronger people needs more energy. It took a lot to summon you and I am afraid if she is anywhere near your level, we cannot do anything about her at this moment.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Shirone is just a child. She is not that strong.” She hurriedly explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Wait… Shirone… the name sparked a memory in my head and what followed were a series of memories.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are… are you perhaps… Kuroka?” I asked, stunned at the memory.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked surprised and then came fear as she slowly shifted into a defensive position. I hurriedly waved my hand to prevent anyone from taking action.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to get defensive. I know about your situation, about everything the Naberius were doing and why you did what you did. Trust me, I would have done something far worse. No one here is going to blame you for what you did but I will never tell them if you don’t want me to.”</p><p><br></p><p>A look of shock appeared on her face but it soon went back to a look of doubt. “How should I believe you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I summoned you to a different world, something I doubt anyone you know of is capable in your world and you are surprised by me knowing something about you? You are Kuroka, the older sister of Shirone. You were a bishop under a member of the Naberius house who was doing experiments on you to discover a way to create super devils. The experiments made you stronger making you a rising star in the Rating Games but when they stopped getting results, they planned to do the same to your sister. That’s when you snapped and killed them and were declared rogue. Am I right till this point?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would assume I am right, seeing your surprised face. As I said, I know many random things. Some background knowledge about you was among these memories. I assume you want me to summon Shirone?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Can you? I will do anything if you can do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will try but I cannot promise you anything. Shirone was almost crushed by the whole incident and it took her a lot of time to recover. She was adopted by the Gremory House and lived a good life but she didn’t have any good feelings about you so I don’t know if she would accept the summoning.”</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t lying either.</p><p><br></p><p>“She will accept the summoning. I just know of it. She will never leave me.” The girl protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is no doubt that your sister loves you, Kuroka. If she didn’t then she wouldn’t have been so sad. But she thinks you went mad on power due to Senjutsu and murdered your own master. She herself was looked upon with fear by others.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please…” She begged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… let’s go. We can try once now and then once next month if it doesn’t work.” I stood up. “Saitō, bring me the strongest prisoner we have.” I commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I wanted to do a focused summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Before this both Kanae and Toji had asked me to do it but we just didn’t have everything needed to get it done.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the energy requirements were far beyond the level of being summoned. Like, for example, in normal summons, I could summon a Jōnin level being with an Elite Jōnin level chakra but in this case, the best I could summon was a Genin.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I sent Saitō to get a sacrifice to reduce the energy expenditure.</p><p><br></p><p>The second requirement was something belonging to the person, best if it was something containing their DNA. This part was nigh impossible to get but in this case, by some stroke of luck, we had both. Kuroka had a handkerchief which she had used to wipe her drool off and so it contained her DNA. I checked it using my Grimoire and it was acceptable.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least were anchors to that world.</p><p><br></p><p>Which I had in the form of Kuroka and everything on her body.</p><p><br></p><p>The setup was completed in record time and we were ready for the second summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>I just hoped it didn’t fail.</p><p><br></p><p>The prisoner Saitō had brought was a Tokubetsu Jōnin level but I had used up the best chance of summoning someone this month so the next chance was lower.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and started the process.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s hope she accepts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She will.” Kuroka answered confidently.</p><p><br></p><p>“Summon Shirone.”</p><p><br></p><p>The message for her was different from what I gave to other people.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of a normal message, she was told the truth about Kuroka and given an offer to be summoned to meet her.</p><p><br></p><p>We waited with bated breath as the magic circle lit up and felt my chakra drain rapidly from my body… then after a minute…The body of the prisoner disintegrated and turned into a ball of flesh which lit up and started to spin, taking the shape of a figure.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute later, the light faded leaving a white haired girl in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka rushed, catching her before she fell down on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>She accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn… did I just summon two people in one day?…</p><p><br></p><p>Holy Crap… that’s a record for me…</p><p><br></p><p>Was the last thing I thought before fainting.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra Exhaustion… is a bitch.</p><p><br></p><p>I never thought I would be forced to this extent, summoning a kid.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes to find Kasumi sitting near my bed.</p><p><br></p><p>She sensed my movements and looked at me. “Kazuya-sama. You are awake.”</p><p><br></p><p>I got up, still feeling slight pain in my body.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, just how much did that ritual drain me?</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure I could shrug off a normal chakra exhaustion without any problems due to my vitality.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long was I asleep?”</p><p><br></p><p>“For a full day. Rose-sama said you were extremely exhausted and she healed you immediately but the exhaustion was mental as well and you could only recover from it through rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No wonder I feel like my head was hit by a truck… and hungry. I feel very hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will get something for you to eat.” She quickly got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Just tell someone else to do it. Stay with me.” I held her hand and stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and nodded before ordering someone outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t waste any time and pulled her to my side. The lime smell of her shampoo was refreshing, helping a lot to clear my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>She too didn’t move away and slowly caressed my hair, massaging my head.</p><p><br></p><p>The peaceful atmosphere didn’t last long as the door was soon opened by Kuina and she entered with the rest of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>Kasumi tried moving but I held her hand and laid down on the bed with my head on her lap. “Please continue doing that. I was feeling better like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl blushed but continued her ministrations.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, he looks fine, alright.” Kuina commented, rolling her eyes at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not exactly alright per say. My head is killing me.” I replied with a pout.</p><p><br></p><p>“You pushed yourself too hard. You said it yourself that targeted summoning is not easy.” She chided.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, there was nothing we could have done. Did you see her? She looked like she would break down into tears at any moment and this time I could actually do something for her unlike the previous cases. How are they doing by the way?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are fine. Shirone woke up after a few hours and the two sisters reunited. They waited for you to wake up and had gone to bed just a few hours ago. Poor girls had to go through a lot so I didn’t wake them up either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Let them rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina then explained the situation of the two sisters before they were summoned. Kuroka was actually badly injured when she was summoned after being chased by the Naberius while Shirone had just been rescued by Sirzechs Lucifer and was summoned directly from the stage… in front of everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Hahahaha, that must have surprised some people.</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few more things before my food came and they took their leave. </p><p><br></p><p>“Kanae, please stay back for a while if you are free.” I called her as everyone was leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Okay…”</p><p><br></p><p>When the room closed, I took her hand and pulled her on the bed with Kasumi and me, making her yelp in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya-kun!”</p><p><br></p><p>Snaking my arm around her waist, I looked at her. “What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I… “ She spluttered, trying to find any words before taking a look at Kasumi.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don't mind it, Kanae-sama. I knew that Kazuya-sama would have other partners. Moreover, I would also love to have someone like you or Sera-sama as a sister.” Kasumi said in her usual calm tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… “ Kanae took a few moments to register the words and then turned red to her ears.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, you don't have to feel embarrassed. Now come here. I need another pillow.” I pulled her into a hug and surprisingly, Kasumi put her other hand on Kanae's head, softly caressing her hair. That’s when I realised something else. “Wait, what was that about Sera?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Didn’t Kazuya-sama say she was yours to the Medicine Prince?” Kasumi asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh that… well, that idiot was pestering Sera and I was worried that she might actually kill him or something. That's why I did that to pull her out of the situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>Changing the topic, I asked her something else. “Did you meet Shirone and Kuroka?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. They are very nice girls. Both of them care a lot about each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. They are going through a very hard period of time. Anyways, I guess you have questions. Go on. Ask away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…”</p><p><br>She hesitated but after some more prodding she asked several questions.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning to show her the summoning but resisted since the one with Rōen could have been dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>So I took this opportunity to explain things to her while eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are many worlds out there, more than you can even imagine. Some similar, some different. In some worlds, humans are the only species while in some others, Gods and Demons live together with them like in Kuroka’s world. For example, in Kanae’s world, demons were rampant… although they were originally humans or animals so I guess that’s different.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanae-sama is from a different world?” She asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. In my world, all Demons were created by the first Demon, Muzan Kibitsuji directly or indirectly. They were originally humans or animals.” Kanae nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, even Muzan was originally a human. He became like that due to using a drug to make himself immortal. He is missing a key ingredient which could have made him conquer his last weakness, that is sunlight. He is searching for it even now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Is that even possible?” She asked, surprised and horrified.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It is very much possible, as is changing a demon back to their human form. I even know the location of the missing ingredient although you don’t have to worry. With the strength we have, we can take down Muzan the next time we enter your world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya-sama, you will be going to Kanae-sama’s world?” Kazumi asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously. She has her siblings back there and I promised her to help her with the problem with Muzan. Don’t worry, we will not stay there. Just go and return in a while. In fact, if you are strong enough, I can take you there too… that is if you want to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would love to…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great then. It’s decided. Just make sure that you don’t tell any of this to anyone or not only I but this whole country will be in danger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will never…” She started to speak but I put a finger on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know, that’s why I told you this. Now, I am still feeling tired so how about you two give me a hug. I haven’t been able to do this for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t do anything while on the carriage because all my subordinates had exceptional hearing and would have heard everything going inside.</p><p><br></p><p>However, we were alone here and I didn’t have to worry about anyone interrupting us.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slid down their waists, landing on their bottoms, feeling their soft flesh on my palms and pulled them further into my embrace. They turned redder but their hands wrapped around my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>Feeling two beautiful girls on both sides like this I couldn’t help but think… Grandpa had a point.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you running like your legs are filled with lead? Run like you mean it, you maggots!” The shout made the kids who were straggling behind pick up their pace, charging ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>Holy Crap!</p><p><br></p><p>Rose was a demon instructor!</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked her to watch over the training of the new kids so that she could heal them in case they got injured during training. She agreed and even asked me for permission to allow her to choose people from the group.</p><p><br></p><p>I allowed it but I never thought she would be… like this…</p><p><br></p><p>A month had passed since I summoned Kuroka and Shirone. Both girls were learning about the history and background of this world, Shirone taking a bit more time due to her age.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiding their ears and tails wasn’t a big problem as Kuroka easily solved it with a few spells so they could even join others with their training.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, I got a rundown of the skills Kuroka had.</p><p><br></p><p>And boy did I luck out by summoning her.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I can understand why it took summoning that beast to summon someone like her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was already a High Class level and a strong one at that which meant she could destroy a mountain with her strongest attack. That’s already better than an average Kage level and equivalent to a lower numbered Jinchuriki.</p><p><br></p><p>But this was just her raw power and Kuroka was not exactly a power fighter.</p><p><br></p><p>She was more of a skill and technique type fighter so power was not exactly her strong point. She was an expert in Devil Magic, Yojutsu techniques which were Youkai Specific techniques also known as Fear in some factions in her world and best of all, Senjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>We finally had a sage.</p><p><br></p><p>And not just any Sage, her Senjutsu was actually a better version than the one used by humans of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world where humans emulated the methods used by other animals to use natural energy, Kuroka’s method directly manipulated it which reminded me a bit of the Six Paths Senjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>With some help and research, we could very well open a sage land for ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, all three known Sage Lands were contracted with Konoha, which kinda closed the lines for other villages.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want a contract with them because… well, they were kinda shady.</p><p><br></p><p>The less said about Mount Myoboku, the better.</p><p><br></p><p>They obviously knew about the Sage of Six Paths and his children and yet never took any steps to interfere or stop all this bloodshed, just sat back and watched, only supporting selected people at times.</p><p><br></p><p>Ryuchi Cave was dangerous and the snakes were extremely selfish and whimsical creatures. I am not going to be having any contact with them.</p><p><br></p><p>The Slugs of the Wet Bone Forest were… well, they were kinda unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing I knew about them was that Katsuyu was the largest summon among all three Sage lands as not even Sakura and Tsunade together could summon more than a tenth of the whole entity.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the sheer size would allow it to cover up tailed beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sage Lands were unique places as in they were within the elemental nations and yet they cannot be found by anyone. Each of these lands are surrounded by special Fuinjutsu which only allows those who search for it specifically to find them or they would just roam around the place without ever finding them.</p><p><br></p><p>I so want to find out what the seals used there were to use myself to hide some of the research facilities and plantations.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, with us already possessing the method to mutate normal animals, and now a sage like Kuroka, we could totally make a new Sage Land with the help of my Akashic Grimoire, maybe a Cat based Sage Land?</p><p><br></p><p>But all of these were long term plans.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest advantage Kuroka had over almost anyone in this world was her ability to get around. She could perfectly hide herself using Magic and Senjutsu and could get into and out of any place using teleportation. She could even hypnotise anyone using magic which worked a bit different from normal genjutsu and all this made her an incredible spy, something I had been lacking. With her around, we could do so many things that were previously out of our reach.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with her around, the Land of Flowers suddenly had a kage level, a decently strong one at that which gave us a way to protect ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I was going to disclose her to the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>I would prefer to have at least three to five Kage level people before disclosing one. We already saw how the Land of Sky ended. We didn’t need a repeat of that.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka had already started learning about Chakra and she was a bonafide genius at it, learning things at an incredible pace.</p><p><br></p><p>I can’t imagine how strong she will become in a few years, especially since she hasn’t even fully explored her original world’s powers to the fullest yet.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of five years, I was pretty sure she would be someone whose name could be counted on the same line as Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha and then… the Land of Flowers wouldn’t have to fear anyone anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>And Shirone can get to the same level too… yes, the summoning with Rōen was the best thing I had done.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, it took me almost a week to completely recover from the targeted summoning of Shirone. According to Kuroka, it wasn’t a problem of body or mind but rather of the soul. Even with my already strong soul, I had strained myself in that ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>Looks like I have to do the next soul ritual sooner than I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>It required three Demon or similar beings.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki knew the locations for some of them, having been the ones to have sealed them. I was planning to ask the Uzukage about the location of some of them when she next comes to meet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get up and start running!” My thoughts were broken by Rose’s voice who had just kicked a straggler who was actually healed of his fatigue and ran again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rose-san is… quite strict.” Kanae sweatdropped at the sight too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, I think she is perfect. I would have made them run without healing them.” Toji added and no one there doubted that the guy would do that… because he already did.</p><p><br></p><p>“The more injuries they suffer now, the less injured they will be on the field. I think Rose-dono’s training methods, while harsh… are actually the best we can provide these students.” Saitō added, surprising even Toji who threw a smirk at the man which the guy expertly ignored.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose got along surprisingly well with Saitō, both having been soldiers, commanding officers in their respective countries.</p><p><br></p><p>They might have different methods of teaching but they respected each other’s capabilities and treated each other politely.</p><p><br></p><p>Did that leave Toji as the only loner in our group?</p><p><br></p><p>Not at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Myaah~” Shirone, in her cat form purred in Toji’s arms as he scratched behind her ears.</p><p><br></p><p>No one had expected that man of all people to take a liking to Shirone or the girl to like the guy either.</p><p><br></p><p>His reason was that he was a cat person. Actually, he treated Shirone quite well, like a rowdy uncle of some sort.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had actually mellowed a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>I think getting the ability to use chakra had done wonders about his inferiority complex over not having Cursed Energy and the treatment of the Zen’in Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he had a power, far more versatile than Cursed Energy and he had thrown himself into exploring every intricacy of this power.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had recently reached the level where he could open the sixth gate, taking the lead in our group.</p><p><br></p><p>The two sisters were getting along with everyone in the group quite well and surprisingly, both got along with Toji.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she had brought news that had shocked Saitō. The news about Okita Souji, one of his closest friends being the Knight of Sirzechs Lucifer and the strongest Knight of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had complex feelings about the whole thing. On one hand, he knew that it was not the same guy as the one he knew but at the same time, he was happy that he was able to survive his illness.</p><p><br></p><p>It however only served to motivate the man to train even harder. I guess there was some healthy competition between the members of the Shinsengumi.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was a bit wary of everyone at the start but was slowly opening up after the girls accompanying her.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Kanae, she was deeply touched when she saw me pushing myself so far to summon Shirone and that’s why she could sit like she did, in her cat form, in my arms while we watched the training of the new batch of students. In fact, it was her who had helped me heal faster with her Senjutsu, which involved her sleeping with me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl did so… in her cat form.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, at least she wasn’t treating me like her previous master so that was a plus. We can get her to warm up more later on.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shiroyasha Uzumaki -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What does the letter say?” Her husband asked as she placed the letter aside.</p><p><br></p><p>She could understand the reason for his impatience.</p><p><br></p><p>The news could be the one which can decide the continued fate of the entire Uzumaki Clan. Even she was just as worried about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“The eighth team has confirmed the location of another continent, one almost as big as the elemental nations. They have also discovered that the people on that continent don’t even know of the existence of Chakra so there are no dangers to our Clan on those lands. They were even able to locate a place suitable for us to set up a village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They don’t even know about chakra?” Her husband asked, surprised. Even she had to reread the letter twice to verify that part.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, none of them have any idea about Chakra. Their culture is very different from the one in the Elemental Nations. Most of the continent is barren but there are parts of land suitable for cultivation which makes people fight over them. Nothing different from the Elemental Nations there. There are no big countries and things are still like the Sengoku Era there.” She explained further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, if there are no people with knowledge of Chakra, we would have no danger there. We can even develop and get more jobs for our people there without any worry about stepping on anyone’s foot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. The place is godsent for us. I don’t think we can get a better opportunity than this right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So… we move.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We do. But first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Prince of Flowers, eh. That boy has been more surprising than I had expected. The last letter from Genshiro just made him become more mysterious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Compared to the information and location of the new continent, the location of a sealed beast is nothing. While the fact that he could move it without anyone’s notice is surely worthy of praise but just that. We could have done the same with many other locations if we wanted.” She added on.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, when are you going for another visit?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“In a week. You on the other hand, start preparing for ships to begin the exodus. The injury of the Tsuchikage has led to them delaying the invasion as they don’t want to lose out on too many of their people. They are probably waiting for Onoki to heal before attacking. If they find out we are planning to move, they might leave all that caution to rest and attack us. We cannot let that happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Around twelve ships are already ready. We need twelve more or we can shift in two rounds. Currently people think we are planning to trade with the Land of Swamps and the Land of the Moon. Our people are buying ships in other lands and keeping them under disguises. We are modelling them to look the same. When the time to move comes, we can send several batches of people in those ships and make it look like they have gone to trade. The next batch of ships will pretend to be the same ones which had left earlier and pick up the rest and move away. We can complete buying and remodelling the ships in a month. It’s just that we will have problems buying supplies for the journey and a few months at least till we are settled there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? What’s the problem?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Getting such large amounts of food during the wartime is extremely hard. Moreover, our properties cannot be liquidated so easily without tipping anyone off so it will be hard to gather funds too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… that is indeed a problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Perhaps we could buy some supplies from our newest ally. In return, we can transfer some of our properties and items which we cannot take to him. The Land of Flowers has a surplus of food from what I have heard and could sell some to us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Yes. That’s plausible. He could get the supplies for us. Alright, I will talk to him about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then… what do we do about Konoha?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her husband’s question made her face blanch. “Nothing. We do nothing for now. They will be treated just like any other. A small group of the old ones have decided against moving. They said that they were born on this land and wish to be buried here. They will cover for us while we are gone, using clones to give a feeling of the village still being populated. Meanwhile, they will set traps for any invaders. None of them took the fact that we were being forced to flee lightly. They wish to bury everyone who dares to attack us. They will manage Konoha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those old fools are really stubborn.” Her husband shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your father and grandfather are among them, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still doesn’t change anything. They are planning something big but haven’t told me what it is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave them be. They would never do anything to jeopardise our escape.” She advised making him nod. “Although it seems they will be suffering some kind of accident sometime soon.” She added</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Konoha had sent people disguised as Iwa shinobi to loot and burn villages in the Land of Flowers to cause friction between them and disturb their line of supply.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They did what?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The Prince encountered one such village while he was on his way to the Land of Medicine and immediately chased and killed them. He was even able to look through their disguise immediately. Konoha not only failed their goal but also made an enemy out of that person. Genshiro said that each of his retainers had the strength to take him on in a battle.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… does it affect our side of the deal in any way?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. The Prince was quite understanding about the whole thing although from Genshiro’s words, he was extremely angry at the sight of the massacred villagers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As he should be. I know I would be enraged if someone did that to any of our people. Seriously, what is Konoha turning into? I doubt we would even recognise it in a few years at this rate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Perhaps we won’t. Mito-sama’s condition has deteriorated. They have requested for a team of Fuinjutsu Masters to assist in the transfer of the Kyuubi. After she is gone…”</p><p><br></p><p>“We will face whatever comes our way.” Her husband assured her. “By the way, have you chosen whom to send to the Land of Flowers apart from the three already there?” Her husband asked and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Yes, I have someone in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… I still can’t believe we have to do this…” Her husband sighed. She put a hand on his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Time changes and those who cannot keep up with it… perish. As ninjas, the first thing we are taught is to be adaptable. The lives of our people are more important than our pride and who knows, we might be able to return in the future?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… we can at least hope so.” Her husband nodded too.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ruling by the Book’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are looking good finally.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kazuya finally has his first Kage level in the form of a cute Cat Girl.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Butterflies have also started flapping their wings.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>How will things turn out in the future?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

I will take a day off today.” Star said as we entered the gates of Llyne. The past three days were spent on hunting.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Rose and Star got to T4 on the way here. Star got the Swordsman class and Rose got the Warrior Class. Bina got her Mage Class too.</p><p><br></p><p>We had enough Skill Books for them to get a decent Skill Set. Bina was using Veena’s spare equipment while Suikazura-san had extra  equipment for Rose.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that the rest were getting close to their T5 Classes too. It’s just that the enemies on the way were just too weak for our team and so I only got one level.</p><p><br></p><p>I had more than enough swords for Star too so the equipment was not a problem for us. All that was left was for Star to level his Class to max level so he can select the T5 Class of his choice.</p><p><br></p><p>These levels however took us some time to grind.</p><p><br></p><p>Funny enough, by the time we reached Llyne, the Guild actually levelled up.</p><p><br></p><p>The new Guild level gave us one perk point which we decided to save. There was still the Power of Friendship Perk Level 3 with 15% Exp Gain Boost which needed three points. We had planned to get that first.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing which happened was the number of members increasing to two hundred. With that all the members were added to the Guild.</p><p><br></p><p>“You head to the Guild then. I will show Suikazura-san and Whistler to the Inn.” Shiroe offered.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally we would have more room at the guild but we had offered those rooms to the girls we had rescued. They had no place to live and had offered to work for the Guild so we offered them the empty rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to buy a property for Guild Dorms. I am very sure people would easily pay a lot of money to stay there.” Star said.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a good idea.” I agreed. It could be another privilege our guild offers, attracting better players.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. We can do that but we should consider developing your territory in Greenfrost with the money we have if you want to make an investment. That’s the place you can earn the best returns.” Veena offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Develop territory?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You did get a territory, didn’t you? Do you know where that territory is in Greenfrost?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s on the outskirts. Greenfrost is a province and I was given undeveloped land on its outskirts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. We need to check the map. We were going to Greenfrost to sell our wares either way. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to check the area too. Not to mention, Greenfrost is a higher level area. We can even stay there and hunt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we go there after a month. We have been away from the guild for a while and need to work things out.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, we parted ways, with Star and Elaine taking Damon to the Guild to act as a gatekeeper.</p><p><br></p><p>Bina and Rose followed us to our house.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the house and they followed me in.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess we would need to clean everything before resting.” I said looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>We had been away for a while and it showed. Everything had a thin film of dust on it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will get that done.” Bina offered, already in her maid mode.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I will help out too.” Rose offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, we can all lend a hand. It will get things done faster.” Veena said and Bina looked like she was about to deny when she added. “Moreover, I am dying to test my new magic… properly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“New Magic?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s a nifty Spell called Clean.” She snapped her finger and the dust on the couch disappeared immediately. “Very convenient and versatile.” Veena threw me a discreet wink.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose looked confused while I recalled the versatile use of the magic making me hard. Seriously, she never stops with her teasing.</p><p><br></p><p>We got to work and within half an hour, everything was cleaned.</p><p><br></p><p>“You two can stay in the other room. It’s mostly unused as Arthas and I mostly share a room. We can shift to a bigger house soon.” Veena offered. Bina nodded while Rose was slightly embarrassed at the reminder.</p><p><br></p><p>We were tired and it was already late evening by the time we were done so we took turns to take our baths and retired for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it usually like this?” Rose asked me as I watched the crowd surrounding our Guild Building to get an invite.</p><p><br></p><p>Last time many had been doubtful, not that I had made it any easy for them but this time, they have had the chance to see the effects of the Guild Perks and thus the crowd in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s larger this time, not something unexpected though. Unfortunately for them, we already have people who had reserved their seats. These people will just have to reserve their seats and wait for the next Guild Update.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe was taking care of the crowd with Elaine. Thankfully, I didn’t have to deal with them myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally this kind of situation would have caused fights to break out but I had already contacted the Knight Academy and they had increased the patrol in this area to prevent anyone from acting stupidly. And on top of that, we had our hammer in Damon, standing behind Shiroe and Elaine, glaring at anyone who tried to cause a ruckus. The guy was channelling all his inner hate towards the crowd and a T6 was not someone any of these people wanted to provoke.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the day after we had returned and the news of the Guild levelling up had spread almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say, the Guild Building was surrounded within an hour so we had to announce that we would be recruiting people the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>None of us was in the mood to work after the whole ordeal we had been through.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, no sense in wasting any time here. Let’s go. We need to check the place we are planning to buy. Will you be joining us?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was busy with work and Bina was helping her. Star was off to the Black Market with the new members to check for any information about T5 Class Change. So that only left Rose and me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I had talked to Kenneth and asked him for any properties which were for sale and he pointed us to a few properties around the area.</p><p><br></p><p>We roamed around and checked the places and Rose made a note of everything.</p><p><br></p><p>She really is good as a secretary.</p><p><br></p><p>It was evening by the time we returned home where a strange sight greeted us.</p><p><br></p><p>Bina, in a maid uniform, was cooking while Veena was working on her medicine.</p><p><br></p><p>It was strange to me for two reasons. First, I was used to seeing Veena cooking and second… where did she get the maid uniform?</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did you get that maid uniform, Bina?” Fortunately Rose was also curious about the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“In Sabaody. I got it from one of the shops there.” She replied not turning back.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are both back. How did the search go?” Veena asked, noticing our presence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quite fruitful. Rose made a list.” I signalled the girl who brought out the parchment and placed it on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>“We saw eight properties and five of them are buildings in good condition, two are abandoned and in bad condition. We will need to renovate the entire thing and the last place… well, people called it haunted.” She reported.</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think we might have a quest in that house.” I added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. And these are in the budget too. I think we can buy one of the buildings in good condition first and make it a dorm for our Guild Members. The money we get from that can be used to buy the abandoned property and slowly renovate it. As for the haunted building, while the possibility of it being a quest is high, we still don’t know what level of quest that is and how long it will take us to complete it. Delaying this project for long is just wasting time and money.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I was thinking the same. In fact, we can use the monthly rent from the first building to renovate the second building over time. In a few months, the players would have enough money and level to move away from this town and we will lose the best time to earn.” I added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. We can finalise the deal tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. How were things on your end?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, a lot of pending work. Mira has been maintaining everything well but she is new and there is only so much she can do alone. Now with the new girls in the management, things will be progressing soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good to see they are settling down well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, they are drowning themselves in work to get a resemblance of normalcy after what they have been through and we have several new projects to start. I was thinking of establishing a brand with our Guild’s name and using it to start a business chain. Shiroe and Elaine have specifically been looking for tailors and blacksmiths this time around to add to our guild so that we can use the new blueprints we got from Sabaody. We are also opening a shop to sell the Medicine and items we import from Sabaody.”</p><p><br></p><p>While we were talking, Shiroe and the rest returned too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything done on that side?” I asked as they took seats. “We are short of seats. Remind me to get some more chairs.” I realised as there was no place for me and Bina to sit by the end.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, we can manage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how were things?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh they were annoying. They were paying up to five thousand gold coins to book the seat. Charging only two thousand was painful.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a matter of principle. We are not short on money so I’d rather not change our rules for just this much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well I understand and agree with that… didn’t make it any less painful. That was almost five hundred thousand to a million gold coins.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah… that was painful.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, we got the members. I left ten slots for emergencies. Five hundred people booked for the next round even when I told them that we would only have three hundred more places open after the next update. We have a million and five hundred thousand gold coins including the first month’s guild charges and the reservation charges.”</p><p><br></p><p>…damn.</p><p><br></p><p>“Star.”</p><p><br></p><p>He pulled out several parchments from his inventory and placed them in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>We checked the parchments while he explained on the side. “Rose can try Magic Warrior Class. It’s basically similar to the Magic Knight. Needs a Mage and Warrior. She can easily get the Mage by using the Class Change Card and keep working on her Warrior Class and directly change when she is a full level warrior.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rose looked at the information of the Class and was happy too.</p><p><br></p><p>“If it’s really like Magic Knight then it might even have higher classes. I think you should go for this first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This is good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We actually found something good for Veena too. A Pharmacist and Mage can actually unlock a rare Witch Class. It’s a T5 Class which can craft and also use curses and dark magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… that does sound interesting.” She took a look at the Class and the skills it could offer and was actually considering it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mage has a T5 Class called the Sorcerer which can be obtained after taking a test in the Magic Academy. I am going for that.” Shiroe had already decided on his path so we didn’t search other classes for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Bina decided to go for the same but instead of the Sorcerer option, she decided to go for the High Mage which was an alternative route of Sorcerer.</p><p><br></p><p>We also explained to them the plan about the Guild Dorms and the business plans which Veena was thinking of implementing.</p><p><br></p><p>“That sounds reasonable. We can get it done in the next two days while we scout the next field boss. Oh and you have to address the new Guild Members too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ughh… is that really necessary?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is. The whole Guild runs on your face right now. We need to increase your brand value so that our products can be trusted more.” Veena explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… okay. We can have a party for the new members and I will address them there.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus step by step, our plans formed.</p><p><br></p><p>We all had dinner and I won’t lie, Bina was a great cook… even better than Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>It was late at night when everyone left for their own residences.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up between Veena’s breasts the next day… currently my favourite way to wake up.</p><p><br></p><p>That alone helped me look forward to the new day.</p><p><br></p><p>We got dressed up and left the room to find Bina already cooking in the kitchen while Rose was working on the accounts books from yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>These two… when did they get up?</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.” I greeted the two and decided to do something productive too.</p><p><br></p><p>I had gained several skills and each one of them was useful so I decided to take some time to level them up.</p><p><br></p><p>Observation, Armament and Soru could be levelled at the same time. I wanted to get to a decent enough level. It would ensure that I could hold my own against the boss monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>In doing so I noticed that the speed of the two Haki levelling up was far lower with normal practice than it was with a fight. In fact, the speed of training Observation Haki on my own was just abysmal.</p><p><br></p><p>Around an hour later, breakfast was ready and we sat down to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>Bina was actually standing on the side, serving us but not eating together.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she really going to do this maid stuff the whole time?</p><p><br></p><p>“Bina.” I called out to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Do you need something?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Join us for breakfast.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I will have my breakfast after I am done serving.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can serve ourselves. Join us. We are all friends here. No need to act as a maid.”</p><p><br></p><p>She paused for a moment and looked at me quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>The silence stretched more than I was comfortable with.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally it was Veena who broke the silence. “It’s fine, Arthas. Bina… she does this because she likes this, not because someone forces her. Let her do as she wants.”</p><p><br></p><p>“…oh.” At that point I didn’t know what I should say. So this woman had a maid fetish?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean the Lucifuge were made to serve the Lucifer House. Was it something hardwired in their DNA? I mean I remember Euclid also being a lackey to Rizevim so maybe it could. Who knows?</p><p><br></p><p>The silence was a bit awkward so I decided to concentrate on my food. “This is very good. You are a great cook, Bina.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Master Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I really didn’t know how to deal with her. It’s not like I didn’t have maids. In fact I even had a butler assigned to me as my parents were very busy. Still… there was something about her professionalism which made even Albert, my butler seem like a novice… which he would be considering how long she has actually been working as a maid.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena sensed my awkwardness and initiated another conversation. “How is your training going? You don’t look happy today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… yes. My skills are not growing fast enough by training alone. I think I need to fight more to level them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, yes. Fighting is always better to learn. Actually, why don’t you try going to the Knight’s Academy? We need to get the bounty quest for the bosses too. Maybe you can try sparring with the Knights of Llyne? In fact, you can even try fighting with Damon. A T6 would be good enough to put pressure on you. And since it will be sparring, you won’t die either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That… yes. Why didn’t I think of that? Thank you, Veena. I will talk to Kenneth and train with them.” Kenneth would obviously help out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, actually, you can take Rose with you too. She needs to get her skills levelled up as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl who looked embarrassed to ask me and nodded. “Sure. I don’t see why not. She is a frontline fighter too. Maybe we can get to know each other and learn how to cooperate better.”</p><p><br></p><p>After breakfast, we left for work.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena and Bina went to buy the properties we had seen while Rose and I left for the Knight’s Academy.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth had been very helpful. In fact, the Knights often sparred against each other.</p><p><br></p><p>I was however a T5 and there were not many knights of that level. Kenneth himself was one and he himself accompanied me to a spar.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I had fought a trained NPC of similar level and Kenneth was a Shield Knight, which meant his defence was rock solid.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want to brag but I was pretty sure my attacks could hurt any Tier 5 but Kenneth, the guy was tanking my attacks as if they were no one’s business.</p><p><br></p><p>Shield Knight had insane defence increase skills but the most annoying one was definitely the counter skills. They had a skill which could reflect damage from melee attacks and even melee skills. It meant one of my skills could be reflected if I went in carelessly and I could damage myself from a full powered attack of a Man Slayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, I didn’t want that.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, training with him did increase Armament Haki faster than before. Even the speed of Observation was faster than normal.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was T5 Level 36 while I was just T5 Level 13. He had twenty six levels on me but I made up for that with my passive skills and still had more stats than him and he was still keeping up with me with skill and experience alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The man showed me that having skills is not important. How to use them was the most important thing. He could make me doubt that he was going to use his counter skills whenever I tried to use my skills, making me stop and change my move, even giving him some chance to counter attack. He was a master of mind games and it was my first time fighting against such a person. I… didn’t like these kinds of opponents.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a good spar. I haven’t had a chance to move like that in a while. Just how do you train, kid? I am pretty sure you will surpass me in no time. Maybe you should try sparring with the City Lord. He is a Lord Knight with skills far beyond mine. You would learn a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered something and asked him the question which had been hounding my mind for a long time. “Say Kenneth. Doesn’t one have to be a Tier 6 to be made the Lord of the City? Then how is the City Lord one with just a T5 Class?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, there are more than one reasons for that. First you do realise that there are around eight hundred cities in our Kingdom, right. There are obviously not that many Tier 6 to fill up the spaces. That’s why if someone has the strength of a Sixth Tier and has made great contributions to the Kingdom, they can sometimes be granted the position of the City Lord. Our City Lord is one such individual.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Strength of a Sixth Tier?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Not all classes are of the same level. The difference between a Lord Knight and Sword and Shield Knights is great. They are the masters of both sword and shield, true experts so a very High Level Lord Knight can sometimes rival even some T6 people with skills alone. There is also the matter of extra skills, equipment and martial arts learned by the person to make up for the gap.” He explained and I nodded in understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s… not exactly a big secret but our lord is planning to sit for the assessment for the Grand Knight, a T6 Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Knights have advancements beyond Lord Knight?” I asked, curious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously. There is the T6 Grand Knight and T7 Imperial Knight, the ones who protect the King and serve as both his sword and shield. There are only about a dozen of them in the entire Kingdom.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the Holy Knights?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that’s more of a Church thing. The Church holds a significant amount of power in the Kingdom as well. Holy Knights are those who use Light or Holy Magic with their skills. There are also Magic Knights who use Magic with Swordsmanship. They can be upgraded to Mystic Knight.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Magic Knights are different. I had thought they were the predecessor class for Holy Knights.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him, slightly confused. “So aren’t these two paths better than just physical knights?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man didn’t look offended and instead laughed. “That depends on how you look at it. Light and Holy Magic can be used to heal and purify so it’s very useful against dark creatures. Holy Knights are the strongest against such foes. Magic on the other hand is extremely versatile making the Magic Knights the most versatile ones. But that doesn’t mean they are the strongest. While they have different skills, at the same time, their physical stats are lower than those of Grand Knights. Grand Knights can simply mow down the enemies with their superior strengths and speed so much so that if it’s just a fight between the three types of Knights… we almost <em>always</em> win.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If that’s the case then why don’t more people try becoming Grand Knights?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who told you they don’t? Tell me, can you use a Butcher’s Knife for all your knife needs?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. And just like a chef needs different types of knives, a Kingdom needs different types of knights too. Each has enemies they are very good against and thus have their own advantages and disadvantages.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how do we become a Grand Knight?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, want to aim for that, do you? Well, I am sorry but I can’t help you there. We don’t know the requirements to become a Grand Knight except that you need to be a Lord Knight to even have the Class available. Also, since you are not a Lord Knight yet, let me tell you something which people don’t always tell others. You should never select a Shield or Sword Knight even if you have them available. You cannot level up your skills later and unlock Lord Knight again. Once you select any of these two, your chances of getting a Lord Knight is permanently cut off. I… kinda got stuck on the same thing.” He said, wincing slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn… there are such things hidden in the game?</p><p><br></p><p>I am kinda glad I got Man Slayer when I did.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a while after which he sent some other Knights to spar against me. Safe to say I wrecked them all one-sidedly.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose also sparred with some of them and she was doing relatively well.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the Knight’s Academy and went back to the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, I started a conversation with Rose.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was quite good.You are really talented with the Spear. Have you learned how to use a spear before?” I asked</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. It was in the Valkyrie Academy back at home…” She paused, probably by the thoughts of home.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know her well enough so I didn’t know what to say here so I gave her some time before speaking again.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is an academy to train Valkyries? That sounds quite fantastical. I… am sorry if I am very curious. It’s just that all this is… quite new to me and I can’t help but be curious. You can obviously tell me if I ask something I shouldn't. I am not really familiar with what I can and cannot ask.” I smiled, embarrassedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no. It’s fine. It’s not a big deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what else do they teach in the Valkyrie Academy?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose started explaining and after a while we were having fun. She was quite enthusiastic when explaining things and by the end of it, I wasn’t even trying to make small talk and was actually enjoying learning about the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The novels had been so vague, concentrating more on boobs than on the grand world outside to explore.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we reached home, she was in a much better mood than she had been in all the time I had known her.</p><p><br></p><p>When we reached the Guild, the rest of the group were already there.</p><p><br></p><p>They were having a break in the meeting room on the third floor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arty, come on. We have cookies.” Star welcomed showing me a cookie before taking a bite.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy… he really had a big sweet tooth.</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes and took a seat beside him and took a cookie from the plate and took a bite. “Hmm, delicious”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right. Miss Bina is awesome. I could totally kiss her hands.” He praised making several others in the room laugh while the woman in question was stoic as always.</p><p><br></p><p>“How were things on your side?” I asked, looking at Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything went fine.” She summoned and returned me the Baron’s badge. They had used my Badge and identity as a noble to buy the properties under my name.</p><p><br></p><p>“The first property can be put to use with slight adjustments and we can have people staying there in a few days while the other one will take a bit more time. I bought it because it was dirt cheap and can be sold for a profit after renovation if we cannot use it. We will have space for around eighty people in the first building while one hundred and twenty can be occupied in the next building after all the renovations. In the meantime, we can take the names of the people who wish to move to the guild dorms.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “We will also need to arrange something for the food issue.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That has already been taken care of. There are some people with the Cook Class. They are mostly those who do not wish to fight anymore and are looking for ways to survive in this game. We have hired them as the guild staff to cook. This way, they can gain experience and also some funds to support themselves without having to fight anymore. I was planning to use the profits from the dorms to build a place for the kids who are stuck in the game. We didn’t have the means to help them before but now that we do, we should try our best.” She added.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… great. Buy another one of the abandoned properties and renovate it. That can be used as a Child Care Center. We can make an announcement about the dorms at the party tomorrow.” I then turned towards Star. Whistler and Star had gone to scout the boss we were planning to hunt. “How did your task go?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, awesome. We found the location of the next boss and investigated it. We can launch an attack on it in a week.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So the tiger then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Unless you want to face the Rhino again.” He smirked at the dirty look I gave him at the mention of the Rhino.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, what’s the deal with this Rhino? You all seem to have a story there.” Suikazura-san asked. “Is it too strong to kill?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh we killed it.” Star replied, to her question. “We just didn’t fight it.” He then went on to explain what we had done and that finally made them understand why I was so disgusted by the monster.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have seen Arthas fight… and that monster. Yeah. We are not ready for that, at least not yet.” She agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, a good thing we are going after the tiger, which in some ways is more troublesome. It’s far faster than the Rhino. It also can jump to the rear and attack the ones at the rear of the team. To fight it, we need to restrict its mobility or we wouldn’t survive.” Shiroe suggested. “I will make a plan of action tonight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I too found out some information about some T6 and T7 Classes.” I told them what Kenneth had told me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you already qualify for a Magic Knight, don’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. The strength of Grand Knight would suit my style more though.” Especially with the Haki buffs. “I will try raising the level of my swordsmanship and shield skills on the side for the Lord Knight promotion and prepare to become a Grand Knight. We don’t know any other suitable T6 Classes for me yet so this is the best I can think of.” And now it was the time this game started becoming more about the grind.</p><p><br></p><p>Each Class will take other Classes or high requirements to unlock and even more time to level up.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, this is what MMO’s have always been about.</p><p><br></p><p>In all this, I have the advantage of getting rewards through references.</p><p><br></p><p>Going by the trend, if they have Goblin Slayer and Man Slayer then they might have other Slayer Classes as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Was there a Demon and Dragon Slayer?</p><p><br></p><p>I have tried quotes from those anime but they haven’t worked. Could it be that the Game Master hasn’t used them or is it just that I haven’t used them in a proper situation yet?</p><p><br></p><p>I haven’t given up and have been trying any and all references I could remember relentlessly at every opportunity I could. But that didn’t mean I stopped looking for other methods. If that doesn’t work out, I need to start working on higher Classes. The next bonus will mean 10% more experience for being the first T6 Class user. I cannot lose it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. By the way, what about the welcome party in the Guild?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can have it tomorrow. I will ask some of my friends to help prepare for it. You can announce it in the Guild Chat and inform everyone about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then.”</p><p><br></p><p>I posted the information about the welcoming party and within minutes the Guild Chat flooded with comments…</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone seemed excited about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Great then.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Good evening everyone. Some of you might already know me but for those who don’t, I am Arthas, the Guild Master of the Fairy Tail Guild.” I started as the crowd on the first floor calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know the last few months have been very stressful, even traumatic for most of us. We have lost things precious to us, our family, loved ones… our normal lives. But it’s because of this that we must cherish the good moments we can have here so as to not lose hope. Thus we have organised this party for everyone to help bring some joy to us and encourage us to work hard together to win this game.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a bit of silence before someone clapped and then others joined the first person one after another.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we…” Suddenly someone spoke, attracting the attention of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked in the direction and it was a guy, around my age. He was wearing glasses and was actually looking comfortable with people staring at him. The ID name was Black Shooter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?” I asked.</p><p><br>“Can we… really win this game? Can we get out after winning this?” He asked, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him and felt sorry. The guy wasn’t trying to cause trouble. If anything, he just wanted reassurance. He wanted to hear someone say this.</p><p><br></p><p>I stepped on the railing of the second floor and jumped down to the first floor and walked up to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked a bit scared so I put a hand on his shoulder. “No need to be afraid. What is your name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am… my name is Keith.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Keith… I won’t lie to you that I know everything. In fact I don’t. I don’t know if we can get out of this game by winning… but… I am willing to try. I am not going to sit here and accept defeat. As for beating the game… I truly believe that as long as all of us work together, as long as we truly give it our all, we can win… so don’t lose hope.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked sad but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of something and added. “The most difficult thing in this world is not to win this game…” I said, making him look up to me. Please work. Oh, please work. “The hardest thing in this world is to live in it. Be brave. Live.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+18 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+36% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Monster Slayer Class Unlocked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I bit my tongue to control the urge to laugh and stop it with just a smile. I don’t believe it. It worked.</p><p><br></p><p>It seriously worked. After trying so many quotes and acting like an idiot, this one was the one that worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you, Buffy.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy nodded and the rest of the members encouraged him too. It was the start of a decent guild.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the time to get to know the members of the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>We had one hundred and ninety members as of now and it will only continue to grow in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>The members we have now, could go on to become the core of the guild in the future so knowing them was given.</p><p><br></p><p>I even took some time to talk to Gareth and his team who seemed far more friendly this time.</p><p><br></p><p>They have been working their asses off and the guy himself had reached T4 already and his teammates were getting there too. They had completed the most number of quests, just behind our group and contributed a lot to the levelling of the Guild so the decision of bringing them into the guild was not a mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting with Bina and Rose had made me realise something very important. There is only so much we can do by ourselves. Both Bina and Rose were very good players and yet they had been reduced to slaves because the other players in their town had not been on par with them.</p><p><br></p><p>We needed a group of strong players to face the World Quests which will be occuring in the coming days and that’s why holding a grudge over a trade would be short sighted. That’s why I had especially come to have a chat with Gareth.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Dwain… nah, fuck that guy.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the party, it was time for another announcement.</p><p><br></p><p>I clapped my hands and the crowd’s attention gathered towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have another announcement to make on this day. We have noticed that most of the players in our guild are staying in the Inn and due to the rise in the number of players in the town, the Inns are charging more money than they used to charge previously. This is becoming a problem for the players who wish to save up money for the equipment and consumables.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were several nods of agreements and grumbling among the players for this reason. The game did become harder the more the players went forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“To solve this problem, our Guild has decided to open up dorms for the Guild members.” And just like that the crowd erupted in discussions once more. Several questions were thrown at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised a hand to calm them down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me finish. Most of you can get the answers by then.” The crowd was slightly placated and I continued. “Currently the charge of living in the Inn with food served is eighty gold coins per day. This amounts to two thousand and four hundred gold coins a month. We are offering the same for twelve hundred gold to two thousand gold coins a month depending on the room you choose. We will have room for eighty people in less than a week and for the rest in around two weeks. You can register for the places in the guild tomorrow morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We will be putting up a list with all the rules and queries on the guild board and you can read them from there.” Shiroe added too.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, Veena stepped forward. “Apart from this, we are opening up shops with the Fairy Tail Guild’s name to sell the items made by our guild members. I would like to clear it out before anyone asks anything. You will not be forced to sell your items through the guild but you can do so if you desire. We will take a smaller cut than the ones taken by the Alchemist Guild for the sales. The details will be put up on the board too. But if someone has any questions, they can talk to Elaine, one of our Guild Officers.” She added.</p><p><br></p><p>“That brings me to the last announcement. Our Guild will have dedicated roles. I as the Guild Master will be at the top. Below me will be the Guild Administrators. Under them will be the Guild Officers who will manage the day to day affairs of the Guild, basically the staff of the Guild. Then comes the Veterans of the Guild, basically people who have been in the guild for a long time. Finally will be the new recruits. There will be privileges for Veterans which will be added later on. This is just a basic structure for now. We will expand more of this as time goes on. Thank you all for joining our Guild. Let’s all work together to make Fairy Tail, the best guild in the game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>The party ended a while later and we all left for our homes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rossweisse -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She held her spear above her head to defend against the swipe from the tiger. The attack was heavy. Far heavier than she had been expecting as she was flung to the side from the impact and hit a rock.</p><p><br></p><p>They were out to hunt a T5 Boss, the Gray Striped Tiger.</p><p><br></p><p>They had gathered all the information they could about the tiger, which was not that much. It was not hard to understand why either.</p><p><br></p><p>Their group was the strongest in the town and probably the entire game right now. Other players wouldn’t even dream of confronting T5 Monsters let alone a T5 Boss.</p><p><br></p><p>As they fought, they realised that this tiger was no less troublesome than the Rhino which Arthas keeps complaining about.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she hadn’t seen him complaining about anything else. Too bad that none of the participants of that fight ever speak of what they did to defeat the Rhino. The only clue she had was the blanching of Arthas’ face whenever that topic was brought up… which was a big testament to something crazy happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas apparently had muted emotions that improved over time but the effects were still there.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t easily show off his emotions, always tending to remain stoic. It reminded her of Bina in a way.</p><p><br></p><p>This tiger however, while not as sturdy as the Rhino, was equally troublesome. The first move it used was a Roar Skill which cast a strength and speed debuff on them, making it hard to deal with its already insane speed. Second, the longer they fought, the darker the stripes on the tiger became and the stronger its attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>And when the stripes became completely black, it let out the roar again, recasting the debuff on them.</p><p><br></p><p>The tiger didn’t stay in one place either and was always on the move, often jumping behind the lines to attack the ones at the back.</p><p><br></p><p>This made it harder to pin it down somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>The solution they had thought for this was to create Walls of Earth or Ice in front of it whenever it was about to leap forward. Right now all three Mages in their group had the skill, Bina having learned it using a Skill Book.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously the wall didn’t trap it. It just made it fail the leap and fall down on the ground, stunned for a while, a chance they exploited by raining their strongest skills on it.</p><p><br></p><p>The impact against the rock disoriented her slightly and the tiger didn’t miss this. It jumped on her and she tried to put her spear in front of her to defend or at least reduce the damage. But at that moment, a figure appeared in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas raised his shield and faced the tiger’s attack. The clash between the two sent shockwaves around the area, blowing her hair. Arthas however didn’t move back and held his ground. His sword lit up with a golden light as he used a skill directly on the tiger’s leg, making it howl.</p><p><br></p><p>He then raised his hand and a ray of light fell on him and illuminated them both and she saw her health rise back to the green.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose also noticed the damage that attack had caused to the monster. It was almost equivalent to a dozen of her own skills… He really is the strongest player in the game.</p><p><br></p><p>All the previous times they had seen him fighting, it was against enemies of a lower level so she wasn’t able to feel just how strong he was.</p><p><br></p><p>She had seen him fight against Kenneth, the Knight Captain of Llyne and that battle was a draw but then again, Kenneth was over twenty levels higher than Arthas and even then he was lacking in strength and speed. He was only keeping up with experience, something which Arthas lacked due to only being self taught for several months.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose had rarely seen such talent even among the warriors of Valhalla. In fact, if he had been a warrior, he would most definitely be the top of his class. Then again, with his manners, he would never fit in with that rowdy bunch.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly several vines shot up from the ground and bound the tiger in its place. She quickly used this chance to get up and rejoin the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>One of her skills had become available again and she used the Focused Strike, on the Tiger’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>It howled and tried to sweep her away but the vines got in the way and Arthas was there, shielding her from another attack, this time pushing it back before jumping away.</p><p><br></p><p>The tiger stumbled and at the same time several blasts of magic landed on its legs, both injuring it and destroying the vines, causing more damage to it. Next up was Suikazura who jumped and hit the tiger once more in the eyes, making it roar in anger. Suikazura was normally such a sweet and calm person but when fighting, she completely changed. She reminded Rose of some of the older valkyries from Asgard.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, everyone in the team were people who could make great warriors even by Asgard standards and that was saying something.</p><p><br></p><p>The tiger tried to jump away but this time it suddenly stumbled back.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s injured. Go all out.” Shiroe shouted and they began attacking in earnest.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Arthas thrust his blade to the ground as his fist lit up, lightning gathering around it. A sound similar to thousands of birds chirping sounded as Arthas disappeared from his place and thrust his fist directly into the tiger’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>The beast collapsed with a final howl.</p><p><br></p><p>With that, all of them collapsed on their backs.</p><p><br></p><p>She had trained with some of the best of the warriors in Asgard to hunt down fierce magical beasts during her Academy days. This was like living it all over again.</p><p><br></p><p>Only this time, her teammates didn’t try to talk her down for being boring or a bookworm or not having a boyfriend or…</p><p><br></p><p>“Rose.” She heard Suikazura’s voice and looked up at the woman who wouldn’t have been odd even if she were to sit among the valkyries of Asgard looking at her worriedly.</p><p><br>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… yes. I was just caught off guard by the strength of the attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s probably because its strength increased as the stripes got darker. After it roared, the strength reset back to the usual level. It’s an annoying boss.” Shiroe replied as he stepped forward and looked at Arthas. “Is that why you were tanking all its attacks with skills later on?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah… I thought it was going to do some other super charged move so I tanked it with Limitless the first time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… I will have to change our strategy more to accommodate it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, let’s check the loot. This is the first kill of this boss. The experience gained was good. Let’s hope we get something good.” Star added.</p><p><br></p><p>They checked the loot and Rose found a Skill Book.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a Skill Book. Intimidating Roar.” She read out the description. “Reduces the attack and movement speed of the opponents. Is this the Tiger’s Skill?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. Sounds like that. We got the Rhino’s skill after the first kill too. I guess the chances of dropping those skills are the highest on the first kill.” Star said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, another Skill Book. Stored Power, increases attack the more the user is in battle up to a total of 5%. Resets after 30 seconds if the user doesn’t attack the opponent in that time.” Arthas said as he read the description. He thought for a moment and then threw the book towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>She caught it hurriedly and looked at him confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“This skill will suit you better.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A pair of boots. Increases Jumping Power.” Star said as he picked up a piece of equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Give that to Suikazura-san.” Shiroe said. “It suits her fighting style.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rose agreed with it too. She often used leaps and jumps in her attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>They harvested the Tiger’s fur and teeth which were quest items and crafting materials and headed back towards their home.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose looked at them, talking and joking with each other… and it didn’t feel bad.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter was mostly returning back to the usual pace after the Sabaody Arc.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I tried exploring some classes for a bit to add to the lore.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Feel free to drop any ideas for the lore or Class Trees which I can use.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will be concentrating a bit on Territory Development next and then we will move on to the next World Quest so there will be some small time skips in between.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will also see what other groups are doing and the condition of the real world and maybe get some development with the valkyrie and the maid.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Isekai Restaurant</strong><br><br><br><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong><br><br><br><strong>Chapter 17: Tohru and Milim’s day out</strong><br><br><br><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong><br><br><br><strong>- Silas -</strong><br><br><br>We searched around for Naruto and Kanna but found no clues anywhere.<br><br><br>An hour or so later, even the Masters of Ryozanpaku arrived at the Restaurant looking worried. Just as we were thinking of going out and searching once more, the door to the Restaurant opened and in came both Kanna and Naruto.<br><br><br>“Naruto, Kanna!” Miu rushed towards them and hugged both the kids tightly.<br><br><br>Even we let out a sigh of relief as they looked safe and sound. Hayato-san went ahead and checked on them. “The kids are fine.”<br><br><br>“Where did the two of you go?” Miu asked, angry. I could understand her anger too. She looked worried out of her mind. But angry as she might have been, she was still hugging the kids close to her as if afraid that she would lose them again.<br><br><br>“I… I am sorry, Miu nee-chan. I was… I just wanted to get a picture of my parents.” He showed a picture he was carrying to us. “I got one but I couldn’t get any of my kaa-chan.”<br><br><br>We looked at the picture of the blonde haired blue eyed guy smiling brightly in the picture. He looked like an adult version of Naruto. How different from the monstrous figure of the cursed spirit who protects Naruto.<br><br><br>His words stopped any complaints from Miu. Hayato-san however kneeled in front of him and brushed his hair. “If you wanted this, you could have told us. We could have brought it for you. But you didn’t tell anyone before going there which had everyone worried. You understand that, right?”<br><br><br>“Umm. I won’t do it again.”<br><br><br>“Good. Now, can you tell us where you were and how you got this late?” He asked.<br><br><br>They were about to speak but Kanna’s stomach growled and she looked at me. I let out a sigh. “I will get something to eat for you two.”<br><br><br>I did just that.<br><br><br>While I went inside to whip something up quickly they told us about their adventures.<br><br><br>“And then we caught fishes from the river and cooked them over fire. We even met Sasuke and I had a spar with him.”<br><br><br>“Oh, the boy from your academy?”<br><br><br>“Hmm. This time I won. You should have seen his face, Gramps. I totally kicked his ass dattebayo.” He was quite proud.<br><br><br>Several of us in the Restaurant knew about Sasuke, mostly from Naruto’s words. The top student of his class and also the one who always defeated Naruto.<br><br><br>“Then we went to the Ichiraku Ramen to meet Teuchi Jii-san and Ayame nee-san and ate ramen there.” He paused for a moment.<br><br><br>“What happened Naruto?”<br><br><br>“Umm… the old man, I mean the Hokage came there with another guy and asked me where I was. He said he would give me the picture of my mom and dad and then took us with him.” He continued, his voice lower this time.<br><br><br>I brought the dishes out by then and put them in front of them.<br><br><br>“They didn’t force you, did they?”<br><br><br>“Umm… he said that I had to attend the academy there because my parents would have wanted that… and when we tried to leave, they stopped us.”<br><br><br>Everyone in the Restaurant was frowning by now.<br><br><br>We had expected something like that could happen if he were to go back, especially knowing about the fox.<br><br><br>“That’s when Tohru-sama came and opened a portal for us to leave.”<br><br><br>“Hmm but they even drew swords at Tohru-chan. Nii-san, she will be fine, right?” Naruto asked as I froze.<br><br><br>“They did <em>what</em>?”<br><br><br>“They attacked us with something but Milim stood in the way. We didn’t see what happened later.”<br><br><br>I tuned the rest out and looked at the time.<br><br><br>Kanna and Naruto had returned fifteen minutes ago.<br><br><br>“Wait here. I will bring them back.” I said as I walked towards the door.<br><br><br>“I will go with you. Tohru can get a bit rowdy when fighting. I might be able to help.” Lucoa stood up.<br><br><br>“Let me join you guys too.” Rimuru got up.<br><br><br>I opened the door to Naruto’s world and the first thing I saw was a massive beam of energy passing right in front of my eyes, destroying everything in its path. We weren’t affected in the least due to the Restaurant’s protection but the sheer power of the attack sent shivers down my spine.<br><br><br>I turned my head to the side mechanically and looked at the mountain wide trench whose end I couldn’t see. As for where Milim and Tohru were… I didn’t even need to search for them.<br><br><br>There was a green coloured dragon in the sky and a pink haired Demon Lord floating in front of us.<br><br><br>Crap…<br><br><br><strong>- Jiraiya -</strong><br><br><br>The one who took the lead to attack was Danzo but he quickly stepped back and sensei took charge, directly summoning Monkey King Enma. “Sarutobi… what kind of enemy made you summon me?”<br><br><br>“We don’t have time to talk, old friend. I need your help.”<br><br><br>“Alright. Adamantine Staff Transformation.” The Monkey King transformed into the legendary Adamantine Staff and sensei swung it towards the girl.<br><br><br>The result however was something completely unexpected… or maybe expected.<br><br><br>The girl raised a hand which transformed into a claw and held the staff with no effort. She then lifted and used it to swing sensei to the side, smashing the hokage tower completely with the attack. The Adamantine Staff left Sensei’s hand and was thrown away. It went spinning before it stuck into the wall of the Hokage Mountain, directly into the middle of the head of Sensei’s statue.<br><br><br>What strength…<br><br><br>Tsunade took this chance to jump forward and punch towards her and the girl didn’t back down and instead punched forward. The result was something which almost made his eyes pop out.<br><br><br>Tsunade, someone whose strength gave him nightmares, had her arm collapse from the attack and was thrown into the ground, creating a massive crater in the place she crashed.<br><br><br>Just what kind of absurd strength was this?<br><br><br>The rest of the anbu attacked her from all sides but she effortlessly dismantled all their attacks one by one.<br><br><br>But it seems even that power was just a trailer. The girl began to morph.<br><br><br>Her face turned draconic and then slowly the rest of the body followed while her size grew until she was the size of a tailed beast.<br><br><br>Moments later, a large green coloured dragon with black coloured wings was in the skies above Konoha.<br><br><br>Dragon.<br><br><br>A real Dragon.<br><br><br>There were really dragons in this world.<br><br><br>Just what kind of summons did Naruto get?<br><br><br>Sensei’s attacks hit the dragon who just shrugged it off as if nothing.<br><br><br>That attack… it could stop even a Tailed Beast for a while but this dragon…<br><br><br>Jiraiya might not have seen any dragons before this but he knew the reputation, the legends about them.<br><br><br>Dragons were synonymous with power.<br><br><br>And today he could see why… the power this dragon was radiating… it is unreal.<br><br><br>Suddenly a thought came to his mind.<br><br><br>What about the little girl who said they were weak and she could take care of them?…<br><br><br>He however didn’t have enough time to think about these things.<br><br><br>Right now, the village was in danger and he needed to stop the angry dragoness in front of them.<br><br><br>Damn Danzo. They shouldn’t have attacked.<br><br><br>Attacking summons was never a good thing. It would make the entire clan their enemies… <br><br><br>He looked at Tsunade who was still stunned. The splatters of the blood from her hand had fallen on her and she was in shock, unable to even move.<br><br><br>Dammit… now of all times.<br><br><br>Jiraiya looked around and quickly took command.<br><br><br>Hundreds of ninjas were gathering.<br><br><br>“Fugaku, send your son away and order the police to evacuate the area. Itachi, help me contain her.” He ordered. However, he couldn’t find the advisors anywhere.<br><br><br>Even Danzo had disappeared… seriously, those cowards…<br><br><br>Jiraiya hoped that the assistance of Uchiha could help ease the tension in the village and help mend the gap between them and the villagers.<br><br><br>Fugaku apparently had the same thought as he created a shadow clone and sent his son away with it and got to assisting.<br><br><br>He wasn’t idle either as he quickly made hand seals and used the Summoning Jutsu.<br><br><br>A giant cloud of smoke appeared and out came Gamabunta and he jumped on his head.<br><br><br>“Jiraiya, why have you called me this tim… holy crap, is that a dragon!”<br><br><br>“Yes… yes it is. Gamabunta, do you know anything about a Dragon Summoning Land?”<br><br><br>“A Summoning Land of Dragons? I didn’t even know they existed. Just how did you encounter one?”<br><br><br>“It’s… I will explain later. Right now we need to stop her before she can destroy Konoha.”<br><br><br>Fugaku commanded the military police to quickly evacuate the people around the Hokage Tower while Itachi sent a clone to actually remove Tsunade from the scene first.<br><br><br>“What is wrong with her, Jiraiya-sama?” Itachi asked.<br><br><br>“Tsunade… she has haemophobia. She won’t be able to assist if she doesn’t snap out of it.”<br><br><br>“Haemophobia?!” The boy was surprised but contained it in seconds.<br><br><br>Sensei had recovered from the previous attack and came out of the rubble of the store he had crashed into. He threw four fuma shuriken in four different directions, surrounding the dragoness. The shuriken transformed into his shadow clones in mid air, each weaving hand seals. All five of them used a technique of five different elements at the same time from five different directions, targeting the dragoness in the middle.<br><br><br>It was sensei’s trump card, the Five Release Great Combo Technique, something which only someone like him who had mastered all five elements could use.<br><br><br>This attack could halt the approach of even tailed beasts and was something which had played a great role in getting him the title of the God of Shinobi.<br><br><br>The attacks crashed into the dragon head on, creating a massive explosion in the sky about the Hokage Tower.<br><br><br>The night sky was lit up by the explosion and what was left was only smoke in the air.<br><br><br>“Is it over?” Jiraiya heard Gamabunta speaking.<br><br><br>Jiraiya doubted it.<br><br><br>Sure enough, a deafening roar tore through the night as the smoke from the explosion was cleared, the shockwave from the roar mowing down the surrounding buildings, revealing the almost pristine condition of the dragon.<br><br><br>“Gamabunta, assist Sensei.” he commanded.<br><br><br>This is not something Gamabunta can stop by himself so Jiraiya summoned two other toads to assist.<br><br><br>Gamabunta was also aware of the seriousness of the situation and drew his sword and jumped towards the Dragon but the dragoness just opened her mouth and blasted a beam of energy and Gamabunta was blasted away into the distance, disappearing in a burst of smoke.<br><br><br>Dammit, Bunta didn’t even last one attack.<br><br><br>The worst part was that the Dragon was just watching them confidently and not exactly attacking them.<br><br><br>She was… as if mocking them, giving them a chance to do their worst before she attacks. Such thoughts sent shivers down Jiraiya’s spine.<br><br><br>He suddenly realised that he had been completely mistaken about her being like a Tailed Beast.<br><br><br>She wasn’t like a Tailed Beast. No, Tailed Beast were just that… beasts. They attacked like one.<br><br><br>This one was intelligent, skilled at using her powers and thus far worse than Tailed Beasts. Such a being… how big of an asset could they have been if they had joined Konoha… if only, Naruto had been treated a little better.<br><br><br>As much as Jiraya wanted to rage and blame sensei, it wasn’t the time for it. Right now, he needed to save the village from what could be the biggest crisis it has faced since the creation.<br><br><br>The other two toads went on to attack the dragon but were being beaten into the ground. The rest of the ninja were continuously attacking the dragon but they couldn’t even scratch her.<br><br><br>Suddenly, Danzo landed near the place from wherever he was hiding.<br><br><br>“Danzo, where are your roots?!” Sensei asked, landing near them.<br><br><br>“The roots are assisting with the evacuation of the people.” He replied and Jiraiya didn’t even need to think to know that he was lying so it was only natural that sensei knew it too.<br><br><br>“You!”<br><br><br>Danzo however didn’t wait for the reply and jumped into the battle. Although, instead of the dragon, he went off the pink haired girl who was floating in the air, watching everything quietly.<br><br><br>“Capture her. We can use her to negotiate with the dragon.” He ordered the surrounding ninjas while he took the lead himself.<br><br><br>“Uwahahaha you all want to fight me? Alright, come. I will take you all on.”<br><br><br>Danzo sent several anbu forward. Surprisingly, Itachi Uchiha followed him and attacked the girl from all directions.<br><br><br>Later down the line, Jiraiya and everyone who survives this day would realise that this was the worst decision they could have made.<br><br><br>The girl laughed and a massive aura erupted from her and to the shock of everyone.. Her aura… was beyond anything they could ever imagine.<br><br><br>It made the dragon flying in the sky look like a candle flame compared to the sun. Many ninjas collapsed on the ground, fainting from the pressure she was releasing.<br><br><br>Jiraiya saw many Hyugas covering their byakugan as cries of agony erupted from them.<br><br><br>She raised her hand and an orb of energy was fired from her hand. It struck Danzo and blasted him towards the Hokage Mountain. The attack seemed harmless but that was only till it touched the mountain and then the ground shook as the entire hokage mountain was turned to dust, leaving a large valley in its place.<br><br><br>“Danzo!”<br><br><br>Sensei shouted and raised his newly recovered Adamantine Staff and raced towards the girl but was met with a strike from the dragon above. The dragon’s tail struck him, breaking his arm and sending him crashing into the academy building.<br><br><br>The dragon gathered energy in her mouth and fired a beam, ripping a landscape of konoha, creating a large canyon through the middle of the village.<br><br><br><em>“Pay attention when you are fighting me. I am giving you all a chance to try your worst. After that I will start attacking and nothing will be left of this land. You were the ones who made the first move, now pay for it.”</em><br><br><br>Suddenly, black flames appeared on the pink haired girl’s body.<br><br><br>Jiraiya looked to the side to see Itachi Uchiha covering his eyes as he kneeled on the ground.<br><br><br>The girl however was completely unbothered as her aura erupted again and the flames were scattered around. It was only when the specks of flames fell on some of the nearby ninjas that they understood what it could do. The ninjas were burned to ashes without any chance to defend themselves while the flames kept on burning.<br><br><br>“Don’t touch those flames.” Itachi shouted. “They cannot be extinguished.”<br><br><br>Jiraiya understood the meaning and quickly jumped ahead to seal the flames to prevent the surrounding ninjas from getting caught.<br><br><br>“This is not going to work. We need Tsunade. We need to contain the damage.” Four Red Yang Formation. They could do it to contain them for a while but they needed another strong ninja for that. Right now they only have Sensei, Fugaku and him. “Itachi, go and try to get Tsunade up. I will try to hold them back for a while.”<br><br><br>Itachi was about to leave but the girl raised a finger and fired a beam, ripping through his heart and causing a massive explosion around Itachi, taking down the entire block of the village.<br><br><br>“Itachi!” Fugaku shouted at the loss of his son. Surprisingly though, before he could do something, a figure jumped out from the flames.<br><br><br>Itachi Uchiha landed on the ground and stumbled on his knees, breathing heavily. To the surprise of everyone around, including the girl, he was uninjured. She however seemed more curious and didn’t attack, preferring to watch instead.<br><br><br>“Are you alright, Itachi.” Fugaku asked while Jiraiya also reached near them.<br><br><br>“I… I will live. I am sorry. You carry on with the plan. I have a way to bring Tsunade-sama back into the fight.” He said as he got up again but they noticed that one of his eyes… they had gone white while the other had a unique pattern, completely different from a normal sharingan.<br><br><br>“Itachi you!” Fugaku looked at him in shock.<br><br><br>“It’s for the village, father. Please assist Hokage-sama.”<br><br><br>“Fugaku.” He too called out and the man was an experienced veteran who collected himself quick enough.<br><br><br>“What’s the plan?” He asked while Itachi went towards Tsunade.<br><br><br>He started explaining the plan to Fugaku.<br><br><br>“Konoha has a jutsu called the Four Yang Flame Formation. It requires four Kage level ninjas to cast. You have the appropriate level of chakra and strength for it. The jutsu should be able to contain them while we can seal them.” He explained the jutsu to him while using the summoning jutsu.<br><br><br>There was only one thing he could think of which could turn the tides or at least give them some chance to hold back the enemies.<br><br><br>Two figures appeared this time, much smaller in size but anyone who knew them wouldn’t dare underestimate them.<br><br><br>“Ma, Pa!”<br><br><br>“Jiraiya-chan! What is going on? Gamabunta, Gamaken and Gamatatsu were sent back and they are in a critical condition. Who did this to them?”<br><br><br>“We are in very serious trouble. I need your help. I need to use <em>that</em>. Please.”<br><br><br>The two toad sages also looked around, freezing at the sight of the two dragons.<br><br><br>“Are  those… dragons… How did you get in such a mess, Jiraiya-chan?”<br><br><br>“It’s because the hokage couldn’t keep his attack dog in control and now the whole village is paying for it. Nothing new really.” To his surprise, it was Fugaku who replied, the rage in his tone evident.<br><br><br>“Fugaku!”<br><br><br>“What Jiraiya-sama? Are you going to ignore everything they did? It wouldn’t be something new. Perhaps the only new thing would be them hitting an iron plate this time.”<br><br><br>“It’s not a time to fight among ourselves, Fugaku. I promise you, I will do my best to assist you in representing the Uchiha Clan after this… but please… the entire village might get destroyed at this rate.”<br><br><br>“Jiraiya is right, Fugaku.” Another voice came from behind and this time a familiar one. He turned back to see Tsunade walking towards them. There was no trace of fear in her eyes. Itachi Uchiha was walking behind her with a crow on his shoulder. “Sensei and his friends have made too many mistakes and they will answer for that but that will only happen when there is a village. I also promise you the same as Jiraiya. If you want then I, as the sole member of the Senju Clan, will nominate you as the next Hokage but for now, we need your help. Please…”<br><br><br>“Tsunade.”<br><br><br>“Give me five minutes, Jiraiya. I need to do surgery on Itachi. He needs an eye transplant to replace his eye.” She then used the summoning jutsu to summon Katsuyu to start healing the ninjas.<br><br><br>“You got it. I need five minutes to prepare too.”<br><br><br>Tsunade started operating while Jiraiya started preparing for the Sage Mode. Meanwhile, Katsuyu healed sensei.<br><br><br>The rest of the ninjas only maintained a distance controlling the fires and evacuating everyone, not attacking the ninjas. Then again, very few of them could attack the airborne enemies.<br><br><br>Sealing Squads gathered around the place.<br><br><br>Five minutes later, he was finally in Sage Mode as he felt the rush of energy in him. The extra power boosting his confidence for a moment… only until he spread his senses and then he collapsed on his knees as he looked at the little pink haired girl in shock. “Tsunade…”<br><br><br>“What is it, Jiraiya? I am busy right now.”<br><br><br>“...we are going to die today.”<br><br><br>“Hah?”<br><br><br><strong>- Tsunade -</strong><br><br><br>To say that the day had been weird for Tsunade would be the biggest understatement of the century.<br><br><br>She had been in reserve in Konoha, getting treatment from the Yamanaka for her Haemophobia in preparation for a civil war which might erupt anytime.<br><br><br>Part of her cursing sensei and the other part cursing the Uchiha. Then again, it’s not like she didn’t understand their situation.<br><br><br>She too was the member of one of the founding clans of the village, one every bit as strong as the Uchiha.<br><br><br>And yet, the Senju Clan had disappeared very suddenly and in no part due to the negligence of sensei. It was obvious that Uchiha were facing a similar situation. But unlike the Senju, the Uchiha were not an idealistic bunch who would just lie in wait for the butcher’s knife to be swung on them.<br><br><br>Was this the village that her grandfather dreamed of?<br><br><br>The situation had become worse since the jinchuriki of nine tails had disappeared.<br><br><br>Some believed it to be the Uchiha’s while others thought that Danzo had a hand in it so imagine her surprise when she was told that the jinchuriki was seen in the village with the Hokage. She had obviously rushed to the Hokage’s office and found the Uchiha Clan head with his two sons, the Hokage advisors and finally two kids with sensei and Jiraiya.<br><br><br>It didn’t take her long to understand what was going on.<br><br><br>The kid, like Jiraiya, had somehow used the summoning technique without signing any contract and was reverse summoned to their land and then he had somehow learned about his heritage. It was obvious that the kid was pissed, not that she blamed him.<br><br><br>She would have ripped the old man a new one had he done something like that to her.<br><br><br>Then as usual, the advisors poked their noses in where it didn’t belong and made the matters worse.<br><br><br>It’s just that she had no idea how worse that situation had been at that time.<br><br><br>Dragons…<br><br><br>The kid had a summoning contract with dragons… who somehow existed in this world.<br><br><br>Even when she was seeing one in front of her, she had a hard time believing it.<br><br><br>Then again, she had felt that dragon’s strength. Her mangled arm was obviously no genjutsu and neither was her panic attack. She obviously didn’t know what the Uchiha kid had done with that sharingan implanted on the crow but it had completely wiped out the fear of blood she had been suffering from or she would still be incapacitated.<br><br><br>And now, when she was finally ready to fight in earnest after almost two decades, Jiraiya was acting strange.<br><br><br>It was obviously not his looks, which were extremely creepy. He had the two toad sages sticking from his shoulders, his features had morphed to look like a toad’s. It was his blank stare towards the girl floating silently in front of them as he lay collapsed on his knees.<br><br><br>“What do you mean, Jiraiya?” She asked, concentrating on the surgery first.<br><br><br>Jiraiya however didn’t reply.<br><br><br>The battle in the background raged.<br><br><br>No, calling it a battle would be wrong.<br><br><br>The dragon was massacring everything that attacked her.<br><br><br>Worried about Jiraiya, Tsunade tried to look at the girl and understand what was going on when a figure landed in front of the girl.<br><br><br>Danzo… wasn’t he… dead?<br><br><br>Something else however attracted her attention, along with the attention of half the battlefield more than the return of a presumed dead man. It was his arm.<br><br><br>For a moment she thought she was dreaming but the sudden roar of Fugaku Uchiha as well as the other Uchiha Clan members told her that she wasn’t seeing some kind of twisted Genjutsu.<br><br><br>Sharingan… he had ten sharingan embedded in his arm, one of which had closed and looked similar to Itachi’s own.<br><br><br>The arm itself looked white and unnatural but Tsunade could feel the vitality from it.<br><br><br>A thought came to her mind and she clenched her hand.<br><br><br>“Danzo!” She gritted her teeth. “If that’s what I think it is, I am going to rip you to shreds.” She growled.<br><br><br>The man however was not bothered in the least.<br><br><br>“Everything I do is for Konoha.” He ripped the bandage around his eyes to reveal another Sharingan which caused Itachi Uchiha to be shocked and she had to press him down so that he didn’t mess up the surgery. “You two have caused too much destruction in Konoha but I can forgive you. Obey me and become my servant. With your power, I can make Konoha rise to the top of the world.”<br><br><br>She looked at Itachi as he seemed to understand what was going on. “What exactly is he trying to do?”<br><br><br>“He’s… he is trying to control that girl. The Sharingan in his eye belonged to Shisui Uchiha and contains a jutsu called Kotoamatsukami. It can manipulate the thoughts and even free will of a person. It’s the strongest genjutsu in the world. Danzo is trying to make them his servants.”<br><br><br>The thought was frightening and for a moment she was frozen at what to do.<br><br><br>She didn’t know what was worse. A Konoha under Danzo or no Konoha at all…<br><br><br>However they were too late to do anything.<br><br><br>The girl narrowed her eyes.<br><br><br>“Oh… it’s you again. How did you survive? Is it those eyes again? Are you stupid? If you survived, you should have run away like the weakling you are. And not only that but also trying to control my mind? Are you that tired of living? Is it because I have been sitting and watching the show that you all are underestimating me?” The more the girl spoke the more her aura rose and now Tsunade understood the reason behind Jiraiya’s reaction. The Dragon… it was actually not the main danger… it is this little girl.<br><br><br>The girl disappeared from her place and the next second she appeared near Danzo, his arm ripped off and his eyes plucked as she held his arm and threw him into the sky.<br><br><br>The next moment she was in the sky looking towards the now destroyed Hokage Mountain. “You wanted my power, here, have it your way.”<br><br><br>She gathered a power in her hand and shot it towards Danzo who was still airborne.<br><br><br>A massive beam of light, unlike anything till now shot out from her hand. It covered Danzo’s figure and the mountain and everything behind it.<br><br><br>There was no sky breaking sound, no shaking of earth… nothing.<br><br><br>Just a beam of light which lit up the place in a straight line.<br><br><br>Even the Dragon who had been fighting all this time paused and looked at the attack.<br><br><br>When the light disappeared, she understood the meaning of Jiraiya’s words…<br><br><br>They were all going to die…<br><br><br>Tsunade had her whole life flash in front of her and she was sure many others would be feeling the same.<br><br><br>Was this the punishment for the lives they had taken, the families they had destroyed, the innocence they had ruined all these years?<br><br><br>Was this karma?<br><br><br>The hokage mountain had disappeared. Behind it, the land had also disappeared. What was left was a canyon whose end couldn’t be seen no matter how far she looked.<br><br><br>The entire battlefield had gone still as the weapons in the hands of the ninjas dropped one by one to the ground.<br><br><br>Tsunade looked at the girl in the air and couldn’t help but ask. “Are you a God?”<br><br><br>No answers came.<br><br><br>The girl wasn’t even paying attention to them. Not that she needed to.<br><br><br>One by one, the rest of the ninjas also collapsed to their knees. They had given up all their hopes and accepted the fact that they were going to die today.<br><br><br>It was then that they heard a voice.<br><br><br>“Tohru, Milim… just what in the nine hells is going on here?”<br><br><br>She looked at the figure of a boy standing on the top of a half collapsed building and looking at the two dragons.<br><br><br>Beside him were two others a blonde haired woman, or a dragon as was evident from the horns on her head and a blue haired young girl.<br><br><br>The green dragon looked at the boy and spoke. “Boss!”<br><br><br>Tsunade suddenly felt the entire world spinning around her.<br><br><br><strong>- Silas -</strong><br><br><br>I looked at the scene which wouldn’t have looked out of place in an apocalypse in front of my eyes. The destroyed buildings and scattered bodies… and I thought the fight with the crazy magicians and the war with the orcs was bad…<br><br><br>I was totally right to not let Tohru participate in those.<br><br><br>And Milim…<br><br><br>Tohru changed back to her human form and Milim floated to me too.<br><br><br>“Sil, what are you doing here?” Milim asked.<br><br><br>“What do you mean what am <em>I</em> doing here? What exactly are you guys doing? I remember telling you all to not cause any trouble. This… how?…”<br><br><br>“We didn’t make the first move, boss. They were the ones who attacked us first.” Tohru replied hurriedly.<br><br><br>“Yes yes, Sil, Rimuru. I didn’t attack first either. They attacked me with fire and even tried to control my mind and make me his servant. Only after that I attacked. I promise.” Milim added.<br><br><br>“They did <em>what</em>?”<br><br><br>“Yes boss. And they even said bad things about Naruto-kun like he was the property of the village and that he was the village’s weapon. That’s why I was so angry but I didn’t attack them even then. I only attacked them after they did first.”<br><br><br>I was not the only one frowning at the words. As much as I had wanted to deny it when Gojo-sensei analysed the true motives of the village leaders… now it seems that it was indeed true.<br><br><br>But if that were indeed the case then they would not let Naruto go easily and they might even come and try to cause trouble in my Restaurant which would mean danger to those close to me.<br><br><br>That’s simply not something I will allow.<br><br><br>Now… how exactly do I solve this?<br><br><br>I looked at Rimuru. He also seemed to be in thought and I could see that he was pretty annoyed too.<br><br><br>We had been there when Naruto had first come to the Restaurant and had seen the condition of the child and how much he had changed for the better after being adopted.<br><br><br>These people… they didn’t deserve a kid like Naruto…<br><br><br>“Boss, did I do something bad?” Tohru asked after seeing me silent for a while.<br><br><br>“Self defence is not wrong. If they attacked you first, then they were in the wrong. But let’s stop this war here.”<br><br><br>“But boss…”<br><br><br>“Tohru… while I understand your feelings, believe me, I am angry too but, we cannot punish the innocent people of the village for the mistakes of a few.”<br><br><br>“Yes. Remember, there are other innocent children the same age as Naruto in this village. If we continue this war, then they will be harmed too…” Rimuru added.<br><br><br>At least more than they are now.<br><br><br>This was enough to shut her up but shutting her up was not the main objective.<br><br><br>I looked around towards the crowd and used magic to amplify my voice. “Who is the leader of the village?”<br><br><br>The people all just stared at us without replying when Tohru stepped forward and roared loudly. “Come out you old monkey or I will raze this village to the ground right now!”<br><br><br>Almost moments later, an old man came out. He had an arm and leg missing. The stumps were wrapped with bandages and he was being supported by a… three headed toadman.<br><br><br>There are beastmen in this world?<br><br><br>Both the people stopped a distance from us and the old man spoke first. “I am Hiruzen Sarutobi, the third Hokage of Konohagakure.”<br><br><br>“He is the guy, boss. There was another guy with bandages but he tried to control Milim-sama and was blasted by her. He was also the one who called Naruto-kun a weapon.” Tohru pointed towards the old man and added.<br><br><br>“Naruto is not a weapon.” The old man spoke but Tohru interrupted him again.<br><br><br>“Oh! Now he isn’t a weapon when you have your ass kicked. I didn’t see you saying anything when that twelve eyed freak was insulting him. The toad guy was the only one who even tried to speak.”<br><br><br>Her words made me look at the toad guy.<br><br><br>“Tohru.” I put a hand on her shoulder to calm her down and then looked at the guy. “What happened here is regrettable, but not inseparable from your own actions. But we can both agree that this much is enough so I propose the end of this… war.” I said the last word unsurely. “Obviously if anyone still wants to fight, I will be more than happy to accompany them.” I added not to appear weak as I released a bit of my power.<br><br><br>“No!” The toad man said hurriedly. “We… accept.”<br><br><br>I nodded. “Good. In that case, we only have one condition. Naruto Furinji… or the one you call Naruto Uzumaki, will stay with us. This point is not negotiable. Aside from that we don’t care what you do with your village.”<br><br><br>“Naruto Uzumaki is the son of Minato Namikaze. He is a part of this village.” The old man said.<br><br><br>I noticed that the man’s proclamation surprised many people, even other ninjas.<br><br><br>“Oh… and what exactly is his role here? A chew toy for people’s anger or a weapon?”<br><br><br>“That’s not it!” The toad man protested.<br><br><br>“Then how exactly is it?” I questioned back. “You say he is the son of the former leader of this village and yet, he was living in an orphanage and was thrown out of one at the age of six. He has been living alone since the age of six, being scorned and hated by everyone. The kid didn’t even know his parent’s names.”<br><br><br>“We did that… to protect him.” The old man gritted out. “Minato had many enemies who would have gone after him had they known about his identity.”<br><br><br>“And? You run an entire village of trained assassins. Are you unable to protect the child of your former leader? Someone who sacrificed his life and endangered the life of his child to save your hides? Did Minato Namikaze have no close friends? Tell me, you are also the leader of this village, did your children and grandchildren also grow up in an orphanage, were they scorned by the entire village? Or are you just a useless nobody with no enemies that your children are so safe?”<br><br><br>He didn’t speak but I could see the anger in his eyes.<br><br><br>But I wasn’t done yet.<br><br><br>“And even if we assume that what you did was to save him from then what about the information of him containing the fox? He was discriminated against and abused mentally because of that.”<br><br><br>“Minato wanted his son to be recognised as a hero.” He replied.<br><br><br>“Oh. I was under the impression that Heroes were treated well by the people, like you know… heroes. Is it different in this village where the standard treatment of heroes is abuse?”<br><br><br>“Jinchuriki are always feared by people because of the danger they contain. The villagers couldn’t look past their fears…” He started to explain but I was stuck on something else.<br><br><br>“Jinchuriki… human… sacrifice… You… call him a sacrifice.” I gritted my teeth, feeling my rage bubble after a long time. Was it what he was for everyone? A sacrifice?<br><br><br>Beside me, Tohru was also enraged and was also  half transformed ready to blast the old man to smithereens and for once I wouldn’t have minded it either.<br><br><br>“I think that’s the term for someone who has a monster sealed inside them.” Rimuru’s voice sounded in my head.<br><br><br>Telepathy.<br><br><br>The old man continued to blabber some nonsense but I just raised my hand.<br><br><br>“So, why didn’t you do something about it? They were being dumb so you just let them. You, as the leader of this village, could have taken steps to solve this problem, explained things to them and yet you didn’t do anything? Why?”<br><br><br>“I did whatever I could. I forbid the spreading of the information to give him a chance to make friends his age.”<br><br><br>“And yet it was not enough. Obviously. The children will always follow the lead of their parents. I mean sure they couldn’t speak of that particular thing but they could still prevent their children from associating with him, effectively isolating him. If that was your goal then Do you know the first time I met him, he was surprised that a restaurant would actually offer him services.”<br><br><br>I observed a look of sadness on the face of the toad man. Did he actually care?<br><br><br>“But then again, if isolating him was your goal from the get go, then everything is understandable.”<br><br><br>“What are you trying to say?” The man asked, anger tinting his voice but he kept his tone in check.<br><br><br>I remembered the theories Gojo-sensei and even Shoko-san had come up with after learning about Naruto’s situation.<br><br><br>“Why, swooping in as his saviour when he is rejected by everyone, making him believe that you are the only person who cares. Isn’t that a sure fire way to gain his trust, make him loyal to you, and gain the power of the so-called weapon of the village?” The frown on his face deepened.<br><br><br>“I do not… I have never treated Naruto like a weapon.”<br><br><br>“You are the leader of a village of liars, thieves and trained killers. Do you think your words have any credibility? Moreover, didn’t you say that you were the third hokage? Then why did you come back again? Why didn’t you find a new leader? I mean sure it could have been an emergency then but years have passed and you are still the leader. Are you so reluctant to let go of the power? With such a personality, pulling something like that does seem something someone like you could do.”<br><br><br>“Everything I have done till now is to protect him… Naruto is the son of my successor. This is his home…” His words stopped as he looked behind me with wide eyes. The rest had similar looks and it made me look behind me and my eyes widened as well.<br><br><br>From the trench created by Milim’s attack, a huge wave, a mini tsunami of sorts was approaching us, about to flood the entire village.<br><br><br>Almost on instinct, I raised my hand and my Demonic Power came to life.<br><br><br>I used my <em><strong>Unique Skill: Flood</strong></em> to control and shape the water and then the <em><strong>Unique Skill: Frost</strong></em> to freeze everything. I pushed my power in and the tsunami as well as the water in the trench froze .<br><br><br>Just where the fuck did that come from?<br><br><br>Was someone attacking this village?<br><br><br>“Let me check.” Rimuru said as his wings popped out of his back and he took to the skies till we couldn’t even see him anymore.<br><br><br>He came down almost five minutes later and looked at <a href=\"http://Milim.”Oi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Milim.”Oi</a>, Milim… just how much power did you put in that blast? That trench… it’s connected to the ocean.”<br><br><br>…<br><br><br>What?!<br><br><br>“Ah… I held back you know but that guy tried to control me and I was angry and…” her voice got lower the more she spoke and I found my eyes twitching at her words.<br><br><br>“Oh my, that’s a problem. At this rate, the water will just wash everyone up when the ice melts. We can’t let that happen, can we.” Lucoa, who had been silent for all this time, spoke. “Let me do something about it.”<br><br><br>Then something happened which I would remember till the end of my life.<br><br><br>Lucoa turned into her dragon form… her ginormous dragon from.<br><br><br>I couldn’t even see her end from the place I was standing. I wasn’t the only one surprised. Even Rimuru was slapping my back in stunned shock as he looked at her form. Milim was surprised too although she seemed more excited than anything else.<br><br><br>Tohru was the only one unsurprised. “Lucoa is a former Goddess. This much is only normal.”<br><br><br>Lucoa went high up in the sky and roared and we looked, equal parts shocked and terrified as the moon in the sky cracked. A piece of the moon was ripped apart and fell down.<br><br><br>I was sure this was the very scene Dinosaurs would have looked at before going extinct but the rocks slowed down and were crushed by her power as they slowly fell in the trench, mending the whole trench once more.<br><br><br>When that was done, trees grew at a visible pace, covering the ground and the parts mended by her.<br><br><br>Finally, the moon was then reshaped back into its previous shape and was… dragged closer to the planet so the size that we saw remained the same as before. <br><br><br>Done with everything, Lucoa turned back into her human form and landed beside us. <br><br>“There, all patched up. I had to use the moon as taking that much land from anywhere else in the world would have caused a lot of more damage. I pulled it slightly closer to prevent any change of tides. Try not to cause so much damage next time, Milim.”<br><br><br>“Okay… that was totally awesome by the way. I didn’t know we could do that. I will have to try that someday.” Milim said, sending me into a bout of panic.<br><br><br>“No… no destroying or trying something like that or…”<br><br><br>“Or?” She asked.<br><br><br>Yes… what can I even threaten her with?<br><br><br>Then I remembered something and took a deep breath. “Or no desserts for you.”<br><br><br>As expected, the girl went pale and was instantly in my face. “No Sil, that's horrible. Rimuru! Tell him.”<br><br><br>“Well, he is not wrong, you know.” Rimuru supported me and finally Milim was pacified and I prevented a heart attack.<br><br><br>Can Archdaemons even get heart attacks?<br><br><br>The show of power from Lucoa had left everyone speechless.<br><br><br>I quickly took the opportunity of this and looked at the old man. “I have already said what I wanted to say. You can either obey or I will finish what was started today. Naruto is someone I consider my little brother. He is not and will never be anyone’s weapon.”<br><br><br>This time however no one spoke anything.<br><br><br>No one even looked blinked as they stared into the sky, at the moon.<br><br><br>I asked Tohru to teleport us away to prevent them from finding where we were going.<br><br><br>With that, quickly left the place.<br><br><br>I also made a vow to never let Milim or Tohru go to any other worlds, unsupervised.<br><br><br><strong>- Fugaku Uchiha -</strong><br><br><br>Two days had passed and yet, the village was still shaken from the events of that night.<br><br><br>In fact, not only the village but the whole ninja world was shaken. After all, one couldn’t hide the reshaping of the moon or the attack which created a trench across half the Land of Fire or the attack which froze all the water in that trench.<br><br><br>Maybe the only silver lining is that the major attacks were all near the hokage mountain and not towards the village or there would probably be no village by now.<br><br><br>It both relieved and terrified him to realise that the dragon, despite destroying a part of the village, was still holding back. It also made them realise how badly they would have ended up had that black haired man… the Dragon’s boss not come when he did.<br><br><br>This attack had brought to light a lot of darkness of the villages, the flaw of management and things they desperately hid.<br><br><br>But that was not all. It also brought to light the truth about Itachi.<br><br><br>His son had those eyes too. Itachi had the Mangekyo and he hid them… Not only that, he also had eyes of Shisui which contained… that… jutsu.<br><br><br>The scenario which came to mind after the reveal of this information was not good at all. Fugaku knew about Itachi’s feelings for the clan and the realisation of which side he might have stood had the clan actually rebelled… it chilled his heart.<br><br><br>But it was this feeling which pushed him forward to actually take a stand for his people. That decrepit old monkey and his friends had pushed the Uchiha far too much and had even turned his own people against them, probably intending to use them. The eye and arm of Danzo were the final straws for Fugaku and the rest of the Uchiha Clan.<br><br><br>The attack had in a way been a boon for the Uchiha Clan overall. First, the Clan was hardly affected by the attack being on the outskirts of the village. Second, the shock of the incident of that day had actually pushed a large part of his clan members to either awaken their sharingan or pushed their sharingan to evolve further, increasing the overall power of the Uchiha Clan by leaps and bounds.<br><br><br>Lastly, the reveal of information about Naruto Uzumaki and the things Hiruzen Sarutobi had hidden and the words of that man had brought about many opinions around the village.<br><br><br>To some extent, Fugaku understood the thinking of the people.<br><br><br>They were angry and needed someone to vent… just like they had done to Naruto. They obviously couldn’t or rather didn’t even dare to say anything about the kid or the dragons, at least not after the show of power by them, so the only ones who they could vent their anger on were the third hokage and the other advisors.<br><br><br>The rumours also helped out their clan as some people who had seen the sharingan in Danzo’s presence had spread the news, especially after seeing him trying to control such strong dragons. Now there were rumours of him being involved in the kyuubi attacks since he also had the means to do so. Moreover, Danzo’s actions preventing the Uchiha clan from intervening during the Kyuubi attack also worked against him.<br><br><br>Everyone… even Fugaku himself thought that he might actually have done so since he was targeting the Uchiha Clan from the very beginning.<br><br><br>After all, everyone with a little knowhow about the man knew of his ambitions and the kyuubi attack could have cleared out most of his competition for the position of the Hokage. Too bad for him that Minato had overturned the board with his wife.<br><br><br>Now he just needed to take advantage of this situation and not only could he save his Clan but also help bring justice to his fallen clans men.<br><br><br>The image of Danzo’s arm was imprinted in his mind after all. It haunted his dreams. The bastard might be dead but Fugaku wouldn’t sit still until all his co-conspirators were punished too.<br><br><br>It was this thought which brought him to his current decision.<br><br><br>“Are you sure you want to do this, Fugaku?” Mikoto asked.<br><br><br>“Yes. I need to do this Mikoto. For the Clan and for the village.”<br><br><br>“Very well.”<br><br><br>She brought out a scroll and unsealed it.<br><br><br>In a sealed tube were two eyes.<br><br><br>Two Mangekyo Sharingan belonging to Itachi.<br><br><br>His son had implanted Shisui’s eye and Shisui being a close relative of theirs, the implants went without any hitch. It might not have been good enough to evolve the eyes but Itachi will not be facing any problems in using them. The only reason he had left those eyes with Itachi was because both the eyes had been used and won’t be usable in the near future. By the time they can be used again, he can achieve his goal.<br><br><br>The surgery had however left Itachi unconscious due to low levels of chakra he had back then and Fugaku took advantage of this and exchanged his other eye with the second eye of Shisui which was in Danzo’s possession. The dragon girl had left the eye on the ground with the arm after plucking it out from Danzo.<br><br><br>They had given him a reason that his other eye was damaged in the battle.<br><br><br>One of the eyes was white due to the use of Izanagi, an eye most would consider useless, which would be true at least until they were evolved.<br><br><br>For the Mangekyo Sharingan to evolve to the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, one didn’t need to just implant the eyes of a close family member… they needed to merge them together or two brothers could just exchange eyes.<br><br><br>One pair was sealed inside the other and over the course of a week, the two eyes merged. The requirement for being close family members was not only so that their blood doesn’t reject the eye but also because the chakra of close family members was almost identical and allowed the eyes to merge seamlessly into one.<br><br><br>This process strengthened the eyes to a new level where it doesn’t get corroded by the strong chakra of the Mangekyo.<br><br><br>He closed his eyes and let Mikoto take care of the rest.<br><br><br>When he wakes up… things will change.<br><br><br>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________<br><br><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\"></a><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a><br><br><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a><br><br><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong><br><br><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong><br><br><strong>Author’s Note:</strong><br><br><strong>I am done with the next chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong><br><br><br><strong>Well, things escalated quickly, didn’t it.</strong><br><br><br><strong>Letting Tohru and Milim go after them was probably not the best idea.</strong><br><br><br><strong>As for Konoha… they fucked around and found out.</strong><br><br><br><strong>Now I know there will be that one guy who will try to defend Sarutobi… because there is always that one idiot.

Rimuru and Ainz were working on deciding which Manga we were going to sell in our new publishing house.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was working, the door opened and Tohru entered followed by two other people.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was a handsome young man with straight waist-length or hip-length black hair that was in a loose ponytail at the end with bangs covering his right eye, red eyes. He was wearing butler attire, a mail coach cravat tie and small glasses on the bridge of his nose. He had a gloomy look on his face as he looked around with a frown.</p><p><br></p><p>I was however not looking at him but the last person who came in… damn, those have to be fake.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a tall, fair-skinned woman with an hourglass figure and large breasts. She had long, wavy blonde hair which took on a turquoise and green colour at the ends. She had heterochromia, where one iris has a different coloration from the other. Her left eye was navy blue on the outside and yellow on the inside, with a green, slit pupil. Her right eye was green on the outside with designs and black on the inside with a yellow, slit pupil. She had horns like Tohru but no tail.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this the place you were talking about, Tohru?” She asked, looking around cluelessly.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why but I felt major Lavy energy from her.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an instinct but my instinct’s are quite spot on these days. Must be an Archdaemon thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. It’s great, isn’t it?” Tohru replied happily, showing them a seat nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>The other guy however stopped and looked at the rest of the people in the Restaurant. “Humans, demons and even undead… should I just kill them first?”</p><p><br></p><p>…suddenly a dozen eyes were pointed towards him from all directions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fafnir! No fighting anyone. This is the place I work at. I told you already that Silas-san is my boss and these are my boss’ friends.” She then looked at the rest, especially Milim and bowed deeply. “I am sorry for my friend. He isn’t used to being around people much.”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim just huffed and turned back to the game in her hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru came to me. “These are my friends, boss. I decided to show them around before the party.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and looked at the guy called Fafnir. Isn’t that name kinda famous? “Will they be alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, don’t worry. Fafnir is just a bit awkward around people. He mostly stays in his cave to protect his treasures.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, a shut-in dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, take their orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two people… dragons, ordered me to make anything I wanted and I began working on their orders before Tohru served them.</p><p><br></p><p>By then, Fafnir was watching Milim and Saitama play games while the other woman was looking at them with a smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you Tohru’s boss?” The latter asked me when I came out, having completed the orders. “A Demon…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Silas. I am the owner of this Restaurant. Tohru works for me.” I introduced myself with a polite bow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, how polite. This is the first time I have seen a demon be so polite in all my years. I mean sure some were polite before too but they were usually faking or mocking others… but none of them run a Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>I controlled my lips from twitching at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, my name is Quetzalcoatl by the way but my friends call me Locoa.”</p><p><br>Quetzalcoatl?!</p><p><br></p><p>Isn’t that the creature from the Aztec myths?</p><p><br></p><p>I had seen a documentary about the Aztec myths a long time ago and remembered the name. I think it was a dragon or serpent of some kind. I tried to remember and sure enough it came to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quetzalcoatl, the Winged Serpent.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you have heard of me?” She asked, interested.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Yes. There are myths of Quetzalcoatl in my world too. I think there was even a Fafnir in the Norse Mythology.” I said, making the other dragon look at me with narrowed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your world?” She asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Tohru. “You didn’t tell them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I forgot.” She said, sticking out her tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>She then went on to explain about the place to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Other worlds, outside our own? I mean I had heard about such a thing from the Gods but none of us knew how to get there. This is really amazing. Are the rest of the guests from other worlds too?” She asked, looking round. </p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Boss is from a world with Gods, Demons and Dragons like our own. Lavy is from that world too. Sakura is from a different world. Rimuru and Milim are from different worlds too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No wonder there are people from so many races here and all seem quite different from the ones I know. I mean I have never seen a slime as strong as this and… are you a dragon, miss?” She asked Milim.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I am a dragonoid.” Milim answered with a puff of her chest.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Dragonoid?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Born from a True Dragon and a human.” She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“A True Dragon! That’s…” Her mouth opened up in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, we can talk afterwards. First try the food. Boss is the best chef I have ever seen. Try it before it gets cold.” Tohru urged them, successfully diverting their attention and they each took a bite of the food and paused.</p><p><br></p><p>A bright smile lit up the face of Lucoa while Fafnir just looked frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my… this is indeed one of the best foods I have eaten.” Lucoa praised while Fafnir… Fafnir was eating without caring about anything else. “What kind of dish is this?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is a Dragon Cherry Pie. These are made from Dragon Cherries, a special variety of cherries which dragons love. Tohru likes this.  I didn’t know what kind of food you liked so I made this for everyone. Is it to your tastes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is. I have never heard of Dragon Cherries. Is it from some other world?” She asked as she took another bite of the food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s from the world of one of my customers.” I answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The two dragons started eating and suddenly Milim spoke up. “Hey Sil, one pie for me too.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her… drooling and shook my head. Really, Milim was a glutton.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately I had anticipated this already and made extra for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha you are the best. Are you sure you don’t want to be my personal chef?” She asked, between her bites.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, I’ll pass.”</p><p><br></p><p>She pouted at the reply.</p><p><br></p><p>After they finished the meal, Lucoa talked to everyone about their worlds while Fafnir was looking at the members playing games.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked quite interested so I picked up a console I used and handed it to him. “Here, you can join them too. Rimuru, help Fafnir out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kay.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere reverted back to the usual calm one as guests started coming in once more and I got busy with work once again.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like this, it was evening. By now, things had changed completely. Fafnir was playing games… or at least trying his best.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was a very patient teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>He however left when Shizuka-san came in.</p><p><br></p><p>It was friday and she had a day off tomorrow and as usual she was here to drink.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I observed Lucoa looking at her… or rather the alcohol but hesitating so I went ahead and offered her a bottle of emerald wine and I understood soon enough why she was hesitating.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that bitch, she had the gall to say that I was nearing my thirties and too old for marriage. Am I old, Lucoa? Hah, am I old?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my… that’s a horrible thing to say. Thirty is practically a newborn in dragon years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right… that racist bitch!”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka-san found out about Lucoa and was actually interested in getting to know her, what’s with her being a famous mythical being… or an alternate version of that.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing led to another and they started drinking with each other and things became like this.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, none of what they said made sense anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was trying his best to support her.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side…</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, hit him, hit him hard.” Milim cheered on as Fafnir was bashing a mini boss with his character. “You are getting good at this.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fafnir was busy playing games and going from a victory dance to gamer’s rage from one second to another.</p><p><br></p><p>Oddly enough, they seemed to have integrated quite well in the group.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that Miu suddenly came to the Restaurant looking around worriedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san, Tohru-chan, have any one of you seen Naruto and Kanna?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? No… they were here but they went back in the morning if I remember correctly. Why? Are they not back home yet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No… we haven’t seen any of them since morning. First we thought that they had gone somewhere to play around but they didn’t come back for their lunch and now they are late for their snacks too. They never miss their food… Grandpa and the rest are searching outside while I came to check for them here.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked extremely worried. It was then that Milim suddenly spoke up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, those two were sneaking around and left the Restaurant when no one was paying attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>…What?</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly thought of the places they could go.</p><p><br></p><p>“They have either gone to Miu’s world, Tohru’s world or Naruto’s world because they only have permission to enter these worlds.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanna was not in our world.we would have sensed her if she was there.” Tohru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa and the rest are searching for them in my world so that only leaves… Naruto's world.”</p><p><br></p><p>A frown appeared on our faces remembering how he was treated there.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Is there something wrong with his world?” Lucoa asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let's say… Naruto wasn't treated well in that place.” I said and Tohru was frowning too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss, let me go there. I can search for them easily.” Tohru asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure? Should I go with you too? We don't know how big that place is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don't worry. I can take care of it, Boss.” She patted her chest quite confidently.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I can help too. My Universal Detection can easily find them anywhere.” Milim stood up and volunteered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Milim.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu, leave it to me. This much is easy.” She puffed up her chest too.</p><p><br></p><p>And now I was worried for a whole other reason.</p><p><br></p><p>While Naruto’s village didn’t treat him well, I was still hesitant about unleashing a Chaos Dragon and a Dragonoid Demon Lords on their heads. After all, one person can hardly represent the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that the situation was just too dire for me to care right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. Be careful. Don’t start a fight, okay. Remember, if there is any big trouble, call for us. We will be there in a moment.” I told them seriously. “Just don’t cause too much trouble, okay?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, Boss. But boss, what if they attack us first?” She asked, making me pause.</p><p><br>“Then you are free to do as you wish.” I don’t know how strong those ninjas are but if they were able to trap something like the kyuubi inside Naruto, they might be quite strong. Holding back against them could actually harm Tohru.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kay.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, I opened the door to the ninja village Naruto lived in and they left to search for him and Kanna.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Naruto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They were flying over Konoha’s training ground, Kanna-chan carrying him as they headed for Ichiraku Ramen when he spotted someone practising in one of the training grounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanna-chan, wait for a moment. I want to meet someone.” He called out. “Drop me there.” He pointed towards the training ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>She did just that and he landed right in the middle of the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The last person having sensed his presence jumped away from them and drew a kunai from his pouch but stopped when he recognised him.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s up, teme.” He smiled at Sasuke. “Training hard, I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke’s eyes widened at the sight of him. “Naruto… where did you disappear to?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I was out doing special training. I have become a lot stronger and could totally kick your ass now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke frowned. “Hmph… did you fall somewhere and hit your head, dobe? You beating me? Dream on.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! You wanna fight, hah! Come on, I will take you on.” He took a stance.</p><p><br></p><p>“If that’s what you wish for. I can always show you why I am the best in the class and you are the deadlast.” Sasuke took the taijutsu stance too.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a long time ago. I can totally kick your ass now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, show him, Naruto.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and who is she? Got yourself another loser friend, dobe?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her name is Kanna Kamui and she is not a loser.” He protested.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna nodded too. “Who is this duckbutt, Naruto?”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Duckbutt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, his hair looks like a duck’s butt.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto looked… he looked closer… and it indeed did.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha it does. It really does look like a duck’s butt.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke looked embarrassed and shouted. “Enough talk. Let’s see who the real loser is.”</p><p><br></p><p>They rushed towards each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the last time however, he could easily see Sasuke’s moves and react to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke’s taijutsu was different from his, but grandpa had taught him well.</p><p><br></p><p>Understand the rhythm and anticipate their moves. He did just that and found himself matching and then easily overpowering Sasuke. He noticed that he was physically stronger and faster than Sasuke already. In fact, he wasn’t even using his Cursed Energy to reinforce his attacks and was still outpacing Sasuke easily. </p><p><br></p><p>With one last punch to the gut, he sent Sasuke sliding down the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I told you, didn’t I. I can totally wipe the floor with you now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke got up, angry this time. “It’s not over yet. This is not a mock taijutsu match but a real fight.” He drew a kunai and a few shuriken.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto narrowed his eyes and looked at Kanna. “Can I have my tanto, Kanna-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.” Kanna nodded and pulled out his tanto from somewhere. They had packed some weapons when they had come here and Kanna-chan had stored everything with her magic.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a mission after all. How could they go out without any weapons?</p><p><br></p><p>He drew the tanto and faced Sasuke. During his time at the Ryozanpaku dojo, Shigure nee-chan had taught him a lot about Bukijutsu. She was even better than Iruka-sensei at teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto personally chose a tanto because he had seen Nanami-sensei using a sword and Silas nii-san used knives and swords too and they looked cool.</p><p><br></p><p>They clashed again, this time with kunai and tanto. The clash sent sparks between the weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them clashed several times. Naruto actually took time to understand the rhythm again instead of using his speed and strength to overpower him.</p><p><br></p><p>Once that was done, the result was the same as the taijutsu fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke’s kunai was sent flying in the air and he had his tanto on his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>“My win, teme.” He grinned as he put his tanto back into the sheathe and offered a hand to him. “We are going to eat ramen at Ichiraku’s. Wanna come with us?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He got up and dusted his clothes. “Hmph… I need to train. My nii-san will teach me a new jutsu and then I will totally beat you up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah… well, I got a nee-chan and a nii-san too. They are very strong too. In fact, I will ask him to teach me some cool stuff too.” He argued back.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas nii-san could teach him some awesome magic. That was even cooler than ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph… as if some random guy could match my nii-san.” Sasuke snorted rudely.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you know? Sil-nii-san is super strong. He could totally wipe the floor with your nii-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You take that back!”</p><p><br></p><p>“No way!”</p><p><br></p><p>And thus they began arguing… until he heard Kanna’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, I’m hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Kanna-chan, this teme is saying that Sil nii-san would lose against his brother. Sil nii-san could totally kick his ass dattebayo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Sil has become stronger. He will win.”</p><p><br></p><p>“See. Kanna-chan knows it too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are both dumb.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you say!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I said you are dumb.”</p><p><br></p><p>And once more they were arguing before he felt Kanna-chan pick him up and fly in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanna-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… okay.” he looked down at Sasuke who was looking at him with wide open eyes. “See you later, teme. And Sil nii-san would totally win.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, Kanna used her stealth magic again and they flew towards Ichiraku Ramen once more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sasuke -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>What the hell had the dobe been doing all these months?</p><p><br></p><p>How did he get so strong?</p><p><br></p><p>And who was that girl with wings?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it some kind of ninjutsu?</p><p><br></p><p>While thinking about these, he returned home.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t joking when he said that nii-san would train with him today. Itachi had been busy with missions and had only returned last night and had promised to train with him today.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, he reached home.</p><p><br></p><p>His mother was the one who opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sasuke… how did you get dirty?” She asked, looking at the state of his clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his shoes and entered his house.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside, his father was sitting with Itachi.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was training.” He replied before taking a seat nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you training with someone? You don’t usually get this roughed up.” His mother asked, making him embarrassed when remembering what he had faced just a while ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I met a… classmate.” He nodded shyly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those look like bruises from a fight. Were you sparring with them? Is there someone in your class who can bruise you in a spar?” His father asked, his tone disappointed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke bowed his head, ashamed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s train later on today, Sasuke.” Itachi offered and he looked at his brother with a smile and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, go and get cleaned up first. It’s almost time for lunch. You can train after that.” Mother interrupted them and sent him for a bath.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke hurried and took a bath and returned back for lunch.</p><p><br></p><p>He started to quickly eat so that he could go out and train with his nii-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eat slowly, Sasuke. The food is not running anywhere.” His mother chided and he slowed down.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how did you get that bruise?” His father asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He paused. “It was… in a taijutsu fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… did you drop your guard against the opponent? Such arrogance can become the undoing of even the greatest shinobi.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...yes father.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you win?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you win the fight? I can understand if you exchanged that bruise for a win.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… didn’t.” He replied embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You lost?” Itachi asked, surprised. “I didn’t know there was someone in your class who could match you in taijutsu. Can you tell me about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… he was stronger and faster and he somehow seemed to be anticipating all my moves. Even when we used weapons, he matched me and then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fighting an opponent with greater strength and speed can be difficult. You shouldn’t lose your cool and try to find a weakness. In a fight, you only need one good hit to win so calmly wait for your opportunity.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there something else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He… he wasn’t using his speed or strength to fight. He was actually holding back. Somehow he already knew what I was going to do, almost as if he had a sharingan. But he isn’t even an Uchiha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need a sharingan to anticipate your opponent’s moves, Sasuke. The Sharingan is a tool which can help you get stronger but it’s not the only way. Any experienced shinobi can predict your moves in a battle.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, I didn’t expect there to be such a kid in your class. What’s his name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… he isn’t in our class per say… or at least not anymore. He suddenly left the academy one day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? What’s his name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto Uzumaki.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the whole room became silent. His parents and brother stopped eating and then suddenly his father turned towards him. “Where… where did you see him, Sasuke? Where is he now?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke was taken aback by the intensity of the question and wasn’t able to reply for a moment when he felt a hand on his back.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to be afraid, Sasuke. You are not in any trouble. Just answer the question. It’s very important. Where did you see, Naruto Uzumaki?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In… the training ground near the river where we practise shurikenjutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, around an hour ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was he alone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No… there was a girl with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Girl? How did she look? Describe her in detail.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She looked around our age. She had white-lavender hair and blue eyes. She was wearing a pink dress and…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She could fly…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She could make wings appear on her back and fly. She took Naruto away when they were leaving.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did they go? Did you see the direction they left?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… umm, I… they invited me for ramen. I think they went to the Ichiraku Ramen to eat something.” He replied after thinking back again.</p><p><br></p><p>His father and brother exchanged looks and the former spoke. “Itachi, go and inform the Hokage. I will bring Sasuke with me and follow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes father.”</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi immediately got up and disappeared in a shunshin while his father got up too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get ready, Sasuke.”</p><p><br></p><p>While still confused about everything, Sasuke got up and started getting ready.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Jiraiya -</strong><br><br></p><p>He was in the Hokage’s building, about to enter the Hokage’s office when he saw Itachi Uchiha heading towards the building.</p><p><br></p><p>“Itachi, you look like you are in a hurry. Did you just return from a mission?” He asked, trying to make small talk with him. The condition with the Uchiha has been deteriorating. The sudden presence of Tsunade and him was holding them back for now and Sensei had talked with Fugaku Uchiha to ease the tensions but to no avail. </p><p><br></p><p>After investigating for the past few weeks, to some extent, he understood their anger too. The Uchiha clan was put in a bad condition and even when it was not explicitly said, they were indeed discriminated against at some level.</p><p><br></p><p>They were indeed one of the two clans who had made this village and yet, they had time and time again produced strong shinobi, becoming the backbone of Konoha’s military might and yet… in all this time, after Kagami Uchiha, not a single person had even come close to the central power or management of the village.</p><p><br></p><p>The first two Hokages were Senju, the third was chosen by a Senju and even in the last election, Minato was the same, the student of the Third Hokage’s student. While he would always say Minato was the best choice, the worst part was Fugaku Uchiha not even getting a mention. Orochimaru did but Fugaku didn’t. The Uchiha were very offended by this, especially after their contributions on the battlefield.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uchiha Clan, a clan famed for their fire jutsu and dojutsu, were sent to fight Kirigakure, a village famous for water jutsu and hidden mist jutsu which can block dojutsu. The decision was stupid. He had called for it to be changed but Sensei had made an excuse that they had no other people.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hyuga were still there, the Inuzuka and Aburame were still there. Each of these clans would have been far better equipped against those opponents and yet, the Uchiha were the only ones sent… and they didn’t complain and even completed their duties loyally. And yet…</p><p><br></p><p>Minato had been trying to ease the tensions with the Uchiha, especially since Obito was also one… but even that was not possible after Obito’s death and Kakashi getting the Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>Laying a hand on the kekkei genkai of a clan was absolutely forbidden. Just look at the extent the Hyuga Clan goes to protect their eyes… and yet they were more or less strong-armed into leaving their sharingan with Kakashi.</p><p><br></p><p>All these things had been bubbling and everyone knew this. So when the Kyuubi attack happened, everyone’s doubt went to the Uchiha, especially with the sharingan visible in the Kyubi’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything had only gone down the drain all of a sudden and the strongest clan in the village was sent to the outskirts of the village.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing came out in the investigations and yet the damage was already done.</p><p><br></p><p>Come to think of it, all this was just as much the village management’s fault… and now they were paying the price for it.</p><p><br></p><p>They had come to a position where a war could start at any time. He could only sigh when he thought about this.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this really the village he had worked for?</p><p><br></p><p>Just what has sensei been doing all these years?</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi looked in a hurry but stopped when he saw him. “Jiraiya-sama. It’s urgent. I need to talk to the Hokage soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, something the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy struggled and he nodded, understanding how missions were. “Let’s go. I was going to sensei either way.”</p><p><br></p><p>They rushed to the Hokage’s office where the Hokage was in a discussion with his two advisors.</p><p><br></p><p>He knocked on the door but there was no reply. There were arguments going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Even from outside, he could hear a few things.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am telling you Hiruzen, there is no proof about Danzo being involved in any of this. Right now things are tense. We need him and his roots to stabilise the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I have already told you, my decision is final. I will not be hearing any of this. Now, if you don’t have anything else to report… leave. I am very busy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiruzen, you…”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya was also done with his eavesdropping and a voice came from inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both Itachi and he entered the room. The eyes of the advisors narrowed at the sight of Itachi… sigh… and they wondered how things went so far.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Jiraiya?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, Itachi has something urgent. I can report after that.” He looked at the guy and smiled. The guy looked like he was on fire somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensei looked towards Itachi who quickly got on one knee. “Naruto Uzumaki has been sighted in the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the room called in one voice and before he knew it, he was grabbing Itachi with both his shoulders. “Where is he?”</p><p><br>“Jiraiya, calm down. Itachi explain.” Sensei ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi nodded and explained everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto sparring with Sasuke Uchiha and then flying away with a white haired girl… with wings…</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure they are at Ichiraku’s?” Sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not. I came here directly to inform you. My father and Sasuke will be coming here to talk to you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, I am leaving to check.” He said and sensei got up too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am coming too. Itachi, ask your father and brother to wait here when they arrive.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that both of them left at their fastest speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching Ichiraku wasn’t that long after.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, as soon as they reached the door, they heard a loud laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not going to lose to you, Kanna-chan, not in eating ramen dattebayo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm… talk less, eat more.” Another voice sounded and the next second, he was already inside the restaurant following sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, sitting on two chairs, eating ramen were two kids. One of them has the same blonde hair and blue eyes as Minato while the other with white hair and a strange dress.</p><p><br></p><p>The restaurant owner recognised them and stood up, greeting them. “Hokage-sama, Jiraiya-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded at them while sensei directly went towards the children.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto!”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya observed from the back.</p><p><br></p><p>As much as he wanted to go and meet him, he didn’t even know the boy. It could scare him away.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked at them as a look of recognition flashed in his eyes as he saw sensei, even a look of happiness and then… came rage. In the end, he just turned his head back towards the bowl of ramen and concentrated on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensei frowned and sat beside him. “Naruto, where have you been all this time? You were not at your home and you didn’t even go to the academy? Everyone was worried about you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto however just pouted and kept eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Naruto? Why are you not saying anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy stopped and looked back. “Oh? And why should I?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because I want to know. We were all worried about you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the rage on the boy’s face became obvious. “Oh, so it matters when you want to know things? When you are worried? What about when I was worried? What about when I asked you who my parents were?…”</p><p><br></p><p>The statement froze both of them while the boy continued.</p><p><br>“You knew it. You knew who my father was… who my parents were and yet you didn’t tell me. Do you know how much I thought about them? The people of the village always said that my parents never wanted a monster like me so they abandoned me. That my parents never loved me… and you knew they were wrong… you knew everything and still didn’t say anything!” The boy had tears in his eyes and fists clenched hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya couldn’t tell if it was just his feeling or not but the atmosphere around them chilled slightly… and the source of this feeling… it was coming from Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto… who… who told you that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My parents… they left their energies… chakra… whatever… inside me… I met them. I know everything. I know who my parents are and even why everyone is afraid of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened at the reveal of the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Many thoughts ran through his head in that instant.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it true? Or was someone using genjutsu on him to feed him the wrong information? If so then who was behind all this?</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, it’s not like that. Come with me. We will talk in my office.” Sensei went forward to calm him down but the boy stepped back.</p><p><br></p><p>“No! I don’t want to talk to any of you! Go away! Go away! Go away!” Suddenly a huge burst of energy pushed them away and something which Jiraiya never imagined he would ever see again appeared in front of their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Golden Chains appeared and threw sensei outside the ramen shop.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya stepped forward to defend against any following attack but the kunai in his hand fell down and his jaws hung open when he saw the figure from whom the chains were originating.</p><p><br></p><p>The figure was monstrous, like some kind of evil spirit that could chill the hearts of people and yet… she stood protectively in front of Naruto and if there was any leftover doubt in his mind, it was cleared by the blood red hair flowing on her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“K-kushina…” The name came out of his mouth almost unconsciously.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that his years of training came back to him as the hair on the back of his neck stood at the feeling of danger and he dove back, almost too close for a figure to slash down with a kunai. Strands of his hair fell in front of his widened eyes as he recognised the figure… the flash of yellow that had appeared in front of his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He watched in frozen shock at the… almost demonic figure with the same sunny blonde hair on his head, holding a bone line dagger in a hauntingly similar stance protectively in front of the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>The killing intent the two figures were exuding was making even him experience chills just by standing in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop owner and his daughter looked pale at the sight of the two.</p><p><br></p><p>They were thinking about what to do when the white haired girl got up from her seat and walked casually to his side and smacked his head lightly. “Calm down, stupid Naruto. You’re scaring the shopkeeper. I want more ramen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ow… I… I am sorry, Kanna-chan.” Naruto apologised before looking at the two figures in front of him. “It’s okay, mom, dad. I am not in danger. I was just… angry. You can rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>To their utter surprise, the figures slowly faded away.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto then went on to apologise to the shop owner and his daughter and then looked at the white haired girl, Kanna. “Let’s go. We are getting late.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto. Let me explain everything. It’s not what you think.” Sensei went forward but stayed a few feet away from him, not risking what had just happened.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want to talk to you. I am just here to take a picture of my parents and I will leave after that.” The boy answered curtly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have their pictures. In fact, I have all their belongings too. Your father wanted those to be given to you when you were older. Come with me. Let me explain everything first. You can take whatever you want after that.” Sensei tried to explain.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid however just narrowed his eyes at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not lying, kid. Your parents’ belongings are indeed with him. At least hear him out once. Your friend can also come along if you want.” Jiraiya also went ahead and added carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid looked at the girl who nodded. “Let’s go. They are weak. If they try something, I will beat them up.” She patted her chest confidently.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene made Jiraiya smile even with all the crap that was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure, Kanna-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay then.” He then looked at them and nodded. He created a shadow clone to take care of the situation there while his original body left with the rest of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>They turned towards the Hokage building and the white haired girl grew wings and picked Naruto up, following them, leaving a stunned audience around.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>They entered the hokage’s office through the window and Naruto and the girl landed behind them as her wings shrunk back into her back.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya watched in awe and couldn’t help but ask. “What kind of jutsu is that?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked at him oddly and it was Naruto who answered. “Kanna-chan is a dragon. Those are her real wings. She hides them when she is in human form.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>And as if to smack that fact into their heads, the girl grew horns and a tail too.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya watched closely and indeed they were growing out of her body.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she a summoning beast?</p><p><br></p><p>He had once heard Orochimaru say that the snakes in the Ryuichi Cave could take the form of humans too.</p><p><br></p><p>But Dragons?</p><p><br></p><p>Did Dragons even exist?</p><p><br></p><p>He had never heard of any such summoning beast. Not even the toads of Mt. Myoboku knew of them.</p><p><br></p><p>And had he somehow reverse summoned himself in the summoning land of dragons? There was an example of this already… Jiraiya himself had done something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>It would also match up with his increased growth. From what he had known Naruto wasn’t exactly good in his classes and yet he had apparently effortlessly defeated the top student of his class after returning. So the training he was getting there must have been good.</p><p><br></p><p>He exchanged a look with sense who was listening to the conversation from the side and asked further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… were you living with her… I mean dragons?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy narrowed his eyes suspiciously at him. Geez, just how much did sensei mess up.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya raised his hand quickly, trying to calm them down. “No need to get mad. I am just curious. I have never heard of any dragons before and wanted to know more about them. Where do they live? I have travelled all over the world but this is my first time seeing one.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto was about to speak but the girl stopped him and turned towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why should I tell you? What’s in it for us?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding a clue, Jiraiya dove in. “Oh, and what is it that you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>A glint passed by the girl’s eyes. “That bunshin thing you did back there… teach that to Naruto.” She asked and suddenly Naruto also had a look of realisation on his face and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bunshin… you mean the Kage Bunshin?” He asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, the Kage Bunshin… tell me how to use it and I will tell you where the dragons live.” Naruto nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well kid, it’s not an easy technique. It might take you a lot of time to learn that.” He answered, pretending to think.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you would need to complete your academy too. It's a jutsu only ninjas can learn. And didn't you want to be the Hokage, Naruto?” Sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The question however had the opposite effect to what he was expecting. The frown on the boy's face returned with full force.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want to be Hokage or even a ninja. I will become a Legendary Master like Gramps.”</p><p><br>Just what had those dragons been teaching him?</p><p><br></p><p>“But Naruto… your father… he was the fourth Hokage.  He was a great man who gave up his life to protect the village. Don’t you want to become like him?” Sensei asked, the worry in his voice, easy to recognise.</p><p><br></p><p>“And my father would also have wanted me to grow up properly and yet, I was thrown out of the orphanage, mocked and shunned by everyone.” The words were like a punch to their guts. “My parents gave up their lives to protect me, so that I can live a better life and I don’t think being a ninja is that life for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who told you that, Naruto? Just who took you away from Konoha.” Sensei asked, his voice agitated slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>And as if to make things worse, the door opened and his two advisors entered… with the man he didn’t want to see in tow.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him, Tsunade, Fugaku Uchiha and his sons also entered.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya noticed the tension in the air between the two groups and the looks they threw at each other.</p><p><br>“Danzo… what are you doing here? I remember saying that you were not allowed anywhere outside your quarters.” Sensei asked in a warning tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“The boy has been found. I am here to prove that I wasn’t involved in any of this.” Danzo replied, unbothered. “But the more important question is where has he been all this time and how was he taken away? You do understand that letting such a significant military asset to the village get lost is your responsibility.”</p><p><br>“You do not… need to teach me what my responsibility is. I still haven’t permitted you to come out of your house arrest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not, Hiruzen.” Koharu complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough! You will keep quiet. That’s an order.” Sensei shouted, taking all of them by surprise. It was a side of sensei they had rarely seen before.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, someone else was getting annoyed by the whole situation too.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto was the one who broke the silence. “Old man, I have waited long enough. When will you give me the pictures of my parents? I need to go back home.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is your home, Naruto. Don’t you want to know about your parents? Jiraiya here, was your father’s sensei. He can tell you everything about them and even teach you ninjutsu like him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes kid. Didn’t you want to learn the Kage Bunshin justu? I can  teach you that. In fact, your friend can join too. I am a summoner too and I know a lot about summoning beasts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want any of that. I don’t want to be a ninja. I am going to be a Legendary Master dattebayo. I told you that already. Now, are you going to give me the pictures of my parents or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>The words brought out several reactions from the rest of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>“What does he mean by that, Hiruzen? You didn’t tell him… how could you? Do you have any idea what would happen if he spreads the identity…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what is this about going back home? Where exactly is he going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Letting a strategic resource of the village getaway is absolutely unacceptable.”</p><p><br></p><p>The situation was getting completely out of control as sensei and his advisors delved into an argument.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto also seemed done with everything and looked at the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems they were lying to us again, Kanna-chan. Let’s go. We can find their pictures later.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl however pointed towards a picture on the wall. “There… a picture of your dad.” Naruto looked back in surprise and his eyes lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeah.” He jumped towards the wall and removed Minato’s picture from there. “Now only the picture of my mom is left. We can totally find it by ourselves. You are awesome, Kanna-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>The simple statement however brought several reactions, especially from the Uchiha who were staring wide eyed at the kid.</p><p><br>Aghh… this is turning into such a mess.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Let’s go.” The girl walked towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where exactly are you going?” Sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Home.” Naruto replied as the girl sprouted wings and took hold of them and were about to fly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop, Naruto!” Sensei commanded and several anbu surrounded them in an instant, closing their exit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei!” he called out but sensei raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Calm down, Jiraiya. He is just angry right now. We need to explain things to him first and know where he found everything from. Till then they need to be kept here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, let us go.” Naruto shouted while the white haired girl also let him down on the ground and glared at the anbu, almost as if preparing to attack when something happened which took them all by surprise once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Golden Chains erupted from Naruto’s back and pushed all the anbu away.</p><p><br></p><p>Few of them were thrown against the wall and the rest dodged, regaining their footing and drawing their weapons, surrounding him.</p><p><br></p><p>Those were… Kushina’s Adamantine Sealing Chains…</p><p><br></p><p>The tense atmosphere was broken by a new voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?”</p><p><br></p><p>They all looked towards the window where a girl was standing. She had long blonde hair with flaming orange tips and red-orange eyes with dilated pupils and was wearing a long blue dress over a white shirt and a hair band. The most surprising thing about here however were the horns and the green lizard-like tail poking out of the dress.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind her was another girl. This one appeared much younger in age. She had pink hair tied up in a twin tails, and was floating in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto-kun, Kanna, what is going on here? Why did you two run away without informing anyone? Do you have any idea how much everyone is worried?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm sorry. I… we just came here to get the pictures of my mom and dad. I got one and need one more and when we were returning they stopped us.” He pointed towards the anbu surrounding them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensei stepped forward. “Are you one of the contracted dragons of Naruto? I have never heard of any dragons. Where do you all live?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked at him with narrowed eyes. “Dragons live in the world of dragons. Now, why are you stopping them from returning home?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This place is Naruto’s home. He needs to spend time here too. I can understand that you want him to train in your arts but he needs to bond with the people of the village too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We already know what kind of home this village was to Naruto-kun.” She replied with narrowed eyes. “This place… has not treated Naruto-kun well and we will not stand by and watch that. He will not be staying here anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p> He just looked at the girl and spoke again. “I am sorry. It seems there has been some kind of misunderstanding here but we can talk and solve that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No need.” The girl stepped towards the anbu and Danzo stepped between them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and who are you to decide that? The boy is a property of this village and will be going nowhere. Anbu, capture them.” Danzo ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is no one’s property.” Jiraiya shouted back.</p><p><br>“He is, as every jinchuriki, a strategic weapon of the village. Remember your place as a ninja of Konoha, Jiraiya. This is not time to let your emotions run wild.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl stopped at the words and Jiraiya noticed the rage in the girl’s eyes at the statement, her fists clenched but she didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards sensei and to his surprise the old man didn’t move but instead looked at the girl and spoke. “I am sorry but I cannot let you take Naruto away. He needs to stay here, in his home as his parents wanted. If you want to insist, I will have to use force to stop you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can try your best.” She replied and stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the signal and one of the anbu attacked her with a drawn kunai. The girl didn’t stop and the kunai struck her directly in her forehead… only to shatter into pieces. The girl however instead of getting angry, smiled… a smile which sent shivers down Jiraiya’s spine. All his instincts screamed at him to run away or he would die.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl, no, the dragon spoke again. “The boss told me not to start any fights while I was here and I was only allowed to fight if I was attacked. This… counts as an attack, doesn’t it?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the next moment Jiraiya knew why his instincts were going haywire as an unholy amount of power seeped out from the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the room froze.</p><p><br></p><p>This power… it was like the Kyubi… no… It was probably worse…</p><p><br></p><p>Her figure blurred and all the anbu were thrown out of the hokage tower, their bodies ripping holes in the walls on their way out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanna, take Naruto-kun and go back. I will return in a few minutes.” She snapped a finger and a tear in space appeared near them.</p><p><br></p><p>The white haired girl nodded and took Naruto and jumped directly into the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>Danzo however attacked them with his Vacuum Sphere jutsu but the other girl who had been floating outside the window suddenly appeared between them and the attacks struck her… doing no damage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Catch them. Don’t let them escape!” Danzo shouted and everyone jumped into action.</p><p><br></p><p>The tear in space however closed and only two girls remained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Capture them! Don’t let them get away.” Sensei ordered and even Jiraiya joined them, even if he didn’t agree with their way of doing things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are we having a fight, Tohru-chan? Hey, are we having a fight? Uwahahahaha these people want to fight us but they are so weak. Hey, do you think if we beat them up, Sil would be happy and then we can get extra desserts after dinner?”</p><p><br></p><p>“…well, the boss considers Naruto-kun his adopted brother so he would definitely not mind if we beat them up.” The girl answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then for my extra dragon cherry pudding… get beaten up.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya had no idea what was happening but he had a feeling that things had just gone from bad to worse.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter took a lot out of me, always something or the other coming up and delaying the work.</strong></p><p><strong><br>I know it ended on a cliff but trust me… for once, this was unplanned.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was hoping to complete the whole fight in the chapter but then as I wrote, I realised that I wouldn’t even be able to start the fight properly at the rate and had to end here.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So Konoha is… how to say this… fucked.

We shall be there in a moment.” I replied and walked towards my room.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, I saw several of the Palace maids throwing looks at me and then blushing and looking away.</p><p><br></p><p>While this had been a regular thing since the Charm Ritual, it was even more today.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what was going on in the minds of these girls?</p><p><br></p><p>I reached my room and took a bath, got dressed up and came out to find Kuina standing outside, looking at me with a deadpan. I couldn’t help but ask. “What’s with that look? Are you Sera henge’d as Kuina?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What were you doing in Kasumi-chan’s room the whole night?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? I… well, you know, I… told her about everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I told her about everything we found out from our investigation about the Stairs Daimyo’s plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The whole night?” She asked and it was then that I realised what she was asking.</p><p><br></p><p>“She was crying and I just sat there consoling her, you know. Just what goes on in that mind of yours?” I protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not what goes on in my head, it’s what the maids in the palace are talking about. The Prince stayed the night at the Princesses’ room. Just open your ears for a moment and you will hear it yourself.” She replied, embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>“… so that’s why they were throwing those kinds of looks towards me. Dammit, what kind of overactive imagination do these people have?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are making assumptions which any normal person would.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh. “I know you two are engaged and all but you still aren’t married. People could spread rumours and that would be bad for both of you, especially for Kasumi-chan. She already has it hard. Just keep it in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked to Grandpa’s room while talking.</p><p><br></p><p>“The five hundred kids for the new batch of trainees have been gathered. The last batch arrived yesterday.” Kuina reported.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, when did they come?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Late last night.” She replied. “Kensho didn’t want to stop in any other country during war time and brought them over as fast as they could.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Have they been provided with food, clothing and residence?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. All of them were moved to the new lodgings. They will be checked for any diseases and introduced to the teachers tomorrow. The seniors are guiding them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>We had made arrangements for one of the senior students from the previous year to stay with five new students.</p><p><br></p><p>They will be able to guide them in their starting phases, helping them with smaller problems and facilitating their learning.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many people from other countries right now and don’t really have feelings for the Land of Flowers. It can also help foster some bond between the kids at an earlier stage and increase their loyalty towards their comrades and the country.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the room and Kuina waited outside while I went ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa was sitting as usual in the room with a large smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it? Did something good happen?” I asked, looking at his happy face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, something good has happened. I heard you spent the night with Kasumi-chan. When should I expect my grandson?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh, not you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What? What’s bad about that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing happened alright? We were just talking about things. I found out about Kasumi’s mother and told her about everything. She was crying and I stayed with her consoling her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And then you consoled her <em>properly</em>, didn’t you?” He asked, putting a lot of stress on the ‘properly’ word.</p><p><br></p><p>“No! Didn’t you listen? She was crying. And we aren’t exactly married yet. There will be rumours everywhere. Even now the maids have been throwing me embarrassed looks everywhere.” I complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… sometimes I wonder if you have gained anything from me and your father? What kind of Daimyo is worried about such dumb things? You are my only descendant. People hope that you would do such things. No one would spread any rumours as long as you don’t go kidnapping and forcing yourself on the unwilling. The maids of the palace know that more than anyone else. Their lives depend on it. They were throwing looks at you to actually entice you, you dumb moron.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha…?” I found my mouth open at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“When the maids are hired, some actually expect to gain the favour of royalty while some are hired to take care of the needs of royalty. Sometimes even lower noble families send their daughters to the palace so that they could gain the favour of a prince or the daimyo and their family can rise. The Daimyo allow this to ally themselves with other houses through marriage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But we don’t have any…”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. No we don’t have any in your generation as I had them sent back after your father’s death. Mira in fact is from the house of a noble incharge of Ajisai town.” He explained calmly. “In fact, it’s not exactly bad to have such small bad rumours about yourself.” He added in the end, making me confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, with your progress, I sometimes forget that you are still a kid and need to learn the usual stuff in politics. You see, whatever you do, there will always be bad rumours about you in the world. This will remain true even if you were to become the King of the world. There will always be people who will spread bad rumours about you. The thing you must keep in mind is to not let those get out of hand. Tell me, do you think the common people of the land would care if they found that you have taken twenty lovers?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… it wouldn’t look good.” I replied unsurely.</p><p><br></p><p>“True but they wouldn’t care. It doesn’t directly affect them. As long as you don’t go publicly kidnapping girls from public places like a tyrant, the general populace doesn’t care. What they would however care about is the new technology you provided them and the increase in their income. They will care about the security you can provide them and increase the prosperity of the nation. Sure, some might talk, laugh but they wouldn’t do anything truly harmful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why even let that happen?” He asked, already anticipating my question and I nodded. “Why very simple? People are wary of perfect people. Success begets jealousy. It doesn’t matter if someone does honest business and gets rich, people will always think they are doing something bad in the background, always choosing to believe that others have flaws to ignore their own. If you appear flawless, they will look closer to find a flaw. You have secrets and don’t want people to look closer so why not give them some flaws to satisfy themselves? That way, <em>you</em> will be the one in control, showing them what <em>you</em> want. Understand this Kazuya, fear not what you can see but that which you cannot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… understand.” It did make sense, in a weird sort of way but still, it did.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Now what was that about Kasumi-chan’s mother?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… that’s.” I explained the situation to him and his face became serious again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobirama Senju, that man… he was far more dangerous than his brother. In fact, I personally think he was more dangerous than even the Shura, Madara Uchiha. And it was not due to his strength but rather his brain. To think he would have done such a thing. Do you know where other Senju tribe people have been scattered? Do they have any in our Land or God forbid, our court?” he asked, looking tense.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were cut off from the village when they were sent out and now after Tobirama’s death almost no one knows where they are. I can always try to find out but it will take some time.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“At least find any in our land. They might not be a part of Konoha anymore but they might still have loyalty for that village. It could be dangerous at a later time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Grandpa.” I hesitated a bit before speaking again. “I have designed a way to increase the vitality of people. Right now it’s not that much but I might be able to increase it further in the future. Do you want to test it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Another one of your experiments? Sure, as long as you think it’s all good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything is completed. I assure you that the results will be great.” I hurriedly said with some excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>Increasing his vitality will ensure that he can live longer. Although I have been giving him medication to make sure of it, rituals are much better.</p><p><br>We talked about a few things and I left for my warehouse to work on my new project.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed mutated chakra beasts for many of my rituals and getting them was not easy. So… I decided to find a way to make them for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, chakra beasts were animals mutated by chakra, gaining the ability to use chakra like ninken or some insects.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to emulate the process and give them the ability and this could be done through medications and rituals.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the methods have their pros and cons.</p><p><br></p><p>Medications are more stable and require less cost but are slower. It could take something from a month to a whole year to complete the transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>Rituals on the other hand are almost instant but its effects on the minds of the beasts are not good.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally when the beast develops the ability to use chakra, its intelligence rises overtime until some can even communicate in human language.</p><p><br></p><p>In case of ritual induced mutations, the process is completed instantly and it overwhelms the beast’s minds.</p><p><br></p><p>While this doesn’t affect their utility for further rituals, it does make them unusable for other purposes such as using them as ninja beasts or for other works.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual for vitality I had designed for others, needs the sacrifice of three animals to increase the vitality in a person. This can be done up to three times with three, five and seven beasts respectively. The stronger the vitality of an animal, the better the results.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning on using the ritual as a reward for promotions. We had decided on keeping the levels of Samurai basic. Apprentice Samurai for Genin, Novice Samurai for Chunin, Veteran Samurai for Tokubetsu Jonin, Expert Samurai for Jonin and Grandmaster Samurai for Kage level.</p><p><br></p><p>For the promotions, everyone has to pass strict strength, leadership as well as loyalty tests. My plan was to reward the three animal rituals for Apprentice, five for Novice and seven for Expert level.</p><p><br></p><p>This would give a chance for more loyal and hardworking members to increase their strength even if they lacked more natural talent.</p><p><br></p><p>As for how to get so many animals… I had collected data with some animals and found a simple solution.</p><p><br></p><p>Using livestock animals as sacrifices. Using chakra beast versions of livestock animals was even better.</p><p><br></p><p>Even goats and pigs had enough vitality to complete the ritual and while the immediate increase might not be too great, their vitality could increase the overall potential of the person, making sure that each of them could be trained to a Chunin level chakra reserves easily, maybe even further.</p><p><br></p><p>One saving grace was that the offspring of the chakra beasts were also chakra beasts so I needed to start a breeding farm for these beasts somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>For Grandpa and my subordinates though, I was preparing bears and tigers. I will change them to chakra beasts and then use them for sacrifice.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, the dozen bears I had experimented on were ready so I was planning on using the ritual on Grandpa.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was that the body of the animals weren’t destroyed in the ritual so they could be covered up as a livestock business and a butcher house.</p><p><br></p><p>Among my subordinates, Kuina and Toji didn’t even need the ritual with Kuina downright denying it.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, with her One Piece physique, I doubted it would have any effects on her. Toji on the other hand wanted every advantage he could get so he told me that he would go through with the ritual. The ones who would gain the most would be Saitō, Kanae and Rose.</p><p><br></p><p>Sera is a vampire. Vitality is never a problem for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you ready, Saitō?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Let’s start this then.” I started the ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>The three bears roared at once as the ritual circle lit up, seals on their bodies stopping them from moving.</p><p><br></p><p>The light of the circle gathered in their bodies and slowly their movements slowed down until they fell down on the ground, lifeless, only three orbs of lights remaining above their bodies. The light orbs then floated through the circles and into Saitō’s body.</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s body convulsed but he didn’t make any noise.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew this was going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual was apparently painful as I had found out when using it on the prisoners, the higher the vitality transferred, the more the pain and Saitō was using three Chakra Beasts. Obviously, it was painful.</p><p><br></p><p>I had even advised him to be sedated but he had denied it.</p><p><br></p><p>“The least I could do is bear the pain to achieve this strength.” was what he said. Sigh, the guy is too stubborn sometimes. But then again, that’s what makes him Saitō Hajime.</p><p><br></p><p>He collapsed to his knees and clenched his fists, blood seeping from his palms but still didn’t make any noise.</p><p><br>From my side, his face was gaining more colour, his slight wrinkles fading away. Overall, he looked a couple years younger.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual was completed after just a minute and it left a heaving Saitō kneeled on the ground. My senses told me that his chakra had increased by almost twice, now at a Jōnin level. The changes take some time to settle and he will soon have an Elite Jōnin level chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s done. Do you need some time to rest?” I asked and he nodded. “Alright. Let me help you.” I helped him up and helped him to his room.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaving Saitō to sleep, I went to visit Kanae.</p><p><br></p><p>She was talking to Rose.</p><p><br></p><p>“How are your experiments going?” I asked, taking a seat beside her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I was just discussing the technique with Rose-sama and how we might reduce the side effects of the technique to a manageable level.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae was trying to find out ways to integrate chakra in her Breathing techniques to upgrade them.</p><p><br></p><p>In doing so, she came across a method which had a similar effect as the Eight Gates which can increase the overall power of the individual by a large margin in return of exhaustion later on.</p><p><br></p><p>With Rose’s inclusion, we could train the Eight Inner Gates technique much better since she just healed any exhaustion and damage so we could get a better feel of the technique and progress faster. Even though I had reached the fifth gate without much trouble, I still needed experience with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, since we were already teaching the Breathing Techniques, this method would be more suitable for them than the Eight Inner Gates with a common base.</p><p><br></p><p>It would also help us devise a method from something already existing in the Elemental Nations, something unique.</p><p><br></p><p>I had given her full support for this and now with Rose there to heal her up, she could push forward to more intense training.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will provide you with the fundings. Just do your best.” I assured them.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them nodded, Kanae especially was enthusiastic about this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa has agreed to undergo the ritual and I just wanted Rose-san to remain with us to check up on him. He is of an advanced age and I don’t want to risk anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rose agreed and we discussed some things before she left, leaving Kanae and me alone in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked for any people nearby and found no one and looked at Kanae with a smile before pulling her closer to me and picking her up in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya-san!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” I replied, while walking to her bed and sitting there with her on my lap and kissing her neck.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmh.” She bit back her moan. “S-someone might come.”</p><p><br></p><p>I made a hand sign and a shadow clone appeared, making Kanae yelp in surprise. He rolled an eye towards us and went ahead and locked the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“There. Now no one will come without asking.” I replied before burying my face in her neck again, gliding my lips on her skin, enjoying the smell of her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>I stopped for a moment, looked into her eyes and said. “If you don’t like this or anything, you are always free to tell me Kanae. I will never force you. I really like you and I wish to make this a serious relationship in the future so if you have any second thoughts, please never be afraid to tell me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… too.” She whispered out. “But Kasumi-chan… you were staying with her…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there no one who doesn’t know about that?” I deadpanned. A part of me thought Grandpa was pulling this to make the girls know that I was free to attack. Knowing him, he could certainly do so. I still explained. “Last night I told her about the Stairs’ Daimyo’s plans for us. She was sad and I was there accompanying her. As for this… she knows and is fine with it too. She likes and respects you all enough and actually wants to be family with you too. Her words, not mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>This wasn’t even a joke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha…”</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s quite a girl, isn’t she?” I asked, smirking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, you are not allowed to bully her.” She pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, then whom should I bully? How about I bully you instead of her? Would you sacrifice yourself for your friend?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face turned crimson at the words and she looked down. I held her chin and lifted her face to look at me and leaned forward.</p><p><br></p><p>She closed her eyes and leaned in too and I captured her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>Her lips were delicious.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae’s clothes hid it but her figure didn’t fall behind Sera’s in the least. She was fit though. Her body was soft and yet there was strength in these arms of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra had really done wonders for her.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t that old either, just eighteen years, the same age as Kasumi so she was still growing. She will only grow prettier in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure that the rumours about her being my lover were the only things stopping people from showering her with gifts and love letters.</p><p><br></p><p>But she was mine and I am very possessive like this.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her into a deeper kiss, my tongue probing her lips before she opened them slightly, giving me the chance to enter her mouth and dance around with her tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>We separated after a minute as she breathed heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was that?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s… amazing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Because we will be doing this everyday from now on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her blush just made me pull her and repeat it once more.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Grandpa who opened his eyes and looked around.</p><p><br></p><p>“How are you feeling?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Although Rose had already checked him and there was nothing wrong, I still wanted to make sure myself.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at hands which now lacked their previous wrinkles. If he could look into a mirror, he would have seen that it wasn’t just his hands but rather his entire body. He looked almost a decade younger.</p><p><br></p><p>“I feel… amazing. No pain in my joints, no problems in breathing, in fact, I feel full of energy right now. I don’t remember when I had felt this good before. Just what did you do to me, Kazu-kun?” He asked incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike Saitō, Grandpa had no problem being unconscious, not that I gave him any choices. He was able to go through the entire process in his sleep and thus didn’t know any details.</p><p><br></p><p>“I used my newly developed method on you. Don’t worry, it’s completely safe.” I reassured him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not worried about my safety, Kazu-kun but yours. If news of this gets out, many people will be after you to get your secrets.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have prepared for everything, Grandpa. As I told you before, just give me five years and not even the Five Great Nations will be able to do anything to us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Very good.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things and I left him to rest.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks later, Toji returned with the last three blades, one of them being a surprise I wasn’t expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>The First one could disturb the senses of anyone it cut, basically casting a Genjutsu on them.</p><p><br></p><p>The second could store chakra and release a wave of sharp chakra. If the user could inject elemental chakra then those waves could have elemental properties too.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, the last one… the Kusanagi… no, a blade so odd that it wasn’t even considered a Kusanagi sword anymore but something else entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>The blade used by Itachi’s Susanno, the infamous and the strongest among the Kusanagi swords, Totsuka no Tsurugi.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like a jar of sake. The liquid inside was shaped like a sword when it was unsheathed. This blade could seal anyone it cut inside the jar, even kage level beings like Orochimaru, as long as the user had enough chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>With this and the fifth gate, I could totally fight a Kage level and even have a decent chance to win.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t help but smile the entire day when I saw this.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously I kept this sword despite Toji pouting but I know that the guy actually liked his one better.</p><p><br></p><p>We kept the last two for any new members we might get.</p><p><br></p><p>My sword was stored inside the Grimoire, the safest place available to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, almost a week later, we were all ready to leave for the Medicine Country.</p><p><br></p><p>My first big step in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is everyone ready?” I asked as I looked at the group gathered around me.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina, Saitō, Kanae, Sera, Toji, Rose and the three Uzumaki.</p><p><br></p><p>With us together, we had the confidence to even take down a kage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The first three days of our journey were relatively safe.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in a horse drawn carriage with Kazumi while others followed us from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa had left the whole meeting on my head and I was to take Kasumi-chan with me as she was invited the last time Medicine Daimyo’s son had come to visit.</p><p><br></p><p>It was on the fourth day that we saw a horrible scene ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>People were relatively safer in the inner areas but these areas… they were worse than I had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately we didn’t have enough soldiers to send everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>People who couldn’t get food resorted to banditry and thus the increase in the number of bandits around this time.</p><p><br></p><p>We saw smoke coming from a distance, far more than was normal.</p><p><br></p><p>Toji was the first one to notice the abnormality and informed everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>I ordered half of them to go ahead and take a look. It’s just that… we were already too late. The village was in its final embers.</p><p><br></p><p>The sight was horrifying.</p><p><br></p><p>Burned bodies lay everywhere and the smell of charred corpses filled the air.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked inside the village, trying to sense any life inside but failed.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I sensed some movement beside me and jumped away and watched as a wall of a house collapsed beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>In the inside was a crib, burned and collapsed as the burned figure inside it rolled down and fell in front of me. It was a head… just the head of an infant.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt the bile trying to rush out of my stomach and sat down on the ground, the hollow charred head staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Why?</p><p><br></p><p>These people never did anyone anything?</p><p><br></p><p>All they did was work honestly to earn their living.</p><p><br></p><p>Then why…</p><p><br></p><p>Does their pain and suffering mean nothing?</p><p><br></p><p>Do their lives not matter?</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed some people approaching me. I didn’t move. I recognised the chakra already.</p><p><br></p><p>They witnessed the same thing I did and stopped before I felt a hand on my shoulder. “Kazuya-sama.” Kasumi’s voice was also quivering.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything and just kept staring at that baby’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>Until now, I had just heard of these, only seen the sight of poverty among my people and that was enough to fill me with rage and determination to do something for them.</p><p><br></p><p>But this…</p><p><br></p><p>It felt as if something had broken inside of me.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the group had also returned, finishing their search around the village.</p><p><br></p><p>“We found the tracks, boss. From the traces, it looks like it’s Iwagakure. They haven’t been gone for long. We could still catch them.” Toji said.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up at him and then turned towards the girls. “Kanae, Rose, Rina-san, could you three stay here with Kasumi and the rest and make sure the people here got a proper burial?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” They nodded without any question.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning towards the rest, I commanded. “Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuina -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They rushed through the woods, following the tracks of the enemies, Toji being the one guiding the way.</p><p><br></p><p>She took a quick look at Kazuya and saw the same unfamiliar look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina had seen him angry before this, when he found out about the plan of the Stairs Daimyo, when he talked about Iwa, he was angry. He never hid it in front of them but he always kept it in tight control.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however, she couldn’t see anything.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like seeing a blank person… and that worried her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I sense some people three kilometres in the north-west direction. A dozen ninjas. Two Jōnin and the rest Chunin.” Genshiro-sama said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s probably them. The tracks go in that direction too.” Toji confirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>A while later Genshiro-sama informed everyone. “They have sensed us, they are running. Hurry up.”</p><p><br></p><p>All of them increased their speeds following them.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are divided into two groups.” Genshiro-sama informed them again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, you, Mina and Saitō take the left one. The rest of us will handle the right.” Kazuya spoke and their groups separated in two directions too. She followed Kazuya.</p><p><br></p><p>They neared the targets.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get ready. They have stopped and are preparing to fight. Open the Third Gate, take them down at once.” Kazuya ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>The three of them Toji, Kazuya and her were the ones with the highest progress with the Inner Gates among their group.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of them could go to the fifth gate now. Opening the third gate was quite easy for them by now.</p><p><br></p><p>Instantly, their chakra rose and Kuina found the world slowing down around her as they rushed forward.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them unsheathed their blades and the next moment the figures of six ninjas appeared, weapons drawn.</p><p><br></p><p>They had the headbands of Iwagakure and wore their red uniforms.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kill!” Kazuya’s shout was almost a growl as he slashed forward with one of the Kusanagi blades, sending a huge chakra wave forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately for the enemies, none of them were expecting this kind of attack and the amount of chakra shocked them and made them slightly late to escape, taking down half of them in one attack, all of them sliced right at their waists.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina didn’t slow down either and slashed with her own sword, her chakra increasing the weight of the blade by dozens of times.</p><p><br></p><p>Her opponent tried to defend using a kunai but was taken aback by the unexpected weight of the attack, not being able to defend as the attack cut him in half right down the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>The blood spurted, covering Kuina’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>In her rush of adrenaline, she stepped on the ground again and looked around for the next enemy but by then Toji had already taken care of the last two.</p><p><br></p><p>They released the gates and their chakra calmed down. The exhaustion which came afterwards was negligible.</p><p><br></p><p>By now all of them had gotten used to fighting in the third gate stage so this much was nothing to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Kazuya didn’t speak. He just went and summoned his Magic Book, Grimoire or whatever it was called and stored the bodies inside his Grimoire before opening the book and reading.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, Toji picked up the headbands of one of the shinobi. “These rock suckers really have some nerve. Their kage is on bed rest, their bases are being destroyed and here they are making more enemies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They were not rock shinobi.” Kazuya spoke, still reading his magic book.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are Konoha shinobi. They came here to destroy the outer villages to provoke a conflict between the rock shinobi and us so that we interrupt their supply of food, maybe even drag Kumo into the mess against Iwa. It would be a fatal blow since their Tsuchikage is already out of commission and make the rock give up faster, giving them more advantage in any after war negotiations.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, sabotage. The ways of the so-called most peace loving village are really something. So what do you want to do boss?” Toji asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take the bodies.” Kazuya answered extremely angry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>They repacked the bodies in scrolls and went back to the village where everyone was working on creating graves.</p><p><br></p><p>Rina-san had used Earth Jutsu to make graves for everyone and the rest were helping clean everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Kazuya and Toji created several clones and helped out too.</p><p><br></p><p>While they were doing this, the other team arrived too.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are taken care of, Your Highness. It was a team from Iwa. We found scrolls on them containing money and grains robbed from the village. They had come to rob for supplies.” Saitō reported.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, apparently… they were not Iwa but Konoha pretending to be Iwa. Boss verified it himself.” Toji shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitō as well as the Uzumaki were taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get the bodies?” Kazuya asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Genshiro-san put forward a ninja scroll and unsealed the bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>Kazuya looked at them and commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Put them up on stakes around the village for everyone to see.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was shocked by the statement and looked at Kazuya in shock. “Your Highness, will that be wise?” Saitō asked. “Wouldn’t that be directly challenging Konoha and Iwa?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Change their clothes before hanging them. Konoha and Iwa wouldn’t be able to do anything. Iwa will know they are not their ninjas so they won’t take any steps. Moreover, for anyone to take a step, they will have to accept that they were behind the pillage and massacre of the village. Ninjas doing that to countries especially without any provocation will ruin their reputation and turn their customers away. They will not be stupid enough to take the blame.”</p><p><br></p><p>His tone was completely cold, without any hint of his usual frivolous manner. “If we don’t set an example like this, attacks will continue. But if they know that their forces can actually die in these missions, they would think twice about doing such stupid things to not lose their precious forces during the war. So… get to work.”</p><p><br></p><p>They did just as instructed and within an hour, the bodies of the twelve ninjas were hung in front of the village gate with a warning for any who think of doing such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina didn’t know why but she had a feeling that this day had changed something which will completely shape the future of this world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We reached the Land of Medicine a bit later than expected due to the incident at the village. We sent some people back to the Capital to send a message to Grandpa to check on the nearby villages and provide support for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, everything took us two days more than expected.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have liked nothing more than to wait and investigate the area around us but this meeting couldn’t be pushed back anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome Prince Katsuyoshi, Princess Fujimoto to the Land of Medicine. I hope your journey was pleasant.” I was greeted by the retainer of the Medicine Daimyo and we were led in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. There were some troubles along the way. We will talk to Lord Yoshiki later.” I answered, making the guy shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he didn’t ask anything. Probably having gotten the message that it was beyond his station.</p><p><br></p><p>Kasumi was guided the other way to visit her aunt while I had to go and meet the Medicine Daimyo. I left Kanae and Sera to guard her.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the Medicine Daimyo for the first time. It was an obese guy with ostentatious clothes and a similar look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need any kind of special senses to tell that he didn’t like me. That much was obvious at a close glance.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Land of Flowers is perhaps not taking this alliance seriously it seems. I can agree with your Grandfather not coming personally due to health issues but even you have arrived late. If this kind of attitude you have now then what will you do when it’s time to assist us?” The man asked, not holding back the bite in his words.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, still salty about the Kodon issue.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, no problem. I was planning to address it too. I just didn’t expect this bastard to attack first.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our presence here is the biggest show of our seriousness Lord Yoshiki because after what we have encountered on our way, we were extremely tempted to turn around and head back to our capital and suspend this alliance entirely.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! What are you talking about?” He asked, furious at my words.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t back down either.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are talking about your half hearted handling of the Kodon Clan, Lord Yoshiki. On our way here, five villages of the Land of Flowers were burned down. We encountered a group in the process of fleeing and our hired guards were able to bring them down and guess who we found there. The Kodon Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible.” He refuted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, are you saying that we are lying? In that case, we also have proof of the whole thing. Saitō.” I commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.” He bowed and brought forth a scroll and unsealed it in front of everyone. Inside were clothes and equipment of the Kodon ninja we had killed back then, including the Jōnin. I had kept it all to use to give a second push if the Medicine Daimyo didn’t take any action against them but he did, thus saving me these resources and what better time to use them than now. I needed proof to make the Daimyo move.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the guy was completely taken aback while I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“These are the equipment and items we have obtained from that group. The reason we are late is because we were busy doing damage control and reporting to the Land of Lightning, asking them for help. As you know, we are allies.”</p><p><br></p><p>That poured cold water on the heads of the listeners.</p><p><br></p><p>“We would like to request Lord Yoshiki to help us in the investigation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“O-of course. We are not someone who promotes manslaughter of any kind. For this reason alone, we let those traitorous shinobi leave here as we didn’t wish to punish everyone for the crimes of one person but it seems our forgiveness was taken for weakness by them.” The guy so eloquently changed his tone instantly. “You have our full support in investigating.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I thank you, Lord Yoshiki and would like to ask you to permit us to go to the previous residence of the Kodon Clan right after this meeting to see if we can discover any clues there. We would also like to talk to some other residents of the Howling Wolf Village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. You may.” He agreed quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you very much. Pardon me for making everyone hurry. You must understand how enraged we are by such a travesty of justice in our land.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Of course, of course.”</p><p><br></p><p>We continued on to the meeting next.</p><p><br></p><p>The topic was the rates of goods we were selling and the quantities.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have heard that the Land of Flowers has devised a new method of farming and is producing more crops than before. Then why is there no reduction in the prices?” The Medicine Daimyo asked, annoyed by the price I was putting up.</p><p><br></p><p>It was what Grandpa had previously discussed, a rate lower than what other nations bought our products for but this guy was expecting us to reduce our prices even more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure our income has increased a bit but so has our expenditures. We had to pay a larger tribute to the Land of Lightning due to the ongoing war.” A complete lie. “And Iwa hasn’t been paying normal rates either. While we would like to reduce the rates of products even more for our allies, we are forced to keep it as it is. The new method might yield more products but it also takes a lot more labour and investment. We cannot force our people to starve even after putting so much work in their fields.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, if you spoil those peasants so much, they will rebel against you someday. Give them an inch and they will take a mile.” The guy replied with a snort.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will leave such decisions to our Lord Grandfather.” I simply diverted the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Land of Medicine needs more supplies this year. The war in the Land of Rain has been spilling over into our land as well and the damages are far worse than before. We demand an increase in the amount of supplies on the initial amount. After all, if the Land of Flowers cannot help us with what they are known for, then it would seem that we are on the losing end in this alliance.”</p><p><br>“Obviously the Land of Flowers will help.” I replied readily, making him surprised but then saw a hint of smile on his face. “In fact, we understand the monetary issues of the Land of Medicine during this war so we won’t demand money either.” His smile widened and I decided to stop it here. “But instead Lord Yoshiki can repay us for the extra supplies with Medicinal Herbs from the Land of Medicine.” I proposed and as expected the smile on his face dimmed.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole evening was filled with bargaining. We were arguing with even a single ryo of price because it would ultimately add up to an insane amount in the final calculations.</p><p><br></p><p>We did have to leave some concessions though but overall, we were in the profit.</p><p><br></p><p>The medicinal herbs I was importing were important for the medicines used to create chakra beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>It would go on to become the foundation of the Land of Flowers in the future so overall, I see the meeting as a win.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked out of the meeting hall, feeling satisfied with the meeting and headed towards our room, planning to visit Kasumi on the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside the room however I saw something which annoyed me to no end.</p><p><br></p><p>That bastard son of the Medicine Daimyo was bothering Sera.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have heard that you are just a guard under Prince Kazuya but we are offering you to become our concubine and become a part of the royal family. You will never get this opportunity again. Think about it carefully.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I see what Sera and Kanae were saying about him last time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not interested.” Sera replied, still holding back her anger, something I have to give her credit about.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally she would have told him to piss off to his face, despite it causing an international incident.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already angry and tired and honestly had no interest in this clown pestering us anymore so I forward and spoke. “We are afraid that we cannot allow that to happen, Prince Yoshiki.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them turned towards me and before that idiot could speak anything, I took Sera’s hand and pulled her to my side. “She belongs to us. You cannot have her.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was taken aback by my statement and I saw a hint of rage pass by his eyes but he controlled it quickly and smiled back.</p><p><br></p><p>“We apologise. We had asked about her and were informed that she was just a commoner working as your bodyguard. We weren’t told that she was your lover.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t like to advertise our relations to the public. Now, if you will excuse us, we are in a hurry right now. We apologise for not being able to accompany you for a cup of tea. We hope we will be able to catch up with each other at a later time.”</p><p><br></p><p>His smile fell for a moment again but he nodded. “In that case, please don’t let us keep you back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Prince Yoshiki.” I nodded and walked into the room with Sera and shut the door behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, I turned towards Sera who had been exceptionally quiet in this whole ordeal, much to my surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry if I did something unnecessary but you looked like you were getting annoyed there.” I apologised. She just stared at me for a while and then replied.</p><p><br>“I was thinking on where to attack him first, his eyes or his privates.” She replied, making my eyes twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, totally guessed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I blamed her but there was only so much we could push them, especially when we were in their territory.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for holding back, Sera. I know it must have been quite difficult seeing how much of an ass that man was. Good news is that we don’t have to stay here for much longer. We are leaving in an hour for the Howling Wolf Village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya-sama, we are leaving already?” Kasumi asked, surprised at the news. “Did something happen?” Behind her, Kanae also looked worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, not really. I just have some work nearby. I will be back in a day or two.” I had started speaking to her in an informal tone similar to others since I had opened up more to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and gave her a slight hug. “Wait for me, alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” She nodded and I kissed her forehead lightly before backing away and looked at Kanae. “We need to prepare to leave. I will be leaving Kuina here to guard Kasumi.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina wasn’t that good with Fuinjutsu and we needed someone to accompany Kasumi.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t thrilled but she agreed nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>In an hour, our entire team gathered and left for the Howling Wolf Village.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the Howling Wolf Village, Your Highness, Prince Katsuyoshi.” The person sent by the Medicine Daimyo brought us to the village.</p><p><br></p><p>It was two days away from the capital city of the Land of Medicine. It would have been a shorter distance had we travelled by ourselves but I had to take a horse drawn carriage so it was delayed.</p><p><br></p><p>The man went on to introduce us to the current head of the village, although calling it a Hidden Village would be a bit of a stretch as there were only a couple hundred people here, including the non combatants.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t even have a Kage. In fact, many small villages didn’t have Kage so it wasn’t a surprise really.</p><p><br></p><p>I had researched this much about them already.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is Koga Kumanoi, the current head of the Kumanoi Clan, the largest clan of this village. He will be able to assist you in anything you need.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man who bowed lightly. My chakra senses could tell that he was a Jōnin, at least in terms of Chakra reserves, stronger than the woman from the Kodon Clan. In fact, I had sensed around six other Jonins in the village and several dozen other lower ranked ninjas.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have heard that the Kodon Clan was exiled from this village. Unfortunately, they haven’t learned their lessons and We have found traces of them in attacks on the villages in the Land of Flowers. We wish to know their current whereabouts. Do you perhaps know where they have relocated to?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise but none of us know their current whereabouts, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Then would you please guide us to the residence of the Kodon Clan? Anything belonging to them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Most of their properties have been taken over by other clans and their belongings either taken away by them or sold. Perhaps the only thing untouched is the shrine outside the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the shrine where Rōen was sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then take us to the Shrine. We will investigate there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to do that right now, Your Highness? It’s already late.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are already inconveniencing the Medicine Daimyo and the Howling Wolf Village with our request. We cannot impose further on you all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not a problem, Your Highness.” The man denied but I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Moreover, this matter is one which directly relates to the safety of our people. We cannot delay this matter any longer because of our pleasure. We have remembered your hospitality so you do not need to worry yourselves with us anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>They agreed and I took my entourage to the shrine.</p><p><br></p><p>The outer building was basic, just a large hall with the inner building containing a large slab of stone, the place Rōen was sealed in.</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to stay at the shrine.</p><p><br></p><p>The people brought food for us. Fortunately, none of them contained poison either.</p><p><br></p><p>It was nighttime when we were finally alone that I addressed the Uzumaki Trio.</p><p><br></p><p>“We expect you have questions for us?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro-sensei hesitated but shook his head. “Shinobi don’t question. They just follow orders, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… We thought we were closer than that, sensei?”I sighed. “Please understand that this mission is of great importance to us and the Land of Flowers. Just set barriers which can completely isolate detection from outside and make them strong please.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How strong are we talking about, Your Highness?” Rina asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl with dead seriousness. “Tailed beast level strong.”</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, their faces were drained of all colours instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to worry about anything.

    "content": "<p><strong>The Dragon Farmer</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 19: Infinity</strong></p><p><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I rushed towards the rampaging Shizuka who was currently being contained by Ingvild and met her head on. Lavy’s fight had concluded too and she was on the side, holding a barely alive Augusta. Shizuka’s power had been suppressed and mine was being boosted by Ingvild so it wasn’t hard to stop her.</p><p><br></p><p>Having already done this several times before, I pushed her down on the ground and got on top of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Calm down, Shizuka.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>What I received in the reply was a roar filled with pain and anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Stopping Dragons during an outrage was a nigh impossible task. Thankfully, we were fully equipped for that.</p><p><br></p><p>I used my Dragon Tamer skills and tried again but unlike the previous times, she just shook it off.</p><p><br></p><p>This time around, it wasn’t fear and betrayal but immense anger that was driving her.</p><p><br></p><p>It won’t work like this.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to subdue her completely to calm her down.</p><p><br></p><p>I held her down but she opened her mouth, ready to drown me in a torrent of flames. Right on time I held her mouth and pushed her face into the ground and used the Dream Magic on her directly.</p><p><br></p><p>Dream Magic’s main power was to enter the dreams of other people and during an outrage, a Dragon’s rational mind also enters a similar state.</p><p><br></p><p>Her dream world was like a scene straight out of hell. Fire burned on the ground and the skies were covered in smoke and ash. Meteors were crashing from the skies. It literally looked like the end of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the middle of all this, I found her sitting in one place, her eyes dead as she looked straight ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shizuka. Wake up. Snap out of it.” I reached her and shook her shoulders but got no response from her.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what in the seven heavens have those bastards done?</p><p><br></p><p>Not getting any response, I decided to follow Tia’s example and slapped her hard. She however just looked in my direction, eyes still dead as ever. It took her a moment to recognise me and then tears filled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened? What did they do, Shizuka?” I held her shoulder and asked. Her state was scaring me.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka was not the kind of girl to show these kinds of emotions to others.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dead… they are all dead…” Was all she was whispering.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who? Who is dead?” Is she talking about the Himejima people from the Utsusemi Agency? But I made it a point to not make her fight them and those people were trying to kill us.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried asking more but she was stuck on that so I decided to do something more.</p><p><br></p><p>Using Dream Magic, I dove into her thoughts. It was far harder than normal but her mind was hardly protected right now, making it easy to access.</p><p><br></p><p>The battle appeared a while ago and a few moments later I understood why she was like this… that bastard… those kids were all…</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder she had been reduced to this state… I quickly pulled her into a tight hug.</p><p><br></p><p>To some extent, all this was also my fault… could all this have been avoided if I hadn’t told Armin about Tobio and the other four?</p><p><br></p><p>I had already seen that things were already different in this world so who knows if things would have been as simple as the novels or things were going to shit either way… I didn’t know and I would never know for sure either.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… cannot do anything to bring them back, Shizuka but I promise you that I will help you get justice for every family member you lost today. So please… let it all out. I will accompany you here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The words seemed to have worked and she broke down in my arms and I couldn’t do anything other than hold her in my arms and let her cry it out. When she was done, she fell asleep in my arms and the surroundings calmed down too.</p><p><br></p><p>I left her mindscape and outside, her body was asleep too.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up but to my surprise, Ingvild and Lavy stood behind us protectively.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s going on here…?” I asked or rather started asking but swallowed my words as I saw a figure in the sky in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a cute young girl with long black hair down to her hips and black eyes. Her ears had pointed tips, although her long black hair makes this feature difficult to notice. Her dark grey eyes had reptilian slitted pupils.</p><p><br></p><p>A dragon…</p><p><br></p><p>In her hand, she was carrying Satanael, looking down on us… no, she was looking straight at Shizuka and me.</p><p><br></p><p>One Scan later, I got her identity and felt a shiver run down my spine. What the hell was she doing here?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ophis [Rank S]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Then again, she was with the Chaos Brigade and Satanael, them using her snakes and all…</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy, Ingvild, step back. She is not someone you can fight.” I ordered as I got in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>We stared at each other, not knowing what to do before she broke the silence…</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do you smell like him?” She asked, her voice low and yet enough for everyone to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do you two smell like him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...” I didn’t know how to answer that. What was I even supposed to say? But she continued again.</p><p><br></p><p>“That girl… feels like his spawn…”</p><p><br></p><p>“She kinda is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… guess you can call me his friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t recognise you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Neither do I. I believe this is the first time we have met.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just stared at me without saying anything and then nodded before raising her hand. Some of the survivors rose up from the frozen wreckage of the battlefield.</p><p><br></p><p>I however recognised the members of the Utsusemi Agency among them and almost reflexively punched in their direction , breaking her control and smacking their bodies to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>She stopped and looked at me “Are you going to stop me from reclaiming my silence too?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no interest in your silence or you spat with him. But they… they have attacked my loved ones. They have taken the lives of those important to Shizuka here… and I am not going to forgive that. I can let you take back Satanael because he only attacked me… I can forgive him… but them… no way.”</p><p><br></p><p>She narrowed her eyes as her power rose but I was in no mood to back down either. Worst case, I will call Great Red and cash in on that favour but I will not let her take them away.</p><p><br></p><p>My aura rose in reply as I directly shifted to my Dragon From. At the same time, I summoned my Familiar.</p><p><br></p><p>With the barrier broken, Leafa could be summoned easily.</p><p><br></p><p>A ginormous magic circle lit up the whole place as a loud roar shook the entire area.</p><p><br></p><p>Leafa appeared below my feet, lifting us up. Her mountain sized body bringing us to Ophis’ eye level.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time two familiar auras reached us, landing directly in between us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tia, Crom.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” Tia asked, looking over her shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>She then turned towards Ophis, her face serious once more. “What are you doing here, Ophis?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tiamat? You… have changed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I suppose I have.” She replied and then turned towards me. “What is going on here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her people attacked us with the Church people… and you can see what happened. Now she is here to take them back after that. I can allow her to take Satanael but others… especially those Utsusemi Agency people… <em>they stay</em>. They crossed my bottom line… and they will pay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You cannot stop me.” Ophis replied in an even tone, unbothered by the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“That remains to be seen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are weak. You cannot defeat me.” She said, not a hint of taunting in her tone. She was speaking facts for that matter.</p><p><br></p><p>I gritted my teeth. The whole situation was already testing my patience and then the memories of Shizuka… I didn’t have the patience to deal with anyone right now… Dragon God or not. That said, there was someone else who was just as angry.</p><p><br></p><p>My Gourmet Demon roared in anger at the slight it had perceived from another Dragon… and I let it.</p><p><br></p><p>I had begun experimenting with my Gourmet Demon since the time Tia had told me about it. Its strength increased with the level of my Gourmet Cells which was far stronger than it was before.</p><p><br></p><p>My aura rose once more as my Gourmet Cells burst with energy powering me. The aura around me taking shape as the Dragon King Derous appeared once more.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however, the projection was far more stable. I was sure that as long as I got the A Ranked Gourmet Cells, I could start manifesting body parts of Derous too.</p><p><br></p><p>But even with just a solid projection, the fear of the apex predator was not something which could be hidden.</p><p><br></p><p>The reactions were obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild and Lavy both became stiff with fear, their balance breakers fading away as they fell to their knees. Crom was the same but he was clawing his own hands to keep himself standing. I could even see Tia’s hands shaking a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophis’ eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe … but I won’t take it lying down either. I haven’t gone out of my way to interfere with you or your plans while your people attacked me out of nowhere. I am willing to let this go if you leave these people behind. Don’t… and you will be making an enemy out of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>We stared at each other before she reigned her aura.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is your name?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be watching you.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, she tore a hole in the space and left with Satanael’s body.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Euclid -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They raced towards the direction of the place where the signal of Mathias and his peerage was last detected.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka sent the signal and Sirzechs will arrive there directly.</p><p><br></p><p>No one knew what exactly had happened and the tracker had disappeared too. Right now all they could do was go there at their fastest speed. Tiamat and Crom had already flown ahead of everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as they were reaching closer, they felt several enormous auras from the direction. Two of them belonged to Tiamat and Crom. It was however the third and fourth auras that surprised them. The third one was something on par with Crom, a Heavenly Dragon level entity… and for the life of him, he couldn’t identify who it was.</p><p><br></p><p>They paused in their way and looked at each other. The Archangels wonder about who the last one was while Serafall and him were thinking a completely different thing.</p><p><br></p><p>One of those auras seemed to be similar to Mathias’... but the power… that didn’t make any sense… just what in the seven heaven’s was happening there?</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part however was the last aura… which seemed to even dwarf these three. ”</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid knew from the previous location of the tracker that the place was hundreds of kilometres away and yet… they could feel the power from this far.</p><p><br></p><p>Right at that moment several magic circles appeared around them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs stepped out of the magic circle followed by his peerage, looking serious. “Serafall, Euclid… what is going on here…?” His words got stuck in his mouth as he sensed the power from that place…</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are they…? Just what is going on there?”</p><p><br></p><p>That kind of power… Euclid had never felt it in his life.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael seemed to have a realisation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what that is, Michael?” Serafall asked, noticing his stunned look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… but… that can’t be right. It… it never interferes in the world. Why is it there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?” Sirzechs asked. To be honest, Euclid had never seen the leader of the Archangels this… intimidated ever before.</p><p><br></p><p>They however soon understood the reason for his behaviour.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ophis.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>They were all stunned in place by the revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded at each other and were about to head straight towards that place but it was as if the surprises hadn’t ended.</p><p><br></p><p>Another aura appeared this time, the same as the largest aura. This one however felt wild… untamed power, something majestic and yet frightening, sending shivers down their spines.</p><p><br></p><p>These feelings were not illusions or pressure of magic but rather primal… As if their bodies refused to go forward, afraid to earn the ire of that majestic entity.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs was the only one able to move but even he was having difficulty as the beads of sweat on his forehead told.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophis’ aura dispersed at that moment and the other one followed suit but even after that, they had to take a moment to regain their breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“What in father’s name was that?”</p><p><br></p><p>A stern expression appeared on Sirzechs’ face, one which reminded Euclid of the Sirzechs from the Civil Wars… “Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>They raced towards the area and reached there a while later to the scene of utter devastation. Everything in the surroundings were either molten or frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Just with a casual look, Euclid was able to identify the frozen statues of several people. The surprising one however was the broken and battered figures in front of the group standing there. Were those Fallen Angels?</p><p><br></p><p>Matty was sitting on the ground while Shizuka lay unconscious in front of them, being tended by Ingvild and Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat and Crom had already left.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias!” They quickly went ahead and checked on the group. “What happened here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were betrayed by the Church. They were working with the Fallen Angels Satanael and Kokabiel. They also had the Utsusemi Agency and Wizards of Oz with them. They had set an ambush here with special barriers to block signals and teleportation. They even had some special barriers specifically designed to hunt Zagan Devils. It was a planned operation, something not done in a day. They also had the user of Incinerate Anthem and three of the five Divine Beasts belonging to the Shinto sealed in some kind of Sacred Gear… lastly, they all seemed to be powered by Ophis’ snakes, making them a lot stronger than normal. Their deal was to give… my body to Satanael for experimentation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure it was the Church and not the rebel exorcists?” Micahel asked, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was Edward Christaldi a stray exorcist?” Matty asked, staring back at Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>“...No. But…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet, he stabbed Ingvild with an Excalibur Fragment. If she didn’t have something to heal her right then and there, it could have been dangerous for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is he… is he?” Michael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias pointed to the ground a distance away. “I think his ashes fell somewhere over there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid as well as everyone who knew Mathias was taken aback by his statement. Anyone who knew Mathias well, knew one thing about him… Mathias Buné Zagan didn’t like killing. He was someone who had been able to look the killer of his parents in his eyes, be spat at by them and still retain his cool to not kill them. It was something which made Euclid both admire and terrified of the boy remembering what he had done to Naberius right after. Still, for him to speak like this… he must be really angry.</p><p><br></p><p>“And we are supposed to just take your word for it?” Uriel said, earning the glares of every Devil present there. “Do you have anything to prove your words?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Brother…” Gabriel was about to speak but was stopped by Uriel.</p><p><br></p><p>“No sister. Think of it carefully. If things were really as he says they were, then how did he survive? Do you think only these four can survive such an ambush, let alone uninjured? Such an ambush could have killed anyone of us, even multiple of us at the same time and they just got a few scratches? Are you telling me that we are to simply take their word for everything without even checking everything first?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are speaking out of line, Uriel.” Sirzechs said, his voice showing his annoyance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Archangel Uriel.” Mathias stopped the man before anyone could say anything more.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you like to see how I was able to survive and remain uninjured? I can show you if you want to… it’s just that… you will die.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You!”</p><p><br></p><p>“But sure, let’s entertain your doubts.” he pointed to some rocks in the distance. “Kokabiel’s body must be somewhere there. I left him alive for such an occasion. Euclid, can you please bring him over? Don’t worry, he won’t resist?”</p><p><br></p><p>He shared a look with Sirzechs and went ahead. Sure enough, when close enough, he felt an aura nearby and removed a huge rock but was taken aback at the sight of the body under the rock.</p><p><br></p><p>The rock slipped from his hand and crashed onto Kokabiels… body once more before he hurriedly removed it and pulled the guy out.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid checked his body and sure enough there were traces of Draconic energy in his body. In fact, the total energy in his body was almost reaching Serafall’s level.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what exactly happened here?</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there anyone else Mathias?” Sirzechs asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Most were killed. Few from the Utsusemi Organisation are alive. Please don’t kill them. Those people… they don’t deserve an easy death.” Mathias requested, really angry this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs nodded. “What of Satanael?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… he was taken by Ophis.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ophis? How is Ophis involved in all of this?” Michael asked quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ophis is working with them to reclaim her silence. Apparently Satanael promised her to drive Great Red away from the Dimensional Gap. Safe to say, she is being duped by them. But she did save his life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened here? What exactly did it do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ophis… hah… can we talk about it later? I am a bit tired and my peerage members need rest too.” He said, although Euclid knew that he was trying not to say anything here. Even the girls looked a bit terrified.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs noticed it too and nodded. “My apologies. Mcgreggor, Souji, take them back to the Underworld. We will handle everything here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Euclid, you go with them too.” Serafall asked him and he agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The first thing we did after reaching back home was let Shizuka rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild and Lavy went to get some rest too.</p><p><br></p><p>“We fucked up, didn’t we?” I asked when I was finally alone with Euclid.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. This was not your fault. You did your best. You went beyond what was expected of you and tried to do the right thing. Their failure is not and will never be your fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed as I fell back into my couch, closing my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Things had become too complicated too quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I really hoped things got better due to this meeting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We all did, Matty. We all did. By the way, what exactly happened there after Ophis appeared. Who were the people who made it retreat?” He asked but I was not paying attention.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered something and got up. “Ah, I need to talk to Rias and Latia. I didn’t tell them about this whole thing and they would be pretty mad if they found it out from somewhere else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeah… you’d better do that fast.” Euclid’s lips twitched at my sudden reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“And… I will tell you all what happened together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly called Latia. She was doing some work of her own but said she will be there. She will be bringing Genbu Domon.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was attending some classes.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked her to come here with Akeno too.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I called Armin and asked him to bring Tobio.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka would need her remaining family and friends.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, I waited for their arrival while thinking of what I could have done better today.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end I found out that there really wasn’t much better I could have done.</p><p><br></p><p>No matter what I did, people had to die. It was a matter of either them dying or us and I might not like killing but I wasn’t a fool who would let my own people die for that. They had attacked us first and they paid the price for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the one injury on our team was Ingvild and she recovered almost immediately. If not for the situation with Shizuka, today’s ambush would have been harmless.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, things did go bad.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophis…</p><p><br></p><p>Why did Ophis come there?</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t someone to poke her nose in such matters…</p><p><br></p><p>And she recognised Shizuka’s and even my connection to Great Red.</p><p><br></p><p>What if that got found out by others?</p><p><br></p><p>I sat there thinking and finally decided to come out clean about some things with everyone. Leafa’s strength was unknown to almost everyone except Tia and Crom. Even Armin didn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>They appeared around an hour later.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was the first, followed by Latia and finally Armin.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, are you alright?” Was the first thing Armin asked as he entered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… yeah, I guess…?”</p><p><br></p><p>He then realised what he had asked and became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what was so urgent that you called us immediately?” Latia asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“First sit. This is going to take a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me weirdly but took the seat nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“Around two weeks ago, I was approached by Rudiger Rosenkreutz via Serafall. He had a request for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I started explaining the whole thing from the start.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you know that his son is very sick and there is a low chance of him living through the next few years?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard some rumours about him trying to find some type of cure for his son, although I am not aware of his exact illness.” Latia said. </p><p><br></p><p>“Is he?” Rias looked worried. “I haven’t heard of it. What happened to him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, he is a half devil and was born with a Sacred Gear… a holy type Sacred Gear to be precise.”</p><p><br></p><p>They winced at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a painful thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Remove it and he dies, don’t remove it and he dies… painfully…</p><p><br></p><p>“The kid’s birthday was coming and he wanted something special. Safe to say, Rudiger was trying his best to get it done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did he want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He wanted to meet someone he admired when he lived in the human world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Dulio Gesualdo, the strongest Exorcist of Heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Strange but hey, that was his wish. Rudiger, although doubtful, went ahead and asked Serafall who conveyed the message to Heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They didn’t agree, did they?” Latia asked. “It would be impossible…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, they did.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“However they had one condition of their own.” Euclid helped me out.</p><p><br></p><p>“What condition?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That Mathias has to meet the leaders of Heaven too. They heard about his special food products and life magic and wanted to meet him in person.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No way. It absolutely reeks of a trap.” Latia scoffed and I pinched myself to not wince.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not going there, are you?” Rias asked, worried.</p><p><br></p><p>Man… this is exactly why I was avoiding telling them.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin on the other hand was quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully Euclid lent me a hand here. “It’s not that simple.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Many factions are on the edge because of Mathias’ unique ability. They are worried that we will surpass everyone if given time. Especially the other two factions. If we didn’t calm them down, they could do something desperate and it could spark another Great War.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And the other houses would never let Matty live the fact down if an Exorcist came to the Underworld to help a half devil child, the son of such a prominent figure but Matty didn’t do anything. Even if Rudiger himself didn’t say anything, they would have dragged the matter out unnecessarily.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t mean to send him there. This is obviously a trap. If they want to meet him so much, why can’t they come here?” Latia asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are many things involved in this matter that you all don’t understand right now.” Euclid tried to explain.</p><p><br></p><p>“What things? All I can see is them trying to get Mathias out of the Underworld by sacrificing an exorcist. They had done the same the last time with an Archangel to kill the first Zagan.” She argued back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Latia… we… the Satans are planning to sign a Peace Treaty between the Three Factions and end this state of cold war.” Euclid said, making her stop in between.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What if they attack, Matty? You are not going to go, are you?” Rias asked, looking worriedly at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually… I already did.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!?”</p><p><br></p><p>…sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dulio visited a week ago and I met him. He is a very nice person.” I explained. “I went there to meet Michael today. We obviously had protections. I took Ingvild, Shizuka and Lavinia with me. I had even asked Tia and a friend to stay on standby and keep a watch from a distance in case something bad happened. We had a tracker on us with Sirzechs’ and Falbium’s peerages minutes away to provide support to us. Moreover, Serafall and Euclid escorted us themselves.” I looked at the man who nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“And?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Latia looked at me with her trademark piercing look. “And what happened there? You wouldn’t have called us like this if things had gone all well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The matter was top secret. Very few people knew it was even going to happen.” Euclid added.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened there, Matty?” She asked, completely ignoring his words and looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“We were ambushed.” I replied and suddenly chaos erupted in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright calm down. I am fine. We are… okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say, none of them calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me over fifteen minutes to reassure them that I was unhurt and then another thirty minutes to explain about the ambush.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those people… they used the kids as bait and attacked Shizuka, killing them and attacking her at the same time. She went into an outrage and is currently sleeping. Akeno, Tobio, could you two stay here for a while. She might need your support when she wakes up later.”</p><p><br></p><p>They both agreed and left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I then looked at Latia who had been eerily quiet for a while. Her face had gone white when I brought up the ambush. But after verifying that I was alright, she had gone quiet completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, let’s take a small break. I will get something for everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, it’s fine…” Euclid and Armin tried to reject but I looked at Rias and Latia.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you two help me carry things out?”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded and followed me out.</p><p><br></p><p>We went to the kitchen and I put a ward around us with a twitch of my finger and looked at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was still worried but Latia was angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing her as well as I did, I could feel her anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I am really sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why didn’t you tell us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t want to worry you two.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s our job, our right to worry about you, you moron!” She shouted, taking me by surprise. She almost never raised her voice like that. But before I could say anything, I noticed the tears in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Latia, I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. no just shut up. Just shut up for a while. I…” She stopped speaking as her voice broke into sobs.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly went ahead and pulled her into a hug. She tried to break through but I kept holding. After a while she stopped struggling.</p><p><br></p><p>A while later, even Rias joined in the hug. After a while she spoke. “Promise me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Promise me that you will never hide such things from us. I know I cannot always stop you from doing stupid things. I don’t want to be that kind of wife either and I know you hate that more than anything else but at least promise me that whenever you do such things, you will at least tell us beforehand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I promise. Also, I am really sorry.” I apologised again.</p><p><br></p><p>“You could have died…” Her voice broke again and I felt the grip of the two girls tighten on me.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled them both against my chest and hugged them closer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually… I could have taken them all on by myself.” I said after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at me, the deadpan on Latia’s face hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, you are strong but they had a Longinus user and several Ultimate Class beings. Such an ambush… even the Satans would have had a hard time dealing with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....hmm, about that… you two have never seen me go all out, have you?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you both seen me going all out in a fight?” I asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have seen you spar against Armin…” Rias said, thinking for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah… that… no, that’s not even close.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Until now, there have been only two people who have pushed me to my brink. Tiamat and my new Rook. The only way Heaven had a chance of killing me… was if they had sent at least three of the four Archangels or beings of the same level together against me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. I think it’s better to clear some things up today.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tia’s advice was helpful and has no doubt kept me safe all this time. In fact, even today’s fight could have been different if the enemy knew about our exact power levels. They could have prepared different countermeasures against us.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the thing about not spooking out the other houses of the Underworld as well as other factions but it was causing too much pain now… It’s better to get it off my chest, at least for those close to me.</p><p><br></p><p>They followed me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Latia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She followed Matty who called Euclid, Armin and the rest of Mathias’ peerage except for Shizuka and directly took everyone to a different dimension which he had made for creating a new biome for his new farm.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are we here, Matty?” Euclid asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You wanted to know what happened there, right? Let me show you a part of it. Can you make a barrier around you all?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Barrier?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Armin, you know what to do.” Armin nodded. </p><p><br></p><p>“What is he up to?” Euclid asked Armin who was looking silently in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep looking. You will know.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias walked a few hundred metres away from them and then waved at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid and Armin both made several barriers around them while the rest of his peerage members looked confused and then they sensed his demonic power flaring.</p><p><br></p><p>It began rising.</p><p><br></p><p>She had seen many strong people in the Underworld, mostly in the Rating Games so she had an idea of what to expect…or so she thought…</p><p><br></p><p>His power kept rising, reaching the levels of Ultimate Class but not stopping or even slowing down in the slightest.</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments later, the dimension started shaking as the air got heavier with demonic power.</p><p><br></p><p>“This… what is happening here?” Gasper looked around, looking terrified.</p><p><br></p><p>“Calm down, Gaspy. It’s Matty. He won’t hurt you.” Armin said looking calmer but she could see the look of surprise in his eyes too.</p><p><br></p><p>The power however kept rising as the dimension’s shaking got more and more and now they could feel his demonic power pressing down on them and the pressure kept getting heavier.</p><p><br></p><p>“Use your demonic power to reinforce yourself.” Armin advised without breaking looking their way.</p><p><br></p><p>The power stopped rising finally and when it did she found herself unable to speak anymore. Her breathing got heavier.</p><p><br></p><p>Gasper, Valerie, Rias and Natsume were having a much harder time.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is… this is insane. Just how much power was he holding back?” Euclid said, looking stunned. “This is… beyond even Serafall…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” All of them turned towards Serafall Leviathan’s Queen who was looking at Mathias with a flabbergasted look.</p><p><br></p><p>Their surprise however didn’t end there as a roar erupted from Mathias and the power started rising again. This time however they could see his body becoming larger and changing into a… draconic looking from.</p><p><br></p><p>The Buné Trait of Dragonification.</p><p><br></p><p>Moments later, a huge dragon stood in front of them. He had red scales with golden highlights at the joints. He roared loudly as the ground around him cracked and they had to grit their teeth to stand straight in its presence.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is absurd.” Euclid shook his head in disbelief. “It’s… on… the level…”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked as Matty turned to the side and breathed flames towards the end of the dimension.</p><p><br>Euclid’s face turned pale as both Armin and he pushed their barriers even further. They looked in horror as the place which was hit by his dragon flames erupted as if it was the end of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The shockwave smacked against the barriers of Armin and Euclid, breaking several of them before stopping finally…</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias then turned towards them and his figure began to shrink once more until he was back in his normal form and walked back towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood in front of them and looked at them. He seemed almost pained as he did so but took a deep breath before speaking. “I went there… because I was confident in my strength. If I wasn’t worried about the surroundings, I could have reduced the entire country and maybe even some of the surrounding ones to ashes. Not to mention, I had Ingvild, Lavy and Shizuka with me and Tia, Crom and Leafa as a backup. The latter three are stronger than me. I know how sad you all would be if something happened to me… that’s why I don’t risk my life unnecessarily.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why… did you hide this… your power?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know the difference between the strong and monsters?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The strong can make people admire and look up to them, aspire to be like them… but monsters… they are different. They only make you feel despair. Just their presence can make people shiver… I don’t want my loved ones to be afraid of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your hands are shaking.” He looked at her hands, making her turn towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened as she looked at her own hands, shaking. She tried to stop them but the shivering continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, I…” She looked at him with a horrified look.</p><p><br></p><p>He had a pained smile on his face. “I am someone who can fight Heavenly Dragons to a standstill, Latia. Two of them could fight all three factions. This reaction of yours… it’s natural. There is nothing wrong with it. You don’t need to feel bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” She tried to say something but found herself at a loss of words.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have all had a long day today. So, let’s call it a day today. We can talk again tomorrow.” He smiled again but she noticed that this smile was not like his usual carefree one.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t wait for anyone and left.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia suddenly felt her as if someone had crushed her heart.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Calling the situation a nightmare would be underselling it.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew things were going to get bad. Everyone had doubts that this might be an elaborate trap of some kind to kill Mathias and yet… yet they wanted to use this chance to ease the rising tensions between the three factions due to the reveal of Mathias’ food products.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only the three factions but even the other factions were suddenly watching them and smuggling his products to test them for themselves. His products were a boon for the Devil race but this very boon could turn into a terrifying curse if not handled properly. That’s why they wanted at least the three factions to present a solid front to deter anyone who might be thinking of making any moves.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe even use it to work towards a Peace Treaty down the line. They were all tired of the constant wars and they didn’t want the younger generation to experience the same struggles. And yet… their worst fears had come true.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, perhaps not the worst fears. That would have been the case where something actually happened to Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>They would be going to war right about now. Thankfully, nothing of that sort happened and the kids were all safe and sound.</p><p><br></p><p>But the current situation wasn’t much better either.</p><p><br></p><p>The tensions between Heaven and the Underworld had gone from relatively calm to shit in less than a day. Falbium was organising the defences and armies of the Underworld against any surprise attacks and she was sure Heaven was also doing the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Several factions were shaken by the auras they had felt in the human world and on guard for sudden attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>The prisoners were taken and were being interrogated for information and they had gotten bits and pieces from them. Those people were not in a state to be interrogated. Mathias had done a serious number on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Kokabiel was for all matters and purposes, a cripple now and as for the Utsusemi Agency and Wizards of Oz… they were currently locked as per Mathias’ request. She had already called Azazel and asked him to come to a meeting of the leaders of the Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Kokabiel’s action was a surprise for everyone, even Azazel… or at least he said that. Not that such an excuse will cut it since he was working with Satanael, a known traitor of the Grigori and they even had the criminals of the Shinto with them. Ughh… now those stuck up Gods will be poking their nose here too,</p><p><br></p><p>Michael and Gabriel will be attending from Heaven’s side. Uriel was sent out because of his previous behaviour. Sirzechs retained his anger well but made it clear that he didn’t want him anywhere near the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>As she finished her call, Falbium entered the room followed by Sirzechs and Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is it?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not good. Ophis’ appearance has spooked many people. We were on the borders of the Norse so even they wanted to know what’s going on. Vidar was there with a regiment of his own. Odin has sent a message that he wants an explanation for the destruction near their borders.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah… what of the Shinto?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They haven’t found out anything about the involvement of the Utsusemi Agency. But it won’t be long before they do and we will have them knocking on the door.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time Euclid also entered the office.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded towards him and looked at the rest. “Did you at least get anything out of those people?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s as Mathias had said. They were there to kill him and get his body. They were planning to find more about the Zagan Life Magic and his new products through research in his bloodline.Kokabiel and the Church just wanted him dead and had offered the Excalibur Fragments and some research data to them in exchange for helping out. It seems the plan was originally initiated by the Church.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those fools...”</p><p><br>“We also found the artifacts used by the Utsusemi Agency members. They looked to be artificially made Sacred Gears and they contain the spirits of the Divine Beasts stolen from the Shinto. Expect a call from them soon.” Ajuka added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just my luck. So, what do we do about those artifacts?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We will have to return those to not cause problems at such a time… but it cannot be for free. Our people risked their lives to get them. They cannot just walk over here and expect us to return them without proper compensation or other factions might take it for a sign of weakness. We cannot afford to show any weakness at such times.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, were any of you able to contact Tiamat? And while I can understand her intervening, just how in the world did Crom Crauch get involved in all of this? No one even knew where that Evil Dragon was for the past several centuries. Not to mention their power… that was way beyond anything in the Dragon King level. I haven’t seen Heavenly Dragons in their prime but I doubt they were far off from them. Both of them were as strong or stronger than you both and Tiamat… how did she get the Annihilation Maker. A Heavenly Dragon with a Longinus capable of destroying the world… Michael was very right to feel worried. Even I was terrified at the thought of facing her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She received the call and said that she called in some favours but refused to elaborate on that.” Ajuka replied. She could sense that he was not pleased to be in the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>“Her favours were able to summon beings on the level of the Heavenly Dragons and even someone capable of making Ophis back off. Be glad she was on our side this time. Any ideas who the other people were? Did Mathias say anything?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We haven’t talked to him yet. They wanted some time to recover. Shizuka Himejima was unconscious and they wanted to get her treated first.” Sirzechs replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually…” Euclid opened his mouth but paused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know this might sound crazy but…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Euclid? You have been awfully quiet since you came back.” Sirzechs asked too.</p><p><br></p><p>“One of those auras back there… it belonged to… Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked worriedly at her daughter. She had been crying since she came back from Mathias’ farm.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana was confused and wanted to call Mathias but was stopped by Rias. “It’s not his fault.” Rias said.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno was the only one who had accompanied her there but she stayed there for some reason so she couldn’t ask her.</p><p><br></p><p>Confused about everything, she called Leila and found that Latia was in the same state, having shut herself in her room.</p><p><br></p><p>She asked Leila to bring her to the Gremory mansion where they can talk things out.</p><p><br></p><p>They arrived there quarter of an hour later and Venelana saw the red in Latia’s eyes, the obvious signs of crying.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, just what happened there? Why are you all in such a state? Is everything alright?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t say anything, making her have a headache.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if you don’t want to speak, then I can only go and ask Mathais.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t call him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both the girls stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then speak up. What’s the matter? Did you have a fight with him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you both speak or should I call him?”</p><p><br></p><p>They winced but started speaking nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>They told them about the deal with Rudiger Rosenkreutz and about Heaven’s demand in return.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s dumb. Those people couldn’t possibly think we would accept such a condition. It’s an obvious trap.” Leila rolled her eyes and then suddenly paused. “Don’t tell me that that idiot actually accepted it…”</p><p><br></p><p>Latia nodded. “Today was the meeting… and they were ambushed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana felt her heart skip a beat. “Is he… is he alright?” She asked, worried.</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… you had a fight with him for hiding this?” Leila asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… well, that’s understandable. There is no need to cry over it. Every couple has their fights. It would be odd if you didn’t have any.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously dear. People have their own personalities. Fights are bound to happen when there are differences. I am sure, he must have his reasons for hiding everything from you too. Did you talk to him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… we made up but…”</p><p><br></p><p>“But what?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girls paused and it took them some more prodding to make them speak again. It was only then that they understood the actual reason behind their tears.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias… that boy… they had known he was strong, perhaps someone like Sirzechs and Ajuka but none of them had realised that he had already reached such a frightening level.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Leila was shocked at the whole reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“He… he said he didn’t tell anyone about his power because he thought we would be afraid of him and… he was right. I… my hands… my hands were shaking. I couldn’t control them…” Latia broke down once more, making Leila pull the girl into a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>That kind of reason… it was just like Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>When thinking about it, it was understandable too.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been alone for years and finally got to make some friends, got engaged and fell in love with these two… he would be apprehensive about showing them that side of him too.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Leila and saw the look of understanding in her eyes too. After all, both Leila and her had to deal with Sirzechs and Ajuka, two people in similar situations.</p><p><br></p><p>“He wasn’t wrong, you know. There is a difference between the strong and monsters… Mathias’ words are absolutely true.” She began making them look at her even more hurt but she continued. They needed to hear this if they wanted to go into a relationship with someone like Mathias. “In fact, I know of two more people who have been in a similar situation. Their thoughts were very similar too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?” Rias asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs and Ajuka.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs had dealt with similar thoughts about his True Form until he met Elsa. She will have to ask him to go and talk to Mathias when he is free.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know why Sirzechs is called the strongest Devil alive?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because he is the Lucifer right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, he is the Lucifer because he is the strongest. Not the other way around. Most of the younger generation don’t know about this and the ones who fought in the Civil War never speak of this but I guess it’s time that you should know this seeing as you are facing a similar situation. Sirzechs… always keeps ninety percent of his power sealed away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The power you see him exhibiting, that’s just a tenth of what he is truly capable of. When he releases his full power, it can cause the entire Underworld to shake. In that form, he loses all control over his Power of Destruction and turns into a mass of Destruction himself… destroying everything in his path indiscriminately. It’s terrifying. It’s something which makes his enemies lose all their will to fight him once they witness that form of his. It’s not even just fear but rather an instinctive reaction of their mind in front of overwhelming power.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the look of horror on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>“And Sirzechs, just like Mathias, doesn’t want to see that look on the faces of his loved ones when they are near him. Your reactions… they were not unusual. It’s natural.” She reassured the two.</p><p><br></p><p>“But…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What you should concentrate on is not on that but rather on whether you like him despite of that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I do.” Was the answer from both of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think he would harm you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty would never do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. So go and talk to him. Matty is a very understanding and mature kid. He wouldn’t mind it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But he… he was hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then go and make up for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He needs you two more than ever. Sirzechs and Ajuka had us but Matty is there alone. Go to him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two girls got up and got ready to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and wash your faces before you leave. You both look like a mess.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>When they left she looked at Leila and summoned a drink.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you like some?” </p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I think I wouldn’t mind a glass right about now.” Leila summoned two glasses.</p><p><br></p><p>She poured two glasses and picked one.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kids… they grow up so fast, don’t they?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… yes, they do.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am finally done with this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Too much work this week.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Anyways, several things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A wild Ophis appeared.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I know many were waiting for the reactions in this chapter but this was something I had in mind for a while and wanted to deal with first.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sirzechs’ true form had terrified even Hades and the Heavenly Dragons were even stronger.

Buy the things you can. No need to think much about it.” Shiroe instructed as we looked through the goods.</p><p><br></p><p>Derek and his people had escorted us out of the Auction House to their base. He had his own businesses which mainly dealt in smuggled goods.</p><p><br></p><p>They were arranging a ship for us to leave right at that moment and we had an hour or two at best to buy anything we could for trade… and that’s what we were doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had decided to accompany us and Grayfia or rather Bina followed us with another girl White Rose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get the weapons and weapon blueprints. Our country lacks those.” She instructed as we were picking things up. “Get maps and books about navigation and information on other countries. Skill Books if you can find any. Equipment and accessories too.”</p><p><br></p><p>As I picked up a sword, I saw something on the wall and couldn’t help but stare at it for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me, how much for it?” I pointed towards the item I wanted.</p><p><br>“Oh this! This is… twenty gold coins.” The man asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll take it.” I gave the man the coins and took the item.</p><p><br></p><p>A straw hat… with a red ribbon.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t help but smile as I put the hat on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“You like that hat, kid?” A person beside me suddenly asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned around to see a guy wearing glasses standing beside me. He had white hair and a white beard. There was a scar across one of his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost unconsciously I used the Scan Skill on him… however it didn’t work.</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck?</p><p><br></p><p>Scan worked on almost anyone, even NPCs. It only didn’t work on… anyone three Tier above me… a T8…</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. This looks awesome. I think it would suit the head of the future king of the pirates.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>The man smirked. “Future King of the Pirates eh! That’s some goal you have. Aren’t you the guy who sold a Devil Fruit in the auctions today… to buy a girl?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was the relative of a comrade.” I replied unphased.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quite admirable but not very pirate like. You used something worth millions for that…”</p><p><br></p><p>I just shrugged. “Well, we were lucky to have the devil fruit when we did or we would have to fight our way through.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oho, you’d fight your way through the Auction House, breaking the rules of the Auction House?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, that sounds kinda bad but. Those who break rules are scum but… those who abandon their friends… are worse than scum.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+11 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+22% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Skill Book: Chidori</strong><br><br></p><p>Hell yeah. Finally worked.</p><p><br></p><p>“So all those girls were your comrades?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Only one of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why did you save the other girls? You could have saved up on a lot of money if you didn’t buy them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah? Well, you see… When I was a boy I wanted to be a hero. Someone who could save people from suffering and grant them their freedom.

I am the man who is gonna be the King of the Pirates… how can I be worse than scum?” I added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh… then what kind of man do you think a Pirate King should be?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Pirate King should be the freest man on the sea… and I am going to become one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just for that and not to find the One Piece, the wealth, the fame, the power?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean finding the One Piece is basically the requirement for the position, right? So I guess I will find it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what is it that you want to do as a Pirate King?” He asked once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him and smiled. “I am gonna turn the world upside down. Say, you don’t look bad either… wanna turn the world upside down with me?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+13 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+26% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Unique Skill: Voice of the World</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Ohh Yeah!</p><p><br></p><p>The guy’s mouth opened as he stared at me and then smiled. “I’ll pass. I am already an old man. But are you sure you want to do that?

Good luck on your journey. That hat suits you well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Goodbye…”</p><p><br></p><p>I walked away from the scene and reached Shiroe.  “What took you so long?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was talking to someone.” I replied. “Did you guys stock up on everything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We are almost done. Anything else you need?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, not really. I have already received everything I wanted.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I sure did.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the most references I had been able to make in my time in the game… even more than during the raid.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean seriously, I even used some extremely uncommon references and didn’t think they would be counted.</p><p><br></p><p>The Game Master must be an ardent One Piece fan to get all of those. Then again, this guy basically recreated the One Piece world here. It would be surprising if he wasn’t a huge fan.</p><p><br></p><p>While we were leaving, I took the chance to check the skills I had gained.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chidori [Level 1/100]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Concentrate Lightning in your hand for a one time stab.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>At higher levels, the attack power increases and lightning can be manipulated more easily for more versatile moves.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Deals 400% Damage</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cost 200 MP</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Attack power increases by 5% every level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Voice of All Things [Level Max.]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The ability to hear the voices of nature, even inanimate things.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There was no more description of this skill and I would need to check it later to understand its use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Observation Haki [Level 1/100]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Heightens the perception of the user.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>More functions are unlocked at higher mastery.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+50 to Perception Stat</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cost: 100 MP per minute.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+5 to Perception Stat per level. MP Cost Decreases by 5 MP per minute every ten levels.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Armament Haki [Level 1/100]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Allows the user to coat their body or weapons for increased attack and defence power. Allows the user to harm ethereal and intangible enemies.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+50% Attack Power, +50% Defence Power while the skill is active.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cost: 200 MP per minute</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+5% to Attack Power, +5% to Defence Power increases per level. -5 MP Per minute every ten levels.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And finally the most broken of skills… the Will of D</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Will of D. [Passive]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You carry the Will of the D.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Increases Spirit Stat by 1 every level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Current increase +112 Spirit</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Spirit, Perception, Luck, etc stats were secondary stats, something not increased so easily. In fact, many didn’t even know the function of these stats. In fact, the increase in these stats is actually random. They just increase at times when someone levels up and doesn’t increase at other times.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I had a skill which increased the Spirit Stat by simply levelling up.</p><p><br></p><p>Although I didn’t know the function of this stat yet, it had to be something good… or at least I hoped so. The description of some skills were too vague.</p><p><br></p><p>Observation and Armament Haki however were incredible additions to my skill set. I have mostly been focused on heavy close quarter attack and defence. These skills complement the rest of my skills very well.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, there was the Buccaneer Race Change Card. Wasn’t that the race of Kuma? Were they half giants?</p><p><br></p><p>How do the Race Change Cards even work?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buccaneer(Half Giant) Race Change Card</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unlocks the Giant Race Tree</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It says it unlocks the giant race tree. How will that even work? Will I become a giant immediately? Explaining that would be hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the trip to Sabaody was good.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, we were escorted by Derek’s men to the ship that was prepared for us.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe had already contacted the Captain who had brought us here and the man was ready to leave for a small bonus.</p><p><br></p><p>We boarded the ship that very night.</p><p><br>Derek had kept his words as he sent twelve of his men to follow us. Three T6 and nine T5 to protect us till we reached Lannisport.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the time we came here, this time, each of us had a room, all paid for by Derek. The guy was not lying about his words.</p><p><br></p><p>A fun thing was that, unlike what everyone was expecting, no one had come to the port to try to rob us… something even Derek was confused about.</p><p><br></p><p>He was ready to fight a war but… there was just no one.</p><p><br></p><p>I had some idea about what might have happened but didn’t say anything there.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had taken some time to talk with Grayfia and explain everything to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, I sat with Shiroe and Star to discuss the amount we had just made.</p><p><br></p><p>A total of thirty two million gold coins… twenty five which Damon had gathered and the seven million extra from selling everything we could.</p><p><br></p><p>“We spent three million on the things we bought today and that leaves us with a total of twenty nine million. Wow… that’s huge.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is. We will need to think carefully on how to invest it when Veena comes back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Veena-san is more experienced in these kinds of things. We can ask her for advice. Still… this was quite an adventure, wasn’t it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Say that again. I wasn’t even sure we would be able to leave that island safely when we were betting in the auction house.” Star sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was fun though. What’s life without an adventure?” Whistler said and by now, we had understood to tune him out most of the time.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is she doing?” Shiroe asked after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is currently talking with Bina. By the way, have you talked with the other girls?” I asked. They were terrified when we escorted them out.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did. They are better after knowing about us, especially the Guild Name. The worldwide announcement has been received differently everywhere but at least they know us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Man, I am just sad that we couldn’t hunt there for longer. That place was giving experience like no other.”</p><p><br></p><p>“True, but that was only because of us. If we didn’t encounter Suikazura-san and Whistler when we did and didn’t have Arthas’ broken class, we would be struggling to survive there, let alone think of hunting. I was actually worried that we might encounter a T6 there and then even running away would have been difficult. We are already ahead of others. No need to risk it all, especially when we don’t even know which T6 Class to choose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I understand that but still… tell me you are not disappointed?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe also sighed. “I am. We can go back there in a month. Right now, we need to go back and level up the guild so that we can add everyone first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things before leaving for our rooms to rest.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Veena -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s the whole story. I didn’t expect to encounter you like this… I…”</p><p><br></p><p>She patted her shoulder. “You have been through a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I just don’t understand why the rest haven’t broken through this game yet. Is it so complicated that even Ajuka cannot find a way around it?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana frowned. “It’s not like they don’t want to. It’s more like they don’t dare to do so.” She said, taking the girl by surprise. Looking at her confused face, she explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“This game was created by someone called the Game Master, the same guy who introduced us to the game. You remember him, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not some common human but rather a being with power surpassing that of the Infinity and Dream.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“After this game started, he also did a broadcast through all the supernatural world, warning anyone against interfering with the game or they will be met with severe consequences. Obviously, many didn’t take this seriously and one person did. The next day, Rizevim Livan Lucifer’s dead body was hung on top of the Lucifer’s castle.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and continued. “He appeared again, this time over the underworld and made the Agreas island disappear as a punishment to the devil race and warned everyone that he would release the beast of apocalypse on the faction who tries to interfere with his game next and if someone survives that, he and his lovers would personally take action. By the way, his lovers are Great Red, Ophis and the Dragon Goddess, Tiamat.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia was rendered blank for a while, not that she blamed her. She had been in the same situation when she had heard of the news.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s why they are not interfering with the game. That said, not all hope is gone. The Game Master has promised that as long as anyone completes the game, everyone will be let go. To do so, Sirzechs and even the members of other faction have been sending more players inside. We met one such player who had come in to save someone else and that’s how we know of everything that has been happening outside. Right now, we have no other way than winning this game to get out of here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia was left silent and she gave her some time to gather herself. She gathered herself quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I believe that as long as we all work hard together, we can achieve this goal. We and our Guild are aiming to complete the same goal.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia nodded. “Still, I didn’t expect you to be from the Fairy Tail Guild, the same one from the world announcements.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my. Were you underestimating me, dear?” She smiled as the girl promptly apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, I didn’t mean to insinuate such a thing… I just…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe I am just joking, dear. I understand your confusion. After all, I didn’t know anything about gaming when I entered, so it is understandable to be confused to see me reach such a level. There are many reasons for it. First of all, this game is quite like the real world. Interacting and finding information is always an option. Second would be my luck to encounter Arthas in the starter village and then Shiroe in the next town. Those two are really good at what they do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your guild mates?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Shiroe is a phenomenal strategist. In fact, I could see him rivalling the likes of Falbium in time. His experience with games like these have been an essential part in our growth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The one with the glasses, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That’s the very one. And then there is Arthas… our guild master and the strongest player in the game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The strongest?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes dear, the strongest. Arthas is a T5 Level 12 while other people are still stuck in T4. He is in a league of his own.”</p><p><br></p><p>“T5! But how? We have worked so hard, working our best and all we could do is near T4, not even achieve the said level. How could he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because he never stopped. He has been putting his life on the line while people were crying about being stuck in the game. He was hunting in the forests by his lonesome while everyone else was waiting for a small rabbit to spawn outside the village. His methods of hunting were ingenious and the game rewarded him. Did you know that you get rewarded for reaching the new tier before anyone?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Yes. I received a boon for reaching the second tier first, a 10% bonus experience gain.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That’s the one. Well, Arthas has received that boon five times already. And by the rate we are going, he might get it a sixth time too. On top of that, he has a Unique Class which gives him extra experience for killing specific species. But even after that, he never stops. Even when he is at home, he keeps on swinging his sword or practising his skill. It got so bad that we had to force him to get a hobby so that he doesn’t burn himself out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...you seem to appreciate him a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh obviously I do. I wouldn’t have taken him as my new lover otherwise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He’s such a sweet guy, a complete gentleman at all times, except when he fights, he turns into an invincible wall you can trust to stop any kind of enemy.” She gushed and only stopped when she saw Grayfia looking at her dumbfounded. “What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Lord Gremory…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, Zeo and I were planning to separate either way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh come on. It’s not like you haven’t heard about old devil couples separating with each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I have but it’s so sudden…”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were planning to announce it after Rias’ marriage, for the sake of the kids.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia still looked stunned but nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, you take some rest, dear. You deserve it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I will go and talk to Rose first. I need to explain the whole situation to her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The white haired girl with you? Sure. I will also retire for the day.”</p><p><br></p><p>She got up and left the room and went towards Arthas’ room.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time for his reward.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I washed up and got ready for bed when I heard a knock on my room.</p><p><br></p><p>The rooms we had were better than the last time and thus we even had some water to wash ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>It was nothing like the bath we had back at Llyne but it was still better than nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Wrapping my towel around my waist, I walked to the door and opened it to find Veena, standing there.</p><p><br></p><p>She sashayed into the room and I closed the door behind her and turned back and she pulled me in for a short kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>I however was not satisfied with just a short kiss. Holding back for almost a week had been painful for me so I pulled her back and pushed her against a wall, claiming her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>We separated after a minute.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked surprised at the sudden aggression from me and asked. “What was that?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled, as a scene popped into my mind. “I learned it from the pizza man.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+17 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+34% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Angel Race Change Card</strong></p><p><br></p><p>…hahahaha.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, nothing. It was just a joke.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, while I enjoy your jokes, I have more in mind than just that today. You were amazing back in the auctions. I was thinking of rewarding you for your performance back there.” She grabbed my crotch over my towel and I didn’t need any more words.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked her up and carried her to the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my.” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want my reward on the bed.” I replied, making her laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you wish.”</p><p><br></p><p>I laid her down on the bed and got on top of her, my towel already having fallen down by now. I pulled her into another kiss and when we pulled back, she took this chance to open her shirt, revealing her milky globes for my hungry eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need any invitations and jumped on her breasts, taking one of her nipples into my mouth and groping the other, pinching and pulling her nipple.</p><p><br></p><p>She combed my hair with her hands, moaning and pulling me into her chest.</p><p><br></p><p>My hand slid up her leg, raising her skirt, up her thigh and reaching her ass before grabbing and squeezing it hard.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Mmhhh</em> yes… that’s it. Do whatever you want. Today I am your reward.” She whispered into my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>I left her breasts and went down, using my hands to spread her legs wide and looked up at her. “Hold them.”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile appeared on her face as she did what I said. She always did like it when I was being dominant. “What next?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep holding them. Just like that.” I ordered while I leaned in and kissed her lower lips over her panties.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” A satisfied moan escaped her mouth as she leaned back, pulling her legs further wide.</p><p><br></p><p>I rubbed her pussy above her panties, slowly at first and then slowly increasing the force. A wet spot formed on her panties and I looked up.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems you are even more excited than me for this reward. Who exactly is being rewarded here?” I asked with a slight smirk of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where does it say that both parties cannot enjoy one person’s reward? Moreover, don’t you think being with you is a reward?” She replied.</p><p><br>“Ah true. My bad. Then please, enjoy the reward as well as you can.” I replied, hiding my blush at her comment.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, she was too good at this.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed aside her panties and dove deep into her crotch, kissing and licking her lower lips.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my fingers entered her, quickly searching for her g-spot.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was quite a patient lover, having quite a lot of experience with women. She took her time to teach me everything I needed about a woman’s body.</p><p><br></p><p>I took her advice to heart and used her as the first test subject of her teachings.</p><p><br></p><p>Within moments, I fought my target and her hand which was combing through my hair suddenly grabbed it and pushed me further into her, something I complied wholeheartedly, all the time while teasing her g-spot.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached her clit and sucked on it and that was apparently enough to push her over the edge. Her whole body jerked up as she climaxed hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I got back up and wiped my face as I looked proudly at my handiwork.</p><p><br></p><p>While making her cum once was nothing, the fact that I could do so in minutes now was a great achievement for me.</p><p><br></p><p>She enjoyed her daze for a few moments before I pulled her up. “I think it’s my reward.” I reminded her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes…. yes, it is. Then let me take care of you.” I lay down on the bed and she grabbed my shaft slowly jerking it, as she leaned in and then kissed the base, slowly kissing her way up.</p><p><br></p><p>I relaxed and enjoyed her ministrations, my hand reaching for her ass and pulling her panties down to play with her round bottom.</p><p><br></p><p>She reached the tip and gave it a lick first before taking it into her mouth and running her tongue all over it.</p><p><br></p><p>A deep grunt escaped from my throat as I felt her working up and down my shaft. My other hand reached for her hair and grabbed them and pushed her deeper on my cock. One unique thing about her was the fact that she had almost no gag reflex.</p><p><br></p><p>Gagging is for amateurs, were her exact words when I had asked her the reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I was complaining.</p><p><br></p><p>It just meant I could go harder and that’s what she liked too.</p><p><br></p><p>She easily let me control the flow, following whatever I wanted her to do, her tongue never once stopping their movements.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached my edge in just a few minutes and pushed her down on my cock till I reached her throat. She wasn’t done even then, her throat massaging my tip and pushing me over the edge as I released ropes of cum inside her throat.</p><p><br></p><p>When I pulled back, a bit of my cum spilled from the side of her lips which she licked with her tongues.</p><p><br></p><p>The sheer sexiness of the sight, making me hard again.</p><p><br></p><p>She snapped her fingers and suddenly all traces of the cum and sweat around her disappeared. Looking at my confused face, she explained. “I was able to find a very nifty Skill Book while shopping today. It’s called a Clean Spell. I bought five copies as they were quite cheap there. Helps a lot with cleaning… and other things too.” She smirked at me. “Now rest and let me do the work today.” She said as she positioned herself on my cock and slowly lowered herself down on me.</p><p><br></p><p>I groaned as my cock was wrapped in the warmth of her core.</p><p><br></p><p>She leaned in for a kiss and I complied before she started moving her waist.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound of her ass clapping against my waist echoed throughout the room, shaking the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the movement of the ship was helping us with the movement and making everything even better. I reached for her breast and took one of her nipples into my mouth while my hands mauled her ass, slapping them occasionally, eliciting moans of pleasure from her.</p><p><br></p><p>Things got heated up and I grabbed her ass and picked her up slightly and started thrusting from below.</p><p><br></p><p>She hugged my head into her bosom before I finally rammed into her and shot my cum deep into her core. At the same time, I felt her pussy grip me as she came at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>We stayed in each other’s embrace, enjoying the pleasure. I was however not even close to being down.</p><p><br></p><p>She sensed me still hard inside her and moved aside, getting on all fours. “Now for your reward.” She spread her ass, revealing her rosebud to me. “It’s been over five decades since I have tried this so go slow at first.”</p><p><br></p><p>The sight of her pussy dripping with my cum and her hands spreading her ass cheeks, inviting me to take her backdoor… there was only so much a man could do.</p><p><br></p><p>It was my first time trying anal but my shaft was wet enough from our juices. I took some of my spit and lubricated her entrance before I pressed my cock at it. She was tight. Her ass was far tighter than her pussy… and hot.</p><p><br></p><p>The lubricating made it easier but I still had to slowly push one bit at a time. It was only after a minute or so that I was fully inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her some time to get used to it as I slowly moved. By now she had relaxed and her switch was flipped on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now ram it inside. You can be as rough as you want. I am your reward today. Use me.” She shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her hands back and did just that, started ramming into her. Each push sending shivers of pleasure down our spines. Pulling her hands further, I grabbed her hand and turned her face towards the side and kissed her before pushing her face on the pillow and began ramming into her in earnest.</p><p><br></p><p>The room was filled with sounds of slapping flesh but neither of us cared.</p><p><br></p><p>I shot into her three times without pulling out and she came five times in that time.</p><p><br></p><p>When I pulled out, her face was against the pillow, ass in the air, my palm prints on them from the slaps. Her asshole was gaping from the brutal treatment and cum overflowed from it to down her pussy lips.</p><p><br></p><p>I laid beside her and pulled her on top of me, slowly entering her pussy this time and let her control the pace. With our lust calmed down a bit, we continued with the slow, more romantic sex till it was almost dawn.</p><p><br></p><p>She slept in my room that day.</p><p><br></p><p>The two of us left the room quite late. Thankfully, the rest of the team were also tired from the entire fiasco of the previous day and were still sleeping, having nothing better to do while sailing. There was however someone who was awake.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia was waiting for us, followed by the girl White Rose, who was looking at Veena and me with a look that could only be described as an atomic blush.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, you two are up already? You should have rested more, especially after such an ordeal.” Veena said as she sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>I occupied a seat beside her and felt Grayfia look at me a few seconds more than normal but didn’t comment on it. I knew it must be weird to know about our relationship… Actually, now that I think about it, her room was right beside ours… with the other side being occupied by White Rose… damn… no wonder she was blushing so hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I however didn’t let my thoughts show up on my face and merely nodded at them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you two have something to eat?” Veena asked, as she took out some snacks and laid them on the table in front of us. “I am starving.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was also starving, having worked all night… very enjoyable work. So I picked up one of the sandwiches and took a bite.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose’s stomach grumbled and her blush intensified. All of us however chose to ignore it and Veena pushed the plate towards her. “Here have some. We cannot waste any food.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded and took a sandwich and took a bite of it, before another. A few seconds later, the sandwich was gone. She must have been really hungry.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena took this time to look at Grayfia. “So, what did you want to talk to me about?” She asked. Grayfia looked at me and Veena, realising her glance continued. “You can say anything you want here.”</p><p><br></p><p>She then checked our surroundings and spoke again. “Last night, while talking to Rose, I realised that she knew about the Supernatural world too. Rose is actually a Valkyrie from Asgard. Her true name is Rossweisse.”</p><p><br></p><p>I felt myself choke on hearing the name.</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck?</p><p><br></p><p>Veena passed me a glass of water. “Eat slowly, dear. We are not running out of food.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry.” I apologised before taking another look at Rossweisse.</p><p><br></p><p>White hair, blue eyes… their looks matched too.</p><p><br></p><p>Like what were the chances…?</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia continued. “She heard my name when…” She sent me a look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just call me Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When Arthas-sama called out my name and then connected the dots and opened up to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sama?” I asked, slightly confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a Japanese honorific. My daughter has been interested in Japanese culture since she was introduced to it by my son’s knight. Since then some of my family members have taken up on these honorifics. Trying something new is always fun. In any case, you can call him Arthas but knowing you, it’s impossible to do that. So why don’t you call him Mr. Arthas or Master Arthas… technically, he <em>is</em> your Master.” She smiled jokingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. You don’t have to do that. As I have already told you all, I was just trying to help out. Moreover, you are Veena’s daughter-in-law… how could I leave you there?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>They suddenly looked at me weirdly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Did I say something wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who told you she is my daughter-in-law?” Veena asked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>She isn’t?</p><p><br></p><p>What does she mean she isn’t?</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia was married to Sirzechs, wasn’t she? Or have they not gotten married yet? Didn’t they have a kid?</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean… you did say she was your son’s queen…” I quickly made an excuse.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, the queen I meant was the Queen of his peerage, not wife.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… I… oh. I apologise, I misunderstood.” I apologised while my mind was running haywire. Was I remembering things wrong or was it just different here?</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully they didn’t pursue it further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. You are quite famous outside after all. Well, at least it all ended for the best. You are welcome to join the team, Rose… just call us by our in game names. We don’t want any enemies to recognize us… at least by our names, just yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rose nodded and I did too.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, it was my slip which caused this.</p><p><br></p><p>“In our team, apart from me, Elaine and Arthas are the only ones who know about the Supernatural world. I do plan to open up about us to the rest someday in the future though. Not anytime soon. So just keep this information to yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about some more things and by that time, the rest also came out. The other three players we had rescued were badly shaken from the whole ordeal and were taking some time alone. We didn’t disturb them either. They needed some more time to get themselves up.</p><p><br></p><p>“So Bina, Rose, what Class do you use?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a Scholar and Rose is a Warrior.” She replied professionally.</p><p><br></p><p>“Scholar. Are you planning to go the Mage route?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, so another Mage. Do you have any other classes we can think of expanding to suit the team better?”</p><p><br></p><p>She thought for a while and then answered. “I have gained a Pirate Trainee Class while on the Pirate Ship. I worked for them, cleaning the ship and was given a Pirate Trainee Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That works? Huh, nice to know. What does it do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Melee combat. They can use swords and axes. I think higher levels of this Class can use Guns too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, that’s what I was looking for.” Star said, suddenly excited.</p><p><br></p><p>“No Star. You are a level 29 Apprentice Swordsman. You are not changing to Pirate.” Shiroe scolded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, a man can dream, right?” Star pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe however looked at Bina. “Does it also give you navigation skills?” He asked after some thought and she nodded. “Yes. Basic knowledge.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. That could be very helpful with our quests. Anyways, since you are already a level 25 Scholar, we can help you level up instead of using the Mage Class Card. Still, I would suggest levelling the Pirate Class on the side.” He finished.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about you Rose?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am… just Apprentice Warrior.” She answered, slightly dejectedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Apprentice Warrior is good. We needed more frontline fighters. By the way, what kind of Class do you want to play going forward? A full warrior based class or do you want a hybrid Class with Magic mixed in?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A hybrid class… sounds better. I have experience…” She suddenly paused, realising her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. So you have played Magic Classes in other games. Sure. We can search for a Hybrid Class.” Thankfully, Shiroe, having gone full planning mode, wasn’t paying any attention and handled the situation quite well here. “What kind of weapons do you use?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Spear.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, the range of the spear is always welcome. We can check the Guild and Black Markets for other classes and see what route would be good for you. Anyways, we have a basic team now. All we need is to get everyone to the T4 Class next as our short term goal. We can add more members as time goes by.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How many people are we looking at as our final goal?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s hard to say. We don’t know how strong the final bosses will be. I mean just Tier 5 had that Rhino so who knows what we can face later on? Would the game even end at T10 or do we even have to face something beyond it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I winced a bit at the mention of that fucking Rhino…</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s get back to the guild and get it levelled up fast so that we can add everyone to the guild first. Also, we will have to leave at least twenty places vacant for urgent invites from the next time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that we got talking.</p><p><br></p><p>Bina was quiet most of the time and only spoke when questioned. Rose was also the same but in her case it wasn’t professionalism but rather shyness which prevented her from speaking out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________________x_________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>After finishing our talks, we decided to go on and do our own work.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this chance to see if I could get any more references and found the Captain.</p><p><br></p><p>“You brat went and shook the entire Sabaody in just a few days.” He laughed as he got drunk on some booze we had bought. “Oh this is good stuff. It has been a while since I have had something like this. Is this from the Grandline?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s from the Grandline. Something Derek had for sale and I picked it up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, no wonder. It just has a different flavour about it. Makes me wanna sing and dance after drinking it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, then what are you waiting for? Let’s sing. I even learned a song back in Sabaody. How did it go again?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yo-hohoho, Yo-hohoho, Yo-hohoho, Yo-hohoho, Yo-hohoho, Yo-hohoho, Yo-hohoho, Yo-hohoho. Binkusu no sake wo, todoke ni yuku yo…” I honestly didn’t remember more than that and was hoping that this would be enough. Seriously remembering the whole song was hard…</p><p><br></p><p>“What forgot already? Sing after me…” The captain continued the song further and I sang after him.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately I didn’t get any rewards for this but it was fun.</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, I got enough on this trip already. I would need a lot of time to level all of this up.</p><p><br></p><p>We sang the entire day.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We reached Lannisport a day earlier than expected. The captain had outdone himself and we paid him some bonus. Derek’s people left right after that but not before inviting us to Sabaody again.</p><p><br></p><p>We went directly to Richard’s place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas! Welcome. How was your trip?” He asked as he looked at the group behind me. “You got slaves? And Damon… why is he here?”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “It’s a long story.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in. Let’s talk over some tea.”</p><p><br></p><p>We did just that. I explained the part about Damon betraying us.</p><p><br></p><p>If looks could have killed, Damon would have died already. First of all he apologised to us for sending us there.</p><p><br></p><p>“As much as I would like to have him skinned and hung on the walls of my building, that’s not the best move. First of all, a T6 person is too useful to be killed just like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think people would appreciate his ugly muck hanging on your building either. It would be bad for business.” I joked, making the man shake his head with a slight smile of his own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… that too. Anyways, T6… they are among the top level fighters of any kingdom. So getting any one is rare, very rare… not to mention expensive. After all, that’s the highest Tier a Slave Crest works on. I would suggest that you keep him as a guard in your Guild. It would keep people from having any ideas about your guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You look worried.” I asked, looking at the thoughtful look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… well, I was wondering who to trade with next. Our Dolphin’s Song Trading Agency had a partnership with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s quite easy.” I gave him a card belonging to Derek. “He is the guy we sold all the businesses belonging to Damon. You can contact him and deal with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the card. “Derek? You got a deal with Derek of the One Eyed Wolf!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. he was the one who bought the Devil Fruit from me…”</p><p><br>“Devil Fruit!” The word seemed to have stunned him. “Just what the hell did you get yourself into Arthas? Explain the entire situation first.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did exactly that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah! This damned bastard Damon…” He punched his table, breaking it in two.</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback by his aggression.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas, you are a newly appointed noble so you don’t know of this but, the King of our country has wanted to buy a Devil Fruit for a long time. You could have received a high ranking Nobility had you sent the fruit to him, maybe even a chance to get a T7 Class. No, with a Logia, you could have received both… Even Llyne could have benefited… dammit… This fucking traitor…”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at our team.</p><p><br></p><p>Bina was looking stoic as ever, no expressions on her face but her hands were clenched. Rose on the other hand… she looked guilty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I am afraid that’s out of the question. There was no way we could have left our comrades to be sold there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… yes, that wasn’t something we could allow. You did the right thing. We as the Knights of our Kingdom must value our honour and responsibility before anything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I was wanting to ask you where to sell some of the things we had bought from Sabaody.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. You can actually go to Greenfrost. It’s a big city and the people would appreciate the goods you have to sell.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you. I will do just that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will get some rooms arranged for you all. Take some rest.” He offered but we rejected. All of us had been doing nothing but resting the past week except for the day of hunting in Sabaody.</p><p><br></p><p>We wanted some action again.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Game Master -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Holy shit, that’s a lot of notifications. Just how many references did he get?” He asked as he looked at the list. With one thought the video came in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha, the balls on the guy. To say those lines to Rayleigh… hell, he even used Rayleigh’s lines on Rayleigh himself. Alright, that definitely deserved the prize.”</p><p><br></p><p>Taking some time to check on his junior’s progress, he saw the scene of the auction.</p><p><br></p><p>Honestly, he was wondering if he would punch someone in the Auction House. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the yearly auctions so there was less than a thousandth chance of encountering a World Noble and the reward wouldn’t have been triggered on anyone except those…</p><p><br></p><p>The move he pulled there was smart… in fact, it was a perfect move.</p><p><br></p><p>Others might think of people in the game as simple npc but as the creator, he knew that wasn’t the case. Most common npcs in the game were actually copies of actual people who have lived in the world, their personalities exact copies of the actual people, without any memories.</p><p><br></p><p>To create a new world, he couldn’t have fake people everywhere. And when there are such people, some tend to act… scummy too…</p><p><br></p><p>This game was meant to force people together against a common enemy, test their bonds and only allow the strongest of the group to come out on the top.</p><p><br></p><p>As for whether they chose to protect the world or destroy it… that wasn’t his problem. He was just giving them a chance to survive against the Alien Gods. He was no one’s nanny or minder who would keep them on the so-called righteous path.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the maid and the valkyrie… luck was indeed a great manipulator.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the list of quotes and finally paused at the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>“Red.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he really get the Pizzaman reference?” He asked. The requirements for that one were extremely hard to get.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, with the Devil Milf being there, he was perhaps one of the very few who could have done that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeah… should have looked. The woman was <em>rewarding</em> him for saving the maid.” Red smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head. He didn’t like watching others fuck… he liked doing the deed himself better.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, he sold off the Swamp Swamp Fruit eh…</p><p><br></p><p>He would have been disappointed if he had eaten that one.</p><p><br></p><p>Devil Fruits and other skills were some aspects he had added in the game from his side. In this game, no one carried over their Sacred Gears.</p><p><br></p><p>In his game, everyone started off equally and had the power to reach the same height. Some easier than others but that was the only thing luck affected.</p><p><br></p><p>Creating the Devil Fruit powers wasn't that hard for him and the reason he liked it more than Sacred Gears was because you had to find it yourself. You didn’t get stuck with it if you didn’t want to.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why if his junior had accepted a mediocre one like the Swamp Swamp Fruit, he would have been truly disappointed.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people say that the power of the Devil Fruit depends on the user and all that bullshit and yet when given the choice, they would choose the Goro Goro no Mi over the Beta Beta no Mi…</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately things seem to be going well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take this time and grow stronger, Junior. You have to face very strong enemies in the future.” He turned towards Red. “By the way, how is the progress of the people all over the server?”</p><p><br></p><p>“According to the plan. At this rate, we can start the next World Quest in four to five months.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, everyone was merely playing a tutorial. The second World Quest will be when things get interesting.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas met the Dark King and went on a rampage with the references.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The entire fiasco cost them some things and bought them some profits.

Just like that. Concentrate on the leaf.” I instructed Kasumi as she tried to stick a leaf on her forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a few days since she had begun her training.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I did was feed her the medicines which helped strengthen her body to make up for the lack of physical exercises. It’s not like people with low physical abilities didn’t have chakra or even high chakra pools. It’s just that, in those cases, more often than not it harms them more than it does any good.</p><p><br></p><p>She was starting her physical training under Kanae but it will obviously take more time for her to get anywhere due to her age.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to work on rituals for her to catch up.</p><p><br></p><p>The Grimoire only provided rituals designed for me and they cannot be used for other people. I can however develop rituals for them, something which I have been working on for a while now.</p><p><br></p><p>I am almost done with the first set of rituals to increase the physique, chakra control, mind and spirit of a person for now.</p><p><br></p><p>The materials needed are relatively cheap and easy to get except for a few herbs which I need to grow on my own. In fact, there are more than a few herbs I need to grow on my own.</p><p><br></p><p>I have already set up a herb garden in my warehouse but I was planning to expand more later on.</p><p><br></p><p>The first batch of students have almost reached Genin levels and we were ready to expand the academy.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, our main problem is numbers. We needed more people in our army.</p><p><br></p><p>The war had left many people orphans and Kensho had been finding and taking in many children.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them will be trained in different fields.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t intend to create a mercenary organisation in the country but rather a proper military under the control of the Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>The main problem with the ninja village system was that while Daimyo did fund it, they had to earn most of their money from missions.</p><p><br></p><p>The Daimyo didn’t want to expend all the costs needed to upkeep an army so they threw everything on the Kage’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>The exception to this rule was the Iron Country who had their samurai and they never participated in any wars.</p><p><br></p><p>I intend to do something similar and make my own Samurai forces.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, I had asked for five hundred children to be recruited. The previous generation will be training as well as working to upkeep peace of the land as a part of the police force, starting from the Capital City. Saitō will be training the old batch and organising them into a police force.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, I am planning to make a Fuinjutsu division now that I can get the cooperation of the Uzumaki Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>This division will mainly be responsible for maintaining the barrier around the city and warding off different places. They will also produce items for sale like Storage Scrolls and Exploding Talismans to generate income for the country.</p><p><br></p><p>The third division would be the Spy Division but I didn’t have any people who could train the students in that art except the Uzumaki ninja.</p><p><br></p><p>While Saitō was something of a spy he would be caught in seconds in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth division would be the Research and Development Branch.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth branch would be the Medical Ninjutsu Branch.</p><p><br></p><p>While the ninja villages never paid too much attention to medical ninjas, I want to make a whole department dedicated to it. They will not only serve in the army but provide services to the entire country in hospitals.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I am planning to make this into an industry later on.</p><p><br></p><p>The seventh branch would be the Finances Branch to manage all the monetary matters of the military.</p><p><br></p><p>As for earning money, I had already gotten several plans for establishing a food products industry, a perfume and cosmetics industry, healthcare products industry and a medicine industry concentrating on treating diseases instead of war injuries.</p><p><br></p><p>One step at a time.</p><p><br></p><p>I will make the Land of Flowers both an economic and military power so that no one can take advantage of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Kasami’s concentration finally broke and the leaf on her forehead fell down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very good. You are making very good progress, Kasumi.” I wasn’t even lying. She did have talent for it.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, now that she was starting to use her chakra, I could see that her reserves were higher than normal.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing too much but still far higher for a normal untrained girl.</p><p><br></p><p>This made me all the more curious about her mother’s identity because this was surely her mother’s genes at work.</p><p><br></p><p>I would get her mother’s identity in two more days.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” She replied shyly at my praise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s rest for some time. It’s almost time for breakfast. You have training with Kanae after this, don’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Kanae-sama and Kuina-sama have been helping me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Even if you wish to just learn Medical Ninjutsu, you would need chakra and to increase chakra, you would need both a strong physique and mind. Practise the Leaf Concentration Exercise everyday. We will arrange for something to help you out later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not disappoint you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will never disappoint me.” I smiled as I put a hand on her cheeks, making the girl lean into my palm.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, the Stairs Daimyo was a dumb moron for not caring for this girl.</p><p><br></p><p>We had dinner and later I left her with Kanae to meet the Uzumaki Trio.</p><p><br></p><p>Since their Uzukage had said she would be leaving them under my command, I had already started preparing identities for them. Since the Uzumaki will be disappearing from this continent, they couldn’t be an Uzumaki anymore or they will always be in danger. Their red hairs and chakra were hard enough to cover for now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness.” Genshiro-sensei bowed as he sensed me entering. The guy had been nervous since it was exposed that he had been spying on me.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to feel nervous, sensei. You were following orders. We are not angry at you.” I reassured the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness is very kind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, please don’t start acting like those sycophant courtiers and nobles, please. One of the main reasons We are delaying taking the crown is to avoid dealing with them. Please don’t make this boring too.” I complained, making his lips twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>In our time together, I had figured out some characteristics of the Uzumaki people.</p><p><br></p><p>They were quite open minded and frank people. Easy to get along with but at the same time, easy to anger and when they get angered, they can be a bit of a savage in their fighting style too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you found any talented students among the hundred?” I asked as I took a seat on one of the cushions.</p><p><br></p><p>“The group you had selected at first can be trained. The others unfortunately are not suitable for learning Fuinjutsu.” He replied politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, unfortunate.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rina looked like she was going to say something so I looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“The young girl, Konan. She is talented. I think she can become a very talented shinobi in the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow at her words. “Yes. We know of her talents. If trained well, she has the talent to become a Kage Level shinobi in the future. It’s one of the reasons why she was recruited by us.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she was not the only one I sent to be recruited.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Yahiko’s parents were found but they had rejected the offer, preferring to stay in their land till the end.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't force them either.</p><p><br></p><p>Since they were so loyal to the land of rain, let them stay there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. We have sent our subordinates to recruit more people for the new batch of students. You can choose from them and see if anyone has talent for the art.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, the war in the Land of Rain has become even more intense.” I informed the group and they nodded too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We have caught wind that the Hokage has sent his three students to fight against Hanzo the Salamander.” He agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those three huh.” So it was already that time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does your Highness think they have a chance against Hanzo?” Rina asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Chance of winning? No way. They will get beaten to the ground but Hanzo will not kill them.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because if he did then Sarutobi would come down on him with the full force of Konoha. That’s not something Rain can bear. They are just pushing to get reparations from Konoha because Konoha is stretched out wide and cannot afford to concentrate on them. Once they die, all that would go down the drain.” I replied. </p><p><br></p><p>After all, Hanzo was not soft hearted enough to leave his enemies, especially those who were guaranteed to become Kage level in the future, alive.</p><p><br></p><p>It was his way of saying that he was willing to take back a step if Konoha takes back a step as well.</p><p><br></p><p>And by doing this, he can have his dignity intact.</p><p><br></p><p>“So he will just let them go?” Mina asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Probably give them some fancy title or something, like who knows… the sannin.” I laughed at the inside joke.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, that title itself was the single biggest insult in the history of the world. Hanzo flexed on them by giving them a title which would run with them their entire lives… for losing against him.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannin meant ‘Three Legendary Ninjas’... more like Three Legendary Losers. I mean really, all three of them… had terrible luck. None of them managed to achieve what they wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>Orochimaru couldn’t get his immortality, Jiraiya couldn’t get Tsunade or bring Orochimaru back to Konoha and the less said about Tsunade the better.</p><p><br></p><p>“We just wanted to know if you three are planning to reveal your whereabouts to the Konoha shinobi should they come here by any chance?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. We are under orders to not reveal ourselves to anyone, even Konoha during our stay here.” He replied curtly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. So be it.” I brought out some identities from my sleeves and handed it over to them. “Here are your new identities as the citizens of the Land of Flowers and my retainers. Use these while you stay here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness.” Each of them took the ids and kept them.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things and I left.</p><p><br></p><p>Today I had more work to do.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time to summon people.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a shinobi we had captured brought over for the summoning ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>Last time, it was due to using a sacrifice that Toji’s wounds were healed when he was summoned or I doubt we could have fixed him up with just potions.</p><p><br></p><p>The strongest prisoner I had right now was just a Tokubetsu Jōnin but my chakra reserves have grown immensely recently.</p><p><br></p><p>It should make up for the deficit.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy was actually someone who had been sent by the Rock on a suicide mission but ran away and deserted. I wouldn’t have been mad at that but he then went on to start a gang of bandits in my land and started looting people… the Uzumaki had been the ones to bring him and his group down.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like usual, my subordinates had all gathered around me and we started the ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>I need a healer, probably someone who can train my people.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought, I started the summon and the ritual magic circle lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>The ninja’s body disintegrated and started quickly spinning into a ball of flesh before slowly taking the form of a person. A few moments later the form became clear and the light dimmed down.</p><p><br>Finally, we were able to see the person who had appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a tall woman with long wavy emerald green hair and brown eyes. She wore a white uniform complete with white gloves.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn't look surprised, instead just looked around calmly. “Is this what a Hero Summoning feels like?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Hero Summoning?</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me, Miss. Could you please introduce yourself?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked at me. “Are you the one who summoned me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. My name is Kazuya Katsuyoshi, the Prince of the Land of Flowers. May I know your name please?” I asked, again, politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am called Rose. Knight Commander… or rather former Knight Commander of the Llinger Kingdom. Why have you summoned me here? Do you have any problems with Demons too?”</p><p><br></p><p>Problems with Demons? Hero Summoning?</p><p><br></p><p>Also, Knight Commander?</p><p><br></p><p>I asked for a Healer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, I wanted a Healer who could train my people. My country is…” I then went on to explain the whole situation to her in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I can indeed use Healing Magic but I had never thought of a dedicated Healing Squad. Perhaps if I did, I would be alive instead of dying while trying to save the lives of my subordinates.” She sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Healing Magic?” I asked her, and she began to explain things about herself.</p><p><br></p><p>She was the Knight Commander of her Kingdom who had awakened Healing Magic. They had encountered a group of Demons in their territory and engaged in a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The Demons had gone suicidal on realising they were on the losing end and had killed two of her subordinates when Rose went berserk and was able to take down their leader and two more of their people. Unfortunately her injuries were too much and she was already exhausted in the fight and trying to heal her subordinates so she was dying. That’s when she got the summoning call and accepted the request to live.</p><p><br></p><p>Her world also had Hero Summoning Rituals and she knew about these things. It was because of this that she accepted the summoning so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can serve as a healer but I don’t think people of my world can use Magic. Here we use something else called Chakra instead of Magic.” I then went on to explain about chakra to her and the ways it could be used.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s understandable. Even the Heroes we summoned rarely knew about Magic. They had to be taught from scratch. You say that I am capable of using this Chakra too. Then teach me how to use this. I can master Medical Ninjutsu too.” She answered, unbothered entirely. “As for not being able to train your people, that’s not entirely true. I have experience of training people. I think I can do this much more easily. Even if not in chakra then at least their physical abilities.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, that’s understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe she can train people in first aid or something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. I will let Kanae explain everything about the world to you.” With that said, I left the room as Kanae and the rest took Rose with her.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s certainly a new thing.</p><p><br></p><p>None of my previous subordinates had magic or were from magic based worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to get more information about Medical Ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Will put that next in line for information to be searched after I get the identity of Kasumi’s mother later.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“What the hell!” I explained, attracting the attention of Kuina who was swinging her sword in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Something wrong?” She asked while I was still looking into my Grimoire, trying to reread the information about Kasumi’s mother, Yuka… Senju.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly read all the information about her and understood the story properly.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuka Senju, the daughter of Tōka Senju, a very prominent member of the Senju Clan was sent by Tobirama Senju as a spy/sleeper agent to infiltrate the Land of Stairs.</p><p><br></p><p>This was done for two reasons. First was to act as sleeper agents and second was to spread the members of the Senju Clan into other nations so that the Senju Clan blood doesn’t die out.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that Tobirama anticipated the current state of the Senju Clan from the changes in the world after the death of Hashirama and started to prepare countermeasures to face it beforehand.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was far ahead in this aspect compared to the Uzumaki Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>All people who were sent out were officially declared to have passed away in the line of duty and all traces of their original identity was erased.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a perfect plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Fun thing was how Yuka actually fell in love with the Prince of the Land of Stairs and actually got pregnant with his child. It’s just that the guy completely refused to accept the child as his own.</p><p><br></p><p>But her troubles were far from over. She was soon diagnosed with a terminal illness and she became desperate.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s when the news of the fourteenth concubine being pregnant came out.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuka was actually a part of the entourage of the Prince as she was a doctor or at least that’s what she was posing as. She had given birth and had gone there to convince the man to accept the child at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>He denied again and told her to leave after returning back to the Land of Stairs.</p><p><br></p><p>But her bad luck was far from over.</p><p><br></p><p>When the entourage of the Prince was going back, they were attacked. Many people died in that and Yuka was also seriously injured while defending her daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>In that attack the Prince and his concubine had also died along with their newborn child.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuka knew that she would die and thus exchanged her child with the dead child of the Prince and let the people who had come to the rescue discover them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for this reason that Kasumi survived that ambush.</p><p><br></p><p>The Daimyo kept her but actually blamed her for the death of his son as they had visited the home of the fourteenth concubine to deliver the baby. He always thought that if not for her, his son would not have fallen into the ambush and would still be alive. She was called the cursed child for this reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, no one in the public said that. It was something nobles said behind closed doors. In fact, the girl wasn’t even abused openly. She was just isolated… which was in ways far worse. No wonder she got so attached to me in such a short time.</p><p><br></p><p>People in grief can be extremely unreasonable. It was nothing new.</p><p><br></p><p>This shit was right out of a novel.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, many things became clear and even more questions arose.</p><p><br></p><p>What of the other Senju Clan members who were sent as spies to other Lands?</p><p><br></p><p>If someone like Yuka Senju could slip into the Land of Stairs carrying the child of the Royal family, then what are the other spies doing?</p><p><br></p><p>Were there any other spies in our land as well?</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing to search and I was pretty sure this information would take a long time to be uncovered… but it would be worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>If I could find the location of the Senju Clan members or their descendants, I could possibly recruit them into the Land of Flowers, having a strong force along with the Uzumaki people.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing was that I could technically use the Ritual on Kasumi and gain the Senju Clan bloodline too.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I could use other rituals to help increase the power of her bloodline too.</p><p><br></p><p>With her insane advantages, she could be a healer rivalling or even surpassing Tsunade Senju when I am done.</p><p><br></p><p>Now… how and to break the news to her?</p><p><br></p><p>“... uya, Kazuya!” My thoughts were interrupted by Kuina.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, well… it’s nothing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You sure?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Just some things. Don’t worry about it. By the way, how is Rose doing? Is she acclimating well to this world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She was surprisingly quick on the uptake and was very agreeable too. According to her, the Heroes who were summoned to her world by her Kingdom did their best to help too and it would be dishonourable of her to not extend the same courtesy to us. I like that woman.”</p><p><br></p><p>She has been quite cooperative.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Kanae said the same thing and she got along with Saitō too.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I have gathered a basic team.</p><p><br></p><p>Still need a good strategist and a research expert.</p><p><br></p><p>Until now, I have been playing both the roles by myself but I am not a very good strategist and I need a dedicated researcher for the team.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder what Toji is doing right now?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Toji Fushiguro -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He ran as fast as his legs could carry him, the trees around him passing by in a blur.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling of air on his face was exhilarating.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra was truly a magical power. Just having some in his body made him faster, stronger and sharper than before.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered what those arrogant Zenin bastards would do if they knew he had access to a power far more versatile than their cursed techniques could ever be?</p><p><br></p><p>Beg him to come back?</p><p><br></p><p>Nah… they would probably declare him as an elimination target of the highest order.</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t have anyone look down on them, can they?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh how his life had turned around in the past few months.</p><p><br>Just one moment, he was dying from that white haired demon boy’s attack and the next moment he was in another world entirely, summoned like those isekai manga characters.</p><p><br></p><p>The new boss was nice, although a bit inexperienced and the colleagues were fine except for Saitō Hajime.</p><p><br></p><p>Who would have thought that he would be working side by side with <em>the</em> Saitō Hajime…  or that he would be such a straight laced asshole.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing like the Zenin though, so he could live with it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Boss was also an enigma. He knew everything or rather had access to something which gave him information about everything.</p><p><br></p><p>For someone in Toji’s profession, that was a weapon far surpassing anything. Thankfully, the guy wasn’t an asshole or he could have the whole world under his boots in a year.</p><p><br></p><p>It was also because of this that Toji was willing to follow the man because he knew that the guy would not break his promise of sending him back to his world to prevent his son from getting possessed and then dying. Apart from this, he had promised him something which Toji didn’t even know was possible but was willing to dedicate his life for it.</p><p><br></p><p>As he ran past the forest, he dove into a river directly and swam underwater to get out of the area.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, how exactly did he get caught in his situation out of nowhere?</p><p><br></p><p>He had been on his mission to collect the Kusanagi Swords as planned. He had even collected five of these fine babies and was on his way to collect the sixth one when he saw a battle going on.</p><p><br></p><p>The forehead protectors gave their identities. They were from the Village Hidden in the Stones.</p><p><br></p><p>He had a strict order from the boss to not interfere in any fights but he was sure the boss wouldn’t mind if he took down one or two Iwa ninjas.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, he had no love for the rock headed fools.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, Toji wasn’t a fool who would put his life on the line for his pride. At least not anymore. The fight with that Gojo brat had taught him that much and this world had monsters far surpassing any from his own world.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why he waited in the distance, and set up his rifle, watching through the scope and looking for the best opportunity to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side was Konoha Ninja, fighting against a platoon of Iwa ninja.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like the Iwa side was losing and Toji considered if he should just wait till they died and then attack the Konoha side and finally rob whatever he could get his hands on but then he spotted someone. A lone figure, flying in the sky, was heading towards the group.</p><p><br>At first, Toji thought it was a bird but realised just a moment later that it was a human instead. The next moment, he remembered the list of names on the Bingo Book issued by the Bounty House.</p><p><br></p><p>The Third Tsuchikage, Onoki of the two scales, the man who was responsible for the Boss’ father’s death on the orders of the Earth Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>Boss hated the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with the usual funny and easy going facade he kept when talking about his plans, it was easy to see in his eyes whenever the Tsuchikage’s and the Earth Daimyo’s names were mentioned.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered if he would be happy if he were to know that the Tsuchikage had an accident and died.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh who was he kidding, the guy would be elated.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s bring him some happy news then.</p><p><br></p><p>He waited for the Tsuchikage to attack, knowing full well that the enemies would not stand a chance against the man.</p><p><br></p><p>A man is the most vulnerable right after he wins.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why he waited with a finger on the trigger, withheld breaths for the fight to end.</p><p><br></p><p>Boss had reinforced the gun with fuinjutsu to reduce recoil, reduce the sound, make the range longer and be able to fire two bullets without reloading. Even the bullets contained poisons of different types and had almost double the initial speed.</p><p><br></p><p>A hallucinogenic which would disturb the chakra flow in one’s body, a neurotoxin and finally a hemotoxin. Even getting grazed by it could put down a normal man.</p><p><br></p><p>He watched as the man gathered some kind of white light between his hands and suddenly a large cylindrical beam of light fell on the Konoha side, simply wiping out everything it touched.</p><p><br></p><p>Particle Style was really cheating.</p><p><br></p><p>The man stopped and then created another attack and Toji used this opportunity to fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he did, he realised that he might miss his target due to a sudden updraft and fired the second bullet.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t stop to look at the result and quickly packed the rifle into his sealing scroll and ran away.</p><p><br></p><p>Two kilometres was not a huge distance for someone who could fly.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s how he was in the current situation.</p><p><br></p><p>He swam almost three kilometres from the place and surfaced near a fishing spot used by villagers of the area.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly finding a place, he changed his clothes, dropped his transformation jutsu, stored everything in a storage seal under his feet and left the place.</p><p><br></p><p>He did wonder if the bullet hit the mark.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sakumo Hatake -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Captain, we have obtained some urgent information.” A ninja reported to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Report.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Base number thirty one has been destroyed by the Tsuchikage, Onoki. There were no survivors.” He reported.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakumo clenched his teeth. The Tsuchikage was here. It was going to get far more dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting against Onoki was nigh impossible due to his aerial advantage and particle style. All they could do was dodge and use long range attacks which were more often than not, no match for his Particle Style jutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>They could only hope to tire him out and dodge until he was out of chakra and left on his own. Either way, lots of soldiers were sacrificed. There was just no other way to stop the man. It was a reason why they hadn’t breached the border of the grass country yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The Tsuchikage stood as a wall who arrived whenever there was any danger and wiped out the opposing side and left.</p><p><br></p><p>“...ir, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“One of the Hyugas on our side was able to capture the last scenes of the battle. It seemed as if the Tsuchikage was attacked just as the fight ended. He crashed from the sky and he was quickly carried off by other Iwa shinobi. We don’t know if he is alive or if he died in the attack. Unfortunately the attack came from the other side so we couldn’t find who the attacker was.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sakumo was taken aback by the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Could you repeat that again?” He asked and his subordinate did. The news still didn’t change. The Tsuchikage was down.</p><p><br></p><p>“What should we do, sir? Could it be that it’s some kind of a trap?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sakumo thought about it and decided quickly. “Gather our forces. We attack with a small force of elites while the others remain on a standby. If we catch a whiff of the Tsuchikage, we retreat, if not, we take down the Iwa side completely.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mysterious attacker could be found later. First they had to take this opportunity and damage Iwagakure’s forces while their biggest player was out.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I slumped down on the couch, heaving to catch my breath.</p><p><br></p><p>The new weights were a bit harder to get used to.</p><p><br></p><p>My new enhanced body can take a lot of punishment but I need to unearth the full potential of the body. That's why I was pushing myself so far.</p><p><br></p><p>The healing factor took care of the muscle aches and helped me get used to the weights at a much faster pace, further increasing my speed of training.</p><p><br></p><p>“You lasted almost twice as long. That's incredible progress, Kazuya-san.” Kanae said as she lent me a towel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably because I have such amazing company.” I smiled, making the girl blush.</p><p><br></p><p>She really was low on the defensive side and I had a lot of fun teasing and flirting with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Even she was returning my advances nowadays and Kasumi had also accepted her so I didn't have to feel bad either.</p><p><br></p><p>I took her hand along with the towel and pulled her to me, making her yelp in surprise. “Kazuya-san!”</p><p><br></p><p>She crashed into my arms. I held her, preventing her from falling. “My bad. I couldn't control my strength and pulled too hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't let go however and made ourselves comfortable in that position. “Have some rest, Kanae.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… “</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don't like this, you can tell me. I will never do anything to hurt you.” I said seriously, dropping the teasing for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, I… someone might see us.” She finally said after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>My smile widened. “So it's fine if no one sees us, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?!” Apparently she hadn't realised what she had said and I wasn't going to let it go.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don't worry. I have already checked the area. No one is nearby.” I replied, snaking my arms around her waist and pulling her into a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>Her breathing became quicker and I could feel her heartbeat against mine.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t push her further and just stayed there like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Time passed and she became relaxed too, resting her head on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me something about your life, Kanae.” I asked, after we had gotten comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>“My life?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>She proceeded to tell me about her family, a relatively well to do family with her parents, her sister and herself. They were attacked by demons and her parents were killed while she and her sister were able to run away.</p><p><br></p><p>They encountered a Hashira and were taken in by him. There they trained and developed their own breathing styles too, finally establishing two new Pillars.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on they encountered and adopted another girl and named her Kanao. She even taught her Flower Breathing but one day, she had encountered Doma, the Upper Moon Rank Demon and was almost killed in the battle with him had she not been summoned here by me.</p><p><br></p><p>She told me about her family, things that I didn’t know from the few pages of manga.</p><p><br></p><p>We left after an hour but I was pretty sure we were closer than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Back at the warehouse, a surprise was awaiting us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Toji, when did you come back?” I asked, surprised at his visit.</p><p><br>We had expected him to take at least two more weeks for the job.</p><p><br></p><p>“Had some good news for you so I decided to drop by first and also deliver the swords before I went for the last three.” He said, before concentrating on the food in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>We waited for him to finish eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Man, that hit the spot. I was really missing the food from here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How was your journey?” I asked. “You didn’t have any difficulties, did you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, it was easy. It was one thing hearing about the war and a completely different thing seeing it with my own eyes. It’s literal hell out in Rain and Grass countries. This place is heaven compared to that.”</p><p><br></p><p>I frowned at the information. “Did you encounter anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes, yes I did. I happened to pass by a fight between Konoha and Iwa ninjas and saw the third Tsuchikage fighting himself. That man is seriously a beast.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he see you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. He was more than busy whipping out some beatdown to the Konoha ninja. I observed them from over two kilometres away.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed in relief. It would have been trouble if he was discovered, especially with all those Kusanagi swords.</p><p><br></p><p>My relief was however short lived as he spoke again.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I did manage to shoot him once, probably twice. I didn’t wait to check.”</p><p><br>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked smug at that moment. “Oh yeah, I got to test out my new sniper rifle. Let’s pray that the Tsuchikage doesn’t have poison resistance or there are no good medical ninja nearby and my first official kill in this world would be a kage. Would sound awesome on the resume, don’t you think? Toji Fushiguro, the Kage Killer.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not joking, are you?” I asked again, seriously this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t joke about my work, boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did anyone see you?” I asked, my mind running at high speed, thinking about every possible result of this situation. If the Tsuchikage dies and if he survives. Both could have drastic changes on us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. As I said, I didn’t even wait to see the result of the attack and ran away as fast as I could. I was in a henge when attacking and then went through two different countries and finally came here. Although I did hear that the Tsuchikage was injured and retreated. Konoha has taken that checkpost.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything else I need to prepare myself for?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, nothing else. I was planning to go and see what the legendary Hanzo of the Salamander looked like but I don’t have good resistance against poison so I avoided that area. You think you could get me something to get poison resistance later? Anyways, here you go. Five swords. I will get the last three later on.” He threw the scroll towards me and I unsealed it to reveal five swords in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Just picking up one could give one the feeling of power in each sword. I summoned my Grimoire and stored all the swords inside to know about the information, even the knowledge about the previous owners of the sword and their abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Each Kusanagi sword had a different ability and even the Totsuka no Tsurugi, the blade used by Itachi’s Susanno, was a variant of the Kusanagi no Tsurugi.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the abilities of the swords. One of them was actually the sword used by Orochimaru, the one which could extend to great distances based on the chakra fed to it. Another one had the property to enhance elemental chakra. One had the property to cut through chakra. The fourth one had extreme durability and could change its weight depending on the chakra injected and the last one actually carried a special type of chakra poison which made the enemies’ body feel heavier every time they were cut by it.</p><p><br></p><p>All in all, they were all extremely great swords.</p><p><br></p><p>With these swords, we might have a chance against Rōen.</p><p><br></p><p>I was almost at the Advanced level of Fuinjutsu and all I needed to do was take a test, which I was pretty sure I would pass and I could be an Advanced Fuinjutsu user.</p><p><br></p><p>There was an invitation for us to go to the Land of Medicine with Grandpa to formally establish the alliance.</p><p><br></p><p>We were going to attack then.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“This is great! This sword is awesome, Kazuya!” Kuina jumped around like a kid on sugar high, swinging her blade and making craters everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>She had taken the one which could increase its weight by injecting chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae took the chakra poison one.</p><p><br></p><p>Seraphim took the chakra nature one while Toji took the one which could cut through chakra as it reminded him of his Inverted Spear of Heaven and Saitō took the blade which could extend.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose didn’t want any for now as she was busy learning about chakra and Medical Ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t left with any… sigh. I will choose from the ones next time.</p><p><br></p><p>At least they are happy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t break this one, alright? Or I won’t know what to do.” I pleaded.</p><p><br></p><p>I really wouldn’t know what to do if she broke this one.</p><p><br></p><p>“I obviously won't break it. Just what do you think I am?” She rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, my bad. How was training with Rose?” I asked. She had just returned from showing Rose around the training grounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rose-san is planning on putting everyone through a test and will select one hundred people from the five hundred for her team. She will then dedicate the next few years to training them.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, let her do what she wants.” I don’t know how her progress in Medical Ninjutsu was coming along but she was positively enthralled by the idea of everyone having the potential to learn Medical Ninjutsu, completely ignoring the fact that not everyone could achieve that level of chakra control. She said that she could take care of that herself.</p><p><br></p><p>I really had no idea what she meant by that.</p><p><br></p><p>Toji had left for his mission after resting for a day. He still needed to collect the last three ownerless Kusanagi Swords for the team and I was left learning Fuinjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, have fun. I am going to take the test for Fuinjutsu.” Today was the day I become an Advanced Fuinjutsu User.</p><p><br></p><p>I went to the Ritual room where Genshiro-sensei was waiting for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Uzumaki people traditionally had three Expert level Fuinjutsu users watch over a test of an Advanced User and only then were they given a certification.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that the Uzukage had personally instructed them to give me the best possible treatment. Currently, my Grimoire was searching for information on the Uzukage, to know her future plans.</p><p><br></p><p>Two and a half months of time needed but with a deal this big, it wasn’t a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>My exam was presided over by Genshiro-sensei as the head examiner, Rina and Mina as his assistants.</p><p><br></p><p>I also found out later why the Uzukage had said all three of them could stay here.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that both Rina and Mina don’t have any other relatives and have been orphans since they were three.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them were trained as ninjas and have served their village as Anbu. They don’t have many connections to the village and could easily start a new life here.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Genshiro-sensei, he had been a close aide of the Uzukage but he didn’t have anyone left in this world anymore. He was in a similar situation and could stay with us.</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be enough, Your Highness. You pass.” Genshiro-sensei said as I finished demonstrating my seal to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations, you are now an Advanced Fuinjutsu user and probably the most prodigious student I have ever taught. To reach this height so quickly… sigh. It’s true that the new generation will surpass the older one. I am honoured to teach someone like you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t embarrass us, sensei. It’s because you were such a good teacher. By the way, We wanted to ask you for a favour if you don’t mind. If need be, you can contact Uzukage-sama and take this as a mission.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t need to do so. Uzukage-sama has ordered us to follow your instructions and assist you for any missions up to A Rank without taking permission from her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is too kind. We just wished for you to accompany us to the Land of Medicines. We have to go there to sign a treaty between our Lands but the ninja of the Howling Wolf Village have already attacked us once and we were lucky to survive. We just wish to take extra measures this time. We never know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“An escort mission will be no problem. We can accompany you.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. We will leave in three weeks. If you need anything, you can inform us. Oh, by the way, you can inform Uzukage-sama that we have brought some time for her. The Tsuchikage has been injured by one of our subordinates and will probably not be participating in the war.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at their gobsmacked faces and walked away with a smile on my face.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shiroyasha Uzumaki -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Taking one last look at the letter, she kept it aside and took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it? Is everything alright on their end?” Her husband asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Genshiro has sent an update. Apparently, the little Prince is now an Advanced level Fuinjutsu user… the fastest one to have reached that level. He became one in just three months.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Three months? He became one in three months? I remember it took you…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eleven months but I was fourteen. No excuses though. This boy has been learning about chakra for just a year and a half, not to mention his other talents. Sigh, he would have made a fine shinobi.” She sighed. “If I didn’t have his entire history in my hands, I would have doubted that he wasn’t descended from some Uzukami who had gone outside. This kind of talent is something I would have liked to nurture, even if we didn’t have such an urgent situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“True. Now it seems that him saying that he didn’t want our knowledge was not just big talk.” Her husband said and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“It does put more credibility to his words, yes. The boy was too confident the entire time. Even when I threatened him, he knew he had everything under control. Now I can see why. Did you know that the Tsuchikage has been severely injured and is out of commission? We just got some more time on our hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Injured? Onoki? How?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Attacked by Kazyua Katsuyoshi’s subordinate. If the news is indeed true, then I can see why he was so calm the entire time. Even if we could fight that Eight Gates technique of his, there were other cards in his hands back then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Look at it this way. The better our ally, the better it is for us. Moreover, with Onoki out Iwa will be in chaos. If Konoha can pressure them a bit more, they will have less time to think about us, buying us more time. We need to hasten our preparations to move. How about the expedition sent to verify the map?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have sent our fastest ship but even with that, it will take around a month, so around two weeks more for them to reach there. If they use summons to send the message, we can hope to get a verification sooner.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I would have never imagined a distant continent to be a way for our salvation. Truly, a blind spot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because we didn’t even know it existed. How he knew about it is still unknown. That boy has too many secrets.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who hasn’t? The fact that he was able to keep these secrets till now is the most commendable thing. Have you chosen a candidate to send to him as a concubine?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was thinking of either Rina or Mina. Those sisters are too close to each other and their identities are almost unknown due to them being Anbu members since a young age. They have known him for a while now and can decide among themselves who among them wish to marry him, either one or both.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you didn’t know? Those sisters are very close to each other… <em>very</em> close.” She smirked slyly.</p><p><br></p><p>“My my. Luc… cough cough. That solves a problem on whom to choose then.” He quickly corrected his words on seeing her glare.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I will instruct Genshiro to start teaching him the next level of Fuinjutsu and we can send people to verify the news about Onoki.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it then.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations on passing your examinations, Kazuya-sama.” I smiled as Kasumi congratulated me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I pulled her into my arms and by now she was used to it as she easily settled into my arms and started feeding me.</p><p><br></p><p>Remembering something, I stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess pushing it back will only make it more difficult to disclose it later on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something the matter, Kazuya-sama?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you trust us, Kasumi?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>She answered almost instantly, no hesitation in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are going to tell you something we recently discovered. Just keep calm and listen to us first. Do you understand?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“When our marriage was decided, we investigated your background as normal procedure. You know this already, don’t you?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed her head and nodded, not meeting my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised her head up and made her face me. “Don’t look away. It’s not your fault. Anyways, recently, we have discovered something big… about your mother. What is your mother’s name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My mother… Kureha Miyazaka.” She answered, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “No. Your mother’s name is… Yuka Senju.” I went on to tell her about everything that had happened then.</p><p><br></p><p>She was shocked stiff from the information and I had to pause in between and reassure her in between.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your mother loved you more than anyone else in the world, Kasumi-chan. She went so far as to sacrifice her life so that you could have a good life. So, instead of feeling down, appreciate her sacrifice and become the best you can be. We are sure Yuka-sama would be happy in the Pure World to see you like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I stayed with her for the rest of the day, cancelling my appointments for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time I told her what little I could tell her about her mother.</p><p><br></p><p>I also informed her to never disclose this information to anyone or it might endanger us both.</p><p><br></p><p>People might come for her and the Stairs Daimyo might even try to execute her.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy was actually petty enough to do so too.</p><p><br></p><p>She did speak when she collected herself. “Do you…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the daughter of… I… am not the princess… I am not worthy of…” She started to speak but I put a finger on her lips and stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be enough. We want to marry you because of who you are, not because of who your parents were. So never… ever bring this thought to your mind. That’s an order. You belong to us and we forbid you from ever having such inane thoughts ever again. Do you understand, Kasumi?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-yes.” She nodded with tears in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I wiped her tears off gently and lifted her face, pulling her in for a light kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>Our lips touched and her eyes widened but she didn’t pull back and I slowly increased the force, taking her lips into mine.</p><p><br></p><p>She obviously had no experience so she accepted my advances, melting into my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t push her further. This much was enough to reassure her.</p><p><br></p><p>That night, I didn’t go back to my room and stayed with her.</p><p><br></p><p>I even told her about the actual plan of the Stairs Daimyo and the Medicine Daimyo after our marriage and saw her face go pale.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the night, she was completely up to the latest news in the Land and on board with my plan.</p><p><br></p><p>The Stairs Daimyo and his family hadn’t treated her well and she had opened up to me that she actually felt that she was cursed, as the Daimyo called it, the one responsible for the death of her own father. It’s one of the reasons why she quietly accepted everything. Now, this new information had completely disillusioned her about that family.</p><p><br></p><p>“Isn’t that good? You will be taking my name soon enough so you don’t need to worry about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>By the time this is done, the Stairs Daimyo will rue the day he put his eyes on my land.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ruling by the Book’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plans are progressing further.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Toji is always the wild card we can trust to do the unexpected.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We got a new healer and Kazuya is getting closer to both Kasumi and Kanae.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

Did she just say?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the group once more. This time I used Scan on them.</p><p><br></p><p>[Lily Moon]</p><p><br></p><p>[Aurelia]</p><p><br></p><p>[Bina Lessthan]</p><p><br></p><p>[White Rose]</p><p><br></p><p>[Muyuki]</p><p><br></p><p>All of them were early or mid T3.</p><p><br></p><p>“Which one?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She pointed at the second girl from the right.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas, we need to save her. At any cost.” She said, looking dead serious. By now, the rest of our group had also sensed something odd about the situation and looked at us.</p><p><br></p><p>“The second girl from the right is Veena’s family member.” I said, shocking everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe was the one who broke out of the stunned state first and took charge. “How much do we have left? Around eighty thousand? How much do you two have?” He asked the two new members.</p><p><br></p><p>“A hundred and twenty thousand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Seventy five thousand.”</p><p><br></p><p>Our personal funds would make twenty five thousand at best.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two hundred and seventy five thousand then. Let’s hope we can bet on them for that price. How much do the usual bids go for anyways?” He asked, uncomfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr Damon, how high do the bids go for these kinds of people?” I asked, looking at the Mafia Boss.</p><p><br></p><p>He had a stoic mask on his face. “Anything from two hundred thousand to a million. It depends on the merchandise and if they catch the eye of anyone. It’s mostly a matter of luck.”</p><p><br></p><p>Luck… with just one hundred thousand margin, is relying too much on luck.</p><p><br></p><p>The first girl was sent forward and the bidding started. It was an NPC so we didn’t pay attention to her and quickly thought of any countermeasures.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say, would the auction house accept new items? Skill Books or such for sale?” I asked Damon.</p><p><br></p><p>“For the next Auction. There is just no way they would stop the auction for a few skill books. They do however keep advance items with their guarantee for the next auction.” He shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>There goes that plan.</p><p><br>Dammit, they should have distributed an itinerary for everyone to plan ahead. We could have saved enough money then. Now…</p><p><br></p><p>While we were running around, the auction for the girl was over.</p><p><br></p><p>Three hundred thousand…</p><p><br></p><p>The highest bid was three hundred thousand for her.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a total of twelve girls, five players among them.</p><p><br></p><p>Three million six hundred thousand for all and one million five hundred thousand for players. Three hundred at the base of Grayfia alone.</p><p><br></p><p>“What will happen to them when they are sold? Is there any way we can buy from the one who purchases them…?” Veena asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s highly unlikely that the buyer would sell them. The ones who come to participate in these auctions are… not the best sort if you know what I mean…”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we… save them later on?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you start a fight here, you will die.” The man’s words were straight and without any nonsense. “The only chance you could have is when they leave the island but even then you're bound to fail. First of all, most of these buyers have strong body guards, a team of T5 or even T6. And if you, by some miracle win,Every slave is bound by a Slave Crest from a distant continent. The owner can make them do anything, even kill themselves. They will need to be transferred to other users.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe we can remove the mark?” Star suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you can get them to T7, then sure. That’s the only known method.” Damon shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, the second npc girl was being bid on and it had reached three hundred and fifty thousand already… dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Damon, can you buy some of our goods? We have some good equipment and skill books which you can sell for a nice profit.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>No one from the team spoke anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, show me the goods.”</p><p><br></p><p>We quickly offered almost everything we had.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seven hundred thousand.” The guy offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s absurd. Just the armour cost over one and a half million and we are adding other unique weapons and skill books worth a million too.” Star retorted angrily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Supply and demand kid, supply and demand. While this equipment might be worth a lot in your Kingdom, it’s slightly above average in others. Your kingdom is known for its medicine, not equipment. And lastly, you need the money urgently. What kind of a businessman would I be if I didn’t take advantage of that?” He smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The third npc was brought on the stage but this time she resisted and was subdued. It caused her injuries and the price for her was reduced.</p><p><br></p><p>After that, they took a small break for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the faces of the girls who looked fearful and Veena who was panicking. Alright, we agree.” I took a deep breath and replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s more like it. Shall we sign a contract first?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Contract?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In Sabaody, words don’t mean anything. They are the most worthless commodity and no one buys them. This is why any transactions we do are done in contracts. A binding contract. The loser faces the same consequences as those girls down there, becoming the slave of the other if they fail.” He said with a smile. “Obviously, if you don’t back down from the deal and complete it, no harm done. After all, a contact only makes things legal. I don’t want Richard to come after me, accusing me of cheating you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Arty…” Star put a hand on my shoulder but I just nodded at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Let’s go and do this contract. Veena, Shiroe, will you guys come with me?” I asked and the two followed while the rest stayed there.</p><p><br></p><p>He led us to a place in the Auction House while explaining everything to us. He entered a room and beckoned us to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damon, need another contract?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. A deal I got my hands on.” He pointed towards us and explained the deal.</p><p><br></p><p>“So just legal documentation. Oh my, is that the Blessed Sun Set? Isn’t that an exclusive of the Holy Knights? Those stuck up bastards use special blessings on them and those enchantments are nigh impossible to copy. You really got yourself a deal this time.” The dealer laughed as Damon smirked once more.</p><p><br></p><p>When the contract was signed, I looked at the contract and Veena rechecked it for any flaws.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there any way to nullify the contract?” I asked, just to be sure. “For example if one side dies?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man laughed. “Hahahaha thinking of killing Damon, are we?” He looked at Damon who was smirking too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just being sure that we won’t be killed to nullify the contact and avoid payment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to worry about that. The Auction House is backed by every native faction of Sabaody and no one messes with it. This is a neutral ground. Even the kings of other countries will think twice before breaking the rules here. Obviously, we cannot guarantee anything happening outside. But still for your information, to nullify a contract, both sides must agree on it and only then can it be nullified.”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew about the no attack zone part already. It was showing in my menu. The part about the contract was helpful. The guy even threw me a parchment with all the rules written about contracts.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.Thank you.” With that I signed the contract too.</p><p><br></p><p>The man finally cast a spell on the piece of paper, sealing the contract.</p><p><br></p><p>With the contract sealed, I felt a tug at my being and a notification appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, the contract is sealed. Anything else, I can do for you?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the money from him and came out and gave it all to Veena. With this we had a million. Hope that will be enough or I will have to resort to desperate means.</p><p><br></p><p>The next round of bidding came and this time again, three girls were on the stage, all NPCs again. Were they going to put three girls on stage at a time?</p><p><br></p><p>We sat in the room quietly, waiting for the bidding to start. The announcer on the stage continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Next, the starting bid will be fifty thousand gold coins. Each increment can only be five thousand and above. Begin.”</p><p><br></p><p>Calls rang throughout the hall.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a message appeared in our guild chat. I read it and I looked at Veena. We shared a look and then looked back at the halls.</p><p><br></p><p>The bids increased one by one before one rang in our room. “Seventy five thousand.”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had bid.</p><p><br></p><p>The call obviously didn’t stop and the price increased to one hundred and eighty thousand when another call came from our room.</p><p><br></p><p>This time it wasn’t Veena however.</p><p><br></p><p>Damon had bid.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at the man and Veena questioned frostily. “What is the meaning of this Mr. Damon?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man had that same annoying smirk on his face. “What else? I am just participating in the auctions. I have a ticket too.”</p><p><br></p><p>We understood what he was doing.</p><p><br></p><p>This bastard was playing with us.</p><p><br></p><p>This is exactly what Veena was telling us in the Guild Message.</p><p><br></p><p>She had expected this could happen and tried to test it out on the NPC. She didn’t lay down the facade and continued bidding. The price increased and obviously our funds were no match for Damon’s and we lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Damon got her for eight hundred and fifty thousand gold coins. The guy looked smugly at us. “Hey, don’t look at me like that. I am permitted to buy merchandise too. Obviously, we are friends so if you lose, you can always buy them from me… for a price of course.”</p><p><br></p><p>We merely glared at the guy while the next girl was on the stage. The bidding started and Veena bid again.</p><p><br></p><p>The smile on Damon’s face froze.</p><p><br></p><p>Not willing to back down he bid again and was baited to bid again.</p><p><br></p><p>Nine hundred and eighty thousand.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had a bad look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when the third time Veena bid that he actually looked angry. The price increased and he still bought her for seven hundred and eighty thousand.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another break. This time I had sent a message to the team and they all sat quietly in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are nine more girls left, Mr. Damon. Do you really want to face that much of a loss?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not face any loss. You will have to pay for everything I spend here, with interest if you want those girls back.” He argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid that’s not going to happen. If we don’t get her, we leave.” I shook my head and stared at him blankly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are bluffing.” He scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>“As much as I hate to say it, I am not. The thing is, you are a guy with no integrity Mr. Damon. What guarantee do we have that I can even get her for that price and you won’t increase the price again, that this won’t become a debt trap? We might get her back and even lose our own freedom. At this point, I have decided to cut my losses.”</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you so surprised? We work as adventurers. Dealing with the loss of comrades is a regular thing for us. Obviously, I will write today's incident down in my memory. Worst case, I can just use the money to place a bounty on your head. Nine girls, at an average of eight hundred thousand will be above seven million gold coins. I am pretty sure that can attract people to aim for your head.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you threatening me?” He scowled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am just telling you what can happen, Mr. Damon. I am not the one who started it. You can either continue the fool’s game or give up and we can both get away from this without any grudge. Obviously, I will not let go of the girl I want so easily so I will put in a last ditch effort for her.”</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out the devil fruit box from my inventory and opened it in front of him. “I wonder if someone will be willing to take this Devil Fruit, the Logia Swamp Swamp Fruit in exchange for the girl I want?”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy’s eyes almost popped out at the sight of the fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked and started leaving the room and he quickly got up and stopped me. “Hold on.”</p><p><br>I narrowed my eyes. “What is the meaning of this Mr. Damon? Are you breaking the rules of the auction house?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. Nothing of that sort. How about I take you up on your offer?” He asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have some nerve asking me this, Mr. Damon. First you took advantage of our situation and gave us dirt cheap prices for our equipment, then you put your nose in, causing trouble for us in trying to get our family member back, even going as far as to blackmail us… and now, you see this Devil Fruit and realise the loss you could face and try to ask me for a deal?” </p><p><br></p><p>“Hey now, no need to get angry, This is Sabaody. If you can’t even handle this much, then you shouldn’t have come here. This is the way things work. I saw an opportunity and I took it. Now, I am offering you a deal. How about it, I will buy all the girls left and add the ones I have already bought, all of this Devil Fruit…”</p><p><br></p><p>“No way. I do not trust you. In fact, I am in a mood to give it to someone else just to spite you.” I replied in my coldest tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on. Don’t be angry.” He tried persuading me again and this time Veena put a hand on my shoulder and then looked at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Add everything you took from us on top of that and we have a deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Veena!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now Arthas, we don’t have time to waste. Don’t let your anger get the best of you.” She said persuasively.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. Listen to the Lady.” The guy quickly said, seeing hope here. “Sure, I will add the equipment.” He quickly added.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked angrily at him for a moment and then took a deep breath. “I want a contract.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Absolutely.” He agreed and almost ran to the same room. I asked Shiroe to wait outside and went with Damon inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“My my, you are having a blast today, aren’t you Damon? What do we have this time?” The same guy from before laughed at Damon but the latter was in no mood to play.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need a contract fast, Krieg.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, such a hurry. Okay, I will get it. So what’s the deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>Damon told him the deal and the guy’s eyes bulged at the sight of the Devil Fruit. “Is that? No way…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just do what you are told, Krieg.” Damon asked impatiently.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy got the message and started making the contract.</p><p><br></p><p>The contract was that he would give me all the nine girls, we mentioned the names to not get confused, as well as the items he had traded from me and I will give him the Devil Fruit. If anyone cannot keep their side of the bargain by the end of the auction, they will be considered as breaking the contract.</p><p><br></p><p>I had truly underestimated the allure of the Devil Fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena looked over the details and we signed the contract. Krieg used his spell again and I felt the tug and got the notification.</p><p><br></p><p>Damon looked ecstatic at this. He quickly hurried and gave me our items back and headed back to the room for the bidding.</p><p><br></p><p>Coincidentally, this group was the group with the rest of the players.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had already messaged us Grayfia’s username.</p><p><br></p><p>Bina Lessthan.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the woman standing there on the stage. Silver hair and red eyes. She was stunning. I can see why she would be such a fan favourite in my previous life.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs Lucifer is a man of taste.</p><p><br></p><p>The bidding went higher without anyone even raising the prices and ended at nine hundred and thirty thousand gold coins.</p><p><br></p><p>The bids went and another girl went for nine hundred thousand gold coins, slightly lower than Bina.</p><p><br></p><p>With a million, we could have bought her but that would have been cutting it too close. Not to mention we couldn’t do anything about the other players.</p><p><br></p><p>The last one didn't go that high but at three hundred thousand only.</p><p><br></p><p>Six more left.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next round, three girls came, two players and one NPC.</p><p><br></p><p>Damon easily bought them. With no one trying to raise the price, they were obtained in three hundred to four hundred thousand gold coins on average.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the last round and before break, I went with Shiroe and had something to eat. I told him to go ahead and collect our purchased Skill Books and arrange for our departure as we will need to leave immediately after this Auction is over. </p><p><br></p><p>The last round began and he looked as confident as ever. That guy was probably using all his sources to keep this bidding in his favour.</p><p><br></p><p>But I wasn’t going to let it go so easily…</p><p><br></p><p>This guy had crossed a line… so he needs to pay…</p><p><br></p><p>When it was time for the second last girl’s bidding, I walked to the balcony of the room, showing myself to the rest of the participants.</p><p><br></p><p>The announcer looked at me. “Yes. Can I do something for you, Sir?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have an announcement to make.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone looked confused and I pulled out the Devil Fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyone who can buy the next girl for me and ensure our safe departure from Sabaody, gets this Logia Type Swamp Swamp Fruit. Thank you very much.”</p><p><br></p><p>… and then there was chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>I came back to the room and Damon looked incensed.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the meaning of this, Arthas!” He shouted loudly at me. “Are you typing to break the contract?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? When did I do that?” I asked him with a smile. “Ah, I understand your confusion. You see, Mr. Damon, when someone I dislike shows me an opening, if I didn’t take full advantage of it… what kind of man would I be?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are breaking the contract with this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh but you will find out that I am not. If you cannot buy the next girl, you are not fulfilling your side of the contract so you will not get the Devil Fruit either. What part of the contract said I cannot prepare for contingencies? The only thing it said was that you would give me the nine girls and I will give you the Devil Fruit by the end of the auction. What I just announced outside doesn’t affect our promise in any way. Oh… but if you fail to get the last girl… I am afraid things will not end well for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before the man could say anything, the announcer started the bidding.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat back and watched calmly as the chaos unfolded before my very eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Bids flew one after another till it finally stopped at a price of twenty eight million.</p><p><br></p><p>Damon went as far as twenty five million, after calling as many favours as he could but even the people he called favours from were bidding and thus he was caught short in the bidding run.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please… please, I can give you anything… just break this contract…” He begged, even getting on his knees.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on now, Mr. Damon. Don’t embarrass me. This is Sabaody. If you can’t even handle this much, then you shouldn’t have come here. This is the way things work. I saw an opportunity and I took it. Since I had to lose the Devil Fruit either way, I’d rather you suffer than if you didn’t. I told you, didn't I… that I have written today’s incident deep in my memories.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man desperately ran out to talk to the buyer, to get him to agree on some settlement but it turned out that the buyer was some other bigshot of Sabaody, a T7 guy who directly ignored him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn Arty… that was savage… not that he didn’t deserve it. You are definitely picking up things from Veena.” Star whispered quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my. I wouldn’t say that. This was all Arthas. People often forget that he is the son of two very prominent business owners. Such manoeuvres are not exactly uncommon in business. One deal can bring a millionaire on the streets. It’s just that in this world, that equates to slavery. Not much different from just a hundred or so years ago in our world.” Veena commented lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She was incensed at the guy too and I was pretty sure she would have found one or other way to ruin that guy if he had succeeded today.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the auction the same tug I had felt at the time of making the contract appeared again and a notification appeared in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Damon, Mafia Lord, was now my slave…</p><p><br></p><p>Everything he owned was now my property, the fact I had been counting on. I had been reading the parchment offered by Krieg and had found this nifty fact. The new owner gets possession of all his assets. </p><p><br></p><p>For all matters and purposes, he was considered dead for the world.</p><p><br></p><p>It was cold but this game was never a warm and cosy place to begin with. Again, it went to show just how much details the Game Master had put into making this place. For all matters and purposes, it was a real world. I couldn’t imagine any game to have these kinds of details… Were these people even npcs?</p><p><br></p><p>Or were they actually other people?</p><p><br></p><p>Times like these made it hard to differentiate between the real world and the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Crime Lord, was the class after the Mafia Lord. The guy who bought the Devil Fruit was a Crime Lord, Derek. He was one of the top smugglers of Sabaody Archipelago. The guy had wanted a Devil Fruit for too long and took the opportunity as soon as the chance appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked and having learned from my mistake once, I directly had an official contract made ensuring our safety till we reached back to our country.</p><p><br></p><p>I wondered how that would even work on this guy who was already a T7, but was assured that the rest of the gangs will maintain the contract so unless he was ready to run away from Sabaody and drop everything here, he wouldn’t come after us. Well, we didn’t have any other options either so we went along with it.</p><p><br></p><p>With that done, I proceeded to the nine girls.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Grayfia Lucifuge -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She waited in the room with the other eight girls… waiting for the person who had bought her… </p><p><br></p><p>Her, Grayfia Lucifuge, the strongest queen of the Underworld, the queen of Lucifer… bought as common goods… a few months ago, even such a thought would have been laughable… and yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything had changed as soon as she had entered this game.</p><p><br></p><p>She had gone from someone who had fought Serafall for the position of the Leviathan to someone who had to avoid wild boars in human forests.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not enough to break her.</p><p><br></p><p>She had fought through the Civil Wars, gone up against monsters and Gods alike. Things like these were not enough to stop her. She could find a way out… and that too if Sirzechs and Ajuka didn’t free them before that.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing them as they did, there was no way they wouldn’t be trying their very best to crack this game and catch the ones responsible. Although, if the agreement was really a soul based contract, then it would be hard.</p><p><br>For this reason, she had started preparing from her side too.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been the first one in her village to get a T2 Class, something which prevented the more… uncouth individuals from targeting her. The place around her was getting crowded so she then moved away from the rest to the nearest town, a port town where she had started working on getting stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>No matter the world, strength was a must.</p><p><br></p><p>Her work paid off and she was the first among the entire group to gain the T3 Class as well. The route she had chosen was the one she was the most familiar with, a Mage and for that she had to become a scholar first.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were going well.</p><p><br></p><p>During her time there, she had met another girl, White Rose, someone who had been trapped inside the game too. They had formed a team as the girl was a Warrior. At the higher level monsters required more players to hunt and she didn’t want to be dragged down by incompetent people. Fortunately, Rose was anything but incompetent. One by one they levelled up, rising beyond other people in the town.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally things were looking better. She had planned her route ahead with the goal of finding Lady Gremory, Rias and the rest of her peerage members inside the game and finding a way out.</p><p><br></p><p>All that was until that… damned world mission.</p><p><br></p><p>Their town was attacked by an armada of pirates and their job was to defend against them till the reinforcements arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately for her, their town failed in the task and was crushed by the pirates. Thousands were killed and captured.</p><p><br></p><p>The most good looking women and stronger men were selected to be sold off as slaves. The only reason she and her team had escaped the fate of being passed around as toys was the fact that it would have reduced the value of the merchandise.</p><p><br></p><p>Many others didn’t have the same privilege, including the rest of her teammates other than Rose.</p><p><br></p><p>This slave mark they had imprinted her with didn’t even allow them to commit suicide to escape their torment. It was probably the first time that she had felt a hint of apprehension but her experience had enabled her to push back her fears and try to find a way out.</p><p><br></p><p>During her time on the ship, she had tried to find out any way to escape but had been unable to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>All she could find out was where they were being taken and for what purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>Standing on stage, being bid upon by the crowd as they tried to undress her with their eyes… it felt disgusting.</p><p><br></p><p>For the second time she had felt fear since entering the game…</p><p><br></p><p>As her bidding completed, she was taken to the room where her new owner would come to collect her. A while later, even Rose was brought to the room. The poor girl was looking shattered. She could understand her thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>While Grayfia had hundreds of years of experience helping her maintain hope, Rose was just a young girl, the same age as Rias. For her to go through all this… it must be like a nightmare.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled the girl in a hug and let her cry.</p><p><br></p><p>At that time, other people who were being auctioned also came inside one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can find a way out of this.” She tried to assure her. “If you lose hope, you will lose everything. We need to survive this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But I… we…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who was the person who got you? Was it the same guy?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She had noticed that one man had been continuously bidding on every girl. She only hoped that he had bid for her too and that they could be together, for Rose and for her own self.</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>This guy had bought everyone in the group.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was thinking of this, the gate opened and the one managing this auction house came in, leading another person behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia took a closer look at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Dark blue coloured hair, golden eyes, dressed in armour, he looked more like a knight or a noble than some old scum she had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a player like them. This knowledge however just confused them even more. His age seemed around the same as Rias, probably a bit older. Then again, she knew better than to judge the book by his cover.</p><p><br></p><p>The auction house manager looked at them. “He is your new master, the one you will be serving your whole life. Be respectful and bow your heads.” He ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>She gritted her teeth but didn’t show her anger on her face and slowly bowed her head, urging Rose to do the same. She needed to understand what kind of person he was before doing anything. Showing resistance now would only be bad, for her and the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you leave us alone for a while?” The man asked the auction house manager who nodded and left the room, leaving them alone, but not before giving him the keys to all the handcuffs.</p><p><br></p><p>The man waited till the door was closed before he came to her directly. She clenched her fist, steeling herself for whatever might come next but contrary to her fears, she felt the handcuffs on her hands being opened and looked up at the guy who went around opening the handcuffs of everyone in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose was shocked too but he simply removed her handcuffs and patted her shoulder. “Are you alright? Don’t worry. You are safe now. We have come to save you.” Rose nodded, tears still streaming from her eyes. “Now now… it’s such a shame to ruin such a pretty face with tear stains.” He offered her a handkerchief and she wiped her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and then looked at her and spoke. “Grayfia Lucifuge.”</p><p><br></p><p>She froze.</p><p><br></p><p>“Follow me. Someone is waiting for you.” He commanded and then looked at the rest. “You all don’t have to worry. We will not harm or mistreat you. Anyone who wants to go free can do so. If you don’t have a place to go then you can stay with us and work for us. As for breaking this Slave Crest, I am afraid that’s something not in our hands yet. When you leave this room however, just maintain silence and follow the instructions to the T. Do not speak until we are away from this island. We are in enemy territory and they are far stronger than us. We cannot afford to mess up. Do I make myself clear?”</p><p><br></p><p>The group quickly nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>As they followed him, hundreds of thoughts ran through her mind. Who was he? How did he know her? What exactly did he want with her?</p><p><br></p><p>She heard Rose’s voice who was looking at her confused. “Bina… what is he talking about?” She whispered. “Who’s Grayfia?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I will explain everything later. Just call me Bina.” She assured and Rose nodded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It felt very awkward walking with the girls following behind me. The Auction House Manager didn’t stop us. Handcuffs or not, they were bound by the Crest. The handcuffs were just… the fetish of some nobles who were into that kind of thing…</p><p><br></p><p>The man had just given me a knowing smile when I had asked about the handcuffs… saying they were on the house.</p><p><br></p><p>He was quite happy as the bids had gone for much more than we expected and all that was thanks to me.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I had to send him out because the look he was giving me and that flattering smile of his only made me disgusted…</p><p><br></p><p>Star met us outside the room with Suikazura-san and Whistler. He took a look at the group behind me and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where’s Veena?” I asked. I wanted to let her be the one to explain things to Grayfia or who knows what she might think…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Veena is waiting in the room with the guy who bought the Devil Fruit, discussing business.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Business?” I asked, confused. What business could we have?</p><p><br></p><p>Star however shook his head. “Seriously that lady… that guy is a T7 Crime Lord. He could swat us away like a fly and she is there… discussing business. Sometimes I wonder if she has a sense of danger or not. But then again, who am I talking to? You practically made a Mafia Boss your bitch coz he was fucking with us.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you dislike it?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah? No way. That guy deserved what came to him. I just wanted to punch his nose in. That’s more my style.” He shrugged lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always do that, you know. I think a Mafia Lord being our Guild’s gatekeeper would be quite good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... remind me never to fuck with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you need me to remind you of that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, I give up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So what business is she doing inside?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damon’s business. You do realise that you own everything he had right? That means everything in Sabaody. Derek is talking about the takeover of those businesses.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” It made sense too. There was no way we could keep the businesses of Damon. At least not with the strength we had. We would be eaten up by other groups within days. It was best to sell them off as soon as we could and who better to sell than Derek.</p><p><br></p><p>For this, Veena was indeed the best person.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the company behind me and then at Star. “Keep them company. I will go inside and take a look.”</p><p><br></p><p>Technically, it was me who owned everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, Veena was sitting across the table from Derek. Shiroe and Elaine standing behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>My entry attracted everyone’s attention and I just nodded at them and sat beside Veena quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I was saying, this is already the most we can offer. We can have a trade agreement if you want. My One Eyed Wolf Gang will provide you security when you are in Sabaody.” Derek added, lighting up his cigar and taking a puff.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a very good offer, Mr. Derek. I am very inclined to take it too. Can I add just one more thing to it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please assure our safe arrival to Lannisport’s town and we have a deal.”</p><p><br>“Hahahahahahaha just that much? I was going to do that either way. Can you imagine if someone sells me a Logia Devil Fruit, new businesses and then gets killed on the way back? That’s bad for the reputation. Everyone will think I was the one who did it to get back the money and while I would love nothing more than to have that money, I mean who wouldn’t.” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously.” Veena agreed with a smile forcing me to control the twitch of my lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s an absolute no no. If that happens, no one will come to sell things to me. What these morons…” He pointed at Damon. “...don’t understand is that losing credibility is the worst thing for business. People already know I am a dangerous guy. What I need now is for them to come to me despite knowing this… and that only happens when you deliver what you promise. If you fuck with the ones you do business, no one will do business with you. That’s not something we want. I can send a dozen of my finest men… with a binding contract to drop you off to your home if you agree with that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena and I shared a look with each other and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“We would appreciate that.” I nodded to the proposal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then let’s go and draft that contract right away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” I got up and Veena was about to follow me but I told her to wait.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is waiting outside. Meet her and explain everything to them. Shiroe and I will go and get the contract. You can catch up with us and check it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena nodded and we left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Star was standing outside with the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Derek looked at the nine girls and then smiled at me. “Good taste.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Even with my twitching lips I thanked him and looked at Star. “Take them inside.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Veena -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She waited in the room as the door opened and Star entered followed by Grayfia who froze at the sight of her. She quickly went ahead and pulled the girl into a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright? ”</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lady…” Grayfia was still in disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s me. You are fine right? They didn’t do anything?…” She asked, leaving the words unsaid.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am fine. They didn’t… want to harm the merchandise.” She said with distaste, making her narrow her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am so sorry for dragging you into this game. If not for me then… ”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no… you couldn’t have known that this would happen. And Ojou-sama is also stuck inside with her peerage members. I am just disappointed that I couldn’t help more and you had to save me…”</p><p><br>“Oh lay aside the apologies. Also, call me Veena and I will call you Bina. Sit here. Did you guys have anything to eat?” She asked her and the others behind.</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” Grayfia hesitated but then looked behind her, specifically at a girl behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well then, come here and have something to eat first. I have to go and check up on Arthas to get our escape from here finalised. We can talk when we are on the ship.” She took out several food items from her inventory and placed them on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that Grayfia was safe, one of her biggest burdens was lightened.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t know what she would have done if she had been sold off to someone else today… she would probably have felt guilty about it her entire life.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, all she could hope for was that Rias and her peerage members were safe wherever they were and that they could reunite soon. This incident had also increased her worries about her daughter’s life.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas and her team members had come out and helped her without holding back. It warmed her heart that they were willing to go so far for her even after only knowing her for such a short period of time. Arthas she could understand and even Shiroe to some extent. But even Star and the new members had all supported her unconditionally today.</p><p><br></p><p>She will have to do something for them. Especially Arthas… yes. She will definitely have to reward him well… and she knew just the way to do so too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Please… I am sorry. I will give you everything I have. Please just let me go…” The filth in front of her begged as he tried to crawl away from her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… sure. Give me everything and I will consider letting you go.” She replied coldly.</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked like he had just gotten his life back and soon unloaded most of his inventory in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Mostly potions and medicines. There was even poison, many different kinds of poisons in fact.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that was gold and equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>She stored everything in her inventory and then narrowed her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this all you have?” She asked, her tone daring him to lie.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Yes, this is everything I have.” He quickly nodded, trying to convince her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… but from what I know you had just swindled a kid a few days ago. The amount you got from him must be… five times this amount.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the scum who had scammed Gasper, taking away all his months of earnings and then selling him overpriced health potions forcing him to keep feeding her potions while she was poisoned. That part which made her angrier was that among the potions that he had offered her… there were dozens of the antidotes she needed to remove that poison. This bastard had them all along and he still forced Gaspy to buy that crap, forcing her to bear the pain of poison for three whole days…</p><p><br></p><p>Gaspy had forced himself to face his worst fears for her and this…. filthy cretin…</p><p><br></p><p>There was a good chance that she could have died. That would have meant that Shirone would be stuck inside this game alone… Gaspy would be even worse. The boy had no one except her. She had brought him with her to this town and if she were to die… he would probably shut himself in or do something… even worse.</p><p><br></p><p>And for what… just a few coins…</p><p><br></p><p>She had obviously tracked him down in less than a day, getting drunk and spending the money he had swindled from Gaspy. Over the next two days, she investigated him, gathering everything she could about him. </p><p><br></p><p>Gaspy was apparently not his first time swindling someone.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, three people who had gone out hunting with him had not returned. Only he had returned with destroyed clothes, always claiming to have narrowly escaped death from some monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>After the third time, even other people were wary of him so he switched classes and became a Herbalist and started this business of swindling people.</p><p><br></p><p>Seducing him when he was drunk and bringing him outside the town’s safe area was easy and even easier was to use paralysing poison on him and beat him up to the inch of his life. And that’s how they were here. Even if he could use his inventory, he couldn’t use any potions until his paralysis was over. She then cuffed him to a rock in the middle of the forest so that he couldn’t run away if he got the chance.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see that you are lying to me. Suddenly I don’t feel like letting you leave anymore.” She narrowed her eyes again and lifted her knife.</p><p><br></p><p>“No No… I am not, I… I will give you everything. Here… here take everything. This is everything I have. I promise… really…” He quickly brought out the rest of the goods and handed it to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She checked and found that the money was actually more than he had taken from Gaspy. There was even equipment for other classes and items.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking one more look at him, she slashed down, taking a massive chunk of his health out.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I just clarified to you that I don’t like it when people lie to me.” One more slash. “You are truly challenging my patience, something I don’t have much of.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I really… really don’t have anything more.”</p><p><br></p><p>She slashed down again but this time she didn’t stop and kept slashing down.</p><p><br></p><p>When his health was in the red, he shouted again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please… please wait… I… I won’t lie again…” He dropped everything from his inventory, or at least she thought he did because this was almost double of what he had given her till now.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way he was earning this all by himself…</p><p><br></p><p>With a wave of her hand she stored everything in her inventory and looked at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I have really given you everything… now please… please let me go…” He begged. She brought out the poison from her inventory and dripped some on his wound. The guy’s eyes widened as he realised what had just happened.</p><p><br></p><p>She then pulled out the bunch of health potions from her inventory and placed them in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really sorry about that. My hand slipped. Here, if you keep drinking this potion, you can keep healing and the status will disappear in three days. I know… after all, my kid brother had to feed me the same potions for three days.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face morphed into that of horror as he realised who she was.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, I have heard that if you punch the cuffs a thousand times, with all your strength, the durability goes down by one percent. So all you need is a hundred thousand punches and it might actually break. Just be sure to keep your voice down. There can be wild animals around and it wouldn’t be good if you get found out.”</p><p><br></p><p>She then ignored him and left… but not before dropping a pouch of monster bait on the road.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh… she should have informed him that the cuffs she was talking about were of lower quality than these ones. The ones she used on him were reforged by Gaspy and could take a dozen times more beating.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rossweisse -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Just how did she get stuck in this place?</p><p><br></p><p>It was all the fault of that bitch Sangrdrifa.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, she shouldn’t have accepted their taunts and taken the bait.</p><p><br></p><p>A place where you can meet boys… even someone like you could find a boyfriend here… then again, that might be impossible for the eternal single valkyrie.</p><p><br></p><p>She really shouldn’t have fallen for their provocations.</p><p><br></p><p>They were obviously just taunting her so that she would be busy in the game and do bad at her job but for once… just that once, she had fallen for it… and it had cost her everything… well almost…</p><p><br></p><p>Rossweisse was stunned on hearing that they were trapped inside the game but at first she thought it was some kind of prank. It wouldn’t be the first she had faced.</p><p><br></p><p>Being the youngest of the group with a position as high as hers had earned her the ire of many of her coworkers… something she couldn’t understand for the life of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Odin was an unrepentant leacher. The pay was bad. The work environment was bad. Even the coworkers were bad.</p><p><br>Why would someone envy her for such a life?</p><p><br></p><p>But logic was a rare commodity in Asgard where people preferred using their fists more instead, so she could understand their foolishness…</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, this time it was not one of their pranks. It was real. She had really been trapped inside this game and now had no way to go outside other than… possibly completing it.</p><p><br></p><p>When the realisation dawned on her, she got to work immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Collecting information, planning a strategy and finally taking action.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything she had learned since childhood had helped her get ahead of any normal players in the game, reaching a T3 Class at a very quick pace.</p><p><br></p><p>She was lucky to encounter Bina in the town and form a team with her.</p><p><br></p><p>A Warrior and a Mage was a good combination and Bina was very good at what she did too.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the other team members she found here… were far better than her actual colleagues. If it wasn’t a life or death situation, she might have genuinely enjoyed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately it seemed that things never went too well for her.</p><p><br></p><p>It was all that damned World Quest.</p><p><br></p><p>She still had nightmares of that day when pirates had razed the town to the ground, killing, plundering and kidnapping people left and right.</p><p><br></p><p>Even her teammates had met the same fate with Bina as the only other survivor other than her.</p><p><br></p><p>And then she found that she was going to be sold… like trophies in the olden days…</p><p><br></p><p>She knew what vikings did with the women they captured… and that thought scared her. All her hopes were crushed when the bid on her name was finalised and she was sold off to some unknown person… but when all seemed hopeless… he came…</p><p><br></p><p>Blue hair, golden eyes, dressed in a golden armour like a warrior from the best among Asgard’s warriors… although much more courteous than them. She held the handkerchief in her hand as she remembered his actions…</p><p><br></p><p>And then came the huge revelations.</p><p><br></p><p>He had come to free them. He was a friend… or at least knew Bina… or rather Grayfia Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>Rossweisse obviously knew that name.</p><p><br></p><p>As a part of Odin’s bodyguards, it was her duty to know the names of important people in all factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia Lucifuge was the queen of Lucifer, the Strongest Queen of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Was Bina that Grayfia?</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t believed it at first but when they met another woman, and she heard bits of their conversation, the dots connected. She really was that Grayfia… and that woman… who exactly was she?</p><p><br></p><p>And who was the guy who saved them?</p><p><br></p><p>But this identity just raised as many questions as it answered.</p><p><br></p><p>What was the rest of the Supernatural World doing if even such a person was trapped inside for so long?</p><p><br></p><p>Now she was waiting for her explanation when they left this place.</p><p><br></p><p>But one thing was for sure… her life was not going to be the same after today…</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So we got the maid… and a surprise bonus too.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hope you guys liked the plan with Damon.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Also Kuroka is a protective and vengeful kitty.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

It was actually a massive mangrove forest growing out from the middle of the ocean with each tree of the forest serving as an island on which people live.</p><p><br></p><p>“Beautiful, isn’t it?” The captain asked as he got down near us.</p><p><br></p><p>“The whole island is actually a mangrove forest. It’s made up of seventy nine Yarukiman Mangrove trees. The Yarukiman Mangrove trees are the largest mangroves in the world and are strong enough to grow from the bottom of the ocean to the top.Each tree is called a grove and serves as an island for which people live on. People can get from one grove to another via the various bridges built connecting around the many tree roots.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s indeed beautiful. I would love to visit a place like this during the holidays.” Veena said and it was actually that beautiful. I would agree with her too had I not known about what kind of place this island was.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, the captain informed everyone in my stead. “I’d hate to disappoint you Miss but this place is not suitable for spending holidays, especially areas one to twenty nine. Always stay in a group when you are there. The best way to look around while being protected is to get the protection of some gang in these islands. You know what? Here, take this. It will help you out.” The man gave us a map of the island describing where everything was.</p><p><br></p><p>Richard had told us about the places we had to visit but the map had more details. I took a brief look at the man and checked the place we had to visit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Auction House was in Grove number one.</p><p><br></p><p>We need to register there first before we can go to the hotel area which was from grove number seventy to seventy nine.</p><p><br></p><p>I also needed to search for Shakky’s Rip Off Bar and see if I can get any achievements here.</p><p><br></p><p>Grove number forty to forty nine was a tourist area and the place where most of the shops were. We needed to check those places too. There could be some good things for sale there. So much to do in such a short time.</p><p><br></p><p>The captain went with his crew and we left our own way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s meet Richard’s contact in the Hotel Area and get a place to stay first. We can plan our visit there. The captain did tell us not to move alone. It’s better to stick around for now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what we did. We were in Grove number fifty three. Grove number fifty to fifty nine was the shipping area and sixty to sixty nine was the residential area for the locals.</p><p><br></p><p>We moved towards the Hotel Area first. Each grove was separate and was connected by bridges built around the ginormous tree roots.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bubble service, bubble service!” A man was shouting, making us look at him.</p><p><br></p><p>We saw a person go to him with several large bags and pay him some money.  The man then pulled out what looked like a horn, dipped it in a bucket and blew out a huge bubble around the bags. To the surprise of my group, the bubble floated, carrying the goods in the air. He quickly tied a rope around the goods and handed it to the person who carried everything like a balloon.</p><p><br></p><p>I had hazy memories of seeing this in the anime in my past life but man if that wasn’t weird… and amazing to see it in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Similarly, we saw another person riding on what looked like a jet ski, only this one had a bubble under it and floated slightly above the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>On asking around, we found out that the island offered the Bubble Taxi, the name of those jet ski, for rent to the tourists.</p><p><br></p><p>Since they needed the bubbles to function which can only be made by the fresh resin of these mangroves, they couldn’t be used outside and there was no use in stealing them. Moreover, there was no doubt that they didn’t have some kind of backup.</p><p><br></p><p>Remembering what little I could about this place, I wouldn’t doubt if there was a bomb inside those bikes which would be set off should they be taken away from the archipelago. The more I thought about it, the more likely it seemed too.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. No need to worry about it.</p><p><br></p><p>We were not trying to steal anything. We decided to travel by foot to enjoy the view.</p><p><br></p><p>It took us around an hour to reach the hotel area. Along the way, I checked several people. T5 were quite common in this place. There were several T6 too.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it was understandable or else there was no way an island like this would have remained independent despite being in the middle of so many kingdoms and with so many pirates roaming around the area. The island must have the backing of some very strong people, probably not a T8 but at least a group of T7 for it to remain standing till now.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the place mentioned by Richard.</p><p><br></p><p>Lion’s Brew, a pub with a hotel attached to it. The owner was someone from our kingdom and did business with Richard.</p><p><br></p><p>We entered and asked for Richard’s associate at the reception table.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, I am Baron Arthas from the Utrudragon Empire. I was sent here by Richard Clyde of the Dolphin’s Song Trading Agency looking for one Damon Artwick. I handed him the recommendation letter from Richard.” I showed him my baron badge and the man nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please wait in the reception for a while. I will send a message to the boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>We waited for fifteen minutes and were escorted inside by an attendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Damon Artwick was a fierce looking man.</p><p><br></p><p>He was built like a tank, had short blonde hair but his most prominent feature was probably the scar running from his right left cheek to his left jaw.</p><p><br></p><p>A simple scan at him showed his Class to be a Mafia Boss, a T6 Class.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn…</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to Sabaody Archipelago, Baron Arthas. Richard has mentioned that you were looking to participate in the monthly auctions. How many seats do you need?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Five.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… five will be a bit hard but not impossible. Normally the reservations are completed in advance. The reason Richard sent you here was because we usually keep some seats with us. The cost will obviously be a bit higher but your security will be assured by us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How much?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since this is your first time with us and you were referred by Richard, we won’t charge you for the usual rate. Six hundred and twenty five gold coins per person.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Will there be any more charges?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I can agree with that rate.” I nodded and he pulled five tickets and five badges from his drawer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here you go. My attendant will take you to the Auction House on the day of the auction. You will be staying here, correct?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then keep those badges on your body. That’s the mark of my Lion’s Brew Gang. It means that you are under the protection of the Lion’s Brew Gang. Just don’t pick fights and no one will bother you either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank yo…”</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be a hundred and twenty five gold more.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>We took three rooms and I understood why Sabaody was running so well.</p><p><br></p><p>The price of hotels was one hundred times more than what we had in Llyne.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I knew it would be expensive but a hundred times was too much. We didn’t argue. Richard had told us how to behave here and getting on the wrong side of a guy like Damon in a place like this would be stupid as fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>We did however take only two rooms. One for the guys and one for the ladies. Unfortunately that meant I couldn’t sneak into Veena’s room for the duration of the trip. Everyone agreed with the arrangement so there was nothing I could do.</p><p><br></p><p>“If I knew the cost of food was this much, I would have had some packed over from Lannisport. This is just daylight robbery.” Star said as he looked at the menu.</p><p><br></p><p>“At least now we know why mostly nobles, rich merchants and pirates come to this place. Normal people would never be able to stay here for so long.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what’s the plan now? We even got the tickets for the Auction here. We have some extra time on our hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can explore the shopping area. Richard did say they had many unique things out here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Let’s do that then.”</p><p><br></p><p>We had the entire day in our hands and it would be a massive waste to just sit in our room and wait.</p><p><br></p><p>The market area was very different from what we had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>I was expecting thieves and pirates all around but it was quite peaceful… or at least it looked peaceful…</p><p><br></p><p>There were all kinds of things for sale. Food, clothes, jewellery, weapons and armour, anything we could look for.</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to check the medicine shops. Veena wanted to see if they had any rare recipes there, although we didn’t expect much as our Kingdom was the leading supplier of medicines but who knows? There are items from other countries and even different continents so we could be in luck and find something good.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead to check out some antique shops. I needed some time alone to make an excuse about the <strong>Map of All Treasures</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine followed Veena and Shiroe and Star went to the weapon shop.</p><p><br></p><p>After an hour of running around, I came to the conclusion that the antique shops were complete shams. They were just ripping off people for fake, subpar goods.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, I had no idea what a wind chime or ancient vase would be helpful for.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say, do you know of a place called Shakky’s Rip Off Bar? Give me the address and this is yours.” I showed him ten gold coins.</p><p><br></p><p>The man actually stepped back at the name. “I… I don’t know what you are talking about.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I added ten more. He swallowed but didn’t break.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if you don’t want free money then it’s not my problem.” I picked up all the coins and turned to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fifty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fifty coins and I can tell you where the place is but no one should know I told you the address.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thirty five.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Forty and no less.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>I threw the coins to him and got the address.</p><p><br></p><p>Grove number thirteen.</p><p><br></p><p>It was in the first twenty nine groves, the one which the Captain had told us to stay away from.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to find an opportunity to go there later on.</p><p><br></p><p>With nothing else to do, I returned and found Shiroe and Star first.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was your side of things?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Better than I could have expected. There was a quest at the antique shop. We will need to go to Grove number thirteen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. What’s the reward?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The man said it was some old treasure map. We just need to find a guy who coats ships there. I don’t know what that even means. I personally think the guy was scamming me but I got a quest so it would be a waste not to try.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. It’s not like we have much to do here.” Star agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go there tomorrow then. By the way, did you guys find anything good?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh the weapons here are all high quality. There were weapons for T5 and some even for T6 but the price…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Too much eh… Well, we are mostly all T4 and might reach T5 in a while so there is no need to hurry. By the time everyone of us is T5, we will have enough to get the weapons sold here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know but… you should have seen the stats on those weapons. They even had guns. Old fashioned but still guns. Man… I missed the feel of those babies.” Star said with a longing look.</p><p><br></p><p>In our time together, we had come to know of his obsessions with blades and especially guns.</p><p><br></p><p>“What Class do you need to use those?” I asked, curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“None, I could use them right now but hey, I can still keep one for my personal amusement.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always get one if we have leftover money when going back. How much did it cost?” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“One hundred and fifty thousand…”</p><p><br></p><p>Damn…</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably the next time we visit then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. It’s a bit too much for now. Either way, it was a T5 Weapon.”</p><p><br></p><p>We roamed around talking about random topics like these when we found Veena and Elaine.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t have any luck with the medicine recipes either.</p><p><br></p><p>Since none of us got anything, we decided to visit the Tourist Area, the Entertainment Sector to have some fun.</p><p><br></p><p>The entertainment sector had many attractions. From a theme part to casinos for people to gamble. There were even places where we could play games and win prizes.</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to visit one such place on Star’s insistence. The reason for his insistence was the game itself.</p><p><br></p><p>A shooting game.</p><p><br></p><p>His name Shooting Star was well deserved.</p><p><br></p><p>The funny thing was that the guy had legally changed his name to that back in the real world too, something he confessed when drunk once.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he using his real name in the game or his in-game name in the real world?</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t know… what we did know was that this was just another fact which showed his obsession with guns.</p><p><br></p><p>We let him do what he wanted, actually buying popcorn and sitting back to watch his performance. He didn’t disappoint either.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop had different levels for the games, each level having different prices for the tries. Star went and cleared till the fifth level and won himself a skill book and… a gun. Seriously, what kind of luck was that?</p><p><br></p><p>All it took was 1000 Gold for that.</p><p><br></p><p>“You weren’t bragging. You really are skilled with a gun.” Shiroe said as we met the guy after the game.</p><p><br></p><p>“Told you, didn’t I?” He said, still playing with his new guy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a flintlock pistol.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing would have cost at least seventy five thousand outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously the first thing which came to our mind was to make easy money from this unfortunately, there was no glitch there. A player could only win once a month after which they were forbidden from participating for the rest of the month.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the higher levels. Star’s level didn’t meet the requirements.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing one of us winning, the rest of us were hyped up too and participated in different types of games too. We decided to only use a thousand gold coins for each person to not gamble away all our money.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried one with a bow and arrow and got to the fourth round although I didn’t win. I hadn’t spent that much time with a bow and arrow recently so my skill levels were still low.</p><p><br></p><p>I did get some common stuff though.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe and the ladies however decided to gamble in the casino instead.</p><p><br></p><p>Funny enough, that stint got them a new Class unlocked.</p><p><br></p><p>Gambler.</p><p><br></p><p>Gambler needs one win at any casino to be unlocked.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a T3 Class. Nothing special in terms of fighting, mainly a sneak attacker. There was however a special thing in Gambler which other classes didn’t have.</p><p><br></p><p>A Special Stat increase per level.</p><p><br></p><p>Gambler gave +3 to LCK per level which was a stat we had received at random when the game started.</p><p><br></p><p>The Luck Stat was assigned randomly between one and a hundred when the character was created.</p><p><br></p><p>After that, there had been no way to increase LCK except for some one time consumable items like Four Leaved Clovers or Rabbit’s Foot which had an abysmal chance of dropping.</p><p><br></p><p>This stat determined the Critical Hit Rate as well as Drops to a certain extent. The drop rate depended on whoever made the last hit. There was also a rumour that this stat increased the rate of random quest encounters.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say, we all played one after the other to get the class.</p><p><br></p><p>This class was the same as any production class. Instead of just fighting, one could gamble at any game established location to gain experience. The Exp gain was more if they won and less if they lost, depending on the money consumed, so in theory, one could get from Level 1 to Level 30 in minutes as long as they had enough money to spend. Unfortunately, that amount would be mind boggling.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was fun. It’s been a long time since I last gambled. Glad to see that my skills haven’t gotten rusty yet.” Veena said happily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Easy for you to say Miss Veena. You won sixteen thousand. I lost five. I don’t feel so good.” Star sighed. “Seriously, you all have incredible poker faces. Arty is a natural. Elaine doesn’t even flinch if somewhere were to drop a bomb beside her and Shiroe, well, he’s Shiroe. I am the only one who sucks at gambling.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Our group managed to make more money than we spent. That’s already better than I had expected.” I shrugged. We made a total of thirty two thousand gold… even after excluding the money Star lost. Veena won sixteen thousand alone.</p><p><br></p><p>No surprises there. She had centuries of experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I had played when I went to parties with my mom and I could keep one hell of a poker face due to my condition. Elaine on the other hand had her maid training to keep that stoic look on.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say Star was bad… he was just not lucky. He had a luck stat of 15 while the lowest among the rest was Elaine with 33.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, you won the shooting game. Even Arty couldn’t get that high of a score. We all have our specialities I guess? By the way, what Skill Book did you win?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, something called Soru or something. I didn’t check. Hold on a moment.” He brought out the skill book from his inventory and checked. “Yeah, Soru. It’s a movement technique. Not exactly my type of Skill. Are any of you interested?”</p><p><br></p><p>Soru? Movement Skill?</p><p><br></p><p>Is it the Six Styles of Marine Skill?</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t have any good movement skills. Will be useful for me.” The only way I could move at high speeds right now was using Hiten Mitsurugi skills and all of them were attack skills. None of them were pure movement skills.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still scared by that Rhino last time.” Star smirked as he threw the book to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, don’t you remember the size of that monster? Its horn was the size of my body and my attacks barely worked on it. Obviously I was scared.” It was the single scariest experience of my entire life.</p><p><br></p><p>I used the Skill Book and the details appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Soru [Level 1/100] [Exp: 0/200]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>One of the Six Techniques of Rokushiki which grants the user superhuman speed.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Covers a distance of up to five metres at 250% speed.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cooldown: 2 mins</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Distance increases by 0.1 metre, speed increases by 5% and cool down decreases by 1 second per level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: This Skill is the part of a set six skills called the Rokushiki. Skills of this set can be combined and used together.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Holy crap, that’s amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>Does that mean I can learn and combine other skills too?</p><p><br></p><p>We reached our hotel by the time it was dark outside and went to have dinner first.</p><p><br></p><p>Our group sat on one of the tables and ordered while deciding what to do tomorrow. The Auction was the day after tomorrow. I told them that I would do a quest.</p><p><br></p><p>Star wanted to try raising some luck which meant he was probably going to gamble. Veena and Elaine decided to watch over him so that he didn’t lose too much. That meant Shiroe and I would be searching for Shakky’s Ripoff Bar tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>As we were having dinner Shiroe sometimes kept looking behind me, a slight look showed that he was looking at two other players, a guy and a woman.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had a medium build and looked around my age. The funny thing about him was his style. He styled himself after the Three Musketeers, donning a red cavalier hat with a plume, leather armour, tabard, and wearing a rapier at his waist. He looked like he was straight out of the three musketeers story.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman on the other hand, had a buxom figure, wore her chestnut-coloured hair in a ponytail, donned crimson-red armour, and used a spear as her weapon. She looked to be in her twenties.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was humming a tune while the woman was casually drinking beer.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly got a message from Shiroe and looked at him oddly.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Can you check the user ids of those two players?’</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>The lady was called Suikazura, a Knight and the guy was named Whistler, a bard. Shiroe’s eyes widened as he read the name and he excused himself before getting up.</p><p><br></p><p>We all looked at him as he walked to that table and started talking with the two and within seconds he was fistbumping with the guy and greeting the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“They seem to know each other.” Star said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe pointed towards our table and invited them to sit with us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Guys, these are my friends from Elder Tales. She is Suikazura-san and he is Whistler. They were two of the best players I knew from the game. We have gone on many difficult quests together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, come on, join us. There is more than enough room here.” We welcomed the group. Shiroe talked with them and we found out that they had come here on a whim. Suikazura-san wanted to have to go to the beach while Whistler wanted to see pirates to see if they had any new songs for him to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>Whistler was a happy go lucky type of a guy who was always in his own mood.</p><p><br></p><p>Suikazura-san on the other hand was a calm person who didn’t speak much and preferred to listen quietly. She was a housewife, three years into her marriage. She was from a well to do family, with her husband owning a business of his own and was mostly away due to that. She started playing games to stave off her loneliness.</p><p><br></p><p>From what Shiroe told us about her, she was known as the strongest housewife in Elder Tales, very amiable usually but merciless in battle and was a member of the Tea Party.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why don’t you two join our guild if you are not in one yet?” Shiroe invited.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you joined a guild? I thought you didn’t like being in one.” Whistler asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… well, this is a guild we started and you know, things are different here. We need every advantage we can get.” Shiroe said, scratching his cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, Shiroe was a loner? He doesn’t seem like that.” Star asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not to say he was a loner. He just didn’t like the strict rules most top level guilds had. I could understand that. Those people were utter hardasses.” Whistler said. “Shiroe was in fact invited by many guilds. He just didn’t join or stay in any for a long period of time. By the way, what’s your Guild Name?” He asked, as he took a sip of his drink.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fairy Tail.” I replied, making the guy choke on his drink and look at us incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the woman was looking at us the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Arthas here is the Guild Master.” Shiroe explained. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any empty slots in the Guild right now, five being sold to Gareth’s group and one for Elaine.</p><p><br></p><p>Although the progress for the next level had reached 38% so we would be getting more slots in about two to three weeks at best.</p><p><br></p><p>They decided to join us for now and would be added to the guild when the guild levels up.</p><p><br></p><p>We will need to keep twenty slots on the side next time for such cases. What if we found a friend or family member in the future?</p><p><br></p><p>We had to purchase two more tickets for them to attend the auction. They joined us to share the rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The next day, our whole group went towards the Shakky’s Rip Off bar in Grove number thirteen.</p><p><br></p><p>The disturbing thing was that as soon as we entered the Grove number twenty nine, it showed we had left the safe zone.</p><p><br></p><p>This fucking town was a dungeon of sorts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be careful. We could be attacked.”</p><p><br></p><p>And we were indeed attacked by a group of pirates as soon as we reached Grove number twenty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fifteen enemies, take positions.” Shiroe took command immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the lead, summoning my Blessed Sun Set and standing in front of the group. To my surprise, unlike usual, two more people stood by my side.</p><p><br></p><p>Suikazura-san and Whistler stood on either side of me.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a shield in one hand and a spear in another while he had drawn his rapier and… started whistling.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I soon understood the reason.</p><p><br></p><p>March of the Brave, a buff appeared on my status. A five percent increase in stats. This is amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>The pirates ran our way, weapons drawn and Veena quickly used an Ice Wall between us while Shiroe used the Mist Spell on their ranged fighters.</p><p><br></p><p>I kicked the ground and shot towards the group, receiving one of their attacks head on. The enemy was actually a T5 Pirate Captain with a scimitar.</p><p><br></p><p>I tilted the shield to the side and let the weapon slide to the side, disturbing his balance and going for a kick at his leg.</p><p><br></p><p>The man lost his balance and tried to get it back. I used this chance to use Double Slash and Holy Blade, chaining the skills with my attacks, finally finishing it with a Knight’s Charge, sending him flying towards a distance at two other pirates.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost at the same time two large fireballs fell at the place they had crashed and an arrow passed by my head, hitting another pirate who was trying to attack me from the flank, right in the eye.</p><p><br></p><p>The pirate held his eye but at the same time, his heart was pierced by a spear and he was lifted in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oryaaaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>In front of my shocked gaze, Suikazura-san lifted the guy in the air and spun around before throwing him to the group of pirates…</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe wasn’t kidding when he said she was merciless in battles.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stand back either.</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t let the newcomers steal all the limelight after all.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a stance with my sword.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū, Ryūtsuisen.”</p><p><br></p><p>I jumped at the enemy she had sent flying and slashed downward, separating his head from his body in one attack. Without rest, I used my next skill.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ryūkansen.”</p><p><br></p><p>Using one foot as a pivot, I spun around, in the middle of the group sending a three sixty degrees slash at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally using the opening to use Soru and attacking the Pirate Captain who was currently tied by Shiroe’s Thorn Bind Hostage. </p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, this was my favourite combo with Shiroe. I could attack anyway I wanted. And this time, with both my sides covered by two people, I could have some leeway too.</p><p><br></p><p>The Pirate Captain couldn’t attack but the guy suddenly shouted, using some kind of buff and suddenly the attacks from the pirates became stronger. Two pirates came in front of him to assist their captain. I used Limitless to ignore their attacks and concentrated on the Pirate Captain instead.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t last long as my next Swift Strike took his head off.</p><p><br></p><p>Raising my hand, I used Holy Light, healing both Suikazura-san and Whistler before continuing forward.</p><p><br></p><p>With the Pirate Captain gone, the rest of the group seemed to have weakened a bit. Their attacks became more uncoordinated and despite the large numbers, they fell down one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>We took down two T5, a Pirate Captain and a Pirate Vice Captain, twelve T4 Veteran Pirates and one T3 Pirate.</p><p><br></p><p>My Manslayer Class was made for this battle.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a level from this battle. In fact, all of us had gained at least one level from this fight, Star actually getting five levels. His Apprentice Swordsman Class was levelling up at an insane speed.</p><p><br></p><p>The pirates had more gold than monsters, but no skill books. There was something else though. We got a treasure map on them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Man, that was some crazy power back there. I won’t lie, I thought the rumours about the Fairy Tail Guild and the First Guild Master were overhyped but holy crap, your damage output was insane there.” Suikazura-san said, chuckling.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right. For a moment I was confused who the real boss was in the fight, the guy he was fighting or him. I was pretty sure that one skill took down almost twenty five percent of that Pirate Captain’s health. That was a T5 monster. One hit twenty five percent. That’s insane.” Whistler exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, that’s well, I was buffed and they were debuffed and I also had a special class so…” I laughed at their words and explained a bit about the Manslayer Class.</p><p><br></p><p>“That Class is busted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It sure is. Hey, Shiroe, can we hunt here for a few days, maybe a month?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not this time unfortunately. You said you wanted to go to Loguetown too. We would need two weeks for a return trip from there. We cannot leave the Guild unattended for long. It’s in its starting phases right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch…”</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to be disappointed. Once the guild is stabilised more, we can take trips here for the next quarterly auctions. Then we can make some time for the hunt.”</p><p><br></p><p>Our discussions were interrupted by Star’s voice. “Hey guys, check it out.” He showed a piece of paper with the picture of the guy we had just defeated. “This guy had a bounty on his head. Should we keep his body and see if we can cash the bounty?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I went and took the bounty poster, taking a look at it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mad Piper, Ninety five thousand gold coins. Where do we cash it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I took out the man given to us by the Captain and checked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Apparently, there is a Bounty office in the Residential Area. We can get it when we go back.”</p><p><br></p><p>We rested for a while and proceeded towards Groove number thirteen to find Shakky’s Rip Off Bar. In doing so, we encountered two more attacks and I gained one more level.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, I was thinking of cancelling the trip to Loguetown and staying here to farm. The only problem with that was that I had no idea which T6 Class I wanted to take so we had some time on our hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Exploring around, getting more references, probably more quests could always be more advantageous in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I could get some rare class like Manslayer and that alone would be worth it?</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the fact that the fights were taking long and the enemies here were quite strong.</p><p><br></p><p>We had killed four T5 Pirate Captains already and Shiroe told us to avoid anymore fights so as to not attract even stronger bosses.</p><p><br></p><p>T6 would be a death sentence for us.</p><p><br></p><p>We finally reached our destination and it was quite easy to find the bar. Unfortunately we didn’t encounter any one with a bounty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, I was told that everything inside costs a lot of money. So just let me go and check it out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How much could it cost?” Whistler asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see the name of the bar and guess.” I answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, you go first. If you don’t come out in a while, we will enter and find you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded before entering the bar.</p><p><br></p><p>The place was empty except for the hostess. She was a relatively slim and tall woman with short black hair, with two tufts pointing upwards. She wore a pink, V-neck t-shirt that exposes her stomach and cleavage with a black spider on it beneath a black jacket with pink lines running down the sleeves that has a collar with wing-like cuffs. The woman looked the same as in the anime.</p><p><br></p><p>I used Scan. A T7…damn. She was the first T7 I had seen in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing who she was, I didn’t have any intention of messing with her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, what would you like to have, young man?” She asked, lighting a cigarette.</p><p><br></p><p>“May I see the menu please?” I asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Take a seat.” She pointed towards a table and handed me a menu.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the prices and my eyes bulged out. The anime wasn’t exaggerating about the ripping off part.</p><p><br></p><p>Ten thousand for a glass of beer, fifty for a rum… thousand gold coins for a glass of water… plain water.</p><p><br></p><p>Nope.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen, guest? Your face doesn’t look so good.” She asked. “Can I get something for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “I apologise for disturbing you but these prices are a bit beyond my reach. I am afraid I won’t be able to order anything.” I replied politely, to not mess with her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, unfortunate. Please visit us again later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Say Miss, would you mind answering a question for me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was looking for a ship coater. I was told that I could find him here.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a moment and then nodded. “Do you have any names?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it was Ray… something. I cannot remember the full name.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, you can wait there for a while. He is out. Might come back later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you.” I nodded and sat, waiting for Rayleigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are those people outside with you?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. They are my crew.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Crew eh. Are you a pirate?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha not yet. But soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You never told me your name.”</p><p><br></p><p>Please work… please just work.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am Monkey D. Luffy and I am gonna be the King of Pirates.”</p><p><br></p><p>Thank God the rest are staying outside or I would have died of embarrassment…</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+10 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+20% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Random Devil Fruit Box</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Random Devil Fruit Box</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gives a random Devil Fruit on opening.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Devil Fruit…</p><p><br></p><p>Jackpot….</p><p><br></p><p>“The Pirate King eh. You have quite the ambition, don’t you? But you don’t look like you have money on you. Do you even have a ship?” She asked, amused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not yet. I am planning to buy one.” I answered.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, the door of the bar opened and Veena looked inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will it take longer?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. He is not here. We might have to come back later on.” I replied and got up before turning towards Shakuyaku and thanking her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are welcome. Such a polite pirate is very rare to see. Good luck, Monkey D. Luffy. I will wait to hear the news about you becoming the Pirate King.” She waved back.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>FUCK…</p><p><br></p><p>My smile faltered as the rest of the team looked weirdly at me. Thankfully, they didn’t say anything and followed me outside.</p><p><br></p><p>No one spoke anything until we were outside the Grove.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? Monkey D. Luffy, the King of Pirates…” Star was the first one to break and started laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the group broke down in laughter too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me, did you leave us out because you have to pretend to be this… Monkey D. Luffy, the future Pirate King? Was that it, Arty? Oh God, I so wish I had a video camera to record that…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was it the quest?” Shiroe threw the straw with that question and I grabbed it immediately and nodded. “Did you complete the quest?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A part of it, yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out the map from my inventory. “I got this and another thing. I had to impress her with my story and get her to identify this map. It’s done.” I lied and passed the map to him. It took him a moment to check the description of the map and stopped in place.</p><p><br></p><p>“What the hell!” He looked at me. “Is this real?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, did you check the stats of that woman? I was sweating bullets there.” I replied, flustered but for a whole other reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“I tried but couldn’t see her stats. Scan works for anyone two Tiers above me so she must be at least T6.” Star said.</p><p><br></p><p>“T7, she was T7.” I corrected him. “And I had to get her approval. This quest was such a damn trap. At least the rewards were good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No wonder we had to fight all those pirates on the way here. This is incredible.” Shiroe said, taking another look at the map. “It’s probably the best item we have in our entire collection.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really, even better than Arty’s Armour Set? That thing took us a lot of work to get.” Star said and Shiroe didn’t say anything and just passed the map to him. The guy checked the description of the map and shut his mouth immediately. Shiroe explained the speciality of the map to the rest at that time.</p><p><br>Veena was the next one who checked the man and even she was surprised but then her expressions became normal again. “This might not be as big of a deal as we all think it is.” She said, making us confused. Seeing our confusion, she explained. “After all, this game is around forty times bigger than Earth and the maps which appear here are random. They could be anywhere in the whole world so the chances that we might be able to find many of them is not exactly that high. That said, it is indeed a very rare treasure. If we indeed get the location of a treasure we know the location of, it might be a huge boon.”</p><p><br></p><p>… that’s true.</p><p><br></p><p>We could get a map of One Piece and not even know where that place is. With our current levels, there was just no way to utilise the Map properly.</p><p><br></p><p>Her words calmed us down and we headed back towards the hotel. On the way, we did hunt some more pirates but no more bounty pirates appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Cashing out the bounties wasn’t that hard either.</p><p><br></p><p>All we needed to do was go to the Residential Area and find the Bounty Office.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that the bounty we encountered was rare. It was like a field boss encounter.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder what we can buy at the Auctions tomorrow?</p><p><br></p><p>At night we gathered together after dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what was the other thing you got from the Quest?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“One moment.” I brought out the Random Devil Fruit Box and placed it in front of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“Devil Fruit?” As expected, Veena was the first one curious.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at it one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s a Devil Fruit?” Whistler asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No idea. Only one way to find out. Who wants to open the box?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let one of the ladies do it.” Whistler suggested and no one had any problems with it either so I gave the box to Veena.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Random Devil Fruit Box</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gives a Random Devil Fruit on opening</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Good luck.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took a deep breath and opened the box. A bright light emerged inside and the fruit was revealed. It looked like a pear, purple in colour with swirl marks all over it.</p><p><br></p><p>We checked the description of the fruits one by one.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Swamp Swamp Fruit</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On consumption, the user can create, control, and transform into mud at will.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Normal Physical Attacks don’t affect the user.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>One new skill related to the use of the Fruit is unlocked every five levels.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: Devil Fruit users are hated by the sea. The user loses all their power in water and the ability to swim and take 250% damage from water based attacks.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Every person can only eat one Devil Fruit so be careful.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A logia.</p><p><br></p><p>A fucking logia…</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Veena in amazement while the rest were looking at the fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>“This… is seriously broken. You sure they won’t nerf it?” Whistler asked</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe was also in shock but then fell into thought. “I doubt it. There is a weakness to water and 250% water damage. That’s a serious disadvantage for anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It will probably cut off most of their chances of doing quests on the seas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes and it doesn’t say anything about skill based damage or magic. So the user is not invincible. Maybe even enchanted magic weapons might hurt them. So it’s not exactly that broken.” He analysed. “It can be good for guardians as they can avoid most physical attacks with this.” he said and looked at Suikazura-san and me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, I’ll pass.” Suikazura-san denied. “This… I don’t know what kind of transformation it will be. Moreover, the idea of turning into mud is… no thanks.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Ufufufufu, that’s understandable dear.” Veena laughed and Elaine had a bad look on her face too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arty?”</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm…</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like some time to think about it. The description suggests that there may be other types of Devil Fruit too and that one person can only eat one in their lifetime. Who knows if we can get something else later on.” I hesitated.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “Sure. We are not in a hurry. In fact, we can ask around and find out what these Devil Fruits are and what we can do with them.” There might be some people who know about it on this island since the quest was from here.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Let’s do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>I stored the Devil Fruit back in my inventory and we retired for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>The next day, we were waiting in the reception hall, waiting for Damon to arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>The man arrived, dressed in a purple pinstripe suit, followed by two people behind him. The guy looked like a proper mafia boss right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is everyone here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good, then follow me.” He beckoned us and we did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a car outside, a bubble car which was pulled by two horses.</p><p><br></p><p>We got in with him while the man ordered the carriages to move.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe started a casual conversation with the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Damon, do you know about something called a Devil Fruit?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The man paused for a bit and then looked at us. “Where’d you hear that from?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, we were exploring the island yesterday when we encountered some pirates. One of them mentioned something like a Devil Fruit but died before he could tell us more.” He lied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pirates eh… yeah, those guys would be the most familiar with one. Devil Fruits are legends in these parts of the world but more common beyond the Reverse Mountain.” Damon explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly are they?”</p><p><br></p><p>“As the name says, they are said to be fruits with devils inside them. Each of them is cursed by the Sea Devil. Anyone who consumes one gains supernatural powers but becomes hated by the sea. They lose their ability in water and sink like a piece of metal in water. There are many types of Devil Fruits too but they are primarily classified in three types, Paramecia, Zoan and Logia.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What can they do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Zoan type allows the user to transform into animals or birds or even other races, increasing their power and giving them new powers. The Logia type is the rarest and most expensive one. These  fruits that grant the power to create, control, and transform one's body into an element of nature. When transforming into their element, a Logia user becomes physically invulnerable, or outright intangible in the case of certain elements, and retains control over their body even if separated into pieces. But these are just the start. Their power increases with the power of the users.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe threw a look at me and then looked back at Damon who continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lastly are the Paramecia abilities.Anything that doesn’t fall into the first two types falls in the last one. Their abilities can be varied, some bad while some even stronger than Logia.” He finished.</p><p><br><br></p><p>“Where can we find one?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Find one? They are very rare in these places. As I said, it’s more of a legend in this place. Very rarely one appears in auctions and the price of those goods would be sky high. Perhaps millions, even more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why that much? Wouldn’t magic work on them too and aren’t they weak in water?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh sure it is. It’s just that… the power they offer… is far beyond your imagination. Logia users can permanently change the terrain or even the climate of an island. There were even rumours about a devil fruit granting immortality. Lastly, the power gained is not restricted to Class, which makes it extremely valuable. Tell me, why would people care about such minor disadvantages if that were the case?”</p><p><br></p><p>We shared a look between each other and didn’t say anything. By then, we had arrived at the auction house.</p><p><br></p><p>Damon led us into a room belonging to his Lion’s Brew Gang.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there anything you want to put up for auction?” He asked and Veena brought out a collection of two hundred Greater Healing Pills which we put up for auction.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we sat in the room and waited for the auction to begin.</p><p><br></p><p>The auction began and a lady came to the stage, beginning to announce the items one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena’s Pills were displayed and here it was surprisingly sold for eight hundred gold coins each instead of their usual price of five hundred and fifty in Llyne.</p><p><br></p><p>We bid on some items too like a Medicine Recipe for Intermediate Antidote and Intermediate Mana Regeneration Potion.</p><p><br></p><p>Our group had three mages and might have more in the future. Having the Mana Regeneration Potion would be good.</p><p><br></p><p>Both items cost us three hundred and eighty thousand gold coins.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came Skill Books. Shiroe got himself an Earth Spike and Earth Wall Spell. Together with Veena’s Ice Wall Spell, we can cover our sides better.</p><p><br></p><p>Star got himself a Silence Shot Skill, which could disable Mages from using Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena got an Explosion Spell.</p><p><br></p><p>The Skill Books cost almost five hundred thousand Gold Coins, leaving us with just eighty thousand or so gold coins.</p><p><br></p><p>Whistler and Suikazura-san didn’t buy anything as nothing caught their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, we come to our final group of items. These merchandise were caught from the islands of the Ashuborg Dynasty. Each of them are of the finest quality and will serve you to fulfil your desires.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, over a dozen girls were brought inside the room in a line.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, they are not!” Suikazura-san stood up stunned at the sight in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“They couldn’t…” Whistler had his mouth open, his usual easy going carefree attitude gone.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s…” Even Shiroe was taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s normal here. Didn’t Richard tell you… at Sabaody, you can buy anything… and I mean… <strong><em>anything</em></strong>.”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew this was coming but even then the scene left me with a bad taste in my mouth. People being sold as merchandise…</p><p><br></p><p>However, the bad things hadn’t ended yet… a simple look at the girls told me that they were not all npcs. Some of them were players. They were selling players.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could say anything however, I felt Veena’s hand on mine.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her but she was staring stunned at the stage, specifically at one of the girls there.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could ask her anything, she whispered a word…</p><p><br></p><p>“Grayfia…!”</p><p><br></p><p>…oh fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A few things happened here.</strong></p><p><strong><br>Arthas is at Sabaody and even got new members and even met Shakky but unfortunately no Rayleigh.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>He got a few things including the massive surprise at the end.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>But is that all?…</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

In fact, it was large enough to even house a Tailed Beast sealing without any problems. It was also the place which had cost me the most to get warded as well as the first on the list of priorities for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day of Solstice and also the day when Rituals had the best rate of success. I had planned eight rituals for today. From midnight to midnight.</p><p><br></p><p>Several plants like Cactus, Eucalyptus, Snake Plant, Golden Photos, Ginseng Herbs, etc were kept on different parts of the ritual circle.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, I summoned the Grimoire and started the Ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ritual Circle lit up as I felt my chakra pour into the circle. The plants lit up as well and slowly disintegrated into motes of light, swirling around me before finally crawling into my body.</p><p><br></p><p>My entire body felt warm before the heat started to increase as if I had a high fever. I still held on.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly but surely, the heat subsided and I sat down on the floor and breathed heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>I could feel the energy increase in my body.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra is made up of Physical and Spiritual/Mental Energies so the easiest way to increase them is by increasing either. One must however be careful as an imbalance can be harmful for the body of the user.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason the Uzumaki Clan have such high chakra reserves is because of their high vitality. An average Uzumaki could live to ages of one hundred and twenty easily which was also the reason the Land of Whirlpools is also called the Land of Longevity.</p><p><br></p><p>The increase was good, almost 40% or so more than my previous reserves but there was still a lot I could do.</p><p><br></p><p>I began cleaning and preparing for another ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, I had prepared twelve animals for the ritual to increase my chakra control and affinity with chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the strongest things in this world is Senjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, the Sage of Six Paths was also a… well, sage.</p><p><br></p><p>This art however was not something easy to learn. One must have high chakra, a strong physique and even then they might not be able to learn this art even when they dedicate their whole life to it.</p><p><br></p><p>For example Jiraiya. He couldn’t enter Sage Mode without help from the two toads of Mount Myoboku and even then it was imperfect.</p><p><br></p><p>While there were some people who could learn and master it in a month, like Ninja Jesus, Naruto Uzumaki.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the Sage of Six Paths who created his own form of Senjutsu after being taught by the Toad Sage.</p><p><br>Also, why was it that animals like toads, snakes and slugs were able to easily master Senjutsu compared to humans?</p><p><br></p><p>The answer to all that was affinity.</p><p><br></p><p>They had incredible affinity with chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>Animals lived in close relationship with nature and were thus more attuned to nature energy and hence could use the art of Senjutsu so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>The case of the Sage of Six Paths and Naruto were different.</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Otsutsuki was an Otsutsuki, a race which had spent thousands of years robbing the vitality and life from planets and improving their genetic code. They would obviously have incredibly high affinities with Nature Energy.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, not just him, any Otsutsuki would have similar affinities but those conceited morons would never practise Senjustu.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, they could just crush everyone with pure power so why waste time and practice or train like the so-called inferior beings?</p><p><br></p><p>What was the point of painstakingly gathering all the nature energy and mixing it with physical and spiritual energies to make Senjutsu Chakra when all they had to do was plant a tree and harvest its fruit?</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Otsutsuki and his brother Hamura Otsutsuki, while only half Otsutsuki, had plenty of their genes and thus their power.</p><p><br></p><p>Asura Otsutsuki’s case was different. He was given the Sage’s Sage Chakra and had the Sage’s body which increased his own affinity.</p><p><br></p><p>What I was trying to do was similar. I was trying to use the ritual to increase my affinity to Chakra, in the Otsutsuki way, just instead of sucking up the entire planet, I was just sacrificing some animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Rat, Ox, Tiger, Hare, Ram, Snake, Horse, Dragon, Monkey, Bird, Dog and Boar.</p><p><br></p><p>A ritual circle had to be made with twelve circles, each separated at 30 degrees, with each animal placed inside one in a particular order.</p><p><br></p><p>The only problem was getting a Dragon but it turns out that Komodo Dragons were also qualified as Dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>Phew, that saved me a lot of headache.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t even imagine where I would run around trying to search for Dragons here.</p><p><br></p><p>I had kept the animals in my Grimoire, all tied up and ready with required symbols already drawn on their bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one they were placed in the ritual circles and I got back to the centre once more, beginning the ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>My chakra seeped out of my body, forming strings and getting attached to the twelve animals, forming a link and suddenly a wind started to blow around us and the Ritual Circle lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>The wind was not normal but rather chakra and power from nature swirling around as the animals all struggled before turning into a mud like substance and rushing to me. The mud crawled along my skin before getting absorbed into my body and I felt a rush of dizziness overcome me. I sat down on the ground and closed my eyes, breathing deeply, waiting for it to pass. The feeling did pass away. It happened after around fifteen minutes. I was still feeling a bit weak so I decided to take a small break.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside the room, Kuina and Kanae were waiting on standby just in case I needed protection or if I didn’t come out after five hours, they were to wake me up so that I didn’t sleep away the entire day and had to wait for the next solstice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” Kuina asked, worry tracing her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Just a little dizzy. I am going to sleep. Can you wake me up in an hour or so?” I asked. I could understand the reason for her worries because most of the time, she had seen me passed out on the floor after a ritual. It was normal for her to worry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” They nodded and I left, collapsing on the bed as soon as I reached my room.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have chakra exhaustion because that’s something I cannot recover from in one day. I was just tired.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>An hour or so later, Kuina woke me up.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt fresh as soon as I woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>That vitality ritual was doing wonders.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and tried to feel my chakra and surprisingly found it extremely easy to move and control it. The degree of ease was actually remarkable.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how long people would have to practise chakra control to get to this level. Even the range of my Chakra Sensing had increased by a lot. If I were to close my eyes, I could feel chakra in a five hundred metres radius. That was huge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is everything alright?” Kanae asked, looking at my surprised face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright? No, Kanae-san, it’s better than alright.” I smiled. “This feels amazing.” I looked at my hand. I really wanted to do some experiments but I didn’t have time for that.</p><p><br></p><p>The clock was running and I had to do preparations for the next ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>This one was for acquiring a healing factor.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, that sweet sweet healing which made Hashirama and the Jinchuriki such pains to deal with.</p><p><br></p><p>This ritual was also divided into several parts similar to the Poison Resistance Ritual. The first part needed me to get several animals who could regenerate their body parts. The second part needed the chakra beast variants of the same animals. The third part was not yet unlocked so I had no idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra Beasts were currently out of my reach as while it is easy for shinobi to kill them, it is just as hard for them to be captured so easily, let alone transport the living monstrosities through a large distance.</p><p><br></p><p>For those, I will have to go out myself and carry them back in my Grimoire, not something I can do right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Since I can’t do it right now, there was no need to worry about it for now.</p><p><br></p><p>I concentrated on what I had in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>The new ritual circle took an hour to prepare and I placed several animals like salamanders, lizards, starfishes, axolotls and several others including a shark. Yes, a fucking shark of all things.</p><p><br></p><p>I had been stunned at the requirement but not all sharks are massive. Some can fit in the palm of the hands too. When I went out to find more, it turned out that the Land of Water sold a lot of these fishes and the Uzumaki Trio knew of places we could get them, even living ones.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason I needed a shark was because they could regenerate too. Not their bodies, their teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual was very thorough.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, there was also a flatworm. I never knew that these creatures could regenerate everything, including their brains. Lastly a Deer as they can regrow their antlers too.</p><p><br></p><p>Aghh, time for work again.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuina -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She sat near the door of the ritual room with Kanae as Seraphim came to replace them so that they could take a break.</p><p><br></p><p>“You two should go and eat. That annoying guy would probably stay there the whole day.” Sera said, in her usual Sera-like manner.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s been three hours. Let’s wait for two more. I will go after that.” She replied, before taking a look at the door. Usually, he only did one or two rituals in a day.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however, he was pushing himself too much.</p><p><br></p><p>Even one or two left him exhausted enough to sleep the entire day, let alone the eight he was planning this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t worry about him. That guy is like a cockroach. He’s not going to die this easily. He is too much of a coward to take any risks and waste all his work. Still, if he does, I will kill him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her lips twitched at Seraphim’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>That was probably her way of reassuring her and showing that she cared. After all, while she didn’t tell Kazuya himself, she considered him her husband due to Vampire Ninja traditions.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a weird tradition if someone asked her but hey, she was not one to blame others for being strange.</p><p><br></p><p>She was in a different world, training as a samurai, a title which her father had repeatedly told her only belonged to men, when she was actually supposed to be dead after a fall from that damned staircase. Her mood soured everytime she thought of that.</p><p><br></p><p>Her, the future Greatest Swordmistress of the World, died due to a fall from a staircase? The entire world would laugh at her if it was ever found out.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say that all of them had seen their fair share of strange things.</p><p><br></p><p>This applied to Sera as well, who might behave rudely at the guy but was willing to take down any enemy who came his way.</p><p><br></p><p>She wondered when that dummy would realise this.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, even Kasumi knew about Sera and even the times when he flirted with Kanae-san but that girl is just too sweet for her own good.</p><p><br></p><p>While nobles taking more than one wife was not uncommon even in her world, Kuina hadn't been associated with any nobles to know better. She had at best heard about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently Kanae-san’s world had similar things too although more uncommon which explained why she would become so embarrassed at Kazuya's teasing.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina had suspicions that Kanae-san also has feelings for Kazuya but just held back due to Kasumi-chan, not that she had to worry about her. Knowing her, she would only be happy for both of them and even welcome her with open arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it was due to this nature of hers that even Sera was very polite towards Kasumi-chan?</p><p><br></p><p>Coming back to her. Her life here was… new. Not to say her life here was bad. In fact, she was freer here than she was back in the Shimotsuki Village.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone respected and looked up to her for her swordsmanship, something she had always desired.</p><p><br></p><p>She did miss her father and Zoro sometimes but the people here always supported her. She had even made good friends like Kazuya, Kasumi-chan and Sera. Kanae-san was like a big sister to her while Saito-san and Toji-san were like two uncles, one strict and the other fun.</p><p><br></p><p>They waited outside for an hour more before the door opened and he came out, even more exhausted than before, looking like he would collapse if he took another step. “Kazuya!” She shouted and perhaps that was the limit as he did collapse.</p><p><br></p><p>Sera caught him before he could hit the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Need sleep, 5 hours.” He whispered before passing out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, this moron.”</p><p><br></p><p>They picked him up and were carrying him towards his room when they heard a voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya-sama?”</p><p><br></p><p>They froze and looked back to see Kasumi-chan carrying what looked like a packed bento in her hands and staring at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh crap.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up to the familiar ceiling of my warehouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Pulling four rituals in a line was pushing it too much.</p><p><br></p><p>I did the rituals for Underwater Breathing, Eye Enhancement and Night Vision, the second round of Vitality and Mind Enhancement, the last ritual draining me of more of my chakra than expected.</p><p><br></p><p>The increase in my stats was beyond expectations and I didn’t have any time to waste so I pushed myself more.</p><p><br></p><p>The Eye Enhancement Ritual needed the eyes of several animals, birds and insects. Even now when I concentrated even slightly, I could see everything around me in detail, to the point of seeing the granules of the wooden boards and the roughed up strings of the curtain.</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure I could see long distances as well as have an incredible dynamic vision and night vision. In this way, I had a makeshift Sharingan and Byakugan and this was just the first stage of the ritual. If I could get the eyes of the same chakra beasts, I could even get the chance to get chakra vision.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to make this ritual for Kanae too as her Flower Breathing needed the user to overstrain their eyes. With this, she could push her abilities to a whole new level.</p><p><br></p><p>Underwater Breathing was always a good skill to have. Many ninjas of Kiri had it too.</p><p><br></p><p>The main rituals were the last two.</p><p><br></p><p>The second vitality ritual increased my vitality furthermore, this time sending my chakra to almost triple of its previous amount, finally reaching Uzumaki levels of chakra. I still hadn’t seen any kage to know how much chakra they had but I was pretty sure, even if I lowballed, I would still be at the elite jōnin level of chakra… and growing. I was pretty sure that if I didn’t do anything and just trained normally from now on, I would still reach the Kage levels in chakra in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>It needed the sacrifice of several animals with long lifespans like turtles, clams and sea urchins.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting these were a pain in the ass but again, the Uzumaki trio were able to help a lot with some although even they were confused why I would need some of them.</p><p><br></p><p>While I haven’t been able to check it, I was pretty sure that I had a minor regeneration by now as there was no way I could start feeling so good after some sleep. I know I was very exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>Last was the Mind Ritual which needed the sacrifice of some specific animal brains or animals with multiple brains and wasn’t this a surprise?</p><p><br></p><p>Eidetic Memory, faster thinking, increased calculation power, higher information processing speed, this ritual has enhanced my brain way beyond the last one. In fact, the reason I had kept the Eye Enhancement for later was because I could only use it to the best of its ability with a fast enough brain to process the information I was receiving through my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>There were still two rituals left, one to enhance my strength and durability and the last one to increase my reflexes.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the wall on the side to see the clock. Eight hours left.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, I can work with this.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was about to get up the door to the room opened again and to my surprise Kasumi entered the room with a tray of food in her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya-sama, you are awake.” She hurried to my side and kept the food on the table and looked at me, checking my temperature as well as pouring water for me.</p><p><br></p><p>“When did you come here?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She normally stayed away when I worked to not disturb me so I was surprised to see her here.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… came here to bring you lunch because you were not back for breakfast or lunch. I apologise if I disturbed your work.” She said softly as she sat down on a chair by the side of my bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“That… no, it’s fine. I was busy and skipped breakfast and lunch.” I did forget about lunch today.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder I was feeling so hungry after waking up. The rituals and the exhaustion had left me hungry.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and looked at the plate of food. “Did you make this?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded slightly nervously. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It looks delicious.” I smiled and picked up some fried meat and took a bite. “And tastes even better than it looks.”</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t even joking. She might have some serious talent in cooking.</p><p><br></p><p>Her face lit up at my praise.</p><p><br></p><p>“But there is something missing.” I said with some thought. And just like that she became nervous again.</p><p><br>Does she wear her emotions on her sleeves? Not wanting to see her sad anymore, I decided to cut my joke short and pulled her by her arm onto the bed and into my arms making her yelp in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>I took another bite of the meat. “Yup, now this tastes perfect.” I smiled and it took her a moment to realise what I did, making her blush even more.</p><p><br></p><p>My clothes had slipped down during my sleep, leaving my upper body bare and I could feel her warm breath on my chest. She was realising the position too as her breathing became quick.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked her up and made her sit in my lap before my arms snaked around her, pulling her in a hug. “Now, feed us, Kasumi-chan. We are hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>The blushing girl nodded and started feeding me while I enjoyed having her in my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>She smelled like jasmine flowers, probably the baths prepared for her by Mira.</p><p><br></p><p>That reminds me, this world still didn’t have many good products for hygiene like soaps and shampoos. I could totally make and sell them without any problems.</p><p><br></p><p>A thought for later.</p><p><br></p><p>I finished my meal in minutes and was still not full but it was rare to get some private time like this with Kasumi as I have been very busy these days with the preparations for the Rōen mission and World Travel.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been wondering how long World Travel would be?</p><p><br></p><p>I am supposed to get married to her in a few months and if I disappear after that for a long time. How am I supposed to explain this to her?</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I have in mind till now is a long trip for trade purposes but I had no way to take her with me.</p><p><br></p><p>While I could hide in other worlds using the transformation jutsu, she didn’t even know anything about ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, maybe I should start teaching her some ways to protect herself. While she was already eighteen and it would be hard, I can make up for the lost time with medicines and rituals.</p><p><br></p><p>I am sure she will be in danger in the future due to her connection to me so it’s better for her to have ways to protect herself.</p><p><br></p><p>By now I was sure that there was no way she was going to betray me and I intended to tell her more about my powers similar to how I had told Grandpa.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was actually relieved as he sometimes wondered if I had been replaced by someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he himself stopped me from telling him anything more as in this world, stealing such information from someone’s head was not uncommon and if my powers were revealed, the entire world would be after my head.</p><p><br></p><p>His exact words were, this is your problem now. Just tell me if you need any help and I will lend a hand too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say, Kasumi-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you like to train with us?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you also like to train with us? That way you can stay here with us when we are training here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I but I don’t know anything…” She started to speak but I cut her off.</p><p><br></p><p>“And neither did we. We all have to start from somewhere. If you are worried about starting late, then don’t worry, we will take care of it. We just want you to have some means of self protection or anything you might like, for example Fuinjutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked in thought and then nodded after some time. “If Kazuya-sama wants me to, then I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We want you to do this if you want to, not because we want it. We absolutely don’t want you to do something you don’t want to. We are not like those people in the Land of Stairs.” I spoke and she suddenly froze, looking at me with wide eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>In response, I hugged her closer to myself. “We found how you were treated there and we promise you that you will never have to live like that here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… didn’t… I wasn’t hiding…”</p><p><br></p><p>I felt her shiver in my arms and raised her face with an arm and saw tears in her eyes and let out a sigh. Wiping her tears lightly, I gave her forehead a light kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are going to be our family, the first wife of Kazuya Katsuyoshi, the future Daimyo of the Land of Flowers and you will always be treated as such, with respect, love and care from both us and our people… this, we promise you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her into a hug and let her calm down.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few minutes when she did, she spoke again.</p><p><br></p><p>“We wish to learn, Kazuya-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We wish to learn Medical Arts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?” I asked, surprised at her reason.</p><p><br></p><p>She went on to explain the reason for her choice. She had arrived when Kuina and the rest of the girls were carrying me after my collapse. Apparently, my body temperature was also high due to the rituals, as if I had a high fever.  The girl was obviously worried out of her mind and had been looking after me since then.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, then we will get someone to teach you about Medical Ninjutsu and as long as you train hard, we promise you that we will make you the greatest healer in this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>While I didn’t have any medical ninja, I had access to all the knowledge in the world. I could totally teach her with enough time.</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>Almost right after that, the door to the room opened and all three girls, Kuina, Kanae and Seraphim entered, pausing at the sight of Kasumi in my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of them had a different reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina wasn’t even hiding her twitching lips, Kanae was blushing why Seraphim… she was her usual self, glaring.</p><p><br></p><p>Kasumi on the other hand was frozen from the shock so I gently helped her get up.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina stared at Kasumi and then frowned at me. “Are you bullying Kasumi-chan? Why was she crying?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her eyes are red. What did you do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do you assume that it was me who did something?” I protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because I don’t see anyone else here?” She replied while going forward and actually checking if I did anything to her.</p><p><br></p><p>My lips twitched at her action. “Just what kind of person am I in your mind?”</p><p><br></p><p>“An unrepentant flirt.” She replied without blinking an eye.</p><p><br></p><p>“A pervert.” Seraphim replied without even being asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae just looked away when I looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, these girls…</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, my future wife was the one who helped me out in this situation and explained everything to the group.</p><p><br></p><p>I ordered something to eat as I was still hungry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you finish your… work for today?” Kanae asked while I was eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. Still got two more left. I will do those after eating.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just… don’t push yourself too much, Kazuya-kun.” Kanae said and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The next two rituals also went without a hitch.</p><p><br></p><p>The Strength Ritual gave me enough brute strength to put a hole in a rock with my bare hands. Not only that, it also increased the durability of my skin and bones.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure that with another Ritual, I could reach and even surpass Toji’s brute strength and that’s a scary thought.</p><p><br></p><p>The Reflex Ritual made sure that I could react to things at the fastest time possible.</p><p><br></p><p>With these two rituals and the enhanced Mind, I can finally utilise the body to the fullest.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure I could absolutely obliterate my pre Ritual First Gate self With just my body right now.</p><p><br></p><p>The eidetic memory and enhanced eyesight also helped me perfect my Water Breathing at an accelerated pace. I could literally observe the way their muscles moved and memorise it with one look.</p><p><br></p><p>I could directly open the third gate now and with some practice will be able to open the fourth and fifth gates without any difficulty too.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, I would easily be a jōnin level, maybe slightly stronger if I were to use the eight gates, except for the combat experience outside of the sparring matches here.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time I could match Kuina and actually suppress her in a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>She had complained the entire day about cheating morons but refused to have any rituals done on herself when I offered her.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to become the greatest swordswoman in the world without any cheating.</p><p><br></p><p>If anything, the defeat only pushed her to work harder and open her fourth gate too. Now I really need a healer to help heal her wounds because I doubt my potion reserves can sustain that.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing I finally did was search for the identity of Kasumi’s mother.</p><p><br></p><p>Now wasn’t that a surprise? The information would take seven days to recover, the same as Genshiro’s information.</p><p><br></p><p>So whoever this woman was, she was not simple.</p><p><br></p><p>Today I was with my subordinates, except Toji, waiting for the people from Uzushiogakure to arrive. They had requested that the meeting be private. </p><p><br></p><p>“So, any ideas who we might be expecting?” Saitō asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably someone high up in the Land of Whirlpools that even Genshiro-sensei has to wait on the door for. Maybe a noble or an advisor of the Uzushiogakure Village?” I replied. I had no clue.</p><p><br></p><p>My questions were answered when I sensed two chakra signatures coming in our direction rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p>I almost froze sensing the chakra of one of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the largest chakra signature I had ever felt. It was at least a dozen times more than my current chakra levels.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it a jinchuriki?</p><p><br></p><p>No. That didn't seem right.</p><p><br></p><p>Uzumaki didn't have tailed beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>So what was this?</p><p><br></p><p>I soon got my answer as two figures appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>The other person had similar chakra reserves to Genshiro-sensei so probably another elite Jōnin.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was a guy and the other was a woman, probably in her thirties. You could never say anything with the Uzumaki. It was the woman's chakra I was feeling all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro-sensei stepped forward and bowed in front of the woman. “Uzukage-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>Holy crap, that's a kage!</p><p><br></p><p>The woman nodded. “Genshiro. Are they the ones?” She asked, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Uzukage-sama. The one in the lead is Prince Kazuya Katsuyoshi-sama and the rest are his retainers.” He then turned towards us and introduced the woman formally. “She is Uzukage, Shiroyasha Uzumaki-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the Land of Flowers.” I greeted the two. “We weren’t expecting to meet the Uzukage or We would have arranged for a better place for us to meet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. This is good enough.” She replied, shaking her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well then, come, let's take a seat first.” I led them to a place nearby and we all got seated for the discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wasn’t expecting the Prince to be this young. Are you sure you can represent the Land of Flowers?” The lady asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“We assure you that We have full authority to make any decision for our land as long as We don’t harm our land but We can understand your worries. If you would like, We could take you to meet our Grandfather and confirm everything for yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>She merely raised an eyebrow. “In that case, we will take your word for it. First of all, let me convey my thanks for saving the life of my daughter, Tamami. As a mother, I would like to express my eternal gratitude for your actions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are welcome.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Now let’s get to the real topic. What is it that you want from the Land of Whirlpools and Uzushiogakure?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Friendship and alliance.” I replied without any hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>She just rolled her eyes at the reply. “Alright, I take back my words. I can see how you can become a daimyo. You can lie with such conviction that it would shame even those old fogies from other lands. But enough of these pleasantries. Let’s talk for real.”</p><p><br></p><p>I controlled the twitch of my lips at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our answer would remain unchanged. We truly want friendship and alliance with the Land of Whirlpools and the Uzushiogakure Village. Could you please explain why you think We are lying?” I asked, actually perplexed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not saying that you are lying. I am just saying that you are not speaking the whole truth. You were able to figure out that Iwa, Kumo and Mizu were planning something even when none of our spies or most of the world had any ideas about it and then you revealed it to us of all people. That shows you know more than you are letting on. You know the actual situation of the Land of Whirlpools and even after knowing all this, you still ask for friendship and alliance from us? I don’t believe it. Even our biggest ally, Konoha, is turning a blind eye to this and yet you approach us. So, what is it that you <em>actually</em> want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. We knew about the danger the Uzumaki Clan faces and it was exactly why We gave you a clue. You obviously made good on it and are now in a much better position than you would have been before. As for Konoha being your biggest ally, We think you are misunderstanding something, Uzukage-sama. Konoha was never your biggest ally. It was the Senju Clan. With no Senju Clan, you are just like any other clan to them.” I saw her face change slightly, a frown came before disappearing almost as if an illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have missed it if I didn’t have my eyesight.</p><p><br></p><p>“For Konoha right now, you are just a clan with extremely great resources, whether it be your knowledge and prowess in the art of Fuinjutsu or your bloodlines. It is something which can fall into the hands of their enemies and become a danger to them.” I shrugged but was interrupted in between.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Uzumaki Clan also acts as a backup for Konoha in times of danger and comes to help them. Losing us gets them nothing. If anything it will be foolish.”</p><p><br></p><p>I chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p>If I was being honest, I didn’t know if Konoha, especially Hiruzen, was actually a grandfatherly person from my memories or just a manipulative bastard but none of that really mattered to me.</p><p><br></p><p>What if it’s true and what if it’s false. The only thing that mattered right now was to convince the Uzukage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Your words are all true. But tell me this, if they had to choose between sacrificing two thousand of their people for the sake of two hundred of yours, would they? If they had to choose between sacrificing a clan from their village and your clan, who would they choose?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face blanched.</p><p><br></p><p>“They already have whatever you have to offer. Due to this, they hold an advantage against their enemies too. But if the same knowledge and bloodline were to fall into the hands of their enemies, it can overturn their advantage in an instant. Perhaps if Hashirama Senju were to be alive, things would have been different. Then again, no one would have dared to start a war if that person were still alive. But We are not here to talk about past matters. Konoha could have had second thoughts if the Senju Clan had been the same as before but they are in a similar if not an even worse situation right now. If We are not mistaken, Mito Uzumaki is on her last leg, isn’t she?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her expression worsened with every word of mine.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seems like you understand that too or you wouldn’t be here, so as you said, let’s talk for real now.” My expressions became serious too. “We will say it again, what We want is the friendship and alliance of the Uzumaki Clan and not like the one they have with Konoha but the one they had with the Senju Clan. We will say this again. We do not want your Fuinjutsu knowledge or your bloodlines. We just want a cooperative relationship. You help us and we help you. Nothing more and nothing less.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>She just stared at me for a while and then spoke. “Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two reasons. First, We appreciate the loyalty of the Uzumaki Clan and the whole structure of the Clan and the Land of Whirlpools. It’s exactly how the relationship between a land and their village should be. Second, We do not want to see a place with such masters of Fuinjutsu go to ruin due to the greed and fear of the five Great Nations. We understand what it is like to be in such a situation and do not want anyone else to suffer like that. There have been enough casualties for that reason already.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what exactly can you provide us with? You cannot save our Clan from extinction.” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“And why exactly can We not do that?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are barely a jōnin and these subordinates are chunin level or tokubetsu jōnin level at best. Even I can take you all out without breaking a sweat.” She answered with a roll of her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>This made me laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>This woman really didn’t hold back her thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do shinobi always think of fighting and killing as a solution to every problem?” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s what they are trained to do.” She replied without any hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, We know. Honestly, it’s quite a waste of their skills. There are so many useful ways a shinobi can use their skills and yet they choose to use it for violence of all things. Water Style could be used to gather water from the air to water crops, Earth Style can be used to pave roads through the mountains and construction and yet they use it to drop and bury people. <em>Sigh</em>, such a massive waste of resources. But then again, it’s not the fault of the shinobi alone but also of their daimyos for only using them for such things. Anyways, let’s not get into this line of talk or We will continue to babble for the rest of the night.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and concentrated on the topic at hand. “There is a simple way to solve this problem. All the Uzumaki Clan needs to do is relocate to somewhere they cannot find you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It won’t work. Do you truly think it’s that easy? They will search the entire Elemental Nations if we were to disappear suddenly. Since they have decided to exterminate us, they will not give up that easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Again. If they will search for you throughout the elemental nations, then why don’t you go away from the Elemental Nations?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The world is far bigger than you think, Uzukage-sama. The Elemental Nations are not even a tenth of the whole world. There are other continents other than the Elemental Nations, some big, some small. One of them is one and a half months away from us by the ocean if you know the way. None of the people from the Elemental Nations will be able to find you there.” I finished and saw their eyes widen in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Initially, I had been planning to get some of their people for the Land of Flowers but something changed in between.</p><p><br></p><p>Toji asked me for a map of the world to know more about the places and that’s when I realised that I knew nothing of the world apart from the Elemental Nations so I asked my Grimoire for a map of the world and the information only took three days to get.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when I realised just how little we know of this world because no one knew of the continent I was talking about in Elemental Nations.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not joking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We do not joke when so many lives are at stake, Uzukage-sama. Our sense of humour is far better than that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If your information is indeed correct, then the Uzumaki Clan will be the eternal allies of the Land of Flowers and the Katsuyoshi Clan. I know that you are interested in Fuinjutsu and are even teaching your people so we will even send three of our top Fuinjutsu Masters along with the ones already here to your court to teach you and anyone you wish our art, even the Fuinjutsu of the Uzumaki Clan. They will be yours to command. We can even establish an alliance in a similar way as the Senju Clan, through marriage. I know you already have a fiance so we can send you a concubine in secret to seal the deal.” She finished in one breath.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, it was my turn to be taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, that… was a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>I collected myself after a few seconds and spoke. “We appreciate your offer but We would like to make some changes to the offer.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“We appreciate you sending your people to our command and We won’t lie that it’s an incredible offer, swaying even us, We do not wish to take advantage of you. As We have said, We want a friendship similar to what your clan has with the Senju Clan. We do not want to separate those people from their families. If anything, you can send them to teach our people but allow them to leave when our Land has at least three Masters of our own. Even teaching them the Uzumaki Fuinjutsu will be left to your wishes and will not be forced by us. As for the offer of a concubine, We accept it but would like for it to be a year or so later. We are scheduled to marry Princess Kasumi and taking a concubine just after will not only be disrespectful to her but to the concubine as well. We cannot and will not do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just stared at me for a while and then opened her mouth again. “You are a fool, you know that, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, yes. We have been called that by our retainers several times.” I laughed before taking out a piece of paper from my sleeve pocket and handing it to her. “This is the map to the continent.”</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly took the paper and looked at the map, memorising it with almost a look and then keeping it in her sleeves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I will meet you again after verifying this information and discuss further plans. Again, thank you.” She replied with a bow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. This is something We would have done regardless. After all, two of our teachers are from the Uzumaki Clan. We cannot sit aside and see them perish.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>This time even she smiled. “You really are a fool.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have a feeling that you prefer this version.” I smiled and replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“You do realise that I could finish you off right now and take this map away and no one would ever know where the Uzumaki Clan goes? If anything, you become more of a liability after giving us this information than an ally.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously I know that… but tell me, do you seriously think We would walk in without any preparations?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“With just you five? There are only you and your retainers here and no other humans in a five kilometre radius of us and I could take you all on and leave without sweating.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, and how strong does Uzukage-sama think we are?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that you have some technique to hide your chakra but your chakra was sensed when you were training. You are a jōnin level at best, an average jōnin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh.” I looked at Genshiro- sensei and released my chakra blocking technique and let my chakra run wild. I saw his eyes widen. “Was this what you sensed last time? The reason you sensed our chakra was not because you caught us off guard but rather because we wanted you to sense us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Uzukage was slightly surprised. “Alright, definitely more than I expected. An Elite Jōnin level at such an age was not something I was expecting. Still, it’s not something I cannot manage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, we know that. But tell me, Uzukage-sama. Have you perhaps heard of the Eight Inner Gates?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Eight Gates are eight specific tenketsu along the chakra pathway system which  exist in order to limit the flow of chakra within an individual's body.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. Normally, individuals can use no more than 20% of their body's full potential, the brain's way of protecting the individual from harming their body through overexertion. With training, individuals can learn to remove these limiters, referred to as \"opening\" the gates. With each opened gate, individuals are given access to more and more of their body's chakra, thus increasing their physical strength and speed. If one can open all eight gates, they can gain power surpassing even the likes of Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha but the only catch is that you will…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Die.” She completed. “Yes. I am aware and so are many others and yet in thousands of years, no one has been able to devise a method to open these gates safely…” And then she paused looking at me with a slightly open mouth. “You did not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But of course We did.” I looked at Kuina and ordered. “Would you please give us a demonstration? Not much just opening till the third gate will be enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and walked to a distance from us and took a deep breath and suddenly her chakra roared.</p><p><br></p><p>She went from Tokubetsu Jōnin level to almost Elite Jōnin levels, her chakra cracking the ground under her as the wind from her chakra release blew away the trees around us. She drew her sword and the next moment, her figure blurred and appeared near a rock, sending a wave of chakra which cut apart dozens of trees.</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be enough.” I ordered and she reverted back to her normal state again while I looked at the stunned Uzukage and spoke calmly. “While We might not be able to rival Uzukage-sama in terms of experience, skills or even chakra.” I narrowed my eyes. “We can make sure that if our life is truly endangered, We drag our enemies down together with us to become nourishment for the very flowers our land gets its name from.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was obviously not serious. I couldn’t do shit to her if I didn’t open at least six or seven gates, something I didn’t have the ability to do right now.</p><p><br></p><p>We stared at each other and I was thanking all that was good that I had done the previous Mind Ritual before meeting her or I would have obviously shown some flaw.</p><p><br></p><p>She backed down after a few moments and I smiled and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, as We have said. We are not exactly into violence so We have also prepared some backups. For example, some of our retainers have also been given this same map and told of our plan. They know of our meeting and if anything were to happen to us… well, you can guess that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. If you want to survive on this continent, you would need to have at least this kind of preparation. Your attitude reminded me of Hashirama Senju’s but you do not have the strength like him to back it up. If you continued like that, you would just get taken advantage of and die before you can reach your full potential. That would be an incredible shame.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We thank you for your advice.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the meeting went on without any problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro-sensei had told them about my odd hobby of collecting chakra beasts and other things and as the leader of a Shinobi Village, she had far more information and even access to these things.</p><p><br></p><p>We were promised these things and in return we sell them food and gold to prepare for their relocation. In the other continent, the currency from the Elemental Nations will not work so they had to liquidise everything too.</p><p><br></p><p>I even asked them for the prisoners they had, citing targets for testing out new Medical Ninjutsu we were developing as a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t even blink an eye at the demand.</p><p><br></p><p>Prisoners of war were treated as dead in this world unless they were some big shots in which case, they would likely actually die rather than get captured.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, there is a thing called the Bingo Book as well as a bounty on the heads of any decent ninja around.</p><p><br></p><p>We parted ways after discussing the basics and decided to finalise things after they verified my information.</p><p><br></p><p>I slumped on my couch after reaching home.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a dangerous game you played out there, my Lord.” Saitō said as he took a seat too.</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet We couldn’t back down at such a time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She could have attacked you.” Kuina said, sweat visible on her forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. There was no way she was going to attack us. You don’t get to be the head of a ninja village by being an idiot. If she truly wanted to attack us, she wouldn’t have said anything and returned and verified the news and then have us assassinated. Worst case, they could have tried to use some Fuinjutsu to control us. In both cases, I had ways to escape and then ruin them. Moreover, they didn’t know if we had any back ups.” Worst case, I would have taken me and all my subordinates inside the Grimoire and set the time to return back after ten days.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a risky move no doubt but I am pretty sure we could have left if we wanted to. They couldn’t afford to make overt moves here and attract attention.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s going to take them at least two months to verify the news and I would have enough time by then not only to prepare for any eventualities but also get Rōen and secure a method to fight against them in worst case.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ruling by the Book’.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Kazuya went all out to strengthen himself this time and had a talk with the Uzukage.</strong></p><p><br><strong>I tried a different solution to the problem with the Uzumaki Clan.

He is one of the top exorcists of the Church and a wielder of Excalibur Fragments. Be careful of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t get much time to discuss anything before the man was near us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, my name is Edward Christaldi, envoy of Heaven to escort Mathias Buné Zagan to meet Lord Michael.” He handed a letter to Euclid and after verifying Euclid nodded to us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will pick you up when the meeting ends.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will call you when I am out.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man led the way and Euclid wished me luck.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy, Ingvild and Shizuka followed close behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>We were escorted into a car outside, with Edward himself driving.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat between Lavy and Ingvild and Shizuka was beside Lavy, with Lavy leaning on my side as the car moved.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene outside was beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the border of the Norse ruled area. It was the winter season so the area was covered in snow, giving the land a very pure and serene look.</p><p><br></p><p>The journey continued for half an hour when the car suddenly stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>Edward looked behind at us. “I will have to check on the engine for a moment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure, take your time.” I nodded. Did the car break down?</p><p><br></p><p>The man got down and closed the door behind him, to prevent the cold from entering the car, not that it would have been a problem. Two of us were dragons and the other two had water and ice type Sacred Gears and this was not pokemon where Dragon types were weak against Ice.</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed at my own joke attracting the attention of my peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, what happened?” Lavy asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing, I just thought of something funny.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Funny?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes…” before I could tell her, I sensed some disturbance in the magic in the area outside and quickly grabbed and pulled all three of my Peerage members into my arms tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>The next thing I knew, a teleportation circle lit up and light covered us.</p><p><br></p><p>When the light faded, I sensed danger and pushed my Touki to the highest, taking my peerage members and tearing through the car and into the skies above.</p><p><br></p><p>The car exploded with a deafening sound almost immediately after that, the explosion carrying a holy and light aura. That must have used a lot of explosives.</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t have the opportunity to think further as my Senjutsu had caught another attack coming our way and I turned and used my dragon flames to counter those.</p><p><br></p><p>A passing look told me that the wave of flames I had just countered were Holy Flames.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously… to think Euclid was right all along.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, I told you they wouldn’t die from just that.” I heard a voice and looked to the side, where several strong strong energy signatures were gathered.</p><p><br></p><p>Two of the strongest ones had ten black feather wings on their back. One of them looked like a deformed elf while the other looked like a scholarly man with brown hair.</p><p>Beside them were some humans, some dressed like magicians while others in suits or japanese kimono.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew who the Fallen were and thus I could hazard a guess about who the others were.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizards of Oz and the Utsusemi Organisation, or as they are called nowadays, the Chaos Brigade.</p><p><br></p><p>Did they kidnap us?</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I thought, I saw Edward Christaldi and many other exorcists walk out from behind them and draw their weapons, facing us.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, it really was a trap.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls had summoned magic circles and were now standing on them, in the air behind me, looking at the group warily. No, that was not just wariness.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia and Shizuka were actually glaring at some of the people from the other side as well. Ingvild on the other hand just looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a moment to take a look at their status to know who each person was.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Satanael[Rank B]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kokabiel[Rank B]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Augusta[Rank C]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shinji Kushihashi[Rank C]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Genji Shinra[Rank C]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hanezu Himejima[Rank D]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Edward Christadi[Rank C]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>David Cero[Rank D]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Valper Galilei[Rank D] </strong></p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael and Kokabiel’s powers didn’t seem right.

If so then this could become dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Kushihashi and Shinra, I knew about them and finally Hanezu Himejima, the weakest among the three, was actually the leader of the group. He must have some ace up his sleeves too.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin had told me who they were and later Shizuka had also told me about them.</p><p><br></p><p>Members of the Utsusemi organisation who stole the Sacred Beasts as well as the Holy Swords of the Shinto pantheon.</p><p><br></p><p>Their powers being in Ultimate Class meant that they were probably using the same powers. In fact, the aura on Kushihashi was draconic but on the Shinra guy was different, so they could very well be using the Divine Beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>As for David Cero and Valper Galilei, I knew their names, having studied about some members of the Church from the information given to me by Euclid.</p><p><br></p><p>David Cero was the wielder of Excalibur Galatine while Valper was the guy who was the mastermind behind the Holy Sword Project.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought he was excommunicated by the Church after Serafall revealed the scam. Then again, we could never say. He could be with the Fallen or he could be hidden by the Church to continue the research.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, there were literally hundreds of exorcists, both current and stray ones, magicians, fallen angels, onmyoji and some humans who were using Sacred Gears so probably the students who had accompanied Satanael in his rebellion.</p><p><br></p><p>They actually had a whole army on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, I checked for any way to leave this place.</p><p><br></p><p>A simple look at the area told me that it was under a barrier, and an especially strong one too.</p><p><br></p><p>Escaping would take some effort and I doubt it would be easy to do so under the attack of all these people.</p><p><br></p><p>The other side must have prepared for us too. Holy, Light and Dragon Slayer attributes must be their main focus.</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, I cannot use any of my large scale microbe based attacks so easily or it might actually affect my peerage members too.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh… so troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I was assessing the situation, they were also taking a look at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Kokabiel broke the silence and spoke to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias Zagan. I was among the people who had hunted the Zagan. I really didn’t think anyone from that accursed family would be alive… not to mention an abomination like you. Don’t worry, today we will complete the incomplete work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now Kokabiel, I understand that you are excited but remember our agreement. Leave his body intact.” Satanael interrupted making Kokabiel scowl, but the guy didn’t deny.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Such high grade research materials are hard to come by. Too bad we have to kill him. I would have loved to research someone like him and his magic, maybe make an Utsusemi out of him. I bet the results would be the best we have had yet, even surpassing the Three Great Monsters.” The woman, Augusta said. “For today however, I will keep the Demise Girl busy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Absolute Demise is also a great research subject. Please don’t waste it. While your current research on it is good, we could get completely different results depending on the race of the user. Be sure to capture her as well.” Satanael said, making me narrow my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“The black haired one belongs to us. I thought she was killed by Susanno along with the Domon girl and we wouldn’t be able to get our revenge but it seems luck is on our side. I can finally wipe out the entire Himejima Clan and clear our name once and for all from all the shame I have been forced to bear.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh come on. This damn drama queen.</p><p><br></p><p>Even after doing all that, he is still being a bitch about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing Shizuka’s mental state after the whole incident, this was the last thing I wanted her to deal with.</p><p><br></p><p>But before that I had something else to verify.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy and then at Edward Christaldi. I was here for a meeting with the Heaven faction and it was crucial to know if they were also involved in this shit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this everyone or will Archangel Michael be sending his angels too?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>A slight twitch came upon his face but it was not him who answered but rather the guy standing beside him, David Cero.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t need the Archangels to intervene to take down trash like you.” He roared.</p><p><br></p><p>I however completely ignored him and kept my eye on Christaldi.</p><p><br>“Does Heaven know of this or is this another matter like the Holy Sword Project, Church going off on its own?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man however was far more experienced than that and didn’t answer.</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “Not that it would matter. You have brought me here. That alone is enough to violate the contract. Tell me, is it really worth it to potentially start a war over your dumb pride?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Dumb Pride! How dare you damn abomination…? We are doing what we should do. The permission of the Archangels is not required for us to do what is right. If we were doing anything wrong, God would have stopped us.”</p><p><br></p><p>… oh you stupid fool.</p><p><br></p><p>“So the Archangels don’t know about this. Great. That does put my mind to rest.” After that, I just ignored them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stalling for time will not work. This barrier is completely isolated from the outside world. No one can send any signals outside nor can they receive anything from here. The only way to open the barrier is from inside. Hahahaha even we cannot open the barrier till everything is finished.” Satanael laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy with a slight twitch on my face. “You know… this evil monologue and telling your enemies your plan is something usually done by third grade villains who don’t even return for a second arc. Are you sure you want to set a flag before a fight like this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s good then, isn’t it? You will die today so I don’t think I need to return after today either way.” He didn’t fall for the provocation, although the guy beside him did.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough talking. Don’t forget why we have gathered here today. Get him!” Kokabiel commanded, creating a light spear in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>The exorcists and magicians also began their spells as the barrier around us took on a yellowish hue. In fact, there were some kind of items… holy swords at the corners of the barrier, used to fuel the entire barrier’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s something we use to hunt Zagans. The creations of the Zagan life magic are all demonic beings and Holy Power weakens them, making them no more than fodder.” Satanael explained, helpfully.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, is this guy really so dumb?</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!” I deadpanned. “Good work.”</p><p><br></p><p>Their side was ready to attack too so I took this brief window to instruct my peerage members too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Looks like we won’t be able to hold back this time. Go all out. Aim to kill. Stay in the air and use our aerial advantage. Lavinia takes on Augusta, Ingvild takes on the white haired guy with the draconic aura and then moves on to the scrubs… I mean exorcists and magicians, Shizuka Byakko is yours.” I looked in Shizuka’s direction. “Remember Shizuka… what happened previously was not your fault. You have a new life now, a new chance at life. Cherish it.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally seeing as the attack was about to come, I looked at Satanael and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks for all your explanations. As a courtesy, let me give it my best too.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satanael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I am honoured?” He mocked the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just that I had a small piece of advice for you all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, amuse me.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Advice?</p><p><br></p><p>He had calculated every situation of this fight, even the possibility of getting found out by the forces of Heaven and the Devils… What advice does he need?</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough of this Satanael, attack him.” Kokabiel shouted and dashed forward, swinging his light spear.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him, the rest of the fallen and magicians attacked, roaring at their loudest.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael shook his head and laughed. “Seriously, this brother of mine. Always so serious.” Not that he couldn’t understand Kokabiel’s feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>How long had it been since he had felt this… this thrill of war?</p><p><br></p><p>And Kokabiel had just received the snake of Ophis, increasing his power to rival that of Azazel. Of course he would be excited to test it out.</p><p><br></p><p>However, his laughter was stuck in place when he felt an enormous aura spike in front of him, making him snap his head in the direction of the boy only to feel a gust of wind hit the side of his face. From the peripheral vision, he saw something passing by his side and crashing on the mountain below into a loud explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>Suppressing the chill running down his spine, he turned his head behind, and saw Kokabiel laying in the middle of the mountain sized crater, blood flowing out from his mouth as his chest was caved in as if a giant had stepped on it.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened and he turned to look at the boy who had just retracted his hand and taken a punching position. His brain was still catching up with the entire situation when he heard the voice of the boy again.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I was saying before I was interrupted so rudely… if you wanted to take me down… you should have brought at least twenty times the numbers.” Then as if to prove his point, a massive aura erupted from the boy and his body was getting covered in touki.</p><p><br></p><p>That power… it was unreal. Wasn’t he supposed to be just a High Class Devil? Even the previous Satans didn’t have this kind of power when he had fought them dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire army that had followed Kokabiel had halted their steps, stepping back in fear as they felt the monstrous demonic power from the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>He snapped out of it the quickest and quickly summoned Arondight, the Holy Demonic Dragonslayer sword, the best counter to someone like him who had both Demonic and Draconic attributes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t step back. Attack! We cannot leave here till he is dead! He is just a single person. We can take him down.” He shouted, rallying the army and breaking them from their trance like states too as he dashed forward to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t let the morale of his troops collapse before the battle had even begun in the earnest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Balance Breaker!” He shouted, activating his new Sacred Gear as a golden light enveloped them. When the light faded, his body was covered with a golden armour.</p><p><br></p><p>The Divine Beast Ouryuu, the strongest of the five Divine Beasts. Taking control of it wasn’t easy so he used another method, trapped it in a Sacred Gear. Azazel’s research data on Artificial Sacred Gear helped out a little.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally the result was this.</p><p><br></p><p>Yellow Dragon Scale Mail.</p><p><br></p><p>He felt his power increase by leaps and bounds as he went forward to clash with the monster in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ingvild Leviathan -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She faced the person in front of her, former member of the Five Principal Clans of which Shizuka-san was a member of before joining Matty’s peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka-san had been quite forthcoming and even Matty had explained the whole situation to them.</p><p><br></p><p>These people were the ones responsible for the destruction of Shizuka-san’s clan.</p><p><br></p><p>A part of her understood their anger and their reason for doing what they had done but just like them, there were many innocent people in those clans too. Not to mention, the children they had kidnapped and experimented on.</p><p><br></p><p>She had witnessed Shizuka-san suffering and throwing herself into life threatening training everyday to cope with her loss. It had taken them a lot of effort to help her come out of it, although barely… and now…</p><p><br></p><p>And these people were targeting not only Shizuka-san but also Matty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t waste time with this one, Shinji. She is no one important. Take care of her quickly and go and wipe the last remains of the Himejima.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, don’t get impatient Hanezu.” The white haired man called Shinji spoke before looking at her. “You don’t have to feel sorry about this girl. Rejoice for you get to die at the hands of the newest Seiryu, Shinji Kushihashi.<em> Balance Breaker</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>In front of her eyes, the man was covered by an azure glow and when the light faded, he was in an armour with draconic features.</p><p><br></p><p>“Azure Dragon Scale Mail. Witness my power by which we have even subdued the great Divine Beast Seiryu.” He boasted as thunder crackled around him and the trees on the ground grew quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>The other man was not sitting idle either. He had brought out a sword which gave her a dangerous feeling and was chanting spells already.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild wasn’t going to give them any opportunity to attack. She had trained a lot in the past few years and that too under one of the Satans and Tiamat.</p><p><br></p><p>She was not going to waste all the time and effort put in training her.</p><p><br></p><p>She let out her wings as her Demonic Power erupted. Waves of water gathered behind her forming gigantic serpents made of water sending them their way while she prepared for her next attacks too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Balance Breaker.”</p><p><br>Nereid Kyrie answered her call, and she could feel her control over the water around her get stronger. Her Sacred Gear was a subspecies which allowed her control over bodies of water as well as dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard from Tiamat that the Nereid Kyrie contained the soul of her ancestor, which is why she was able to awaken from her Sleeping Sickness.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a surprise for her… and everyone to learn about the origins of Leviathan and the reason for the end of Atlantis. She still remembers how Matty’s lips were twitching when he had heard the information.</p><p><br></p><p>This fact however didn’t just awaken her from her Sleeping Sickness but also gave her incredible compatibility with her Sacred Gear, making it a Subspecies and promoting it to the levels of a High Tier Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>And over the past few years, she had trained to control her Sacred Gear as well as learn magic which can make use of her Leviathan power.</p><p><br></p><p>The Original Satan Leviathan was only known for her Sea Serpent of the End form and her control over water but from Tiamat she found that her father also had another power, something which manifested in Nereid Kyrie, the power to control, empower or weaken dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a power similar to Mathias’ Dragon Tamer ability to a certain extent and that’s why she was trained by him to control this power so that she could help him manage the Dragon farm.</p><p><br></p><p>She too did her best to master this ability to help out more in the farm and by now… it had become her strongest ability.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why when she saw the sword wielding onmyoji overcome one of the water serpents and dash towards her, she didn’t stop him. Instead, before his sword fell, he was punched away into the ground by another figure.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked around in stunned surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shinji! What are you doing?” He shouted towards his companion in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in question however didn’t answer and instead dashed towards him, throwing a large bolt of lightning towards him, making him dodge hurriedly but didn’t get a chance to do so as the rest of her water serpents cut off his escape route, tearing off his arm, leaving him defenceless against the next lightning bolt attack from the Azure Dragon guy while reduced him into a charred mass of flesh, with only the sword left behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly, she picked up the sword and turned her attention towards the other battlefields.</p><p><br></p><p>The one nearest to her was Shizuka-san. She was fighting with another person who was wearing a white armour on his body.</p><p><br></p><p>He was controlling wind to attack Shizuka-san but was being suppressed by her sheer strength and speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka-san was dominating the fight, each one of her punches sending the other person crashing into the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild was pretty sure that she would have won the fight had she not been continuously interrupted by strange monsters controlled by zombie-like people who were accompanying the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka-san was hesitating from attacking them but was holding her own against them so she went ahead to assist Matty who was fighting a large group of people by himself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shizuka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She dodged the attacks from the Utsusemi and knocked it back as she took to the air once more to make a distance between them. Genji Shinra used this opportunity to gather himself and attack again.</p><p><br></p><p>“How does it feel, Himejima… to fight against your own family members? We have finally taken vengeance for the humiliation and sufferings we have suffered all these years.” he mocked, making her grit her teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>The people controlled by those Utsusemi, she recognised them…</p><p><br></p><p>They were the missing members of the Himejima Clan. She had sent the children away with some members when their family was chased out but heard that they were killed.</p><p><br></p><p>Did they get caught by these people?</p><p><br></p><p>“Today, you will fall and so will each and every one of you and our vengeance will be complete.” Genji shouted and sent another barrage of wind blades, following the attack to advance towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>She summoned dozens of fireballs to counter the attack but suddenly deflected them to the side when some of the kids controlled by the Utsusemi jumped in the way.</p><p><br></p><p>The wind blades tore through the kids and attacked her, tearing her skin and throwing her aside. She felt blood rise into her mouth but more than the pain in her body, it was the scene in front of her which hurt her.</p><p><br></p><p>The kids who had jumped were all cut into pieces and their bodies were still falling from the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nooooooooooooooo!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the world turned red in front of her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I heard a roar from the side as Shizuka’s magic power just went berserk.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit, did she snap again?</p><p><br></p><p>I knew fighting against the people who brought the Himejima Clan to destruction was going to be heavy on her but she had gained pretty good control over her powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what did those bastards do?</p><p><br></p><p>However I didn’t have time to think much about them as I dodged the sword coming for my neck and punched forward forcing Satanael to dodge.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sacred Gear he was using was a Draconic type and was boosting his power by quite a lot. That on top of Ophis’ snake made him able to take on my attacks while the sword was able to cut my scales.</p><p><br></p><p>I would still win but I had to keep an eye on others who were trying to come for my head. They had used Phoenix tears on Kokabiel to bring him up once more and now that guy was just kiting from a distance and sometimes taking the advantage of the Totsuka no Tsurugi, the sword Susanno used to kill Yamata no Orochi to try to land an attack on me.</p><p><br></p><p>My defence was strong enough to not let those attacks hurt me seriously but it was giving Satanael a chance to land attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the rest of the exorcists, Utsusemi and fallen who were not fighting creatures made by me, were just trying to divert my attention from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed concentration and time to create stronger creatures which couldn’t be done in the heat of the battle and the holy barrier was weakening anything I had in a hurry barely keeping them in line.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see why this lineup could kill off the Zagan.</p><p><br></p><p>Had I not been as strong as I currently was, I was pretty sure I would be dead instead of just being annoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>I spun in my place, smashing a light spear with my tail, the attacking stinging my tail.</p><p><br></p><p>Aghh, this is getting annoying.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to be losing your concentration, boy! Are you perhaps close to that Himejima girl? I can understand. She is quite good looking after all. In fact, all three of them are quite good looking. Maybe if you fall quickly, I can go and take them down myself. Although they are devils, the boys could enjoy themselves before sending them off for experiments. After all, live subjects are more valuable than dead ones.” Kokabiel taunted.</p><p><br></p><p>I know they are trying to get under my skin by trash talking but… it was actually working. My rage was bubbling more with each passing moment while my dragon instincts were screaming at me to rip them to pieces for eyeing what is mine.</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to turn into my full dragon form and use my Illusion Magic as well as Viruses to do just that when suddenly, I felt my power rise sharply.</p><p><br></p><p>I recognised this feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild.</p><p><br></p><p>Did she complete her fight?</p><p><br></p><p>I had sensed a draconic aura from one of her enemies that’s why I had sent her there to face him. Looks like she was done already.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael who was coming to attack me was also weakened and I took this opportunity to dodge his sword and hold his hand and punch his face with a touki and senjutsu powered fist, shattering his scale mail and breaking his jaw.</p><p><br></p><p> Several light spears came my way but most of them were blocked by gigantic serpents made of water.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty!” I heard Ingvild’s voice behind me. “I will back you up.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s all I needed to hear. I held Satanael’s hand harder, my body morphing into my half dragon state. My body size increased by almost two feet, putting me at eight feet tall. Scales covered my forearms and legs and a tail grew from my back.</p><p><br></p><p>I was trying not to use this more as it would increase the effect of Dragon Slayer elements of Arondight on me but I had to end this fight soon and stop Shizuka.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensing a presence coming towards me with my senjutsu, I took a page from Armin’s book, turned and bashed towards the attack with Satanael’s body like a makeshift club of sorts. David Cero, the one who had attacked was not expecting this and defended with Excalibur Galatine but the attack snapped his arm and created a massive crater under him from the sheer force behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack crushed a large part of Satanael’s scale mail. He vomited a large amount of blood but I wasn’t done yet.</p><p><br></p><p>I slammed my foot on his chest, further sending him into the ground and then using my leg to keep him pressed into the ground, I pulled… with all my might.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want to kill me… you want to toy with my family? Do you have the power to back those words up?!” I growled, my voice heavier, almost like a roar in my half dragon form.</p><p><br></p><p>“Argggggggghhh!” he shouted as his arm was ripped from his shoulder, Arondight falling from his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Stomping once more to make sure he was down for sure, I picked up the Arondight and Excalibur Galatine, the holy and dragon slayer elements trying to repel me but I just stored it in my inventory and threw sealing magic on him to make sure his magic was sealed tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>The fallen had lost consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I felt my power falling back to my previous level and heard a cry from Ingvild’s direction. Looking there, my eyes widened as I saw Edward Christaldi with Excalibur Blessing stabbed into her side.</p><p><br></p><p>He had snuck up on her using Excalibur Transparency while she was busy fighting Kokabiel.</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment my mind blanked at the sight… and then a guttural roar erupted from my mouth, carrying all the anger that had been accumulating.</p><p><br></p><p>I kicked the ground, shattering it under my foot as I reached her side, punching away a light spear from Kokabiel.</p><p><br></p><p>The fallen was taken aback by my sudden arrival.</p><p><br></p><p>I roared at the fallen, sending a torrent of dragonfire towards him and then at Christaldi, burning the entire area with the attack. Christaldi was caught in it too. He tried to slash at the flames with his sword but the attack was too much for him and he was lost under the dragonfire, barely alive.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed him alive to question him to know if Michael and Heaven were really involved in the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright, Ingvild?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-yes, I used a Senzu Bean. I am fine.” She answered and I looked down to see her wound completely healed.</p><p><br></p><p>My rage however wasn’t suppressed completely so I looked towards the other fallen angel cadre who suddenly looked pale and let out a roar.</p><p><br></p><p>Without waiting any longer, I was at his face, touki and nature energy twisting around my fist as it blazed with dragon fire and punched.</p><p><br></p><p>Kokabiel tried to defend with his sword but his hand snapped under the force of the attack. The attack sends a crack through the blade.</p><p><br></p><p>His body was sent to the ground, shattering the landscape under him.</p><p><br></p><p>I crashed into him foot first, breaking all his ribs. This time just to be sure that he wouldn’t be healed, I held him by the face and lifted him up.</p><p><br></p><p>“You wanted to toy with my peerage. Let’s see if you are capable of toying with anyone after I am done with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw horror in his eyes but he couldn’t speak due to his injuries so I continued. “Don’t worry. I am not going to kill you. I have a special kind of hell planned for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I created a new type of virus and directly forced it into his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>This virus will completely ruin his body’s ability to move or use any kind of energy. After all, we needed our brain and consciousness to use magic. This virus will just change his brain to remove that part completely. Moreover, since it changes his brain, it wouldn’t be something he can heal. Lastly, I changed his eyelids, and removed them completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will be able to hear and see everything, but you will not be able to do anything. You wanted to start a war by killing me, didn’t you? Then I am going to create peace… and I will make you sit in the front row when the Peace treaty is signed and witness as I trample on everything you stand for. You will regret ever eying me and mine till someone takes pity on you and ends your disgusting existence.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that I dropped him to the ground. </p><p><br></p><p>At the same time something else happened, a massive storm of ice enveloped the area, turning everything white.</p><p><br></p><p>The mobs were all frozen into ice sculptures in their places.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy!</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild looked in that direction and then at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Go and help Lavy. I will check up on Shizuka.”</p><p><br></p><p>The attack had broken the barrier slightly and Euclid would be able to track us soon. I had to finish everything before that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Lavinia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She used her Absolute Demise to stop a wave of Holy Flames rushing her way as she created a giant wall of ice to stop the exorcists from coming near. She then shaped the ice on the walls into icicles and shot them towards the place where most of them had gathered, to mow down their numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>The ice wall stopping Augusta cracked and she got ready to face her too.</p><p><br></p><p>Facing Holy Flames, especially ones from the Incinerate Anthem was a devil’s nightmare.</p><p><br></p><p>It was after all, one of the best weapons to kill any devil, right below the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>But she didn’t feel the same fear as other devils would have.</p><p><br></p><p>The last few years had brought great changes to her life, some bad while some good. But at the end of the day, there was no denying it that all these events had made her strong. And honestly, she was glad that she was where she was.</p><p><br></p><p>Because after almost a decade, she felt that she had found a true home with Matty and the rest of her fellow peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>Gasper is like a little brother to her while Valerie, Ingvild, Shizu-chan and Natsume were like sisters.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Latia and Rias treated her the same and didn’t mind her relationship with Mathias and were even supportive of her. And finally, Matty… the person who had given her a new home…</p><p><br></p><p>Their love and acceptance had allowed her to leave behind her previous life and start a new life of her own.</p><p><br></p><p>She loved her new life but it seems that while she had left behind her old life, her old life hadn’t left her behind, coming back once more to take away what she loved.</p><p><br></p><p>But this time she wouldn’t allow it. This was something she had pledged to herself when she had accepted Matty’s offer to join him.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone who tries to do otherwise will face <em>Demise</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last few years, she had trained under arguably the best Ice Magic users of the Devil race, Serafall Leviathan and Euclid Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>Even without Absolute Demise, her understanding with Ice Magic was enough to take on Ultimate Class beings.</p><p><br></p><p>Coupled with the special type of food products Matty provided her with and the constant hunting near the pits, spars against Dragons and Dryads of the Farm and even Tiamat, she has had enough time and opportunity to hone her magic against some of the harshest situations in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>And if that’s not all, Mathias had made specific environments with situations which made it hard for her to use her Sacred Gear in, like a volcanic land or the extreme gravity and heat waves of the Heat Planet. All these environments tested and pushed her and all her fellow peerage members to the limits and took their powers to a whole new level.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why, even when faced with Holy Flames from a Longinus, she didn’t have much fear and could keep her calm.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly flying away, she created a large mass of ice above her, in the form of meteors, letting them fall down on the stunned crowd below.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Augusta was taken aback and was forced to cancel her spell and quickly teleport away, stopping her attack in the middle to avoid getting caught in the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>The retreat of Augusta had given her time to concentrate on her next attack which needed some preparation to use.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Balance Breaker.”</em> she called out and felt Demi-chan listened to her call.</p><p><br></p><p>Her lessons with Euclid had taught her various ways to use her Sacred Gear and after her fight with the Demonic Beasts when she had attained her Balance Breaker for the first time, she had experimented more with her Sacred Gear too.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, she was able to develop a Subspecies Balance breaker for her Absolute Demise similar to Tobi-kun’s Balance Breaker with his Canis Lykaon.</p><p><br></p><p>Demi-chan merged with her body, becoming a blue and white coloured armour, a tiara of ice appeared on her head, keeping her hair in place, preventing them from interfering with her fight and lastly wings of ice covered her devil wings, giving them a feeling of an angel’s wings only made of ice.</p><p><br></p><p>This form of her Sacred Gear not only increased her magic power and Ice Magic but also boosted her physical stats, something she has had plenty of time to train. Being a member of Mathias Buné Zagan’s peerage essentially meant she had to train her physique. So although not at the level of Mathias and the rest, she was confident about taking down High Class beings with her physique alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Her preparations were completed just in time as she felt another aura spike nearby. Looking in the direction, she felt the heat wave emanating from the eight headed fire serpent made of Holy Fire… eight headed hydra.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt almost draconic and there was a hint of something else in the Holy Flames that made the attack feel more dangerous to her.</p><p><br></p><p>The flame serpent roared, destroying the ice wall and setting many exorcists and magicians in its path on fire.</p><p><br></p><p>She waved her hand, creating a barrier of ice and meeting the attack head on.</p><p><br></p><p>The ice and fire met together in an intense explosion, covering the whole area with vapours, blocking everyone’s vision. She flew out of the cloud of vapours and saw several heads of the hydra coming towards her and attacked them with giant spears of ice, cutting them off.</p><p><br></p><p>However, suddenly something surprising happened.</p><p><br></p><p>From the heads which were cut off, two more heads rose up and came racing towards her, making her quickly take to the skies to dodge the attacks, sending waves of icicles towards the heads of the hydra to cover her retreat.</p><p><br></p><p>Once more, as the heads were destroyed, two more took their place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fascinating isn’t it? Just a bit of research and good enough materials could boost the abilities of Sacred Gears to such an extent, even a Longinus.” She heard the voice of the woman she had hated for years for killing her former teacher. The woman came out from the cloud of vapour.</p><p><br></p><p>It had taken her witnessing Glenda alive and willingly working with the same woman she had hated.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth had broken her but it had also helped her let go of her hate for Augusta. Sure enough when she saw her today, she couldn’t feel any hate for the woman… at least for the past.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to have developed quite nicely yourself. I didn’t know the Absolute Demise had a Balance Breaker like this. Was it because of you becoming a Devil? Are there any reactions between the Sacred Gears and Evil Pieces? Or is it because of the special food items created by the Zagan boy? I can’t wait to find it out for myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia felt an intense burst of anger when she heard her mention Mathias and her plans for him. “If you…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Are you saying something?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you even harm a single hair on Mathias' head, <em>I will end you</em>.” She warned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, such big words. Have you forgotten what I did to your teacher?” The woman mocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You did nothing. I already know everything, the whole truth about the Witch of the South, Glenda Goodwitch and I have nothing to do with such a person anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>She recognised the look of surprise on the woman’s face.“Ah, so you know already. Good. I don’t have to keep this act up anymore. To be honest, I always thought Glenda was too cautious, fearing the Longinus would go berserk if you threw a tantrum and going through all this drama. There was always the option of finishing you off  but I am thankful she didn’t do that or we wouldn’t have such great research materials in our hands. Still, it looks like I will have to put some effort into it. “</p><p><br></p><p>She took a look towards the area where Matty was fighting. “It looks like Satanael is having problems with your King and might need my help. Do you think his body would be damaged too much if I attacked him seriously with the Holy Flame? We don’t want to destroy such precious material after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was the last straw for her as she sent waves of icicles towards the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“Haven’t you learned, girl? It’s useless to use such tricks on me.” Augusta replied as the Incinerate Anthem tanked the attacks, evaporating the ice and creating vapours between them again.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia however didn’t reply and instead created body doubles of Ice and spread them in the cloud of vapours.</p><p><br></p><p>The ploy worked as the serpents began to attack the ice doubles. The doubles were created and controlled by using Demi-chan’s powers and had semi-sentience, enabling them to move and attack by themselves. It wasn’t enough to stop Augusta but it was more than enough to buy her some time and time was all she needed to prepare her strongest spell.</p><p><br></p><p>She poured her power into her Sacred Gear, as a bluish orb of icy energy formed in between her palms, the more energy she poured the colder it got, by the time she had finished, the orb had turned from icy blue to pure white and the area around her was freezing too.</p><p><br></p><p>Augusta had also sensed this and had also finished taking care of the ice body doubles and hurriedly sent her hydra towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>The dozen flaming jaws of the Holy Flame hydra approached her but it was done, she had finished preparing her spell.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Celcius Cross Trigger!”</em></p><p><br></p><p>And the world turned white.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Euclid -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean you don’t know! Edward Chirstaldi took him away. He even had your letter and now you tell me that he just disappeared? How can he just disappear?” He heard Serafall shout at Gabriel and this time around it wasn’t even her just being childish due to her one sided rivalry with the Archangel but real anger.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing which they all had feared had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias and his peerage members were kidnapped.</p><p><br></p><p>While it wasn’t exactly verified what happened to them yet, he had received a signal from the device he had given to Shizuka and by the time they rushed there, they were already long gone.</p><p><br></p><p>And now, what could have turned into the first step to a possible Peace Treaty between Heaven and the Underworld, had turned into an emergency meeting to stop another Great War.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our people are trying to find out what happened to them. Even Edward has been missing since he went out to receive Mathias Buné Zagan and his peerage members. Please rest assured that we are doing our best to find them.” Gabriel answered calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot rest assured when they just disappear not even thirty minutes after leaving with your people. Who knows what kind of situation he might be in right now?” Serafall argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please calm down, Serafall. We don’t know what happened to them.” Michael tried to speak and assure Serafall but it didn’t work either.</p><p><br></p><p>“If I may interrupt, Lord Michael.” He interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Euclid.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am almost certain that Mathias and his peerage members are in danger. One of them had a tracker and trigger which would let us know if they were in any danger. It was triggered from the place where they were teleported from. We have checked the area and there were signs of a spell prepared in advance there and it would have needed the car to stop there. There were no signs of any accidents or even resistance which meant that the car had stopped exactly at that point until the teleportation took place. All this doesn’t paint a good picture for us. I hope you will do whatever is needed from your side or… things will turn ugly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you threatening us, devil!” Uriel, the ever hot head said in a loud voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, no I am not. We are beyond the point of threats. I am just stating the natural progression of things. We had already repeatedly warned your side about this so it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Should all this be a plot to harm Mathias… we go to war.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not going to war, Euclid.” Michael interrupted. “Heaven has nothing to do with this, I can swear this on my father’s name. All the three factions have lost a lot in the Great War. We do not wish for those tragedies to be repeated again.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe you don’t… but can you say the same about your subordinates?” He questioned. “Can you say the same about the Church?” He asked and watched as a frown appeared on his face. “See, you can’t.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could speak however, they sensed two massive auras approaching towards them and looked in the direction to see a familiar figure appear with a cloaked person.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tiamat!” He spoke to the person in lead but the woman didn’t look like she was in any mood to talk.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is Mathias?” She asked directly in a no nonsense tone. Not that Euclid would have tried to speak any nonsense after sensing the menacing aura around her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias and his peerage members were teleported away on their way to the meeting location. We are still trying to find any signs of him.” he quickly explained the situation to her, not wanting to risk the ire of the angry dragoness.</p><p><br></p><p>He was glad that he did so because she turned her attention towards Michael who was taken aback by the intensity of the dragoness.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is Mathias, Michael?” She asked once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tiamat. We really don’t know where Mathias and his three peerage members are. Believe me. We are trying our best to find him too.” He tried assuring her but by the look on her face, it didn’t look like it worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat just glared at the Archangel and spoke after a minute of glaring.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two hours. I will give you two hours. If Mathias doesn’t stand before me safe and sound by then… not even your father coming back from death will be able to save Heaven from my anger.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone present was taken aback by the blatant threat of the dragoness.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, some didn’t take it so well.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will mind your tongue, dragon!” Uriel roared, holy flames coming to life around him.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Serafall and he took their stances against the angel too. Tiamat was currently on the same side as them. But before any of them could do anything, the cloaked figure moved at a pace beyond any of them, grabbing the furious Archangel’s face and smashing him into the ground, sending shockwaves around the entire area.</p><p><br></p><p>The flames burned the cloak and the shockwaves sent the burned cloak flying away to reveal the face under it, making them freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your methods are too tame, Tiamat. These kinds of fools understand things better after a limb or two are removed from their bodies.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was Michael who broke out of his stupor first. “You are… The Crescent Circle Dragon, Crom Cruach?!”</p><p><br></p><p>While his mind was still reeling from the fact, trying to understand why the strongest of the Evil Dragons was suddenly here and asking about Mathias, even going so far as to pick up a fight with the entire Heaven, Tiamat’s aura flared.</p><p><br></p><p>The power of the strongest Dragon King came out in its fullest but to the surprise and horror of the Archangels, it didn’t just stop there but kept increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>Earth shook and the mountains started to crumble as her power reached a level which surpassed even Sirzechs and Ajuka’s, reaching into the realms of Heavenly Dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>He had only heard about the full power of the Heavenly Dragons from the older Devils, not having been born when they were sealed but if this was anything like the power they possessed, he could see why it would take all three factions to face the two of them… especially when they were outraged.</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat’s show of power however didn’t just end there, her shadows expanded, and to everyone’s horror, claws erupted from the shadows as monstrous dragons stepped out of her shadow, climbing out.</p><p><br></p><p>That was… the Annihilation Maker.</p><p><br></p><p>How… just how and when did she get that?…</p><p><br></p><p>A Heavenly Dragon with a Longinus and that too one of the top four… just thinking about it sent shivers running down his spine. He could understand Michael’s state now.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have one hour fifty five minutes left, Michael. Find Mathias and pray to your departed father that he is unharmed or there will only be two factions left from now on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike Crom’s angry roar, Tiamat’s calm voice scared Euclid even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, right at that time, he received a message and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have found their location.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said and immediately the magic power and the monsters evaporated and the two dragons turned towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lead the way.”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t complain either. He himself was worried about Matty after all.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them took to the air and raced towards the location, each of them praying that nothing happens to Mathias… for their own reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘The Dragon Farmer’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Man, I really suck at writing the fighting scenes.

Two of them were the familiar twins while the last one was an elderly man who looked to be in his sixties, around Grandpa’s age.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness.” They bowed politely.</p><p><br></p><p>I guided them to one of the meeting rooms and asked Mira to bring us some tea for us as we took our seats for discussions.</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all, I would like to thank Your Highness for the help you provided our people during their time of need. Our Uzumaki Clan and the Land of Whirlpools will always be grateful for this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We did what was expected of us. Our Land doesn’t hold any good feelings for Iwagakure after the previous war.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded and the old man pulled out a scroll from his bag and presented it to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the scroll and opened it, reading the contents. It was from the Uzukage herself and suddenly I froze at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>Tamami Uzumaki was the daughter of the Daimyo and the Uzukage...damn. She was essentially the princess of the Uzumaki Clan and the Land of Whirlpools.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder Iwa was trying to capture and not kill her.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the Uzukage and the Daimyo had sent their gratitude and for this, they had decided to offer us a 75% discount in the warding costs. </p><p><br></p><p>That was...a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Uzumaki Seals were expensive so 75% would be absurd. Then again, it was their princess. If she had gotten captured, things could have been much worse.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the teaching part, they had decided to accept to teach me to the Advanced Level for now.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro Uzumaki, the old man who gave me this scroll will be the one to teach me or anyone else I want after the warding is finished.</p><p><br></p><p>We can discuss further deals after that.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however, she has requested me to keep the presence of the Uzumaki in my country a secret.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, did they discover the strange movements of Iwa, Kumo and Mizu and are starting to take measures?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, let’s see how that works for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Either way, I am getting free coaching for one of the most difficult arts in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>I kept the scroll aside and looked at the three shinobi sitting in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for accepting our request.” I thanked them before they began to explain to me about warding.</p><p><br></p><p>The costs made my knees go weak. Damn, even with that 75% discount, it would take a lot of money to afford their services. I will have to redouble my efforts.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki Clan could do several types of warding. Starting from warding off a simple room to palaces or entire cities, like Konoha.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the Telescope Jutsu of the Hokage can only be used as it is connected to the barrier around the village.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted them to ward my palace and the warehouse as well as some area around it for now. In the future, when I build a village or town for my soldiers and their families, kinda like a hidden village, I could have that warded later.</p><p><br></p><p>Such places required a squad of ninjas to power the wards at all times. I don't have such privileges right now.</p><p><br></p><p>One step at a time.</p><p><br></p><p>I told them the places I needed them to ward and they asked me to show them the places before they could say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Take some rest for today. We will take you to our Warehouse later in the evening. You must be tired from your journey.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.” Genshiro-san bowed and I had Mira guide them to a room.</p><p><br></p><p>After they left, Kuina spoke. “Can we trust these people?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. At least not completely right now. We will know soon enough.” I replied as I set a search on Genshiro Uzumaki to know what they were sent here to do.</p><p><br></p><p>14 days.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy must be strong, at the very least an Elite Jōnin.</p><p><br></p><p>I had tried to feel his chakra and it was massive.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, all Uzumaki have insane chakra reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought it would only be double or so at best and cases like Naruto were an exception but it turns out to be wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the two sisters have several times more chakra than me, let alone the old man. I wonder how much chakra their Kage or any other kage must have?</p><p><br></p><p>If only I could get the Uzumaki Bloodline, I would have a much easier time with my summoning rituals.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t have the leisure to trust anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>It had taken Saitō and me a lot of time to unearth spies from my palace alone.</p><p><br></p><p>There were still nobles who had spies among themselves and while not many, there were enough to prevent us from making any overt moves.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that the stupidity of the Medicine Daimyo had given me a perfect excuse to remove every spy from my court.</p><p><br></p><p>After Grandpa’s permission, I had gone on and culled every person who had been colluding with other nations or passing information to them… even the ones covertly sent by our allies, the Land of Lightning.</p><p><br></p><p>They couldn’t even complain because the spies had been hiding in secret and we were not informed so their dying is not on our heads.</p><p><br></p><p>Entire court was shaken by what could only be called a massacre.</p><p><br></p><p>No one was expecting <em>me</em> to make such moves. Grandpa sure but not me.</p><p><br></p><p>I had the image of a research scholar in their minds and except for a select few, no one was aware of my training.</p><p><br></p><p>Now however, that image has changed completely.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who used to hide their contempt in their gazes didn’t even dare to meet my eyes now and with the people on my side, they couldn’t shake anything by themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>I had been planning for this for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>Going on a one sided purge would just make me unpopular with the people and increase the chances of rebellion.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the first step was to increase my popularity among the people which I did by upgrading their cultivation methods. With increased income and a better standard of life due to it, even in this war, they were able to live relatively comfortably.</p><p><br></p><p>And when these people heard about the attack on me and the purge of <em>traitors</em>, it wasn’t me they blamed but rather the ones who were purged.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we had tightened the security to the best of our abilities, to avoid the same problem in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, it’s impossible to completely prevent all spies from entering the country but I can at least train my own people against them.</p><p><br></p><p>With the high alert state of the Land of Flowers and the Capital city, most of the spies were either dead or chased away and the other countries hadn’t sent new ones so early.</p><p><br></p><p>They will probably be sending some a few months later.</p><p><br></p><p>Having the Uzumaki finish the warding till them is of utmost importance for us. That would make the security of the place reach another level.</p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And this is all. We will make more orders when we wish to expand.” I finished as we showed them everything.</p><p><br></p><p>My Warehouse had been cleared of all materials and information.</p><p><br></p><p>We even had several prison cells built underground to hold prisoners. My plan was to use seals which can absorb their chakra and power the barriers around the Warehouse. At least that way, those prisoners can be of some use to us.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, there were places for holding valuables as well as the granaries of the Capital City.</p><p><br></p><p>The three Uzumaki were taking detailed notes of the whole place, calculating area and physical features.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, in some places, they even suggested some modification in the facilities to me for better results like the Ritual Room which I wanted to build in the centre of the Warehouse area was moved out completely while my lab was modified into a hybrid of both a ritual room as well as...a lab.</p><p><br></p><p>Their reasoning was that Rituals were intricate processes and could have destructive backlashes in case things went wrong. It would be better to keep them away from normal places.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long do you think it will take to get these places warded off?” I asked after they finished their calculations.</p><p><br></p><p>“Based on the requirements you want, especially for the Ritual Rooms, it would take at least two months even if we work day and night.” Genshiro-san said, putting aside the pen and paper.</p><p><br></p><p>“We assume that the lessons will start after that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. We can teach alongside. It would even help your studies to watch the seals as complex as these being made.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, take your time. You don’t need to push yourself too hard. We look forward to your teachings. Take your time.” I reassured the three.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness.” The group bowed politely.</p><p><br></p><p>Two or three months should be enough for me to prepare for my first World Travel.</p><p><br></p><p>After leaving them with their work, I left to meet Grandpa.</p><p><br></p><p>He was sitting in the room, waiting for me already by the time I got there. I checked the room and found nothing in the room itself but still used a simple security seal to hide our conversation from outsiders.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did your work go?” He asked as I took a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two to three months to complete everything.” I replied as I picked up the chop sticks and took a bite of my food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uzumaki Sealing is very costly. Are you sure you can afford everything?” He asked, picking his own chopsticks and getting ready to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have already prepared the payment. They offered me a discount because one of the people I had saved back then turned out to be the Daughter of the Whirlpool Daimyo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, the girl was the whirlpool princess. She was disguising herself as a guy.” I chuckled remembering Tamami’s act.</p><p><br></p><p>“And Iwa knew her identity?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably. I can’t imagine them sending such a team to capture a no name trio of Uzumakis.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s suspicious. Ninja villages never take direct action against anyone of the royal family of any nation. That’s one taboo no one breaks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That rule is not exactly applicable to Tamami as she is the daughter of both the Daimyo and the Uzukage. She is a ninja so she is fair game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you are looking to ally with Konoha through Uzu?” He asked. “That’s a good plan considering the Land of Stairs is immediate neighbours to the Land of Fire and that might make us similar to Rain in the future…”</p><p><br></p><p>“We cannot become allies with them, Grandpa. Alliances only hold true when both sides have similar power. If one side is weak, they can only be pawns or tools of the stronger side and if they are equal in power…then a target for backstabbing. The Big five cannot be trusted.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “Then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am planning to ally with the Uzumaki instead. I am interested in Fuinjutsu and wish to learn more from them. The Wards will help us protect our products better. The last incident made me realise how easy our palace could be raided and important documents and research data stolen and I don’t want that to be the case.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Just take care. By the way, a message has come from the Medicine Daimyo. That’s the main reason I had to call for you. Do you want to come and meet him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He sent a messenger? Sure, let’s go and see what he wants to say.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably apologise. He sent his son for this. The same guy who is married to the daughter of the Stairs daimyo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That guy huh...” My eyes narrowed at the mention of the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t met him before but just the information about him made me mad enough to want to rip him apart.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t let your emotions show, Kazu-kun. That’s unbecoming of a Daimyo.” Grandpa said. “I know of your anger at them and believe me, I wish for nothing more than to have him beheaded right at this moment but that’s not how Daimyo’s work. We always have to keep the interests of our people in mind first. Our revenge is long and painful.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded at his comment and we went to the audience chamber together.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina and Seraphim were waiting for me outside and followed us to the chambers. </p><p><br></p><p>I had my chakra senses spread the entire time to notice any presences and noticed two presences among the people brought by the Medicine Prince.</p><p><br></p><p>Both had chakra levels lower than mine so Chunin or probably Tokubetsu Jōnin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Land of Medicine’s Howling Wolf Village…</p><p><br></p><p>They were a small village with several clans within, the Kodon clan being one of the stronger ones.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Majesty, Lord Katsuyoshi.” The prince bowed before Grandpa and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You may rise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We would like to sincerely apologise for the actions of the shinobi of the Kodon Clan. Those people have been punished severely for their actions. Our father has told us to relay that he doesn’t want this incident to become an obstacle for the relations between our lands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what punishment did Wakui give them?” Grandpa asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The Medicine prince looked solemnly and replied. “Their entire clan was exiled from the Land of medicine and the Howling Wolf Village. They will never be allowed entry in the Land of Medicine again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well, I’ll be damned.</p><p><br></p><p>That fat piece of lard really wiped his hands off of the clan before we could even push towards it.</p><p><br></p><p>I rejoiced inside at the news. This makes things so much better for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Father has also sent the medicinal herbs you had requested the last time as a compensation for the injuries to the Prince to show our sincerity in this matter.” He bowed slightly towards me and his subordinates put forward a few scrolls and unsealed them in front of us, revealing over two hundred different herbs. Although most of them were common ones, there were some rare ones as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I signalled towards Kuina to receive the herbs and didn’t miss the way he stared at Kuina and Seraphim, especially Seraphim. Thankfully, the girl restrained herself well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. We will resume trade between our Land and the Land of Medicine again. We apologise for the inconvenience and our doubts but the circumstances forced our hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. Lord Katsuyoshi is too kind.” The guy thanked Grandpa and then came the negotiations for the trade renewal.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t like the guy. His eyes….felt disgusting.” Kuina said</p><p><br></p><p>“He had the eyes of a cretin. I have seen any of those before to know how to identify them.” Sera complained and while she was always complaining, this time the disgust in her voice….felt potent.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. You won’t have to bear him for much longer. He will be leaving the place immediately.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“That better be the case or I cannot guarantee that I won’t use him as a target to practise my new sword techniques.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed. The worst part was that Sera wasn’t even kidding. She would actually do such a thing if I allowed her to.</p><p><br></p><p>“That guy went to meet Princess Kasumi. Are you sure you shouldn't go there and accompany her?” Kuina asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanae is there, keeping an eye on things. Moreover, by relationship he is her aunt’s husband. There are no valid reasons I can give to prevent him from meeting her.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>Kasumi was… as Grandpa had said, a kind and innocent girl.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I had asked around and it turns out that everyone knew her as the daughter of the fourteenth concubine of the Stairs’ Daimyo’s son.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the girl herself thought so and even carried a picture of the woman with her.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s something which had been bugging me for a while and I don’t know why.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning to search for information about Kasumi’s mother to know what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are the Uzumaki people?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are starting with the Warehouse first. Saitō-san and Toji-san are keeping an eye on them.” Kuina reported.</p><p><br></p><p>I winced.</p><p><br></p><p>Toji and Saitō… didn’t get along well together. No, it would be fair to say that Saitō hated his guts and Toji never failed to provoke him either.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitō Hajime was someone who hated people like Toji Fushiguro, killers. He believed in exterminating evil without mercy. It was the same reason he hated and went after Kenshin Himura so much.</p><p><br></p><p>So, working with Toji was difficult for him.</p><p><br></p><p>They had finally found a middle ground by ignoring each other’s existence at all. Still, this was more than I could ask of them.</p><p><br></p><p>At least they were quite pleasant with the girls.</p><p><br></p><p>It also made me aware that all the people I summon might not get along well with each other and I will have to learn to deal with them.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were broken by Kuina’s voice. “By the way, do you think they actually exiled the entire Kodon Clan from their lands?” She asked. “That seemed a bit odd if you ask me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ninja lives are always expendable. These kinds of things are not uncommon at all, at least in my world.” Sera said, a frown appearing on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what kind of life has she been living all this time?</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know. I will check on them and see what I can find out about them.” I said, reassuring them both. I would have done so either way as I didn’t want to take any risks.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the fact that he would go so far… kinda suspicious now that Kuina mentioned it. From what I had read about that guy, he hardly seemed like the guy who would let go of the power in his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>At least I got the herbs I had wanted for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of these herbs could be used to make medicines which can increase the chakra capacity of people over time and give them some poison resistance too. Others were used to make antidotes of many common and even some rare poisons.</p><p><br></p><p>Shinobi Villages trained their ninja to develop poison resistance with the help of similar medicines and herbs.</p><p><br></p><p>Medical Ninjutsu was also something I wanted to train my people in but there was only so much I could do by myself and I had no time to learn everything by myself and teach others. That’s why I was planning on leaning more towards medicines which can easily be taught to other people.</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned my Grimoire and stored the herbs inside and all the information about the herbs appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down and both girls also sat behind me, taking a look at the Grimoire out of curiosity. Normally, the Grimoire wouldn’t allow them to read from it and they would just see gibberish or nothing at all but they could read the contents if I permitted them to.</p><p><br></p><p>The information I got also listed the best ways to grow the herbs and increase their productivity. Simply using them all at once would be foolish and growing them in my own land would be far better in the long run for me.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Toji was a beast.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy was keeping up with a Three Gates Kuina with his base strength, without even using Chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire training ground had been ravaged due to the clashes between them.</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho had been able to get us some chakra blades today and both Kuina and Toji jumped at the opportunity to test them out.</p><p><br></p><p>The Daimyo of the Land of Stairs had found out that I was searching for Chakra Blades and as an attempt to soothe things over, he had sent over two dozen chakra blades from his side. The blacksmiths of the Land of Stairs were not the best at their art but they were not bad either.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, Kensho’s contacts had replied and brought me five high grade chakra blades from the Land of Iron, which were exactly the ones Kuina and Toji were using right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Put your back into it, Kuina–chan. With the speed you are swinging your sword, I will grow old by the time your blade reaches me.” He teased, making Kuina angrier.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that he had the privilege of actually teasing her while she was using the inner gates was even scarier.</p><p><br></p><p>I know for certain that he could do a lot more if he started using chakra as he had immense chakra reserves due to his physique. It wasn’t at the Uzumaki level but far above common jōnin… and growing.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time I felt something change in my Grimoire and checked the area around us first to see if anyone was spying on us.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding the area clear, I summoned the Grimoire and found out that the information about Genshiro Uzumaki had been updated.</p><p><br></p><p>I personally found the guy to be quite professional. He was stoic but honest and a good teacher too so I hoped there was nothing wrong with the information. Reading further, I found out that the reason the Uzukage had sent him here was to observe me and see if we were actually intending to become their allies or just trying to steal their knowledge or even working for Kumo or Iwa.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzukage was actually disturbed by the news of Kumo, Iwa and Mizu working together. Especially with the sudden destruction of the Sky Village by Konoha, they had become wary of the whole situation and had secretly started spreading their people all over the elemental nations, especially in the smaller Lands.</p><p><br></p><p>It was also due to this that they wanted to see if I could become a true ally to them and shelter them if things went south and they had to flee everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>They also had plans to send me a concubine to strengthen the relationship with the Land of Flowers behind everyone’s back.</p><p><br></p><p>….like holy crap.</p><p><br></p><p>All this changed from such a simple clue given by me?</p><p><br></p><p>If anything, I am surprised they didn’t go to Konoha directly.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, this eases my mind a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>At least now I could be sure that they were not here with ulterior motives although the guy is spying on us to know more about us, which means he knows most of our training.</p><p><br></p><p>I can do something about that, I guess.</p><p><br></p><p>Still good. If they want to send their people here, then I will arrange for a way to accept them in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>As for saving Uzushio, I am not an idiot to think I have or will have the power to do such a thing in the near future.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting even five Jōnin from Uzu would be a god sent gift for the Land of Flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look quite happy. Did something good happen?” Kanae asked, noticing my happy mood. “Is it because of your date with Kasumi-chan?” She smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes internally. Girls and gossip are really inseparable.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why can’t I be happy because I am sitting here with you, Kanae-chan?” I smirked back, turning her attack on her. As expected, the girl was not as good with defence as she was at attacking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?!”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her surprised look, I continued. “I am sitting here with a very pretty girl like you, it would be odd if I wasn’t happy, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>Blood rushed to her face at the comment.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t realised it at first but the charm ritual had actually worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever I went out among the public, I always drew attention but now, the looks in their eyes had changed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the maids in the palace blushed when I passed by despite having seen me for years.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I flirt, I would assume it would have a much better effect than before.</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-you shouldn’t joke like that, Kazuya-kun. You are going to get married to Kasumi-chan. It’s not good to tease other girls like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, I was just stating the truth, you know. We could go out and ask any person and they would tell you exactly what I told you.” I shrugged. “You should have more confidence in yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl’s blush reached her ears so I decided to throw the last attack.</p><p><br></p><p>“Moreover, as the next Daimyo and the sole guy from my lineage, I am expected to take more than one wife. This is something even Princess Kasumi knows.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her super flustered look, I couldn’t hold back and started laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae pouted. “You are a meanie. To make a joke like that…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh, I wasn’t making a joke, you know. If you don’t believe me you can go and ask Princess Kasumi. In fact, you should go and ask Grandpa. That man can think of nothing more than getting his great grandkids.” I rolled my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>By this time, the spar between Toji and Kuina had finished and Kuina was approaching us. “What are you two talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just telling Kanae that she is quite famous among the people of the capital but she doesn’t believe me. She thinks I am teasing her when I say she is pretty.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina rolled her eyes. “Kanae-san has a group of fans among the students of the academy and the people from the palace too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I told you. You should have more confidence in yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl just looked at the ground embarrassed and nodded her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that she was not speaking anymore, I turned my attention to Kuina. “How about you? Do you think you are closer to opening the fourth gate?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not yet. It will take some time for that or it might cause injuries.” She said as she sat down beside us. Kanae gave her a towel and she wiped off her sweat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take it easy. We don’t want you to get injured.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” She nodded. “By the way, don’t you have to go on a date with Princess Kasumi today?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Why is everyone so worried about this?” I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina shrugged. “We talked to Kasumi-chan and she was looking forward to it. We just didn’t want you to be late. That would make her sad.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>When did they talk to her?</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, I will go and have a look. By the way, how is your sword?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh this is good stuff. I am just afraid that it might break if I go to the fourth or fifth gate. I can still use it for the time being.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>That sword was the most expensive of the bunch.</p><p><br></p><p>I really need to get one of those Kusanagi Swords.</p><p><br></p><p>The Kusanagi are a group of swords rather than just one.</p><p><br></p><p>These swords were made long ago and all information about how to make them was lost in time so no more of them could be made.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of them had extremely good chakra conducting abilities and they were extremely strong too. Currently, there are only eighteen known Kusanagi Blades out there.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see.</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned the Grimoire and ordered it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Location of the Kusanagi Swords and the identities of the current owners.”</p><p><br></p><p>Six months….</p><p><br></p><p>Nope</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s try something else then.</p><p><br></p><p>“Location of the nearest five Kusanagi Swords and the identities of the current owners.”</p><p><br></p><p>Two months.</p><p><br></p><p>I reduced the number to three swords and the time became one month.</p><p><br>Just out of curiosity, I checked out the methods of making the sword and it would take one year to search. I wanted to do so but right now, I don't have the privilege of doing so. I needed to search for other things.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a thought came to my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“Location of ownerless Kusanagi Blades.”</p><p><br></p><p>Two months.</p><p><br></p><p>Ownerless Kusanagi Blades were those which had been lost in time. Even if I found one, no one would know they were with me. These were the safest choices.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, done. I will get the information in two months. Happy now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would I be happy about this? I want the sword in my hands first.” She rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this girl… not thankful at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now off you go or you will be late.” She shooed me, making my eyes twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>I took my leave from the group and left for the palace.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Here is your order of dangos, Your Highness.” The waitress served us the order and bowed deeply before stepping back out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I nodded at her and then looked at the girl in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure, this is all you want?” I asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This much is enough for me.” She said in a soft voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, give it a try. We have heard from Kuina that this place sells great dangos. It’s famous throughout the capital. We had been looking forward to trying them for a while.” I said as I picked up the dango stick and took a bite of the dumpling.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, she wasn’t lying.</p><p><br></p><p>“No wonder Kuina didn’t want to share these. These are really great.” I closed my eyes and enjoyed the delicious taste.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Your Highness very close to Kuina-sama?” Kasumi asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Close? Yes. She is our first friend as well as the first retainer selected by us. Due to this she holds a very special place in our heart.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded. “I have heard that Your Highness has lovers other than Kuina-sama and Kanae-sama. Could you tell me about them?” She asked, suddenly making me choke on my food.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly slapped my chest and she gave me a glass of water to help push down the food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lovers? No no. Kuina is more like a… well, brother to us than anything else.You should see us when we are squabbling. That girl doesn’t care about our status or wealth and could punch us in the face should we do something wrong. This is something… we appreciate. We don’t have anyone like that in our life.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “I am very envious of you for having such close friends.” She suddenly realised what she had said and her eyes widened and she apologised to me very quickly. “My apologies for speaking out of line.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to apologise. You are not out of line.” I shook my head, making her look up at me. “We can understand your feelings. In fact, we have felt it too. Having people who only approached us due to our position and wealth and not having someone to open our hearts to is not a good feeling. Do you have any good friends, Princess?”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything and just looked at the plate.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, the wrong thing to say.</p><p><br></p><p>How could I forget after reading her file?</p><p><br></p><p>To salvage the situation I put a hand on hers, making her surprised and look up at me. “It doesn’t matter what happened in the past. Now you have us. Please feel free to open up to us and we will become your friend. To begin our friendship, how about you call us by our name?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened and she opened her mouth in surprise. “I couldn’t…”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not be disrespecting us. This is our promise to you.” I reassured her.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that she was still hesitating, I took her hands in mine and looked right into her eyes. “Kasumi-san, we are engaged and are supposed to get married in a few months. But before that, we would like to know more about you. We know that you were kept here as an unofficial hostage due to that attack on us but please trust us when we say that we don’t blame you for that attack. After seeing you these days, we know that you are a very kind and caring girl and we truly wish to marry you. So please…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… Kazuya-sama.” She spoke after hesitating a bit and a smile came to my face. I pulled her hand to my lips and gave her a kiss on the knuckles.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for granting our wish, Kasumi-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just nodded still not meeting my eyes but the blush on her cheeks was reaching her ears by now.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the place after an hour and this time there was a little smile on her face as she held my hands while walking.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shiroyasha Uzumaki -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“My lady, Genshiro-sama has sent a message.” She watched as the Ninja Wolf, the summons of Genshiro, kept a scroll on the ground and one of the attendants on the side picked it up and handed it over to her.</p><p><br></p><p>While she read the document, her husband talked to the ninja wolf.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was the Land of Flowers?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very beautiful. Despite the dangers and chaos caused by the war, that place is almost untouched. The people were quite happy and while there were occasional bandits and attackers, the rulers of the Land, especially the Prince, always made sure to take care of them at the fastest speed. It’s just that they still don’t have strong enough forces to take care of everything by themselves. The Prince is training a force but they are still young and will take some time to develop fully.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The samurai he is training?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How strong would you say they are?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The children are all normal Ninja Academy Student level with a few of them getting to the Genin Level. They all practise a special style of Swordsmanship taught by some of the Prince’s direct retainers. Apart from them, the Prince has four or five personal retainers, each at the very least a Chunin level. The Prince himself trains and usually keeps his chakra hidden using some technique which even we cannot bypass. Moreover, we think he is a sensor as he never reveals any powers when any ninja is around him. Genshiro was only able to know about his true power because he used Kagura Shingan from halfway across the city and found out that the Prince had a Jōnin level chakra.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Jōnin. That’s quite good for someone of that age and he is self taught?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We found no traces of any other shinobi with them but we did find some interesting news.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>She had finished reading the document by now and decided to intervene. “The information about the engagement of the Prince with the Princess of the Stairs kingdom and how the envoy of the Princess turned out to be ninjas from the Land of Medicine who were there to steal the secrets of the Prince and even attacked them and escaped.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Prince survived and those ninjas escaped. It seems that the measures taken by the Prince to hide his power helped him out in the end.” She finished.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Land of Stairs and the Land of Medicine, isn’t the daughter of the former married off to the son of the latter?” Her husband asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. There was news about an alliance among the three Lands, the engagement being a part of that. The Land of Flowers had suspended any talks of the engagement till they got a suitable explanation from the Land of Medicines. The Daimyo of Stairs actually left the Princess as an unofficial hostage in that country to calm things down.” The summon explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems that someone is trying to break the alliance between the three Lands.” Her husband said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe. These are precarious times. We can never be sure who our allies are.” She said, recalling the information she had received from her spies about the movement of the five Great Ninja Villages.</p><p><br></p><p>The Five Great Nations might have fought among themselves for decades but they never break the balance or let a sixth power arise.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sky Nation was an example of this… and by the looks of things, they were planning to make the Uzumaki face a similar end.</p><p><br></p><p>Konoha would not make any moves if the Fire Daimyo was against helping them and if the Land of Whirlpools can be exchanged for the end of a war, it would be something which the Hokage would accept, after all, they might be allies but the Uzumaki were not exactly a part of Konoha. As the Kage, he would always choose his village’s wellbeing over the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>With the Senju Clan almost merged with the village or dead, Mito-sama at the end of her life and Kushina sent there as a replacement Jinchuriki, Konoha had no use of the Uzumaki Clan anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>They already had both the bloodlines and the knowledge of the Uzumaki, now they will try to cut their own losses from this war.</p><p><br></p><p>While some might say she is overthinking things, ninjas survived by being paranoid.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, the new higher ups of the village, the students of Tobirama Senju, weren’t like the Senju Clan because there was no way they didn’t know about the strange movements of the Kumo, Mizu and Iwa ninja, especially during wartime when they keep track of each and every movement of the enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Even she could find and guess all these with just a month long investigation.</p><p><br></p><p>Those people must be expecting the attacking armies to suffer under the Uzumaki traps and cull their numbers. They are more likely to send people after they die and use the previous ties between the villages to collect the leftovers of their heritage.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, there was nothing she could do so late in the game. If such an attack happened, the destruction of the Uzushiogakure was more or less certain although she had started making sure they would bleed in case they attacked Uzushio.</p><p><br></p><p>The best she could do for her people was to make sure that the clan doesn’t perish and can make a comeback later on.</p><p><br></p><p>She had already started moving all their knowledge away from the Land of Whirlpool and slowly shifting people away from here too.</p><p><br></p><p>They were hiding as civilians in other lands, especially the smaller nations, preferably without any shinobi villages of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>This is where the Land of Flowers came in.</p><p><br></p><p>From the information she had read, the Prince of the Land of Flowers was an ambitious person and quite smart if he was able to develop so far.</p><p><br></p><p>If she makes an alliance with him, could he hide her people?</p><p><br></p><p>He would be in just as much trouble if he is found to be harbouring a Clan hunted by the big five nations.</p><p><br></p><p>“What does Genshiro say about him? Is he trustworthy?” Her husband asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro was her caretaker and one of the best shinobi of Uzushiogakure. The main reason she had sent him there was to see if the Prince was trustworthy.</p><p><br></p><p>“He has given his approval, but… can the young Prince take this responsibility?” Her husband asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can try to talk to him directly to know.” She replied and then brought out her brush and an empty scroll and started writing a reply to Genshiro.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Two months have passed and things have begun to move again.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa had removed the trade restrictions on the Land of Medicine and the Land of Stairs after the whole situation was cleared up.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently there was news that the war had become worse.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the rumours the infamous Gold and Silver brothers had died in an ambush set up by the Third Raikage. The two brothers had been declared rogue since their attempted coup in which they killed the Second Raikage and the Second Hokage.</p><p><br></p><p>Hanzo of the Salamander was butchering the forces from both Iwa and Konoha and Iwa had wisely stepped back and let Ame and Konoha fight it out, instead choosing to attack through the Land of Grass.</p><p><br></p><p>There were both good and bad things due to this change.</p><p><br></p><p>Good thing was with Iwa fighting only on one front, they didn’t need as many supplies as before and we could save things up for ourselves. Bad was the fact that with Hanzo being forced, he was sending people to neighbouring countries to rob.</p><p><br></p><p>The one facing the full brunt of this attack was the Land of Medicine, something which I wouldn’t mind if not for the coming alliance between our lands.</p><p><br></p><p>The alliance would mean even we would be dragged into the whole mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only him, even the Land of Grass was sending people into smaller countries to rob to feed their people.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything was becoming a clusterfuck.</p><p><br></p><p>We had even captured over a dozen or so Genins and six Chunins during these two months, with the Uzumaki Trio actually lending us a hand and capturing five of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully a few good things also happened during this time.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the higher ups of the Land of Whirlpools wanted to talk to me privately to discuss an alliance.</p><p><br></p><p>I had agreed and they were to arrive here soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Second good thing was that we had just found the location of eight ownerless Kusanagi Blades. Not one or two but eight.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that adding the information of the owner increased the time required as most of the owners were shinobi too and strong ones at that whereas ownerless blades didn’t have such a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>I had noted down everything about them and handed the paper to Toji to get them.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina was the most excited one when I revealed this news, Toji himself being a close second. He was missing his own weapons from his world.</p><p><br></p><p>Third was the fact that the Genshiro-sensei actually knew about some things which I needed for some of my rituals. For example, while teaching me Fuinjutsu, he had told me about the places where several demons were rumoured to be sealed and who sealed them.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki were connected to many of these places too.</p><p><br></p><p>He also knew about the materials I would need for the next Poison Resistance Ritual and where to get them.</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, the ritual room was finally ready and I could perform my rituals as well as summonings again.</p><p><br></p><p>The last two months I hadn’t summoned more people and instead focused on summoning items which had yielded me several good things.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a bunch of potions for healing. Some of them were from other worlds too such as the Skele-Gro Potion from the Harry Potter World which can regrow bones as well as Strengthening potion which can increase the strength of the user for a certain period of time. There were also several antidotes for poisons in case anyone got poisoned.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, I had managed to summon something amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>A TAC-50 Sniper Rifle and 200 rounds. It had an effective range of 1800m and one could even shoot beyond the 2km mark with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Toji was over the moon when he saw it and since then has carried it in a storage scroll with him.</p><p><br></p><p>While killing stronger ninjas with it will be very difficult, it could take down even Jōnin if they were caught off guard and Toji would have enough time to hide or flee too. I even used Fuinjutsu on it to enhance it as much as I could.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest haul however was not these things.</p><p><br></p><p>It was actually a plant.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood Orchids.</p><p><br></p><p>I managed to summon freaking Blood Orchids from the Anaconda movies.</p><p><br></p><p>These plants had the property of increasing the vitality of those who consume it. Higher vitality leads to longer lifespans.</p><p><br></p><p>A single flower can increase up to 1-5 years of life of an average human.</p><p><br></p><p>I had scanned it with the Grimoire and even found the ideal method of growing this plant. In fact, it can even be used in some rituals but I didn’t want to use this piece. I wanted to grow more of them first before using them. It took three years for it to grow but I was willing to wait that long.</p><p><br></p><p>The profits from this plant will be just that good.</p><p><br></p><p>The last but not the least was… an egg.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>I got an egg.</p><p><br></p><p>A Pokemon Egg.</p><p><br></p><p>A freaking Pokemon Egg.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to read the Grimoire twice before confirming that it was indeed a Pokemon Egg, and not just any Pokemon Egg but the egg of a Ralts.</p><p><br></p><p>An actual Ralts.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t stopped smiling for the whole day when I summoned it. Ralts would be so good.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I had prepared several materials for the rituals.</p><p><br>I was planning to do all these rituals this month, specifically on the solstice which was just days later.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, I was planning to go after Rōen in a month and I needed every bit of power I could get.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least, my progress with Fuinjutsu was going very well. Genshiro was a very great teacher, and a master of his field. As one would expect from one of the best Uzu shinobi. His lessons were easy to understand and my progress showed this. According to him, I could reach the Advanced Level in just three months or so at this rate.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already started practising the Seal used for Rōen and had a certain degree of expertise in it. I hope to completely master it by the end of the month.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were interrupted by Kasumi’s voice. “Try this. Grandma Tsuyu from the eastern market road makes these mochi. It’s the best in the entire capital city. Kanae-san brought me some to try earlier.”</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at her, I saw her holding a mochi between her chopsticks and directly in front of my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had opened up so much since our date two months ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she smiled more and not the polite kind she did in front of others, but rather a bright smile which could make a man’s day.</p><p><br></p><p>It also made me realise how alone she was all these years and how desperately she yearned for someone to be with. She latched on to me since that day. Every time I met her, her face lit up and I knew that she was not faking this.</p><p><br></p><p>These were her genuine feelings. </p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and took a bit from the mochi before pulling her to my side, easily picking her up and placing her on my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>“K-kazuya-sama!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” I hummed as I hugged her with my arms around her waist.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was her eighteenth birthday and we were here to celebrate it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Stairs Daimyo did send some gifts but they were mostly formality. Not a single person came from the Land of Stairs citing that the war was causing problems and they were very busy.</p><p><br></p><p>So I took it upon myself to organise a party for her. Only me and my retainers, Kuina, Kanae and Seraphim were invited.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitō politely declined although he did send a gift and Toji was still out searching for the Kusanagi Blades.</p><p><br></p><p>The three girls were still buying gifts for her and that left the two of us alone as we were early here.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuina-sama, Kanae-sama and Seraphim-sama will be here at any moment.” She whispered almost inaudibly.</p><p><br></p><p>“So? Let them see how much we love our fiance.” I whispered back as I nuzzled into her neck. She gasped.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-b-but.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had never had any intimate physical contact before she met me, not any that she knew of. Not even her own mother’s love because she was too young when they died.</p><p><br></p><p>The maids treated her and brought her up and they too only did as much as they were instructed, keeping their distances.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I had first hugged her, she had completely frozen in shock and teared up. I was afraid that I did something wrong and apologised but she told me that it was actually the first time she remembered anyone hugging her. Since then whenever we were alone, I made it a point to spend time like this and she relished every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the girls often came to her and accompanied her. Surprising thing was Seraphim actually being nice to her.</p><p><br></p><p>I wouldn’t lie and say that I didn’t like it. I am a healthy boy in puberty and I was constantly surrounded by stunning girls. It would be an utter lie to say I was not interested.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing about being a Daimyo that I didn’t mind was having a harem, especially with sweet girls like the one currently in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then is it okay if we do this when we are alone?” I asked, huskily making her stutter again. There was something about girls like her and Kanae that just made me want to tease her more and more.</p><p><br></p><p>“We were just joking. You look so adorable when you are like this that we couldn’t hold ourself back.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her blush went to her ears but she stopped struggling and started caressing her head lightly as she relaxed in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, she too got used to the feelings and picked up more of the mochi and fed me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a quiet private time we both enjoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Around half an hour later, I sensed Kuina’s chakra coming nearer and picked her up and placed her back on her seat. “They are coming.” I replied at her confused look.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened as she quickly fixed her yukata, making me smirk at her actions.</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened a moment after she finished rearranging her clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Many many happy returns of the day, Kasumi-chan.” Kuina wished before stopping at the blushing princess and then looked at me with narrowed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I just shrugged and she shifted her attention back to the princess.</p><p><br></p><p>We got together to celebrate.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Things are progressing.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Uzumaki are here and now they are not that trusting of Konoha.</strong></p><p><strong><br>What end are they going to meet this time around?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the other hand, Kazuya is building a good relationship with Kasumi and Kanae, while Sera behaves like an awkward tsuntsun around him… and everyone.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br></p>",

During this time, all of us decided to level up our skills since we had free time.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena got to her crafting and I got busy with my swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine had taken a Tailor Class on the side and Shiroe was levelling his Scribe skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Star had taken a Peddler Class on the side so he couldn’t level it right now so he was also working on his Sword Skills till we got down.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Shiroe had bought several maps from the shops telling us about surrounding lands and we were talking to other people on the ship to find out information and quests we could get.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s why I was here, getting the captain of the ship drunk so that I could get some useful information out of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“We sail on the endless blues. No one knows how big these oceans are, for no one has ever conquered it.” The captain said as he smoked from his cigar. “No, there was a man, one man like no other…” With that he shook his head and didn’t say anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this as a chance to pour him his drink and he smiled at me, taking a sip of his drink and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was a man who sailed across the whole world, saw everything the world had to show, and gained every treasure the world had to offer… the man looked up to by man and hated by even more, some called him a hero while others called him a pirate but one thing both these groups agreed on was that… he was a King.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“The King of Pirates, Gold Roger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah.” I could only deadpan at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>Because why not?</p><p><br></p><p>There was already the Sabaody Archipelago so why not other One Piece characters?</p><p><br></p><p>“He was captured but even at the end of his life, he started the Great Pirate Age, with just a few words, the news that he had left all his treasures in One Piece, the Ultimate Treasure of the world. Even now, thousands of people every year go out to the sea to search for that mythical treasure but to no avail.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man went on rambling as he was getting more and more drunk.</p><p><br></p><p>I then asked him about different places in the nearby islands and found out that around a month away was Loguetown, the birthplace of Gold Roger.</p><p><br></p><p>There were mentions of many other places which I knew like Water Seven, the biggest ship making centre of the world, Reverse Mountain, even the nation of Giants, Elbaf.</p><p><br></p><p>I totally had to go to Loguetown because I knew there would be many references I could make there.</p><p><br></p><p>I still hadn’t made references from any of the Big three in my previous life. In fact, I had found that just randomly blabbering the references didn’t help. We had to be in specific places or situations for them to work.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I kept an eye out for any news of places which could be used for references. My memory of my previous life was also not perfect so there might be things I miss but I think my memory is improving the more I level up.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the man further about the seas and found that there was indeed a World Government in this world, but it was on another continent beyond the Reverse Mountain and was very hard to reach at our level.</p><p><br></p><p>“What other races are there in the seas?” I asked. “I mean, apart from Humans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Races? There are many. Giants, Long legs, Fishmen, Mermaids, etc. There are even stories of Gods in the seas.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please.” I calmly poured him another drink and he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“In one particular legend, Davy Jones was a great sailor until he fell in love with the sea goddess Calypso. He would be given the Flying Dutchman as well as the sacred task of ferrying souls who died at sea to the worlds beyond. Because of that love, Davy Jones agreed to set foot on land once every ten years, where Jones would be free to be with Calypso. But when Davy Jones came ashore after his ten year duty, he was forsaken by Calypso, who was nowhere to be found.”</p><p><br></p><p>….now, I don’t know anything anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Pirates of the Caribbean world is mashed up with One Piece?</p><p><br></p><p>Just what kind of special hell has the Game Master created in this place?</p><p><br></p><p>The man however was unbothered by my inner turmoil and continued. “So, Davy Jones plotted with other pirates to tear the rule of the seas away from Calypso, in which they imprisoned her into the body of a mortal woman. However Davy Jones was drowned by his own guilt so he left her as it is.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took another sip from his glass and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Abandoning his duty, Davy Jones then returned to the seven seas, only now sailors everywhere would fear him to the death, for Jones had turned fierce and cruel, with an insatiable taste for all things brutal. He became a nightmarish creature; half human, half sea beast, a crab claw for an arm, and a beard made of octopus tentacles. As the legendary ruler of the ocean depths, Davy Jones preys on wayward sailors lost at sea with the Flying Dutchman, now a cursed ghost ship. It’s a story mothers tell their children to make them sleep. But little do they know all the stories about Davy Jones… are true… cough cough.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was getting tipsy by now but was lost in his storytelling so I took advantage of the situation too.  “Jones also commands the Kraken, an ancient and horrible squid-like beast of the sea, which brings the captain of the Dutchman ever more souls into joining his crew. Those who wish to avoid death and final judgement agree to serve Jones aboard his haunted vessel, eventually becoming a part of the ship itself, forever enslaved to its terrifying captain.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what? Is Davy Jones real?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Absolutely. Although only a fairy tale in these parts of the world, beyond the Reverse Mountain, in the <em>real</em> seas, he is as real as it gets. He even has a bounty put on his head, a bounty only matched by the Pirate King Roger till now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So all those stories about him are real? Even the part about him locking up a Goddess? Does that mean Gods exist in this world?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>And if they did, what Tier would they be?</p><p><br></p><p>“There are many legends in the seas about Gods, be it the legend of the Sun God Nika, the liberator of seas or the Sea Goddess Calypso, the fickle Goddess who brings wealth and ruin on her whims. As for whether that’s true? Who knows my boy, who knows…”</p><p><br></p><p>….damn.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am in some kind of a mismatched world of Pirates of the Caribbean and One Piece, and perhaps even more worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Scared of the seas?” He smirked, perhaps at the look on my face. “I don’t blame you? Most of the people I have told these stories have completely given up the idea of going into the seas. I don’t blame them. It’s dangerous out there.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man and smiled, thinking of something. “When you told me these stories intending to scare me off, you forgot one thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, what’s that?”</p><p><br></p><p>My smirk widened. “I’m Captain Jack Sparrow.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+9 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+18% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Map of All Treasures</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>[Map of All Treasures]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A piece of parchment which shows the location of a treasure randomly. The map on the parchment changes every month.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at the reward and the man looked dumbly at me before laughing on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a nice one, brat. Just don’t let anyone else hear you calling yourself that. Jack Sparrow is a wanted man by both pirates and the World Government. People could be after your head just for the slightest clue about his current whereabouts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, I’ll mind that. Do you perhaps have any maps of the nearby islands? Perhaps Loguetown?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wanna go to the town of beginnings and the ends? Sure, I can help ya. Just ask me when I am sober. Now, off you go. I need to take a nap.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man sent me off and I was happy enough with today’s gain.</p><p><br></p><p>Hope Shiroe has found something in the meantime too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Akeno Himejima -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Be careful, Akatsuki-chan!” She warned as she used a Heal Spell, healing a chunk of the girl’s health as the girl parried a blow from the monster which sent her skidding back several metres.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oryaa!” Naotsugu-kun covered her as the monster tried to go after her, coming in between them and using his Shield Drive Skill to throw the monster back and stun it temporarily.</p><p><br></p><p>Marielle swiftly used several of her buffs on them to increase their stats and then fired a magic arrow towards the monster.</p><p><br></p><p>Akatsuki-chan took this opportunity to get back into the fight and quickly used her backstab skill and triple stab skill to do massive damage on the enemy and finish it off.</p><p><br></p><p>She used a quick ‘Detect Life’ spell and didn’t find anyone else in the vicinity.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was the last of them. We can take a break now.” She instructed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Phew. This round was tiring.” Marielle slumped down on the ground and Akatsuki-chan cleaned her blade before sitting down too.</p><p><br></p><p>“You tell me. That monster had four health bars. Four and it wasn’t even a boss. Have mini bosses started becoming stronger now?” Naotsugu said as he checked the loot. “Hey! We got a Skill Book. Double Slash, a Skill for a sword user. Too bad we don’t have any sword users in our group.”</p><p><br></p><p>Akatsuki-chan used knives.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can auction it later or we might keep some for new team members. We need more front liners.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. No offence to Shorty but Thief isn’t exactly a front liner. Our offence is lacking due to this. We need to hire.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can put up a notice on the Adventurer’s Guild Board and see if we can hire anyone.” She suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“That sounds like a great plan. Let’s do it today. It’s almost evening anyway and it’s time for us to go back.”</p><p><br></p><p>All of them collected the drops and left back for the town.</p><p><br></p><p>Things had changed after the raid.</p><p><br></p><p>Monsters had changed and become stronger, making their usual hunting grounds hard to traverse. More monsters were using Skills and Magic now which kept them on their toes to safely hunt here.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the raid, everyone had started forming groups and while their group was quite famous, not many top players were willing to join them.</p><p><br></p><p>The main reason was that they didn’t want to waste their time and money on the welfare stuff they usually did, like helping the children of the town or donating to the orphanages. Due to this very reason, they didn’t have any new teammates.</p><p><br></p><p>Their team desperately needed another frontliner.</p><p><br></p><p>Naotsugu-kun was good, very good at what he did but he couldn’t hold everyone back by himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Akatsuki-chan could do highly damaging moves but she wasn’t someone who could stop the enemy head on.</p><p><br></p><p>Both her and Marielle were not damage dealers.</p><p><br></p><p>Like this, their team was heavily unbalanced and while it wasn’t that much of a problem Pre-Raid, they were feeling the difference now that things were becoming harder.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, all set.” Marielle pinned the new application on the board and they looked at it.</p><p><br></p><p>‘The Crescent Moon Alliance is recruiting a front liner. T3 or above apply only. Join us, we have milk and cookies.’</p><p><br></p><p>Under it were the details of the applicant and their team.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled at the last bit. It was exactly Marielle's style to write something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. I am starving.” Marielle pouted and the rest of the group followed her.</p><p><br></p><p>They had hired help from among the people of the town to run the makeshift children’s home their group was running.</p><p><br></p><p>Five people were hired to cook, clean and teach the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the things they made from their Production Classes, they were collected and sold at a store they had opened. The earnings were used to buy equipment for the kids as well as maintain the whole place. The five volunteers were all NPCs as no other player had come up.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it’s not like no one had come up.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some people but when they had spied on them, they were found to be embezzling the funds to buy equipment for themselves and were promptly kicked out.</p><p><br></p><p>Naotsugu-kun had beaten them up and taken all their equipment, sold them and gotten the money back.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few such attempts were foiled and the culprits punished in the same way, the rest of the players got the message and never tried anything.</p><p><br></p><p>But this also meant that no other players joined their group or even came forward to help the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure some people came and donated some money for the kids once in a while but no one actively came to join in their group.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are back!” Mari shouted as soon as she opened the door to the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mari-onee chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Big Sis.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Big Bro, Naotsugu!”</p><p><br></p><p>Several kids ran out to greet them.</p><p><br></p><p>While Mari and Naotsugu went on to play with them, she went aside and checked on the store and today’s earnings.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this everything?” She asked Nina, an NPC they had hired to staff the shop. She had experience in managing a shop. In fact, she was the assistant and granddaughter of the shop owner of the beginner’s village she had been sent to.</p><p><br></p><p>They knew each other well enough to know of her loyalty. Her grandfather wanted to send her to the town to teach her more about managing a shop and thus she hired her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We have three new orders. Two of them are usual but the third one wanted us to work on a deadline with compensation to them if we cannot complete the order on time.” Nina said with a slight frown on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Compensation?” She narrowed her eyes. “Who were the ones who ordered this? Did you accept the order?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Nina shook her head. “It was the Dark Fiends group. I didn’t accept their order and said that I would need to talk with you all before answering.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those people…</p><p><br></p><p>Dark Fiends were the top scorers in the recent raid. They had used this temporary fame to attract many people to their group and were currently an unofficial guild of sorts in this town.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, establishing a Guild was not that easy.</p><p><br></p><p>When they had seen the global announcements right after the raid, many people had tried to find out the requirements to establish a Guild but were severely disappointed to find out the results.</p><p><br></p><p>A T6 or a T5 with a million Gold Coins…</p><p><br></p><p>None of the two were something they could achieve anytime soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the best players in the town were only projected to reach T5 in another three or four months.</p><p><br></p><p>No one knew how the Guild Master of Fairy Tail had done it.</p><p><br></p><p>Some thought he must have gained some super rare skill, class or equipment while some just claimed him to be a cheater. But there was one thing everyone agreed on… the Guild Master of Fairy Tail is the strongest player in the game as of now.</p><p><br></p><p>And the difference between them would only grow as they would definitely have the extra advantage of guild perks.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>It was no use thinking about those things. They had to concentrate on what was in front of them right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the Dark Fiends group wanted to make such a deal.</p><p><br></p><p>Their leader Clyde was not a good person.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno had seen the looks he had thrown at her when he tried to invite her and Marielle to their group.</p><p><br></p><p>They had obviously rejected their invitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Their group had almost half of the top ten members from the raid and each of them were among the top ten ratings despite having classes unsuitable for direct damage in the raids.</p><p><br></p><p>In terms of skills, they far surpassed the other side and that’s why they kept a distance despite the rejection. So… what had changed for them to make this kind of request?</p><p><br></p><p>She thought of it and asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of compensation were they asking for?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Discounted price for the items. They wanted a thirty percent discount on the prices of the items if we couldn’t provide them with the order on time.” Nina replied.</p><p><br></p><p>A thirty percent discount?</p><p><br></p><p>They had a profit margin of twenty five percent. A thirty percent discount would mean they had to pay for the order from their own pockets.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly an idea struck her mind. “Did they say that they would provide the ingredients?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No but they were paying ten percent more than others.” Nina replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah… so it was that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Reject them.” She replied decisively. “And never accept such orders. We have a shop. The only things we sell will be the things we have on hand. If they want more, they can come back later and if they are so hell bent on placing advance orders, then we will not pay any compensation if we are late. We have opened this place to provide a place for the kids to get a better life. We are not going to turn them into forced labour here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nina nodded. “But the Dark Fiends?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They will do nothing because they can do nothing in the town. Those bastards were probably going to pull something to delay the order, probably disturb our hunting team, or maybe do something to the kids so that they could buy the order at a reduced price. If we accept the order, it would be taking a bait and asking them to attack us. Reject them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Also, tell the rest to keep an eye on the kids and not to let them go out of the town.” She said after some thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Nina agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the matter, Akeno-chan? You sound so serious. Did something happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>Just as she finished, a voice sounded behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mari-san? It’s…” She explained the situation to her and saw a rare expression on Mari’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Your decision was correct. Don’t worry yourselves about this. We will take care of everything.” She reassured her.</p><p><br></p><p>They had dinner with everyone and rested for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno looked at the ceiling wondering how the rest of her friends were doing before falling asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Taking on that boss is a bit out of our league for now. We need to be at least mid T4 to even try.” Akatsuki-chan said.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded too.</p><p><br></p><p>“We might need some more people too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even after their request, no one has been approaching them.</p><p><br></p><p>It had gone beyond them just finding it inconvenient as they never force anyone to contribute towards helping the kids out. On asking the Guild staff, she found out that many had shown interest in the request but they had all refused on the same day.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone… was working behind the scenes to push those people away from their team.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as they were talking they heard a voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Looking behind them, they saw a guy standing behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>He had blonde hair and blue eyes, wearing glasses. He carried a sword on his side and was wearing a light armour.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I just saw a request on the board and was told that it was your group who posted the request for a Squire or Swordsman. I am a Squire and have recently come to this town. I was wondering if I could join your group.” The guy requested, his face showing slight surprise when he saw her.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he know her?</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh hello, please join us.” Mari invited him to join. “What is your name? What level are you?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy brought an extra chair to their table and sat down with them.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Arthur. I am a level 5 Squire.”</p><p><br></p><p>A level five?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s… quite low even for casual players.</p><p><br></p><p>“Level 5 is a bit on the lower end but no problem. We can always level up. Getting the class you can play well is more important. Are you comfortable with playing as a Squire?” She asked. “Do you have any plans for the future classes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I wish to pursue sword based classes like Knight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that’s perfect. Nao-kun here is a Knight and is planning to become a Shield Knight. If you become a Sword Knight, it will be a perfect balance for the team. Let me introduce you to our team and tell us a few things about ourselves.”</p><p><br></p><p>For the rest of the day, they talked to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>They found out that Arthur was a relatively inexperienced player. He probably had to switch several classes before finding one he was most comfortable with.</p><p><br></p><p>It would explain his low level. In this aspect she was lucky as she had a set idea on what she wanted to become and later on with the help of her friends, she was able to avoid drifting off in unnecessary directions. Arthur seemed to be one of the unluckier ones who didn’t have this help and thus his current condition.</p><p><br></p><p>Even his equipment was low levelled. She originally thought that he might be here to mooch off to get better equipment but he rejected any monetary help and only accepted Naotsugu’s extra weapons when he was told that he would need it to keep up his damage output to help the team, promising to pay him back.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, everyone agreed to accept the new member.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>A week had passed and their team was doing quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>Their new member, Arthur, turned out to be an extremely good swordsman. He could keep up with strong enemies even without any skill, just with his swordsmanship alone.</p><p><br></p><p>It was something which both intrigued and bothered Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>How was someone like him just a level 5 before meeting them?</p><p><br></p><p>He had gained an average of one level per day since joining them. Even when everyone rested, he continued practising his Skills or doing quests on the side.</p><p><br></p><p>In just a week, he had paid Naotsugu back for his equipment and was now working on slowly improving his existing ones.</p><p><br></p><p>The progress and talent he had shown could have gotten him a place in any team, in fact, he could have been one of the top players in the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, something about the way he moved told her that he was not a novice.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur was trained and not just casually either.</p><p><br></p><p>He was trained in real combat. His moves were sharper than Yuuto’s, similar to Souji-sama’s, from the times she had seen him fight.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way he was someone common. If so then, what exactly was his goal?</p><p><br></p><p>Until now, everyone liked their new member.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a straight laced man, very much like Yuuto, a perfect knight in his skills and behaviour. Even Akatsuki-chan who was generally wary of new people liked him and appreciated him.</p><p><br></p><p>Naotsugu, although often annoying him, got along well with him, especially during fights when they seamlessly complemented each other without even talking.</p><p><br></p><p>Mari was worried about him because he was always pushing himself too hard and that’s why she often sent someone from the team to accompany him when he hunted overtime.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was her turn and they were returning back from the hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who exactly are you, Arthur?” She asked as they saw the gates of the town in the distance. “You are obviously not someone inexperienced who doesn’t know anything about the game. Then why are you so low levelled and why exactly have you approached us?” She asked, while keeping a spell ready in case things went bad.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still far above his level to assure that she could take him down but one could never be sure as the other side could have some kind of trump card, some item of some kind of skill.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy stopped and then breathed out a sigh. “I haven’t lied about anything. My name is indeed Arthur and I approached your team because I saw your request at the guild. I needed a party to work with as progressing solo is nigh impossible at this stage of the game.” He confessed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your moves are not of a player. You are trained in combat, not even simple combat. What exactly is your identity?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Isn’t it good manners to introduce yourself before asking others for their identities… Priestess of Lightning, the Queen of Rias Gremory, Akeno Himejima?” He said, looking directly into her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened and she jumped back, summoning her staff in front of her, ready to make a move.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy however didn’t make any moves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just shrugged. “I guess since the cat’s already out of the bag then there’s no point in hiding it either. My name’s Arthur… Arthur Pendragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth hung open at the name.</p><p><br></p><p>“The reason I am here is to find my little sister who is stuck in this game and bring her out. The reason I am so low level is because I joined the game just a month or so earlier. As for why I joined this team, I really didn’t know you were a part of the team. I saw their request and joined them since they seemed to be a good party from the information I got about them. My only goal is to become stronger and find my sister and friends in this game and bring them out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait wait, you entered this game a month ago but that’s… Why is no one trying to stop this game from the outside? You are from the Pendragon family so why haven’t you or anyone else from the supernatural side has done anything to stop this game? Why hasn’t Sirzechs-sama or any of the Satans done anything even after such a long time?” She asked hurriedly.</p><p><br></p><p>A look of resignation came up on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“The reason they haven’t done anything is because… they couldn’t do anything, because at this point, no one dares to do anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>He then proceeded to tell her everything that had happened in the outside world. The Game Master, the end of Rizevim Livan Lucifer, the warning given to everyone in the Supernatural side and the current state of things.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Three Factions under a temporary truce, are working together and have sent many people inside the game with the purpose of completing the game and rescuing people stuck inside, including the little sister of Sirzechs Lucifer and her peerage as well as his mother Venelana Gremory and Queen Grayfia Lucifuge.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Venelana-sama and Grayfia are inside too?” She exclaimed, stunned at the reveal. “But why would they…”</p><p><br></p><p>Her words got stuck in her mouth as she remembered Rias suggesting Venelana-sama to play the game and her saying that she has been bored and actually giving it a try.</p><p><br></p><p>Did they actually…</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur continued. “Even your father was about to join the people entering the game and would have definitely entered had it not been for Azazel personally holding him back.”</p><p><br></p><p>She froze at the words and then a frown came to her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t wish to talk about my father.” She replied coldly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, my apologies. I understand. In fact, I am no longer part of the Pendragon family either. My sister and I left the Pendragon family around a year ago so please just call me Arthur.”</p><p><br></p><p>They talked for another hour and she agreed to work with him as long as he didn’t betray them. They made a truce to work together to find their friends.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s all I was able to get from the Knight Commander.” Henrietta reported, making her think.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is the news confirmed?” She asked after some time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It was obtained from the Captain of the Imperial Knights who came to reward us after the Raid. He himself was planning to change into this class. This is a very good opportunity, Rias…”</p><p><br></p><p>Indeed, it was a massive opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>The way to obtain a T7 Class. Even in the black market, the news would cost at least ten million gold coins.</p><p><br></p><p>Methods to reach T6 Class were still known and in cases, even distributed by the Guilds and the countries.</p><p><br></p><p>The only restrictions were the number of achievements one had which basically meant they had to complete a certain number of missions before they could even take on the Class Change quest as soon as they were at the level cap.</p><p><br></p><p>All this changed however as soon as it came to the T7 Classes.</p><p><br></p><p>There was almost no information about these classes. Not even in the black markets. It was for this reason that there were so few T7 people in the entire country, with the King being a T8 and one of the strongest people on the continent.</p><p><br></p><p>If it was true, which it really looked like it was then…</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the information again. The T7 Class, Paladin.</p><p><br></p><p>They were the upgraded class of the Holy Knights, the strongest weapons under the King. Only a handful of people could be called one.</p><p><br></p><p>One needed to get a Knight and a Cleric Class to get a Templar Class which can then be upgraded to the Holy Knight and finally the Paladin.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think we should try to get this. After all, we have nothing to lose. If we can indeed get to T7, it would be a great help to our team.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Should we sell the information? We can get a lot of coins and might even be able to buy a Guild Order.” Ley Fay asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Henrietta shook her head. “The Knight Commander said that the number of Paladins was very low and recently one of them had died. It was due to this that the guy was so confident in becoming one himself. We never know if there is a fixed number of these Classes. I think we should wait till one of us becomes a Paladin first before selling the news to the Black Market.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded at the suggestion too.</p><p><br></p><p>Guild Order…</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was chasing after the Guild Orders from the time they had heard the Global Announcement. The First Player established Guild, Fairy Tail…</p><p><br></p><p>Just how in the world had they done it?</p><p><br></p><p>Become a T5 while most of the players hadn’t even reached T4…</p><p><br></p><p>It had shaken them all as they had thought that their progress was among the top in their town.</p><p><br></p><p>With the experience of Chief Nyanta and the management skills of Henrietta from her previous game, they had been working quite well, even establishing a group, preparing to establish a guild down the line.</p><p><br></p><p>Their group had done everything to the best of their abilities and there were hardly any places she could think of which could be improved and yet…</p><p><br></p><p>How was it even possible? Did Fairy Tails Guildmaster cheat?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it even possible to cheat in this game?</p><p><br></p><p>Chief Nyanta however had denied it.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, they must have discovered some kind of glitch to abuse and get to a higher level. There could also be the fact that they had a good strategist and finally… something which irked everyone to accept… they were just that much better than the rest of the players worldwide.</p><p><br></p><p>Her thoughts were broken by Henrietta’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then comes the question of who will become the Paladin.” Henrietta asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Chief Nyanta, you should become one. You are our frontline fighter.” She said after some thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think it would suit me. I am more of a swordsman, a swashbuckler. The playstyle of a Knight is very different from mine. Moreover, they seem to be a hybrid class who can use magic too. Not really my cup of tea.” He shook his head. “Not to mention, I would have to train from the scratch to get everything. I think the one who has at least one class in common should become a Paladin so that way we don’t have to level them up more than required. After all, it takes a lot of time to get either Cleric or Knight Classes.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and fell in thought. His reasons were on point and she couldn’t really argue with it.</p><p><br>Cleric had similar requirements as a mage. The only thing is that they had to register in the Church to achieve it.</p><p><br></p><p>Their group already had two mages, Ley Fay and herself so they were the most suitable ones to pick up the Paladin Class quest.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Ley Fay and asked her but the girl denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not sure I can fight in the close quarters.” She said and Rias didn’t want to make her do it either.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. I will take the Cleric Class and then start from the Squire Class after that. We are going to be working overtime to catch up. Chief, can I ask you to instruct me in swordsmanship? I am a complete novice at that.”</p><p><br>“I’ll be honoured.” The man smiled at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>She left the gates of Church, feeling very complicated inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Never had she imagined that she would be going to the Church, and registering to become a member…</p><p><br></p><p>The Princess of the Gremory House, the Crimson Haired Ruin Princess, the little sister of Lucifer… a Cleric of the Church… yes. It sounded odd.</p><p><br></p><p>Although this Church was dedicated to some fantasy God instead of the Biblical one, still the feeling didn’t subside at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Could this be some trap of the Heaven side? She could actually see the Church doing this… especially after what they had done with Kiba…</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, that would probably start another Great War if they had trapped many people inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, maybe some exile from the Church then?</p><p><br></p><p>The Cleric Class had opened up for her and it had basic healing and support skills but she didn’t need to level it up. Templar only needed one to have the Class, not be at full level.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she would have loved to level it up and gain more Skills, they didn’t exactly have the time. She had to level up the Squire Class too.</p><p><br></p><p>She was met by Koneko outside the church.</p><p><br></p><p>“Buchou, is it done?” She asked and Rias nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. We need to level up the Squire Class too. I don’t want to drag the team behind due to my level.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The next two and half weeks they had pushed themselves into grinding, even staying out day and night for days straight to level up.</p><p><br></p><p>With their cooperation, her level had increased to level 15 of Squire.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting on the frontlines was a completely different experience.</p><p><br></p><p>While she had been trained in martial arts, it was just the basics. Devils had better physiques than humans. Even Low Class Devils were better than the best athletes in terms of physical capabilities. Moreover, Pure Blooded Devils always concentrated on their magical prowess more.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, there were some exceptions like cousin Sairaorg but they were what they were… exceptions, not the rule.</p><p><br></p><p>As the King of her peerage, she had always concentrated on staying back and commanding because the moment she falls, the game is over.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why suddenly changing to the frontlines, especially using swords was a completely new experience for her.</p><p><br></p><p>There were times when she was surprised by the change in pace of the battle.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones in the front lines had to observe and adjust to the change in pace in a completely different manner than someone who was supporting or damaging from the back like a Mage who had a wider view of things from the back where they didn’t have to worry about being attacked so often.</p><p><br></p><p>It had taken her many battles to appreciate and get herself adjusted into the role.</p><p><br></p><p>When they were not hunting, she had to spar with Koneko and Chief to get used to using a sword. At the end of two weeks, she had a decent grasp of her skills and it showed in their hunts. She was able to anticipate the attacks and respond to them much better than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Although it might take time, she was going to master this class to the best of her abilities.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Here’s what I got.” I dumped a bunch of maps on Shiroe’s table. “The captain was quite amiable when drunk. He even allowed me to borrow some of his maps to copy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe took a look at the bundle and opened them one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>“Most of them are sea charts. There are some maps for other islands but I don’t recognise most of the names.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because they are countries beyond the Reverse Mountain.” I told him the story which the captain had told me and saw his face blanch at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gods, seriously? That has to be some high level raid if what the captain said was true.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably. There’s also the treasure of the Pirate King Roger. I think we should at least take a look at Loguetown.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s another week from here. You sure you want to go there?” he asked to which I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, we can go there directly from Sabaody then. The One Piece does sound like a huge quest of sorts. We might be able to find some clues in the birthplace of Roger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is called the town of Beginnings and Ends after all.” I said, laughing at my own joke.</p><p><br></p><p>“True. Anyways, I was able to talk to some sailors and found out the method of getting the Sailing related Classes. We would need one if we plan to explore the seas in the future.” He said. “I am pretty sure there would be many quests in the seas. Even just now, the One Piece questline and the Davy Jones questline seem like big deals to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We should also find a way to sell our products, especially the healing items to other countries. I just found out from some traders on board that they are in very high demand in other countries. Most of these traders buy them from here and sell them at high price on Sabaody or even directly have contacts with other countries.” Star said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh, finally using that trader class.” I joked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, who would have thought it was so difficult to level it up. No wonder no one tries it. We cannot just kill mobs to level it up but actually need to trade.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The skills are well worth it, dear.” Veena interjected.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… yeah. Can’t deny that.” He agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have asked around some traders from other lands too. The country we live in is famous for its healing items. A nearby country of Kal Kohldur is a country famous for their blacksmithing skills. Likewise, each country has their own products they are famous for and the price of these things are lower in those countries and the quality is higher too. Although we would need to have a trade permit to start that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And how do we get those?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh that’s easy. All you need to do is write a letter and mark it with your seal and give it to Star. Someone with a Trader Class needs to get the verification and letter of recommendation from a noble. Any noble rank will suffice.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we can?”</p><p><br>“Yes. We can and will be using this method to sell our healing items in Sabaody tomorrow. We level up Star’s new Class and earn profits at the same time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then let’s do just that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, it was Elaine who added. “Sabaody is not a good place. There are frequent kidnappings and the people kidnapped are often sold as slaves in the very auction houses of the island. These Auction Houses are backed up by bigwigs of all surrounding nations so no one can do anything to them.” She said, a bit disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, that sounded just about right. The Sabaody in my memories was just like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think they will do that to other players too?” She asked after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her blankly. “Not to be rude but you remember the situation you were in when we saved you.” I said and her face blanched. “If the game can do <em>that</em> then I don’t see why it would hold back on anything else. I mean they have been killing people from the first day of the game. For all intents and purposes, we are just like any other NPC in the game.”</p><p><br></p><p>A sombre look came to everyone’s faces as we discussed the rest of the plans for the day and then left off for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was quite harsh of you, quite unlike your usual self.” Veena said as we undressed and got into the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “I don’t want her to keep thinking that we are some kind of heroes inside the game and suffer later due to this thinking. It’s been proved over and over again that the Game Master will not hold back when it comes to testing us. The sooner she gets this idea down her head, the better it is for her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, maybe but you forget that unlike us, she has had a much lesser time to adjust. It’s reasonable to have some hesitation and doubts.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Yes. I just… I will apologise to her tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Remembered the Goblin cave?”</p><p><br></p><p>If Sabaaody was anything like the one in my memories, then it was worse than the Goblin cave and I didn’t want any of my team members to go there with such naive thoughts. Still, I guess I was a bit too harsh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. We have been working so hard to avoid any such a thing. Believe in your hard work.” She reassured me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, enough of all this. We will be landing on Sabaody tomorrow and who knows when we might get some alone time. You will not be sleeping until you satisfy me tonight.” She said as she climbed on top of me.</p><p><br></p><p>A smile came to my face. “Yes Ma’am.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, I worked to satisfy her… which was not an easy task.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was relentless.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Dammit. He wasn’t supposed to have guards with him.” She cursed as she ran through the narrow passages in the slums, changing her clothes while doing so to throw off the people chasing her.</p><p><br></p><p>She gulped down a healing potion and felt the pain in her gut calming down for a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>The bleeding effect was still there and would probably last for some time. She also felt the effect of the poison slowly catch up.</p><p><br></p><p>It was supposed to be a normal mission but who would have thought that it was actually a trap.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly jumped into one of the garbage dumps and burrowed under the bunch of thrown food, the stench assaulting her nose but she held on.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the people chasing her didn’t look there and ran forward.</p><p><br></p><p>She still stayed there for another hour and then left the place, sneaking away through another route to the place they lived.</p><p><br></p><p>“Open up, Gaspy. Be quick.” She knocked quickly, feeling her consciousness fade. The antidote she had used couldn’t fully cure the poison.</p><p><br></p><p>She would probably need a higher tier antidote.</p><p><br></p><p>The door was opened and the blondie’s nose twitched visibly. “k-k-kuroka -san! What happened to you?” He quickly moved aside and walked into the bath, finally throwing up the vomit she had been holding back.</p><p><br></p><p>Gaspy quickly put water to heat for her to bathe but she wasn’t going to bear the stench any longer and poured cold water on herself, scrubbing herself with all the soap she could get her hands on.</p><p><br></p><p>“K-kuroka-san, are you alright?” She heard the voice outside </p><p><br></p><p>Controlling her pain,she replied. “Gaspy. I will need a T4 Antidote or a bunch of healing potions. I have been badly poisoned and cannot move.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Whaaaa! What should I do, Kurokaaa-sannnn?” The boy cried.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid I can only rely on you Gaspy. You will have to help me out with this or I don’t know if I will make it.”</p><p><br></p><p>She somehow opened the door with a towel wrapped around her and struggled down to the couch and crashed there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuroka-san, Kuroka-sannnn!”</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to reply but couldn’t hold back any longer as the comfort of the couch enveloped her and fell unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes opened and she saw the familiar ceiling of her hideout.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside her bed was Gaspy, sitting in his makeshift coffin.</p><p><br></p><p>She checked her status and her health was full, all injuries were healed.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long was I out?” She got up and stretched her body.</p><p><br></p><p>The movements were enough to wake up Gasper too and he quickly jumped up. “Kuroka-sann, are you alright? Are you alright now? I am sorryyyyy I couldn’t find the antidotes. They were out of it in the shop.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? You went out?” She asked, truly surprised at the news.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I-I did. I am sorrryyy I couldn’t get the antidote.” He apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to cry. I am alright. Huh, how am I alright then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I bought Healing potions and kept feeding you till the Poisoned Status effect disappeared.” He answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… that works? Wait, how long was I out for? How long was I poisoned? I am starving right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“T-t-three days. You were poisoned for three days. Your poisoned effect disappeared yesterday.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Three days! Wait, you kept feeding me potions for three days? Where did you even get so many potions from?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorryyyyy! I used up my savings and bought everything in the shop.” He answered quickly, leaving her frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>“You used up your savings?” She asked, in a low voice, feeling slightly warm at his words. Gasper had a very <em>sizable</em> saving, having used it on nothing till now.</p><p><br></p><p>To think he would not only go out alone to the shop but also use up all his hard earned savings for her. A simple look at the side of the room showed the dozens of bottles that lay there.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled him into a hug. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehhhh!” The boy shrieked as she brought him to her lap.</p><p><br></p><p>On asking further, he told her about what he had done while she was asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that he had actually forced himself to face his fears and go out but the shops were closed so he had asked around and found another player who told him that there were no antidotes and that he could save her by using this method.</p><p><br></p><p>A frown marred her face when she found out that that bastard had actually tricked him to buy the potions at double the price, tricking the poor boy due to his nervousness.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what that player looked like? What his name and level was?” She asked in a kind tone. She was planning to go out and collect interest after she had a good meal. From both that player and the assassins who attacked her.</p><p><br></p><p>She will not allow anyone to take advantage of her little brother and herself. No matter player or NPC.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of SAO.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was asked to explore more about what the other people in the Game were doing so I decided this chapter to show that.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Everyone has their own challenges and decisions to make which will make them grow in different ways.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The game will change everyone, for better or for worse.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Isekai Restaurant </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 15: Archdaemon</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up to the feeling of softness on both sides of my chest. Opening my eyes, I saw blonde and cherry blossom coloured hair in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>On one side of me was Lavy, like usual, in my shirt and on the other side was Shuna, in a thin kimono.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, how did it come to this?</p><p><br></p><p>That evolution had brought a lot of changes to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hoping Sakura and Lavy wouldn’t notice but I wouldn’t have such useless wishes had I seen myself in a mirror even once.</p><p><br></p><p>My height had increased by an inch and my body was now leaner and sharper than before. The changes might not be obvious for someone who didn’t know me that well but was obvious to someone who knew me even relatively well.</p><p><br></p><p>A few tests showed that my power had increased by leaps and bounds. A Daemon Chevailler wasn’t even in the same league as an Archdaemon.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say that both the girls had noticed the changes the very second they saw me and started fretting over me.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me reassuring them for a full hour before they calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>They had seen me laying on Shuna’s lap when they returned and so, Lavy of all people invited Shuna to have a sleepover. The real surprise was Sakura actually encouraging her too.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, Shuna had already known about Lavy sleeping with me. She had even seen her with my shirt on my bed so she wasn’t as surprised as the first time but she was embarrassed. I felt a bit awkward too.</p><p><br></p><p>Just yesterday I had confessed to and slept with Lavy and today she was bringing another girl, a girl she knew had feelings for me to our bed.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t kidding about all that yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the blushing oni princess, I couldn’t find it in myself to reject her. It must have taken her a great deal of courage to do something like this. I didn’t want to be a jerk. And it’s not like I didn’t like the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuna was a very pretty girl with a great personality too. If anything I was lucky to have such a girl like me and Lavy actually being supportive of this. Perhaps, Rimuru and Ainz’s words about ‘ the Harem Protagonist’ thing had some basis after all?</p><p><br></p><p>And so, here I was, waking up between two beautiful girls.</p><p><br></p><p>My movements woke both up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhh, is it morning already?” Lavy said before wrapping her hands around my neck and pulling me in for a kiss, something I wholeheartedly responded to.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning, Sil-kun, Su-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>The scene was enough to awaken Shuna who was blushing red by now but she still leaned in and gave me a peck on my cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>“G-good morning, Silas-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning. We still have thirty minutes on hand. If you two want to stay and rest for some time, you can.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it’s fine.” Shuna stuttered so I just wrapped a hand around her waist and hugged her to my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then just accompany us for some more time.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just nodded shyly and I closed my eyes, enjoying the feeling till I needed to get up for work.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“An Archdaemon is a spiritual being. It’s a qualitative change compared to your previous evolutions.” Milim explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have also heard that Archdaemons are very strong, boss.” Tohru said. She had come in early in the morning to check up on me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you explain in detail?” I asked Milim.</p><p><br></p><p>“In this form, one is as strong as any monster with a Demon Lord Seed. Your case is unique even among Archdaemons. Generally a purely spiritual being cannot stay in our world for long without a body, but you already have that so it allows you to exert your full power unlike other Archdaemons. The second thing is having a name, you got that too. Finally, somehow, miraculously, you have not one but two Demon Lord Seeds. It shouldn’t be possible, you know. How did you get it?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No idea. By the way, how did you know about the Demon Lord Seed thing?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahahaha nothing can escape my eyes.” She replied smugly at my question. “Still, you have almost everything needed to become a Demon Lord. Say, wanna join the council with us? Both Rimuru and you could join. I can recommend you, you know?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, not interested. You don’t seem to have too much fun there, seeing as you stay here all the time.” I retorted, making her blanched.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s not fair. I don’t have such a fun place. It’s not my fault.” She pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I said earlier, you’re always welcome here.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, why don’t I sense a connection with you?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Normally, when a stronger being names someone, they risk losing a portion of their power. Obviously, I am very strong so nothing will happen to me hahahaha.” She laughed again, making my eyes twitch. “Naming can make the one being stronger but it also makes a connection between them and their namer. It can have different effects like sometimes making them evolve like in your case or in case of Shuna-chan when she was named by Rimuru. Do you understand this much?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“The one getting named can also gain some abilities from the namer sometimes, although that’s very rare. But one thing almost always happens. The one being named forms a connection with the one naming. In your case, it formed but then broke as soon as you were carried into the Restaurant. Why is that?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, what’s the use of asking me? I didn’t even know about the connection part let alone the part about the connection breaking. Then again, if I had to guess then it would be that the Restaurant removed it. Was it harmful by any chance?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. You were already named by Rimuru so nothing new on that. I will have to ask Guy about it. I don’t have any experience in naming others.” She smiled, making me want to facepalm.</p><p><br></p><p>“If there is nothing to worry about then don’t. Tell me more about Archdaemons.” I asked. I wanted to know more about my new abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are alright I guess. Not that strong but can destroy a country easily. You could probably do far more though with all the extra stuff I mentioned earlier. If you train a bit more, you could evolve again. Or well, I can always name you again. Next time I will ask Guy about them and tell you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll pass for now.” I had evolved twice in close succession. I needed some time to understand and control my power first. “By the way, who is this Guy… guy?” I asked, completely ignoring the fact that she just waved off country destroyers as just… alright. It was not good for my sanity to think about it more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, he is one of the Demon Lords along with me. He is also the first Demon Lord and a Daemon just like you so he should know more about the abilities of Daemons.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were several pieces of information in those sentences which could individually give me an aneurysm but together they felt like I was bashed in the face.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will try to understand my abilities more till then so take your time.  Here, I am done with your order too.” I placed her plate in front of her and she immediately forgot about everything and dove into her food.</p><p><br></p><p>I went to Rimuru’s world and checked myself once more. This time, analysing all the changes. The raw amount of Demonic Power I possessed had increased by several times. The same was the case with my Cursed Energy, it had increased to an absurd degree. I was pretty sure I could rival or even surpass Naruto’s Cursed Energy now, but unlike him, I can control every bit of my power. It also felt like my Innate Cursed Technique had some changes and I can use Water and Ice now. I will have to check that first.</p><p><br></p><p>My new Skills, Flood and Frost helped me control water and ice with a thought. It also increased the power I could exert with the same amount of Demonic Power. The exercises Irene-san had me doing before, I could now do them as easy as breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ice Devil Slayer Magic I used was also far stronger now without any extra effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, that magic was supposed to turn me into a Demon and now I was an Archdaemon. I doubt it gets better than this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe you can go and ask Kisuke. He seemed to know quite a lot about souls.” Rimuru suggested. “I haven’t heard from Ikki either. You can check out how he is doing too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Sounds like a plan.” I nodded. “I was planning to visit Zeref, August or Irene-san to know more, but they are not in Alvarez right now. Also, I don’t know where exactly Jujutsu Academy is so I can’t go there. Kisuke-san seems like a good idea too. He has already invited me several times before.”</p><p><br></p><p>We all agreed to this suggestion and finally done with my work, I took the time to sit with Saitama and Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what’s the deal with you and Lavinia?” Rimuru asked as soon as we were alone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t give me that look. You have both been sharing those sickly sweet looks with each other. I mean sure, that’s usual for Lavinia but what about you?”</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes twitched at his words but it didn’t look like he was going to relent so I confessed. It will come out sooner or later.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two days ago, I asked her out. She accepted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shh! Don’t make a scene.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What the hell do you mean don’t make a scene? You got a girlfriend. We <em>have</em> to make a scene. Remember what you guys did when I was going on that date with Shizuka-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was Ainz’s idea.”</p><p><br>“You were quite happy to go along with it.” He countered, not backing out.</p><p><br></p><p>We did tease him a lot, especially with him being mistaken as a girl by Shizuka-san.</p><p><br></p><p>In my defence… it was damn funny.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we could say anything else, Shuna came with glasses of juice for us and he became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>She gave me a shy smile, blushing as our eyes met and went back to the kitchen to clean up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, what was that about?” Rimuru asked, as soon as Shuna disappeared into the kitchen. “You are not stringing her along, are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously not. What kind of guy do you think I am?” I asked, offended.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what was up with that look?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… the thing is…” I explained the whole situation to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Screw you, damn harem protagonist!”</p><p><br></p><p>…The worst part was that I couldn’t even refute his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s it. It’s decided. You are throwing us a party.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“A party. I died a virgin at almost forty years old. Ainz is the same. Saitama…” We looked at the guy and became quiet. He was taken aback at the sudden silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? What do you two want to say?” He questioned defensively.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing.” We replied at the same time and Rimuru turned towards me and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you got two girlfriends in two days. You better give us a treat or so help me…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, fine.” I relented, not wanting him to start causing chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru can be extremely vindictive about the strangest of things… and we <em>did</em> tease him… a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Know what, maybe you should take Lavinia with you on a date to Kisuke’s world since you officially asked her out and all that.” He suggested and I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a good idea. Everyone has been so busy recently that we have had no time to spend on ourselves and we cannot exactly go out in our world as there might still be some supernatural people looking out for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>We also had the Jujutsu Exam in line in a week or two and who knows how long that might take?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we finished for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>In the evening, I closed the Restaurant and invited Lavy to go out with me.</p><p><br></p><p>The order of things was already messed up but I wanted to at least let her experience a normal relationship… or as normal as our relationship could get.</p><p><br></p><p>The place where Kisuke lived was called Karakura town.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a normal Japanese town but there was something about this place which made it an ideal place to go on a date - the fact that there won't be anyone looking for a mysterious Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>We spent the whole day having fun together and had our dinner outside. The food from my Restaurant had spoiled any normal food for us.</p><p><br></p><p>The two of us got a bit lost and didn't realise the time. It was night by the time we decided to find Kisuke's place.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, his shop is in this area. The Urahara Candy Shop. Let's look around the area and see.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We walked past a corner and I suddenly felt something flying towards me at a high speed. I reflexively slapped it aside as a wall crashed and I saw the figure embedded into the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>What’s that… a boy?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ichigo!\"</p><p><br></p><p>From the other side of the street, a black haired girl cried loudly and came running towards the guy and looked at me menacingly.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I know she was supposedly trying to look menacing but all she looked like was a menacing squirrel with its mouth full of nuts.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Who are you people? Why did you attack Ichigo?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Attack is a strong word. It's just that I felt something about to crash into me and reflexively slapped it away. You know, kinda when you feel like a fly or something is about to enter your eyes and you try to slap it away. It wasn’t exactly intentional so it’s more of an accident than an actual attack.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You can't slap someone like Ichigo away? You shouldn't even be able to see him.\" She shouted, offended?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm why? I have perfect vision (especially during the nights). Also, why can't I hit him? Is he a prince somewhere? Does he own this street? If someone is about to crash into me, potentially push me into the middle of a road and cause an accident, I do believe I have a right to defend myself. Haven't you heard, running on the streets is not good? What do they teach in Middle Schools these days?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not a Middle Schooler!\" She shrieked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm… sorry. Eleme…\" I stopped my words looking at her face. “Probably not.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could say anything, we heard a blast of sorts from the nearby street and the girl checked her phone.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh no, the hollow.\" She ran towards the boy embedded in the wall. \"Ichigo, wake up. The hollow is attacking.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and let out a sigh. I have been doing this a lot in the last few months. Then again, I wasn't caught in such situations before and neither did I have a multiverse spanning restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lavy, check on the boy. See if a restoration potion works. I will go and see what's going on.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and went to check on the boy while I turned towards the place where the sound of the explosion came from.</p><p><br></p><p>The noise was coming from a house. The surprising thing was that no one was coming out or even noticing anything wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>There were no barriers around. Were the people of this area so used to these kinds of things?</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke's world is messed up.</p><p><br></p><p>I jumped to the window of the house and saw a half human half serpent ghost kind of thing looking at an orange haired girl while another girl lay on the ground injured.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster jumped and I almost reflexively created ice around it, freezing it in an ice box.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl fell on her butt. I rushed to their side and picked both up and carried the other girl on my shoulder before jumping out of the window.</p><p><br></p><p>The black haired girl from before came in running, carrying the fainted boy on her shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay, what the hell was that? And why is this guy still down? Didn't the potion work on him?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia shook her head. \"Sil-kun, these people are apparently Shinigami.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Death Gods? No way. They are too weak. Don't get tricked by them, Lavy. I am not good at sensing power but even by my standards, they are too weak. That guy took one slap but hasn't woken up yet.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy looked at the girl suspiciously. \"Are you lying?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What? No. I recently lost my power in an attack. Ichigo is still new at this work. Also, it's that guy who is the freak.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you calling a freak? I am just a respectable… ah, yeah. My bad.” I realised mid sentence what I really was.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a bang inside the house and the ghost thing came out, blasting a wall.</p><p><br></p><p>I was able to take a look behind and the ice cube was still as it is. How did it get out?</p><p><br></p><p>I created another ice cage around it instantly and looked at the black haired girl.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay, keep the discussions for later. What is that thing?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's a hollow. They are spirits which have some leftover wishes and haven't passed on to the afterlife. They become corrupted and become hollows who form that mask on their faces. They attack anything with Spiritual Power.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"So an evil spirit of sorts. Reminds me of some Youkai. Will it be a problem if I just kill it?\" I was pretty sure I could do that. In fact, I could instinctively feel that it was a soul of sorts and that I could literally eat it.</p><p><br></p><p>\"No don’t!\" It was surprisingly the orange haired girl who said that. And that was not the end of surprises as she walked to the monster and hugged it, apologising.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster's mask broke and a face was revealed and from the girl's words, I knew it to be her brother.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like a freaking anime.</p><p><br></p><p>The now unmasked guy looked at me. \"Kill me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No please, don't.\" The girl cried out again.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn. So troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>The black haired girl spoke again. \"He will just become a mindless hollow if he is not purified.\"</p><p><br></p><p>How do I even purify it?</p><p><br></p><p>I am a devil for fuck's sake. We are beings the furthest away from pure</p><p><br></p><p>Purify?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly an idea struck me. \"Lavy, use the Incinerate Anthem. I don't have any purification Skills.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked conflicted for a moment. She didn’t like using her Sacred Gears normally, but after looking at the girl and then the ghost who was literally begging us, she steeled her resolve and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked towards the guy while I stopped the girl. \"Don't worry. She won't hurt him.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia's body was surrounded by a purple flame as a giant cross appeared behind her. I was feeling chills even now when looking at the flame. It was however far lower than the last time I had felt when Augusta was using the flames.</p><p><br></p><p>Is it because Lavy was new and didn’t know how to use it to Augusta’s level of my own strength? I didn’t know. What I did know was that it was strong and could severely hurt and even kill me.</p><p><br></p><p>I took some distance with the girl as the ghost waved at the girl and closed his eyes allowing the flames to touch him. The flames didn't exactly burn him but rather burned off his monstrous features, leaving a normal human-like soul in its place.</p><p><br></p><p>He waved goodbye to the weeping girl one last time and disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia recalled the flames back.</p><p><br></p><p>\"See, he's probably going to a better place.\" The girl nodded and then fainted.</p><p><br></p><p>…. Now, what to do with this. I turned back to the black haired girl who was looking at us as if we were ghosts. \"Say, do you know an address?\"</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_______________________________</p><p><br></p><p>\"And so we came here.\" I explained to a rather amused looking Kisuke.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that the black haired girl, Rukia knew Kisuke and so did the carrot top, Ichigo.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, apparently, she wasn’t a middle school student but rather someone like Kanna, a hundred plus years old… high school student.</p><p><br></p><p>They healed the girl, Orihime and the carrot top Ichigo.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, we are not in any trouble, are we?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not really. You could be if you went around without controlling your Reiatsu though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Reiawhat?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Reiatsu, Spiritual Pressure or Soul Power.\" Kisuke then explained what he was talking about and showed me how to reign in my power.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I wanted to talk to you about this. You see, I encountered something yesterday which kinda made me evolve again.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Evolve? Like the time you fought a war? What exactly happened? Did you get into another war?” He asked, amused.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “If only it were that easy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh! Something worse than a war then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Although I wouldn’t call it worse. Mildly troublesome at best.” I corrected it when I thought about everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are we talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I met and was named by a Demon Lord. An Ancient Demon Lord who is one of the strongest beings in Rimuru’s world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Demon Lord?” He asked, surprised this time. “Is everything alright there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. Milim is not a bad person. In fact, as I said, she is more like Kanna than anything. The Power of a God and the mind of a child.” I shuddered at the combination.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, that does sound scary. How strong are we talking about?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru was scared by her presence alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>He blanched. “Yes, that’s scary alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, as I said, she is a good person. Mostly just lays around and plays games.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what’s the problem? You said she made you evolve.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She named me and I evolved from the increased power. I am an Archdaemon now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He brought out a paper fan from his sleeves and covered his face. “Oh my, that’s good news then. Congratulations, I guess?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and was about to speak when a cat walked into the room.</p><p><br></p><p>A black cat, who just took a look at us and then went up and sat on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at the cat and then I looked back at Kisuke and continued.  “The thing is, the evolution to an Archdaemon is a fundamental change. They are Spiritual Beings and there are many things I don’t know about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I then went on to explain everything Milim told me about Archdaemons and myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you thought I could help you out with my knowledge of souls?” He asked and I nodded. “Well, you have come to the right person. Come, we have so much to exper… um, learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, you were about to say experiment. You totally were going to say experiment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Slip of tongue, Silas-kun. Don’t mind these small things.” He waved his fan with a smile, making my eyes twitch wildly.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s not exactly a small thing, ya know?!</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, we can start with teaching you how to control your Reiatsu. If you continue throwing around any more of your power, it will attract some dangerous things.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm, I am already reigning in my power a lot. I learned it because it scared the goblins at Rimuru's village.\" It's more of a town now though.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Really? You are giving off a new lieutenant class to a 3rd Seat Class reiatsu. That's you holding back? You must have quite some juice.\" The black cat sleeping on the table talked, completely taking me by surprise with the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>It talked?</p><p><br></p><p>And what's with that manly voice?</p><p><br></p><p>\"So cute!\" Lavinia jumped and hugged the cat almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yoruichi is an old friend.\" Kisike stated as if the talking cat part was already understood.</p><p><br></p><p>No no, explain more about the talking cat part.</p><p><br></p><p>I reiterate again. This world is messed up.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh. Yes. 2% power.\" I replied absentmindedly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You were holding back 2% power?\" He deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What? No. I am <em>showing</em> 2% of my power.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I continued seeing their blank looks, \"But then again it's my magic and soul power might be hidden in a different way. I am new to this, can you show me an example?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. \"I think we should go to the training room first. Kurogane-kun is training there already.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We went down a flight of stairs into what looked to be a gigantic space, complete with lights and all too.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the space was Ikki… being chased around by two children, one with a baseball bat while the other was a girl with a freaking rocket launcher.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the shopkeeper who suddenly began to seem a lot more sinister to me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Just kids having some fun. Don't worry, we can heal everyone back to full health again.\"</p><p><br></p><p>…. That doesn't change anything, dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that I noticed something odd. Attached to Ikki's chest was a chain and on the other end of the chain was a body which looked exactly like Ikki's.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So you noticed. The chain attaches the body to the soul. In our world, we can train to increase our spiritual power. Since the laws of Kurogane-kun's world binds a <em>human</em>, to bypass them, we simply made him into something other than a human. We temporarily separated his soul from his body and helped him train. It worked too as his Spiritual Power has been increasing steadily. This progress can be maintained even when he returns to his body.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The boy is a ridiculously hard worker too. He has never once complained no matter what kind of training we threw at him. Kind of makes me want to train him too.\" The cat… said.</p><p><br></p><p>I am really having quite a hard time getting used to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Also what was it going to teach him, cat walk?</p><p><br></p><p>“Those chains I had cut back then?” I asked and he nodded in agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What are the risks?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"He will turn into a hollow.\"</p><p><br></p><p>'You mean those masked ghost things?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes those. By the way, how did you defeat the hollow?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't. Lavy did.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Your waitress?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. She purified it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Purified?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You know, cleanse the soul of their sins, resentment and stuff and send it to the Shinigami Heaven. The Rukia girl told us that the guy will get there.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh! Did she use her device? I didn't realise that these devices were so similar to a Zanpakuto. To perform a Konso too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She doesn’t have a device. She used her Sacred Gear?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sacred Gear? Those NotPokemon things? I never got to hear exactly what they were.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Have you read the Bible?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A bit, yes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"In my home world, the God of the Bible created a bunch of artifacts and started a lucky draw at birth to incarnate them in a human soul. This was done to give humanity the power to stand against the supernatural.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"God?\" He asked, completely stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. There are literal Gods living in my world. I was surprised and shit scared too. What is my life turning into? Demon Lords and Gods…\"</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke was the first one to break the silence. \"So these Sacred Gears. What kind of things can they be?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Can be anything. From something to give the user an eidetic memory to having the power to kill even Gods.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Kill Gods…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, you understand why I am afraid to go out in my world now? There are weirdos roaming about with weapons which can kill Gods and Demon Lords.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me more about them.” He said, this time in a far more serious tone.</p><p><br></p><p>\"There are thirteen Longinuses.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Like the Spear which killed Jesus Christ.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It was the first. These thirteen are weapons of enormous power. They can enable the user to kill gods too… with enough training of course. Even that crazy fire lady who tried to possess Lavy had one of the Longinuses. She just hadn’t been able to use its full power. I was raised by human parents so I don't know much about the Supernatural world, only the things I should stay away from.\" I made it a point to get to know what to avoid first.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How fascinating. So, how did Miss Lavinia purify this hollow?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Her Sacred Gear, the one used by the crazy fire lady, allows her to use the Holy Flames to purify dark beings. It’s actually the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I would totally like to see how it works some time but we need to fix your problem first.” He said with a slight nod.</p><p><br></p><p>By then Ikki had fallen down to the ground, fainting so we moved on to him.</p><p><br></p><p>While Ikki was being healed, Kisuke showed me a way to cloak my power.</p><p><br></p><p>\"First, why don't you go and stop holding back? Don't worry, this place is sealed tight. No one will be able to detect us outside.\" Kisuke waved at me. He looked very curious. It reminded me of those crazy scientist types.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You sure?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Absolutely.\" He assured me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well alright. Lavinia, why don't you take the children a bit away from the area and make a barrier around you all.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay~\"</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. The cat surprisingly stayed on Ikki's head.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ready then. Here I go.\" I let go of all restraints for the first time since becoming an Archdaemon, the power which could destroy countries, and the place shook.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Yoruichi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck, Kisuke?</p><p><br></p><p>Just who is this monster?</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of power was something she had only felt once, when she had seen the Head Captain spar against his two disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>Was all that talk about Demons actually true?</p><p><br></p><p>She was having a very hard time maintaining her composure and using her Spiritual Pressure to shield Ikki who was already pressed to the ground from the pressure despite her efforts. Kisuke himself was barely standing. She felt Tessai make a barrier around them and the pressure lightened.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy soon held back his power and everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>\"A-alright. Observe me.\" Kisuke instructed him to control his power after that released his power and slowly reigned it in.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy just nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"To do this…\"</p><p><br></p><p>Before Kisuke could continue, he started reigning his power to near invisible levels just like Kisuke.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is this alright?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"... yes. How did you do that though?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I saw you, copied it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Just by seeing me once?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The method was pretty simple.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Just out of curiosity, can you try something for me?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Try copying this.\" Kisuke moved to a different place with a Shunpo.</p><p><br></p><p>Even she was quite interested. To be honest, a large part of her was screaming bullshit at the guy. As if someone could learn to control their spiritual power so easily. Wouldn't that mean that the work they had put all this time was for naught?</p><p><br></p><p>But as if to break her preconceived notions, he appeared several tens of metres away from his place. \"Oops, this is a bit hard to control.\" he then proceeded to disappear and reappear several times around the ground back to the place where he was standing at the beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>She saw the first few steps and the last one was close to a blur for her. He was getting better at a mindblowing pace. \"That's more like it. I had to use brute force but this method is much more convenient. What's it called?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"This is called Shunpo or Flash Step.\" Kisuke replied while bringing out a notepad taking some notes. \"Interested in learning some more tricks?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sil-kun seems to be having so much fun.\" She was picked up by the girl who came with him and she started petting her. \"Are you having fun, Yoru-chan?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't know that Silas-san was this strong?\" Ikki said while sitting in his place, his face still pale but the light in his eyes was as strong as ever. She observed that he was heaving for breath but his soul was becoming stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, a soul grew stronger the fastest when it was in danger. And feeling that kind of power…</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sil-kun is very strong. I don't think I can defeat him even if I used both of my Sacred Gears. Maybe hold him back for a while but not defeat him.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Yoruichi found herself still for a moment. \"You can hold <em>him</em> back for a while?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"An hour at best if I could achieve Balance Breaker with both my Sacred Gears. I don't have much Magic Power to sustain the use though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Balance Breakers?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, they are the temporary power upped forms of the Sacred Gears.\"</p><p><br></p><p>As she talked to the girl, Kisuke continued with his experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the period of the next two hours, he continued to break all of Yoruichi's preconceived notions of being a genius.</p><p><br></p><p>This was no longer a genius. This was a genuine monster.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke helped me learn many spiritual spells from his world called Kido. They were of two types, primarily, which were Hadō for direct attacks, and Bakudō for battle support. There were healing type Kido as well and it was also something I was most interested in.</p><p><br></p><p>My Reversed Curse Technique allowed me to heal my body. I just needed something to heal my soul with.</p><p><br></p><p>There were obviously spells in Rimuru’s worlds but most of them were of Holy nature and we had no one who knew how to cast them, that’s why I wanted to learn Healing Kido. Unfortunately, Kisuke wasn’t an expert in those.</p><p><br></p><p>He did teach me some basic spells though.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Hadō and Bakudō spells were numbered from 1 to 99, the higher the number, the stronger the spell power.</p><p><br></p><p>I was invited to come over and learn more spells later on.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki seemed to be having fun training there and there was still time before his school reopened so he decided to stay there for training. He said he will go to the Ryozanpaku masters for training after this.</p><p><br></p><p>It was getting late, so we left and went back to our restaurant. But before leaving, I left a card of my restaurant with the girl whose house I had almost destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt kinda bad for her.</p><p><br></p><p>The stay in Kisuke's world was full of ups and downs but at least the candies in his store were something.</p><p><br></p><p>That reminds me, I need other helpers in the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I can ask Nakiri-san since he was the Principal of a Culinary School or something? He could introduce me to some of his students who can help me out. In fact, I needed some new waitresses for my Restaurant too.</p><p><br></p><p>With most of the girls being busy with teaching the Oni and setting up the business. That only left me with Tohru as a waitress.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss, I heard we are having a party?” My musings were broken by Tohru’s words. She looked excited.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. A week later, we are having a party.” I had earned a lot in the deal with Issac-san and could easily afford to splurge here. “In fact, you can invite your friends if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Kanna is often with Naruto and the Dojo Masters so she must be missing the other dragon friends too. It will be a good chance for them to reunite and have some fun.” I suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will bring some of my friends too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just make sure they don’t cause any trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me, Boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had also gone out to invite Shizuka-san for the party and I had asked Cid-kun’s friends to invite others too.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be a good opportunity for all the guests to gather and also give me time to prepare everything in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, they could bring their friends and that could increase my customer base.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of this, the door to the Restaurant opened and some familiar figures popped in.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san had come with the orange haired girl, Orihime, the black haired girl, Rukia, the carrot top Ichigo and… Yoruichi.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this the place? A maid cafe?” Ichigo said, looking around the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not a maid cafe, just a simple Restaurant.” I replied. “Tohru, take their orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>As Tohru took their orders, I talked with Kisuke-san.</p><p><br></p><p>The orange haired girl called Orihime was looking around the area nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm, hello.\" She said, attracting our attention.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hello. Welcome to my restaurant. What will you be having today?\" I asked politely.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ano… I… you are the one who saved me, aren't you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"... I am. Are you alright now?\" I asked. She had been unconscious when we left so we never got a chance to go back.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah yes. Thank you for helping me… and my brother.\" She bowed deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's fine. The… supernatural police of that world would have done that anyway.\" I said turning towards Rukia and Ichigo.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ohh…\" She replied awkwardly, not knowing what to say.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, what will you be having today?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"This…\" She hesitated.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san spoke on her behalf.  \"She will be having a job at your restaurant if you have one.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Say what?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke went on to explain the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>She was living alone after her brother's death. Her parents had died even before her brother and after her brother's death, she was given an allowance by her aunt who stayed far away.</p><p><br></p><p>The incident that day had caused her house to crash. The landlord was an ass and had evicted her from the place and made her pay for the damage. Partly because there were no culprits found for the incident. Now, that part was taken care of by her aunt but she had reduced her allowance by a lot because she too thought that the girl was making up stories.</p><p><br></p><p>… talk about a messed up situation.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So you are looking for a part time job in my Restaurant?\"</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed. \"Please.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, well alright. The damage was partially caused by me because I interfered in the work of whatever soul police was doing back then. I think I can take responsibility for this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I explained to her the schedule. I did need some more staff in the restaurant. It's not like I didn't have any empty rooms. We had expanded both the house and the Restaurant just a week ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, Hat-and-clogs, are you sure this is a good place to work? It totally looks like a shady maid cafe and not a good one at that.” The carrot top spoke, making my eyes twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me, what do you mean by ‘not so good maid cafe’?” I asked, my tone calm, as I reigned in my anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Who the fuck did this brat think he was, dissing my Restaurant?</p><p><br></p><p>Even Dragons and Demon Lords had to politely sit in line to be served here.</p><p><br></p><p>“What else? Your Restaurant is obviously empty and even the one waitress is a cosplayer pretending to be who knows what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a dragon, little boy.” Tohru replied, hotly and then looked at me. “Do you want me to bash his face, boss?” Tohru asked, not hiding her anger</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, Tohru, what have we learned about customer service?” I assuaged her anger and looked at the carrot top. “Tell me, have you ever seen a Restaurant which is always full?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his mouth to reply but shut up again.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for my waitress, as she has already said, she is a dragon. A genuine Dragon. Do you perhaps have a problem with them?”</p><p><br></p><p>To his credit he didn’t say anything and apologised too.</p><p><br></p><p>Rukia on the other hand looked at Kisuke, “But Dragons are…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru-chan is not that kind of Dragon. So don’t worry about it” He reassured her and then explained a bit about this place.</p><p><br></p><p>They ordered. Yoruichi, ordering milk and some fish.</p><p><br></p><p>I went in and cooked their orders while Tohru happily showed Orihime around the place and also the work clothes they were supposed to wear.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, what is Ikki doing?” Tohru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, he was too tired and is sleeping. We will be having a packed meal for him too.” Kisuke-san ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I will get it arranged. Oh, by the way, there is a Party in the Restaurant, a week from now. You are invited and can bring friends too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, that sounds like fun. Did something good happen for you to be throwing a party?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. I signed a big deal with Issac-san and we are also opening a new Publishing House. The Restaurant also had a renovation. Finally, I had a bit of time on my hand and decided to throw a party to share my happiness with everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations! I will be happy to join.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down and looked at them as they ate.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Yoruichi was eating with full concentration.</p><p><br></p><p>“One more.” Rukia ordered, her mouth still puffed with food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“One more of me too.” Yoruichi’s voice sounded before changing her order. “Actually, make it two more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In a minute.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn Kisuke, keeping this place all to yourself. Why didn’t you tell me about this place before?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahaha… well, it’s quite expensive eating out everyday and…”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you were just being a cheapskate. That's it. Silas, pack fifteen, no twenty of these fishes for me. Kisuke will pay the bill.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yoruichi…”</p><p><br></p><p>The banter went on for some time and they left after they were done.</p><p><br></p><p>Orihime will be shifting here by tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>She will be working as a waitress here during the evenings as she had school in the mornings. I agreed as I needed more help in the evenings.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Naruto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And Ninjas can also make bunshin but I can’t do that, ya know. It’s always that crappy bunshin jutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, aren’t there any other jutsu that you know?” Kanna asked him. “We could totally pull a big prank on Kensei-sensei if we can learn it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, not really. I wasn’t able to learn any before coming here, but other kids might know. They had clans and clan people had many jutsu of their own.” He was a bit miffed. By now, he had figured out that he was the son of the fourth Hokage. Although he didn’t understand why his own father would seal the fox inside him, he didn’t want to blame him without knowing his side of the story.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa had told him that people had to make hard decisions in difficult times and maybe he had his reasons, especially since he sacrificed his life for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto decided to listen to his words but it didn’t stop him from being miffed about not having any jutsu from his father or… his mother.</p><p><br></p><p>Why didn’t anyone tell him about his parents?</p><p><br></p><p>Even the fox knew of his Kaa-san, then there is no way they wouldn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>The more he thought of it, the angrier he became but grandpa taught him that the fox would take advantage of his anger and try to take control of him.</p><p><br></p><p>If he became too angry, even his mom and dad’s soul came out and he didn’t want to disturb them in their rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Aghh, this is so annoying.</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly felt a smack on his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stupid Naruto, don’t think too much or your head will  burst.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh, Kanna-chan, that hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t know any ninjutsu, aren’t there others who do? We can always go and ask them to teach us.” Kanna suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, will they teach us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, Iruka-sensei might but he will probably be mad that I left the academy without telling anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we can just sneak around. Aren’t you a ninja? We can also use magic.” She said as she made lightning spark around her fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We can, dattebayo. I have also learned about the Jujutsu Barrier technique from Nanami-sensei. We can totally use that to hide. It will be like a top secret mission hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Top Secret Mission, yes.” Kanna-chan nodded too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I also… “</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br>“I also want to find some pictures of my parents.” He said, remembering that he didn’t have anything belonging to them from their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, we can find those too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But what if others find out?”</p><p><br>“We will sneak in.” Kanna said and they quietly made plans.</p><p><br></p><p>Miu nee-chan and Shigure nee-chan were busy and they had a holiday in the academy today. He had even finished his training for today.</p><p><br></p><p>They could totally play around for the rest of the day and no one will say anything.</p><p><br>Finally, it was decided.</p><p><br></p><p>The two of them went to the Restaurant and only Tohru-chan and another pink haired girl were there, playing games. They had their breakfast there and packed some food while Kanna recharged in the Restaurant to her full power.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them waited until it was time for Tohru-chan to eat and then slowly sneaked towards the door.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened the door to his world and snuck out.</p><p><br></p><p>They were suddenly around the same familiar buildings and quickly jumped to one of the rooftops.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna-chan did some magic to hide them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this your world, Naruto?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. See that mountain over there, the faces on them are the ones belonging to the Hokage. My dad is the fourth one.” He pointed to a mountain and took out a camera and clicked a picture of the fourth hokage’s face on the mountain.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm. This world has magic. I can feel it.” Kanna-chan said as she breathed deeply. “Yes. Now, where do we go from here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me show you around the village first, Kanna-chan. We can go to the places where we played. I can also take you to my favourite fishing spot and we can fish there.” He said, as memories of Konoha came back to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was very happy with his life and wouldn’t leave his new home for anything but Konoha had some good memories for him too and he wanted to share them with his new friends.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, let’s go.” Kanna-chan took his hand and they flew into the air, flying over Konoha and towards the mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>If they had, however, been paying attention, they would have noticed that they were spotted by a small figure with dark blue hair and pearl-like white eyes as they left the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, they went around the spots where Naruto played and even did fishing together.</p><p><br></p><p>Fishing was so much fun when he used his Cursed Techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>The chains could easily catch fish and Kanna-chan just dove into the water and chased the fishes, catching and eating them instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he hadn’t mastered it, he could teleport to places he had marked too. It’s just that, to use it to the fullest extent, he had to summon his dad and he didn’t want to disturb them.</p><p><br></p><p>He had to stop her so that they could fry the fish together and eat.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to visit Teuchi-san and Ayame nee-chan. They were the ones who helped me a lot first. We can also eat some ramen there.” He said, remembering the duo who had fed him ramen for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu, let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna-chan said as she took his hand and they flew into the sky, completely forgetting about why they had come here in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’ as promised.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sorry for the delay.

They could be other Shinobi disguised as Mogami and the other servants.” The Stairs Daimyo tried to defend although his sweating made it clear that he was nervous.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? Because I am pretty sure I know of no techniques which could allow even dead bodies to be disguised. Is the dead ninja not one of your envoys?” I asked, narrowing my eyes. The man wisely kept his mouth shut when pointed to the obvious flaw.</p><p><br></p><p>The awkward silence was broken by a very calm voice which terrified everyone in the room. “I want answers, Fujimoto.” Grandpa spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew he was angry.</p><p><br></p><p>No, he was beyond angry at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>I had no memory of him being this angry.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, for him, his only family had almost gotten murdered. Of course he will be angry. I will have to explain everything to him when he is alone.</p><p><br></p><p>“O-obviously. I will investigate everything and give you a satisfactory answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kensho.” He called out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Put a bounty on the head of all the criminals with the crime of attempted murder and theft. I want their true identities on my desk as soon as possible.” He ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will be done, Your Majesty.” He answered seriously. Man, even Kensho was pissed.</p><p><br></p><p>They left the room after a while, leaving only Grandpa in the room with me.</p><p><br></p><p>He sat on a chair beside me, looking blankly at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will cancel this engagement.” He said after a while, breaking the silence in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Don’t do that. This marriage is an opportunity which our Land cannot lose.” I interrupted him. Seriously, the reserves of natural gas alone made it something we cannot leave.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you stopping this now? You weren’t interested in this from the very beginning. What has changed now? Your life is in danger and you still want to pursue this marriage?” He asked, a bit angry.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be fine, Grandpa.” I closed my eyes and sensed for any presences around me and found no one except my own people so I looked at him. “Don’t worry. Everything is under control.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are lying on the bed, a stab wound on your shoulder and you say everything is under control. How is this...being under control!” He shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I stilled for a moment. This was the first time I had seen him shouting. In fact, this was the first time he had ever shouted at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuina.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Open the bandages?” I commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazu-kun, what are you up to?” Grandpa was broken from his anger in a moment and suddenly looked at me worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“You said I had secrets of my own, right?” I asked. Seeing him not answering, I just continued. “I am just showing you a few of them to assure you that I will be fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina opened my bandages and I summoned one of the Red Potions.</p><p><br></p><p>The appearance of the potion surprised Grandpa but his eyes soon moved to my injuries and got stuck there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa, the ninja who was pretending to be the attendant of Princess Kasumi indeed attacked my warehouse but she was not able to steal anything. I and my subordinates captured everyone...without any injuries.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! But this...”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something I had to do to myself to not let our enemies know about the real situation.” I drank the Red Potion and the wound started to heal in front of his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened as he saw this while I passed the rest of the potion to Kuina for Saitō to heal.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were sent by the Medicine Daimyo to steal the secrets of our place and got caught in the trap. The woman did try to attack and kill me but wasn’t able to do so. I am sorry, I didn’t mean to worry you but we had no time to tell you everything as we were running on the clock. I was planning to tell you everything once they left.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You!...do you have any idea...” He breathed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazu-kun, no amount of land or property is more important to me than you. You don’t have to put yourself in danger for the sake of the Land of Stairs.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not that simple, Grandpa. The thing which the Land of Stairs has, is something which can make us richer than all of the five big nations combined. It can simply change the fate of our Land. It’s something which I <em>have</em> to try. Moreover, hurting myself was not for that. It was to find a reason to blame the Medicine Daimyo and create a rift between him and his ninja.” I explained my whole plan to him except the summoning part.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me Grandpa. Just give me a few years and you will see the results of my plans.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and I could see several thoughts running through his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Promise me something first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Promise me that you will not endanger yourself, that you will not die in all this.”</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes softened at his words. “I promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>He left the room after this, leaving me with my subordinates alone.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The Stairs entourage left the same day and Grandpa wasn’t kidding.</p><p><br></p><p>He destroyed them, even pushing the date for the marriage back till everything was cleared up. He knew I wanted time and gave me just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Medicine Daimyo was sent the complaints and Grandpa said that he would have to reconsider their alliance if he couldn’t give us an appropriate answer in regards to the actions of the Kodon Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>Till then all trade was suspended between the two Lands. Such a move during a war was a death sentence for the Medicine Daimyo as we were their major food provider.</p><p><br></p><p>He will give us an answer soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Stairs Daimyo, that guy was one step ahead of everyone. He talked to grandpa and left his Granddaughter here as a political hostage to show their <em>sincerity</em> while outwardly claiming that he did so to give us some time to get to know each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, even as someone who hated his guts, I had to praise his move.</p><p><br></p><p>He got away with so many things in this one move. One he managed to give Grandpa a good enough reason to not doubt his sincerity and two, he managed to throw the Granddaughter he didn’t want here, eliminating any chance of her knowing anything about his plans.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, the girl herself was staying in the palace, feeling guilty for the whole thing despite having no hand in any of this mess.</p><p><br></p><p>I had ordered everyone to treat her with respect and show her no hostility. The least I could do was give her a chance at a normal life here.</p><p><br></p><p>A week had passed and I was finally <em>released</em> from medical care officially.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, the princess had visited me several times. In fact, she used to come here everyday, bring flowers, sometimes cut fruits for me, small things like these.</p><p><br></p><p>The very first day, I checked the information about her in the book to see what she was planning but it turns out that she was actually blaming herself for everything and was trying to make it up to me so that we don’t start a war with the Land of Stairs due to this whole mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I felt bad for the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>At least here she was making some friends in Kanae.</p><p><br></p><p>Seraphim on the other hand, was difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was extremely rude, although she followed her orders and was extremely competent too so there was not much we could do.</p><p><br></p><p>She at least explained why because her clan was at war for over a hundred years at that point and they were always thrown into wars, which made her the way she is.</p><p><br></p><p>Vampire Ninjas apparently used magic for their ninja techniques. The downsides of this was that she would need to drink blood if she used up her magic in a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, Kanae was teaching her how to use Chakra and she was picking it up very quickly. We also observed that using chakra didn’t weaken her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a solid Chunin level ninja.</p><p><br></p><p>My old subordinates were progressing quickly too.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitō showed why he was one of the strongest in his world. After recovering from his injuries, he went ahead and opened the Third Gate.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae was able to open the Second Gate as well but it left her exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>I was able to learn Water Breathing, although only the basics. As for the Gates, my stronger physique allowed me to open one and I felt like I could open the second one too but I didn’t want to push and mess things up.</p><p><br></p><p>My main focus was on Fuinjutsu for now.</p><p><br></p><p>The actual MVP was actually Kuina, who could also open the Third Gate and was even progressing in her Water Breathing at an incredible pace.</p><p><br></p><p>Her One Piece World Physique was really showing its power. Her swordsmanship when using Gates was insane.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad none of the swords we had could bear it.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning to search for the Kusanagi Blade for her or try summoning something good for her when I could.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them were strong, well in the Chunin level in their base form and even reaching Tokubetsu Jōnin while using Gates.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, the opponent we were up against was something even Jōnin level ninjas wouldn’t casually face.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s why I had to prepare.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day I was planning to do the next ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last week, Saitō had been extracting information from the ninjas who had attacked me.</p><p><br></p><p>We only got some basic information. The Jōnin didn’t say anything at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The rituals were getting far more complicated than before.</p><p><br>For example, this ritual needed an entire day to complete. It could only be done on the night of a full moon.</p><p><br></p><p>This made me wonder what would have happened if someone wanted to do this ritual before Kaguya was sealed?</p><p><br></p><p>Gotta thank the Sage of Six Paths and his younger brother for this.</p><p><br></p><p>The sacrifice of seven chunin level ninjas to open a portal to summon the Shinigami and get its power to strengthen my soul.</p><p><br></p><p>While the Uzumaki had only been able to summon the Shinigami with the sacrifice of the user, if one wanted to summon it with the sacrifice of others, the number of sacrifices increased. Moreover, each of them needed to be at least at a minimum level of strength, that’s why chunin.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a hand on my Grimoire and began the ritual and all of a sudden, the entire area cooled down.</p><p><br></p><p>I could even see my breath becoming misty.</p><p><br></p><p>I concentrated and sure enough, a figure manifested in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a translucent, gaunt spectre with a demonic visage, much larger than an average human, possessing long, shaggy, white hair, from which two red horns protrude, as well as purple-hued skin. It was draped in a large white kimono and carried a set of prayer beads. It had a tanto in its mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>Just looking at it gave me a pressure on my soul like never before.</p><p><br></p><p>It removed the tanto which revealed its mouth which was full of jagged teeth and a long purple tongue. Then before I could react, it unsheathed its sword and twirled around in a dance-like move, reaping the souls of all seven ninja in one single attack and devouring them all.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it turned towards me, staring at me with its dark bottomless eyes and suddenly stabbed me in the chest with its sword.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt the world go white all of a sudden and lost consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The next morning, my eyes opened due to the sunlight greeting my face.</p><p><br></p><p>Opening my eyes, I looked around and found myself laying in the courtyard of the warehouse. I had warned my people to not come in until I called them personally as I had no idea what the Shinigami could do.</p><p><br></p><p>Around me were the bodies of the seven chunin whom I quickly stored in my Grimoire before I began cleaning everything.</p><p><br></p><p>I had kept everyone waiting outside and didn’t want them to wait any longer.</p><p><br></p><p>While doing this, I checked my own body and found out that my chakra had increased by at least four times at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>Soul strengthening’s effects were not directly visible but showed when my body increased in strength.</p><p><br></p><p>It also gave one an affinity with Yin Chakra, Genjutsu as well as made one resistant to genjutsu. A very less known fact was that someone with a stronger soul could control their chakra far better.</p><p><br></p><p>With this ritual, I was pretty sure that my soul was far stronger than the souls of most of the shinobi who have ever walked this world. There were more rituals for the soul but I couldn’t do them any time soon.</p><p><br></p><p>They required the souls of demons to be sacrificed permanently for the next stage. The only place which even had the rumours of demons was in the Land of Demons but I had no clue about it so there was no way I could get anywhere with it.</p><p><br></p><p>But that didn’t mean I could progress anywhere. In fact, now that the soul rituals were done for the time being, I could begin with the body and mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, my chakra reserves were comparable to that of the Jōnin we had captured and would only grow more in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, there were even rituals to increase chakra reserves and the first ritual for that was quite easy as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already collected all the materials for it and just needed to wait till my body adapts to my current chakra level.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate, I was sure that I could get to Elite Jōnin level of chakra in the next few months, before we go for Rōen.</p><p><br></p><p>That kind of strength with the Eight Inner Gates could give me some confidence to keep my people safe from at least the smaller nations.</p><p><br></p><p>One step at a time and one day, not even the big five will be able to push us around.</p><p><br></p><p>When I walked out, I was greeted by the worried faces of my subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you faint again?” Kuina asked, looking slightly worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This ritual was a lot harder than the last one. Took too much out of me.” I let out a sigh remembering the Shinigami.</p><p><br></p><p>This world...it was really far more than what was shown in the anime or manga. Then again, disclosing all the secrets of the whole world in just one story is absolutely impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>“I told you, he would be fine. Bugs have an incredible capacity to survive.” My thoughts were broken by the sudden comment and I looked at the speaker with a deadpan.</p><p><br></p><p>Seraphim...</p><p><br></p><p>This girl was...sigh...</p><p><br></p><p>“What? That’s a compliment.”</p><p><br></p><p>I still had no idea how to deal with her.</p><p><br></p><p>So I just smiled. “Why thank you, Sera.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw her eyes twitch at the nickname while Kanae just giggled at the situation. Kuina and Saitō rolled their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Two can play at this game.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rina Uzumaki -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s all for the reports, my lord.” She bowed. Her sister was already on one of her knees, waiting for their next command. In front of her was the Uzukage, Shiroyasha-sama and beside her sat her husband, the Daimyo of the Land of Whirlpools, Hiroki-sama and between them sat their daughter...Princess Tamami Uzumaki.</p><p><br></p><p>The Land of the Whirlpools was unique in the way that both the Kage and the Daimyo were from the same family.</p><p><br></p><p>This helped them keep a focused decision making body at their head and keep their clan out of unnecessary wars unlike the other countries who were forced to go to war by their Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>In those countries, the Daimyo always tries to keep the powers of the Kage restrained which is not the case with Uzushiogakure and the Land of Whirlpools.</p><p><br></p><p>“Iwa, Kumo and Mizu working together behind the scenes is indeed big news if it is true. Recently, the war has been in a very...unnatural state. The three sides are pushing Konoha but they are not using their full power anywhere. It seemed that they were trying to play a game of attrition with them, which is a decent strategy when it is one against three, forcing Konoha to give up and make a settlement in a long term war, maybe gain some of their territory or just monetary gains but at no point have they shown any hints of an actual alliance. If that’s the case then they must be plotting something big.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did the prince of the Land of Flowers tell you himself?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Uzukage-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he tell you anything else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He asked us not to reveal that it was him who disclosed the news and gave us a scroll.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mina handed over the scroll to the Uzukage.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened the scroll and read the contents, her eyebrows raising at one point.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, dear?” Daimyo-sama asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A job commission, two actually.” She answered before looking at them. “What kind of person is this Prince of the Land of Flowers? What can you tell me about the Land of Flowers right now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Prince, Kazuya-sama is a very dedicated and honest person. He single handedly developed a new method of agriculture which can increase the production of crops in the Land of Flowers by 50%. And he didn’t just keep it to himself but actually distributed the method among his people. Due to this the people of the Land of Flowers are still in a relatively good state even during this war.” She reported.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is also training hundred or so children to raise them as samurai to establish a police force which he intends to expand throughout his country to improve the security of his people. In fact, he himself trains with them. The people of his land love him a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“An agricultural method to increase production by 50%?” Daimyo raised an eyebrow. “And he distributed it to everyone? Isn’t he afraid of the method being stolen by others?”</p><p><br></p><p>The answer to his question came not from them but rather his own daughter. “That guy just doesn’t care. I had asked him about this too and he said that if the method is spread in other countries, they would grow more food and would at least stop bothering them for food. So he actually wanted everyone to actually find out. His actual goal is to improve the lives of his people. Having plenty of food will make everyone’s lives better. That guy is really dumb at times, ya know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! You seem to know him quite well?” Daimyo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I do. Can you believe it, that guy actually learned basic Fuinjutsu by himself and was even teaching it to the kids training to be Samurai? It was so basic that anyone could have walked through those seals in minutes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He did write about it. He even thanked you saying that you were an extremely great teacher.” Uzukage-sama said with a smile at her daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just taught him the basics about Fuinjutsu. He had only memorised some seals but knew nothing of the art itself. The guy was dumb, I tell you. He was older than me and still at the basic level. Even children in Uzushio are better at Fuinjutsu than him.” The Princess just huffed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, and yet this so-called dumb person identified your disguise and you didn’t find out?” The Uzukage joked, making her go red.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise, Uzukage-sama.” She quickly apologised. It was after all due to their failure that put them in such a position.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to apologise, Rina. You people already did a great job bringing her out here alive. This is more than I can ask knowing the danger you encountered in the mission. By the way, what do you know about this prince’s fuinjutsu skill?</p><p><br></p><p>“I investigated and found out that the Prince had only started learning about chakra slightly over a year ago. If that’s the case then he is extremely talented in Fuinjutsu, reaching Intermediate level in just a year mostly without any guidance except the one week under Lady Tamami.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He reached intermediate level, did he? I guess he really liked Tamami’s teachings that’s why he has given us a contract for large scale warding and security seals for the Land of Flowers. Moreover, he has requested for a teacher to guide him with Fuinjutsu. He is willing to pay equivalent to an S Class Mission every month for the guidance. The second request is obviously left to our discretion but he promises his friendship if we agree to it.” Uzukage said making them freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“The request for the warding of properties is not bad but teaching Fuinjutsu, even if we only teach them basic knowledge, is a big deal. It is similar to establishing an alliance between the two countries and especially with a place like the Land of Flowers which doesn’t even have a ninja village. Moreover, can he really represent his country in proposing the alliance?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This...the Prince is the only descendant of the current daimyo and the previous daimyo. With his popularity, it is all but decided that he will be the next daimyo.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think we should do, dear?” The Uzukage asked Daimyo-sama.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. How about accepting the request for warding and observing them first? If things are good, we can talk with them about establishing an alliance. Maybe send a girl from the clan as a concubine to the Prince, further strengthening the alliance. After that, teaching him to an Advanced level or even Expert level would not be a loss. If the guy is really as good as they say, he will reach there by himself in the future. So doing this will only serve to help build more trust.” Daimyo-sama replied after a moment of thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. We will send a team there to complete the request made by the Prince. You two will be the ones leading the team. You also need to investigate the Prince and his political inclinations for the alliance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Uzukage-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>As they were talking, there was suddenly a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enter.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Jōnin entered looking worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the matter? Why do you look so worried?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Uzukage-sama. We have just received urgent news...”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Stairs Daimyo -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“How dare that bastard! He wants me to give him an answer?” He watched as the Medicine Daimyo, Wakui Yoshiki, threw the glass in his hand, smashing it on the wall and the pieces shattering all over the place.</p><p><br></p><p>The man then looked at him. “How did it come to this? You said they didn’t have anyone who could fight a Jōnin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They don't. Apart from the three Samurai there were no other strong guards. This is something verified by the shinobi you sent too. They are the ones who messed up the mission and even failed to hide their identities. All this has put the entire plan in jeopardy.” He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he doubting you?” Wakui asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously he would doubt me. I took those shinobi as my own people. I was able to calm that bastard with great efforts, even leaving that girl there as a supposed political hostage to assure him that I wasn’t planning anything bad. What kind of incompetent shinobi did you send? They couldn’t even knock him out.” He complained. “And now you say they ran away with all the information.”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t regret leaving that girl there.</p><p><br></p><p>If anything, it assured that she would not find anything about the plan. She was just an expendable...the daughter of a dead concubine of his son. Unfortunately, both of them died in an ambush during a trip to the Land of Vegetables, leaving her alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, he was glad he didn’t send her away to her mother’s family who were just a bunch of businessmen who traded weapons made in the Land of Stairs with other Lands. At least now she could be of some use.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those were the best of the Howling Wolf Village’s shinobi or so they said. I even paid them a hefty sum of money. They must have run away and defected to sell the information to other people for a greater sum. Those damn traitors. I gave them shelter when they needed it and now they are betraying me. Truly, these shinobi can never be trusted. I will put a reward on their heads and see them brought to me on their knees.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What should we do with the demands of Katsuyoshi? He wants strict actions against the Kodon Clan and an explanation from us or he will put the alliance on hold. We cannot lose this alliance or all our plans will go to waste.”</p><p><br>“Oh he won’t back down. I don’t need to give them any explanation. All we need to do is send some people and burn the crops in his country. Just because the brat has developed some new things and is growing more crops, they think they can dictate terms to us? Let them lose their crops for a year and suffer a bit to learn a lesson.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would that be a good idea? What if Kumo or Iwa intervenes? They depend on them for food.” He tried to dissuade the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, those barbarians are busy in their own war. They can’t even take down one Konoha, let alone have time to think about a small country like the Land of Flowers.” The guy snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father! Something big has happened.” Came the voice of his son-in-law and the Prince of the land of Medicine.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened as the boy bowed towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the matter? Why are you so worried?” Wakui asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father. The Land of Sky, Konoha has destroyed the Land of Sky and its hidden village.” He said, making them freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>The Land of Sky was a country which was far more advanced technologically than any other country. Their shinobi could even fly with the machines they had created.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a country...how could they?</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? And how did this happen?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The reason given was that they had challenged the sovereignty of the Five Great Ninja Villages and were destroyed for that reason. Neither of the four other villages or even the Daimyo of those Lands spoke anything about this indicating that it was done by their agreement. Father, what should we do? Would they?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was sweating and so were they. An entire village was just razed to the ground...just the words chilled their hearts.</p><p><br></p><p>Challenging the sovereignty...in simple words, they were becoming too strong for the liking of the bigger villages.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Wakui and spoke. “We cannot take any action against the Land of Flowers. If Kumo or Iwa caught even a hint of our involvement, we would be ruined.”</p><p><br></p><p>Wakui also seemed to have broken from his trance and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“This was a warning...from the big five to the smaller countries.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We...we should probably reduce the number of ninjas to show that we don’t mean to challenge them. Didn’t Katsuyoshi want answers? Tell him the members of the Kodon Clan will be exiled from the Land of Medicine. That should give him an answer and even satisfy the big five villages?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you really going to exile them?” He asked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously not. I will at best relocate them. In fact, you should keep them in the Land of Stairs, away from the heat as civilians. It would also teach them a lesson for betraying me.” Wakui said, wiping his sweat as his mind worked quickly. “And this will set an example for the rest of the Clans in the Howling Wolf Village to remain within their limits. Yes, this is a good plan.” Wakui nodded to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, yes. That should keep Katsuyoshi satisfied.” He agreed. Maybe he could even sway those Kodon Ninja to his side and establish a Ninja village in the Land of Stairs? That way, he will have more cards in the future. He thought to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>They discussed the plan for the rest of the night.</p><p><br></p><p>A country was destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>The coming days were sure to be full of chaos.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The destruction of the Land of Sky hit hard even when I knew what was coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Challenging the sovereignty of the five Great Ninja Villages...</p><p><br></p><p>The reason alone made me clench my fist in anger. So those bastards could do whatever they want, rampage in other people’s lands but no one else was allowed to do so?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no use in getting angry.</p><p><br></p><p>It was better to use this as motivation and become stronger. Only by becoming stronger can I break through this endless loop.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think our next action should be, Kazu-kun?” Grandpa asked as he drank his tea.</p><p><br></p><p>“We proceed as we were. They will only take action against us when they see us as a threat. Right now, we are nothing like that.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good, then so be it.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Ever since that day in the hospital room, he had left all these decisions on me entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get any reply from the Medicine and Stairs?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, but I expect a positive reply soon enough. They wouldn’t dare take any actions after the Land of the Sky incident.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can only hope so. By the way, how is your health? Are those medicines working?”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile came to his face soon. “Yes. They are working far better than I had expected. Dare I say we can get a great market for them if we sell them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. We are not going to even reveal them let alone sell them. Those medicines are very essential for our samurai.” I denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, your decision then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, Grandpa. I have some plans for establishing industries in our country.” I reassured him.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I said, it’s your decision. You probably don’t realise your popularity in the people. When the news about the attack on you came out, the Stairs Daimyo’s procession received glares from people on their way back till they were completely out of the country. I am afraid if our people were not escorting them, they could have been attacked on their way back. Even some of the notoriously cowardly nobles wanted the Stairs guy to be detained until this matter was solved.” He said with a smile, making me sweatdrop. “At this rate, even if I were to make you a Daimyo today, no one would raise a question. They would even welcome it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not yet ready for the responsibilities, Grandpa. I...my efforts are needed in research right now. I think I can contribute more to our people that way.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, I am using every moment of my time to train or research. I didn’t have any time to concentrate on governance of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then take your time and do what you want.” He nodded. “All I want is a great grandchild.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah...there he goes again.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, the princess of Stairs is quite a great girl herself. I seriously think she would make for a great wife for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Don’t tell me you don’t think she is pretty?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not the issue.” I protested. On the side note, Kasumi was pretty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what is? Aside from her scheming family, she has no flaws at all. I don’t get you sometimes. Other princes your age all have several lovers. Even the ones who had no chance to inherit the throne are the same. And yet, here you are, not showing any interest in other girls. No, that’s not true.You do have three beautiful girls in your subordinates but I never hear any news about you going anywhere with them. I am getting old, you know. I really want to see the face of my great grandchildren before I die.”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>I merely deadpanned at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not ready to be a father right now, Grandpa. Give me some time. You will have your great grandchildren.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, as long as that happens, I have no problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, I saw the information given to us by the Stairs Daimyo about the Princess. It is said that she is the daughter of the fourteenth concubine of the Stairs’ Daimyo’s son who died along with him in the ambush but I know for sure that Princess Kasumi’s mother was not his concubine.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was something which had struck me when I was reading everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” He asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am pretty sure she wasn’t a concubine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Must be another lie that bastard made up then. Well, what does it matter who her mother was? In fact, it’s good if she is not related to that bastard’s family. The girl is good. You should spend more time with her. I have seen how she takes care of you and I have no problems with her either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, don’t go in that direction.” I stopped him from going off into his great grandchildren drama again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay okay, sheesh. Can’t an old man state his wish nowadays?”</p><p><br></p><p>And thus continued our banter.</p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day that the information about Rōen was completely gathered.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at all the information and got to know what Rōen is and how strong it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, it wasn’t some kind of Tailed Beast like being. It wasn’t a chakra construct either. It was just a mutated monster which could absorb the chakra of other beings and live almost eternally.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as strong as a tailed beast, but only One Tails. That would explain the five months time needed to extract the information about it.</p><p><br></p><p>That means, I cannot use it repeatedly like I had wanted to like a tailed beast.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit, that changes many things.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to come up with another method.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it was not something I could let go.</p><p><br></p><p>Even without that, it could still serve as a sacrifice for a ritual to use in a summoning and that kind of power could be used to summon someone strong.</p><p><br></p><p>It might just be the deterrent we need to keep away people with bad thoughts. It also reduced the difficulty of the whole mission as I just had to sacrifice the wolf instead of seal it inside me. That’s something far easier to do. I just needed some practice for something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe this time I will use that Jōnin as a sacrifice to summon someone stronger?</p><p><br></p><p>Until now, I had been saving stronger shinobi prisoners for the previous soul ritual. Now, I had no such needs.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, with Rōen being a failure, I will have to find other targets for my experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>Another very important thing which had happened recently was the Grimoire getting charged for World Travel.</p><p><br></p><p>It had enough energy to send me to another world and bring me back once. I could have gathered this energy far faster if I had been using my own energy but I have been using my own energy for training and summoning everyday. I barely had any extra energy to spare for this.</p><p><br></p><p>I still couldn’t control the world I was travelling to but each world gets recorded in the Grimoire and a return trip to that world would only take half the energy next time.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to make some preparations before doing so, like preparing enough funds if I wanted to buy something, all in Gold and precious jewels, mastering basic genjutsu to avoid problems. I already knew the transformation technique but some genjutsu will always be more helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I stood in front of Kuina, facing her once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Start!” At Kanae’s instructions, we both shot from our places, clashing in between, sending shockwaves around us.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt the weight of her attack and twisted my sword, letting her attack slip by as I took a step forward, intending to strike her with my next move.</p><p><br></p><p>She was however one step ahead and quickly rotated her body in a dance-like motion, getting behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly dove forward, dodging her attack before kicking the ground and using the force to turn around and attack.</p><p><br></p><p>She faced me head on, clashing with me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t forget to breathe, Kazuya-san. Breathe!” Kanae shouted from the side and I realised that my breath had faltered and picked it up again.</p><p><br></p><p>Total Concentration Breathing was hard, especially during fights.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina however was not giving up her attacks and continued pursuing me.</p><p><br></p><p>The clashes got faster and we separated before suddenly releasing the first gate at the same time and rushing at each other again.</p><p><br></p><p>Our clashes continued before I felt my boost from the opened gate fading away and used all my strength to attack. She replied in kind, the resulting clash shattering the swords...again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dammit! This is the fifteenth sword.” She complained looking at the shattered sword in her hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><br></p><p>This was becoming a problem for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Chakra blades are stronger but getting them is not easy. I have already told Kensho to get us some but it will take some time. I will try to find the location of the Kusanagi Blades. It’s just that those blades are very famous and might attract the eyes of some unscrupulous ninja.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You need to man up a bit. We need to stop being so afraid.” She huffed but didn’t pressure me anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>RIght now, I was using all my summoning attempts to summon precious metals and jewels for trade in other worlds after world travel.</p><p><br></p><p>I could understand her frustrations though.</p><p><br></p><p>The lack of good swords was holding her back. In fact, even in this fight, I was going full strength without any weights while she was wearing her weights even now.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, I had told her about the kind of people she would have to face in her world and how strong Zoro becomes and thus she didn’t want to get left behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina was <em>very</em> competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will get something to solve this problem.” I promised.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and then left for training.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat there, regaining my breath. Even with my physique, opening the gate and fighting was hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae handed me a towel and sat beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t blame yourself, you know. We all know how hard you work but there is only so much one can do by themselves. In fact, Kuina is also feeling frustrated because she is not being able to help you out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You two are friends, aren’t you?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s why when she sees you working so hard and cannot do anything, she feels frustrated. Unlike you however, the only thing she can do well is swordsmanship but now even that is being hindered. It makes her feel useless.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s not true. She is already the strongest one among us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That she is...but she is not strong enough to protect everyone. Kuina is a very good girl. She wants to share your burdens with you. We all do...even Seraphim.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sera? Hahahaha, yeah, she would sooner use me for her Tsubame Gaeshi training.” I laughed out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not true, you know. In fact, did you know that vampire ninjas have a strange custom?” She asked, smiling mysteriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“What custom?” I asked, taking a bottle from my side and taking a sip of the water.</p><p><br></p><p>“If they kiss someone, they are considered married to them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I spat out the water immediately and looked at Kanae who was still smiling calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are kidding right?” I asked, stunned. There was no way...</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I was told this by Sera-chan herself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that was an accident. You all saw it yourself.” I protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. But Sera-chan is very serious about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No way. She is the type to kill me and then kill herself rather than accept something like that.” I retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, you don’t know how a woman’s heart works, Kazuya-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That woman tried to kill me the first time she saw me, ya know. I am saying this from experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And your experience with women is...not very good, is it?”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>Low blow, Kanae. Low blow.</p><p><br></p><p>This was something I would expect from Kuina, not you.</p><p><br></p><p>As the days passed, we were growing closer to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina, Saitō, Kanae and now even Sera, they have become my close friends.</p><p><br></p><p>I told them what I knew about their worlds, except Seraphim, whose world I knew almost nothing about.</p><p><br></p><p>The most I could remember from that world was the existence of a chainsaw wielding magical girl and sometimes a guy wearing the same magical girl costume...</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure she would look at me like I was some kind of a pond scum if I told her this...that’s why we didn’t have much to share between us.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, we were getting closer. And now, I find this.</p><p><br></p><p>That night we gathered for another ritual. This time, the Kodon Jōnin was brought with us.</p><p><br></p><p>Preparing a ritual to assist with the summoning was a lot more complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me several hours to get the ritual circle ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when everything was done, I threw the woman in the circle and stood outside it, summoning my Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s hope this works.” I said to myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I want someone strong to help us with the Rōen mission.</p><p><br></p><p>And then I felt a drain in chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>Even my Jōnin level chakra went dry almost instantly and I fell to my knees, biting my tongue to not lose my consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>A strange scene took place in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>The body of the ninja in the ritual circle was compressed, turning into a ball of flesh and blood. It started spinning in the ritual circle, releasing a red light before slowly taking the form of a person. Slowly, the ball turned into the form of a man.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a tall, muscular man with mid-length straight black hair that reached to his ears. His eyes were green, and he had thin black eyebrows and a scar on the corner of his right lip.</p><p><br></p><p>When the process was completed, the man just looked at himself and muttered. “Huh, so that was not fake. I thought I was hallucinating due to blood loss.” He then looked at us and asked. “So, you all seem to be the people who summoned me for some help. What do you need?”</p><p><br></p><p>I stepped forward. “Hello. My name is Kazuya Katsuyoshi. I summoned you to help us to help protect my country. May I know what to call you?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Protect your country? What happened, did Japan go to war again? I thought those days were left behind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, this is not Japan. You are in a different world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...seriously?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I made sure you would know it when being summoned. Did you not hear?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...I was kinda bleeding out, being stared at by that white haired demon when I heard the voice. I accepted before I could hear anything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s...I am sorry I guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be. If I wasn’t here, I would be dead. Being alive feels better. So, a new world eh. That’s certainly something I haven’t heard of before. Oh, name’s Toji by the way. Toji Fushiguro.”</p><p><br></p><p>...fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy who was devouring enough food for fifteen people with no care in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>This didn’t look like someone who was on the verge of dying and was summoned to a new world.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing he did was ask for food and I provided him that.</p><p><br></p><p>While this was happening, I thought about this summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Toji said he was dying so it must have been a fight with Gojo but there were no injuries on his body.</p><p><br></p><p>Did the sacrifice neutralise it?</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, Toji would be equal to a taijutsu specialist jōnin or even elite level in terms of his physique but he still needs training in other aspects of chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>I am sure that he would be a force to be reckoned with when he learns the Eight Inner Gates technique.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the Eight Inner Gates fit him too well and even without that, just having chakra alone would make him far stronger. Maybe I could get my first Kage level fighter out of him if things go well.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy finished eating and looked at me. “So, now tell me what I need to do.”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Why are you looking confused? Despite what you might think, I cannot read minds, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, no. I know that. I was just a bit surprised that you agreed so easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I was dying and now I am here, suddenly healed and alive. I accepted the deal. I have lived enough to know these things don’t come for free. So, what do I need to do?” He answered with a shrug.</p><p><br></p><p>“I...”</p><p><br></p><p>I explained the whole situation to him</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s interesting. So, how strong would you say I am compared to these...ninjas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A jōnin in terms of physique but you would die in a fight against one.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow, unconvinced. “Really?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “I know quite a lot about you and your world, both past and the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh, and what does the future hold?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to know?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have nothing to lose, so why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, since you chose it, I will not hide.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went on to explain to him the future events of Jujutsu Kaisen and almost an hour later, the guy’s face was a sight to behold.</p><p><br></p><p>“Send me back, now.” He said in a no nonsense voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not strong enough. I could probably open a portal to your world but I am just not strong enough right now. Moreover, what can you even do if you go back? As you are now, Gojo would kill you either way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can take him on.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, no you can’t. Not anymore. You had your chance and you lost it. Satoru Gojo is now forever beyond your reach.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw him clench his fists and glare at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will send you back when I can and even help you out to the best of my abilities, this is a promise. But until then, you need to help me too. In fact, use this chance and become stronger. You can learn things here that will make you nigh invincible in your own world.” I convinced the guy over the whole night before he finally calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of it, we had an agreement between us.</p><p><br></p><p>I will help him get stronger and send him back to his world, or at least summon his son and step-daughter here in case something happens to him and in return, he will help me to the best of his abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>When I asked him if he was fine with it, his reply was.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am used to being hired for this kind of work. This time I just have to work for something other than money. Something far more important.”</p><p><br></p><p>And so, I had Toji Fushiguro join the team.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Hey guys, sorry for the delay.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I got a bad case of flu so no ‘Isekai Restaurant’ as promised.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Since I didn’t want you guys to be without any posts, here’s another chapter of ‘Ruling By the Book’, I had in reserve.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will write again when I fully recover.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As you can see, Kazuya’s team is finally starting to form now.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see more in the future.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

They lost their consciousness. The youngest one was barely able to stand either. We arranged doctors for them but at the rate they are healing, it will take over a month for them to recover. It looks like the Iwa shinobi were trying to catch them alive for some reason so the poison they used was mostly for the purpose of subduing and not killing them.”Saitō explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, the Uzumaki have always had exceptional life force. They can heal pretty fast.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They have something big to hide. You have noticed that the person dressed up as a guy is actually a girl. She must be someone very important.”</p><p><br></p><p>Crossdressing?</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, I did not notice that at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find anything about the Iwa Shinobi?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two among the dead were Jōnin ranked and the rest were Chunin. Those two redheads must be exceptionally strong to take on that kind of force, probably Elite Jōnin at the very least. We are interrogating them but they are not speaking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Such people rarely talk. Just do not let them die. I will take care of them. Have you cleared out the area of the fight?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Everything has been cleared out and all traces of battle have been removed. I have ordered the students to plant flowers on the land, to cover the area too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Keep a watch on our guests and see that they are hidden from the view of normal people. No one must know they are here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Saitō nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw a hint of hesitation in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Any questions?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded after some thought. “Are you sure this is a good idea? Interfering in the business of Iwa and siding with someone we don’t even know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I have several reasons for this. First, there is no way we can side with Iwa. Anything that has the chance of empowering them is bad news for us.” I saw his eye twitch slightly but he did not say anything. By now, he understood the situation of the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued. “Second, The Uzumaki are connected to Konoha and after the Land of Stairs becomes a part of the Land of Flowers, they are going to be our neighbours. If we could make some good relations with them with Uzumaki as a mediator, we can use it to lessen the pressure of Iwa and even keep Kumo in limits.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What if they try to conquer us?” Saitō countered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Konoha and the Land of Fire can also try to pull the same thing as Iwa. What then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They would not because we do not have anything they do not already have. The Land of Fire has plentiful fertile lands. They do not exactly need our small patch of land to give them anything and it would also put them directly on the boundary of Iwa. That is a bad choice. They would rather have us as a buffer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Buffer nations don’t have the best of the fates either. Look at Ame and Kusa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, no they do not.” I agreed and then smiled. “That is why it will give us a reason to push the date of the merger back until the war ends giving us more time to prepare. Give me five years and we can have strong enough forces to deter the big five. In fact, the Uzumaki are a very important part of these plans?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What plans?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me, why are the Uzumaki Clan famous?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“For their red hair, extremely high vitality and...their prowess in sealing. You...you are planning to get their help with Rōen?” He asked. </p><p><br></p><p>“Well, not Rōen exactly. We do not have any negotiation power if they turn on us to take control of Rōen for themselves. That is a mountain we need to cross by ourselves. Unless we have at least one Kage level individual, we do not have the freedom to do anything that might attract the attention of people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then the Uzumaki?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Even just warding our palace or warehouses would be a great boon. The Uzumaki are the best we can get for this. Fuinjutsu is the most versatile art in this world. You should not just look at it from the sealing perspective. They have a wide variety of uses.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded slightly in understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, if I could make some friendly relationship with the Uzumaki, then after the attack on Uzu, there could be some chances of us recruiting them.</p><p><br></p><p>I could even just hire them right before the invasion and give them a place here as the attack on Uzu was apparently too sudden or at least that is what I remember.</p><p><br></p><p>If possible, I could also discreetly pass on some information about the coming invasion and let them bleed the other three villages badly.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, did you get what I told you to?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We were able to get their blood.” He handed me the vials.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. We will need another sample from them when they are cured of the poison.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you order.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed and lay down on the tatami mats after he left.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>With only one month left for the engagement, I was feeling the pressure as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing I had discovered about the Grimoire was that which it could give me information about someone, it could only do so until that point of time.</p><p><br></p><p>If I needed the updated information, I would need to go through the entire process of searching again which requires time, something I lack.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, I needed to use the Grimoire to search for techniques and knowledge of Chakra to train my people.</p><p><br></p><p>Balancing both has been hard. If I focus on people, then the rate at which I acquire knowledge will be compromised and if I concentrate on knowledge, the rate at which I get information is compromised. I can only force myself to juggle both until I have a good enough spy network.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Grimoire cannot predict the future and thus can only give me information about selected people which is not exactly good for spying.</p><p><br></p><p>I could not possibly know who my enemy is among all the people of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitō was training some people to be spies too but such things take a lot of time, something which he does not have due to his duties.</p><p><br></p><p>I need two more chunin for the next soul ritual. Perhaps that could boost my chakra a bit more and I could summon someone stronger next time?</p><p><br></p><p>There were a few things which I had set in motion though.</p><p><br>For example, I had begun the search for some characters and found that the Ame Trio were still with their parents.</p><p><br></p><p>I used Konan for the search target as Nagato took too much time and was not worth the effort as he would just attract the unwanted eyes of Madara and Zetsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Konan’s parents were actually craftsmen who made things out of paper like paper windows and doors as well as paper lamps.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus I had sent some people to offer them jobs stating that I had seen their work and was impressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Daimyo were known to be whimsical beings so it was not out of scope of understanding for some of them to make such a move.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to get Konan under my wing because she was someone who had become an S Class ninja on her own with just three years of training from Jiraya.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, what would happen to future Yahiko and Nagato?</p><p><br></p><p>Why should I care?</p><p><br></p><p>By that time, I would have more than enough power to take down Hanzo or even Madara so it wouldn’t matter.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“You are teaching them Fuinjutsu?” Tamaki Uzumaki, the youngest member of the group,  the girl who was disguised as a guy, asked.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been three days since they started living here and the three had not disclosed the identity of the girl so we didn’t break their facade either.</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows how they would react?</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the girl was terrible in acting and at this point most of my subordinates knew her identity as a girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We think Fuinjutsu is a beautiful art, not to mention incredibly useful. We wish to teach some of our people Fuinjutsu so that they can help with the security of our country.” I replied, not stuttering in the slightest.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you are the one teaching them? Wait, you know Fuinjutsu?” She asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha we wouldn’t call ourself a master but we know enough to teach some of them. We are learning the skills too although it’s quite a difficult task for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously. Fuinjutsu is the most complex of the Shinobi Arts. Not everyone can learn it, let alone by self study.” She puffed her chest proudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“True, still, we need to try for our people.” I answered, not even pretending this time.</p><p><br></p><p>She just stared at me for a while and then looked at the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can teach you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can teach you till my companions are cured. Think of it as a thanks for helping us and saving our lives.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“You do not need to do so. We know that Shinobi arts are the secrets of a Shinobi Village and different Clans. We would never tell you to do something like this. We didn’t save you for your knowledge. We saved you because we wanted to. We hate Iwa Shinobi too. They were the ones responsible for the death of our father. So killing them was not a completely selfless act either.” I answered. Really, I didn’t need the Uzumaki clan to come after me.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, if it was just their techniques, I could always search for it with my Grimoire and I would get it regardless.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no use to potentially harm our future friendship over this.</p><p><br></p><p>She just looked at me and rolled her eyes. “I am obviously not going to teach you my clan secrets but teaching you common things is not a problem so you don’t need to worry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...are you sure?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Now show me what you are doing.”</p><p><br></p><p>I hesitated a moment before nodding.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next two hours I showed her the seals I had learned, which was quite a decent collection by now.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have only learned this much?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, learning things by our lonesome is hard.” I laughed, not disclosing any of my secrets. She then went on to explain some tricks about some seals and some basic methods which can be used to make them more efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki had really perfected this as an art form.</p><p><br></p><p>Just changing the composition of paper or ink could affect the seals so much.</p><p><br></p><p>They had even divided the practitioners into different ranks.</p><p><br></p><p>Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert and finally Master.</p><p><br></p><p>I was currently a novice, close to the Intermediate Level but still a Novice.</p><p><br></p><p>Tamaki on the other hand was an Advanced level Fuinjutsu user, something which she happily bragged about.</p><p><br></p><p>Her two companions were both Experts.</p><p><br></p><p>The likes of Minato and Mito would be genuine Seal Masters although the latter was far above Minato’s level from what I could tell due to the ramblings of this girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Being an Advanced level at her age was already a great achievement, something only rare prodigies could achieve.</p><p><br></p><p>If things went well, she would become a Seal Mistress as well.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I learned many things about Fuinjutsu and realised how inefficient my method of learning was.</p><p><br></p><p>I was only focusing on Seals instead of the entire art.</p><p><br></p><p>My method was not at all systematic and thus was far harder to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>Tamaki explained to me the order of doing things which helped me make a basic outline of how to teach fuinjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the course of the next two weeks, I was able to learn more than I had learned in the last three months unassisted.</p><p><br></p><p>The sealing arrays reminded me of maths problems and with my enhanced mind, they were becoming easier to solve when I knew what I wanted to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I completed the last character with a stroke of my brush on a wooden plank and looked at my work.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This looks good. Now use chakra and activate it.” My temporary teacher told me and I complied.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wooden Plank emitted a very soft light for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s test it.</p><p><br></p><p>I hung the plank near the main door and went back to the room and then I looked out of the window and called Kuina who was practising swordsmanship with Kanae.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later I <em>felt</em> a presence entering the house.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensory Seals were at work.</p><p><br></p><p>“You sensed it, didn’t you?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. How strange. I am not there and yet...”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s because of your chakra. Even when separated from your body, it’s still a part of you. That’s why you can sense these things.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. </p><p><br></p><p>This was the exact same principle behind the memory transfer of the Shadow Clone technique, something which I had gained but couldn’t use due to my chakra reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, using that technique gave me the idea of why Multi Shadow Clone was a forbidden technique and how absurd Naruto’s chakra reserves truly were.</p><p><br></p><p>The technique had left me drained and with a headache the first time I had used it. Moreover, the transfer of pain was no joke either.</p><p><br></p><p>It also made me have some respect for Naruto. He must have insanely high pain resistance for him to just bulldoze through hundreds of them and not even blink an eye.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I couldn’t even imagine fighting with Shadow Clones as suddenly feeling the pain of being stabbed in the gut was enough for most people to break their attention and losing attention in a fight could easily kill someone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now you can activate the traps from a distance too just by sensing where they are. It's a very nifty technique to make traps which can take out even stronger shiboni. I guess this makes you an Intermediate Seal Master. Congratulations.” She wished me with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. This wouldn’t have been possible without your help.” I bowed to the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah! You don’t need to bow. You saved my, our lives. This is only the least bit I can do.” She hurriedly waved her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. This is the least we can do. You have been an incredible teacher. Thank you very much.” I wasn’t even lying. In these past two weeks, she had actually guided me honestly and helped me progress.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl blushed at the praise. “You’re welcome, dattebane.”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>I just stared at her while her blush deepened and then she bursted. “You didn’t hear anything, understood?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Ma'am.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good...wait. Ma’am?!”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you three have to go so soon? We are having a celebration in a week. You can stay and join us.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The older of the twins, Mina and Rina shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have already overstayed our welcome. We couldn’t impose more upon you. We have to escort Miss Tamami back to the village. We are already very late.” She looked at the girl who was talking with Kanae and the rest of the group before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been embarrassed when I discovered her identity but fortunately she didn’t attack me or anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, even her companions had just face-palmed when they found out.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s disappointing. But feel free to visit us in the future. We would also love to go to your village sometime in the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness. We would love to welcome you and return your hospitality. The Uzumaki will never forget this gratitude so please feel free to ask us if you need our assistance in any case.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “We would also feel more comfortable to hire shinobi we know than someone we have no relation with.”</p><p><br></p><p>This made her confused. “My apologies, Your Majesty but isn’t the Land of Flowers allied with the Land of Lightning?”</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes. “What kind of allies have to pay tributes to their friends? We have a relationship of convenience. Lightning doesn’t want Earth to grow stronger and we don’t want to be conquered by other countries. Lightning is just the lesser of two evils here. But from the things we have discovered, it looks like even this might not last for long.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems that Iwa, Kumo and Mizu are planning something. An alliance between them would mean a death sentence for us.” I sighed, passing a crucial piece of information to her. If they could investigate it and find out more, good for them.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw her eyes open wide and her mouth open in surprise at the news.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “We don’t know the details of anything or even the time but there is no doubt in our information.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just...”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t disclose to anyone that we gave you this piece of news or it might become bad for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I swear on the name of my clan.” She vowed.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, Tamami was done with her greetings and came back too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we will leave.” She said after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sad?” I asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah! Why would I be sad? And why are you so happy?”</p><p><br></p><p>I just burst out laughing at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you laughing at, you moron?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Tamami, you cannot say that.” Her companions quickly intervened.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, small Daimyo or not, insulting a Daimyo or a Prince was a no go for shinobi.</p><p><br></p><p>Daimyo and royal families were absolute taboos.</p><p><br></p><p>Killing one could get anyone a rank S bounty by all nations combined.</p><p><br></p><p>The only exception was when two countries were at war.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved their worries off. “Don’t worry. We are not offended. After all, although temporarily, Miss Tamami was our Sensei and we think it’s not odd for a sensei scolding their pupil.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was shameless enough to grab at the opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>“See Rina, I was not wrong, ya know.”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>This just made me laugh again.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you laughing about?” She asked, incensed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing. We just think we should part ways with a sad look on our faces. Laughing like this is much better.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph. Well, if that’s the case, then it’s fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw both her companions shaking their heads at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, we are leaving now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, take care on your journey and remember that the Land of Flowers always has a place for you. After all, the future Daimyo of this Land is your student.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>This caused her to smile too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh we remembered something.” I brought out a scroll from our sleeves. “This is a request for a quest for the Uzukage. If they accept it, they can send someone over. But please don’t worry. This will not affect our relations at all. This is...just my personal curiosity after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this?” She asked, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“A request for a job.” I smiled mysteriously.</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, the group of redheads left for their village.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I stood in my lab.</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow was the day of my engagement and I was planning to complete some rituals today.</p><p><br>First was a Ritual to increase my charm.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to collect two hundred varieties of flowers for this, something which was quite easy for me and I had even collected the materials for the ritual a while back but didn’t go through with this to prevent my guests from noticing. The catch was that each of these flowers should be flawless.</p><p><br></p><p>This ritual was relatively simple and just drawing the circles and placing the sacrifices was enough to get me started with it.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual circles lit up and the flowers turned into an ink like substance and slowly flowed into my body.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt warm all over. It was like the first ritual I had done.</p><p><br></p><p>After the ritual was completed, I went to the mirror and checked myself.</p><p><br></p><p>The changes in my body were not huge.</p><p><br></p><p>What the ritual did was fix my imperfections or any blemishes my body had. Scars were removed and the skin and hair became healthier.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, I couldn’t notice anything. Was this all?</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, that’s no good.</p><p><br></p><p>I started to prepare for the second ritual right after that.</p><p><br></p><p>This time something else was going to come in hand. The blood of the Uzumaki.</p><p><br></p><p>I had found out that Mina and Rina were both sensors. I didn’t know if they had the Uzumaki’s trademark Mind’s Eye of Kagura but even that didn’t exactly matter.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual I was going to do was to gain the ability to sense chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>It required several ingredients but most of all, the blood of another sensor ninja.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensing was an ability I was looking forward to for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho apparently had this ability but I didn’t want to ask him for his blood as that would just raise doubts in the guy’s mind. The encounter with the Uzumaki was heaven sent.</p><p><br></p><p>I had planned for another set of rituals for different things, for example the ritual to increase my elemental affinity with different elements.</p><p><br></p><p>On checking, it turned out that I had water affinity but there were rituals which could give me different affinities as well as increase the strength of my existing affinities.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, I needed the water from seven different lakes to increase my Water affinity. Earth from seven different mountains to gain earth affinity, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t tried these yet as I wasn’t exactly concentrating on elemental ninjutsu for now.</p><p><br></p><p>The preparations were complete and I started the ritual as usual.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual circle lit up and suddenly, I felt as if a door was opened.</p><p><br></p><p>It was strange, as if using an organ I hadn’t used for the first time. I could just feel different presences around me.</p><p><br></p><p>Each presence had a different...size or weight and each presence was different in their own way. They had their own...flavours if that’s even the right word for it.</p><p><br></p><p>So this was a sensing skill? It’s incredible.</p><p><br></p><p>No, it was beyond incredible.</p><p><br></p><p>My range was not that high yet, slightly beyond the warehouse which would be fifty metres radius but even that was incredible.</p><p><br></p><p>There was so much I could do with this.</p><p><br></p><p>Another Ritual I wanted to do today was to achieve poison resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that the people of the Land of Stairs and the Land of Medicine would try to poison me so it was better to start getting resistance to these things in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several levels to this Ritual as well. The higher I went, the better the poisons I would be resistant too. This also gave me resistance to some diseases.</p><p><br></p><p>The first stage of Ritual needed me to gather twelve poisonous animals or insects.</p><p><br></p><p>The second stage of the Ritual needed 100 poisonous herbs.</p><p><br></p><p>The third stage needed some esoteric types of poison which I didn’t even know about so that’s out of reach.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, checking a few more things, I decided to proceed towards the last thing on today’s to do list.</p><p><br></p><p>Summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow was my engagement so I was betting a lot on this summoning ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>This summoning could change a lot of things. That's why I was planning to summon someone as a bodyguard.</p><p><br></p><p>Drawing the ritual circles again, I summoned my Grimoire and put my hand on it.</p><p><br></p><p>I need someone completely loyal to me as a bodyguard.</p><p><br></p><p>As I imagined this, the memories of Mina and Rina defending Tamami came to my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Having a shinobi bodyguard wouldn’t be bad either.</p><p><br></p><p>The white ritual circle turned into a red colour and a figure appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could react though, the figure jumped towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaves gathered around the figure’s hands during the jump.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsubamegaeshi.”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” My mind blanked for a second at the words.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Kuina, who was behind me, worked quickly and was about to stop the girl’s attack but something strange happened.</p><p><br></p><p>The sword made of leaves fell apart as soon as it came near me, making Kuina miss her attack and hitting the girl instead.</p><p><br></p><p>The force threw her at me at a faster force, crashing straight into me and I was enveloped by a soft feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to push but my hands were met with two soft cushions of flesh and I felt a moan in my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl seemed to have realised what had happened and moved back quickly and I could finally see her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a girl with long black hair and green eyes. She had her hair in a high ponytail and left a few locks of hair to dangle on either side of her face. She was slightly shorter than me and...that figure, damn...</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina had blanked due to the incident and the girl herself was stunned and was touching her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>So that was a kiss...</p><p><br></p><p>This was not the kind of summoning I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina was the first person to break out of the stunned state and quickly stood in front of me, covering me.</p><p><br></p><p>She had her sword drawn and pointed towards the girl in black.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you and why did you attack all of a sudden?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The question seemed to have broken the girl out of her trance as well. She threw me a glare and if looks could kill, I would be dead already.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s up with that look lady? And what problem do you have with me? Sure I called you here, but you were given an option too. I didn’t force anyone here.” I said, slightly angry at the sudden attack.</p><p><br></p><p>“So it was you who summoned me. I thought it was another trick of the other ninja clan to take us down. Who are you and why did you summon me here?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Ninja Clan?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she a ninja?</p><p><br></p><p>But Tsubamegaeshi?</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I was the one who summoned you but I only asked for someone who was about to die and even then they must be asked for their agreement first. You were summoned because you agreed to it then why did you attack me?”</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh. “I was in a fight when we were ambushed in a trap of the enemy clan. That's when I heard the voice and accepted the offer without knowing what was happening. When the light disappeared and I saw someone in front of me, I attacked.” She then looked towards me with a heated gaze. “And yet, I became powerless as soon as I went near you and was taken advantage of.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Taken advantage of? Are you out of your mind? I didn't make a single move. You were the one who tried to attack me and then crashed into me when the attack failed. How is that me taking advantage of you? If anything, it's you taking advantage of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just continued to glare at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Kuina took charge of the situation. She told me to leave the room and that she would talk to the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>I was more than happy to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>The two girls came out after an hour and while the girl was controlled, she still stared at me unnervingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Seraphim. I am a vampire ninja. Thank you for saving my life.” She bowed slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Vampire?</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you drink blood?” I asked, cautiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. But I don’t drain just anyone out of blood. I can drink blood from blood bags just fine.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will arrange blood bags for you but you are not allowed to drink blood from any of my people. Nor are you allowed to turn anyone into a vampire. This is an order.” In fact, I set a rule for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot turn others into vampires. I am a vampire ninja, not one of those freaks from TV Dramas.” She protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh...that’s fine then.”</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, Kuina had done a really good job at explaining everything to her, having witnessed the process several times.</p><p><br></p><p>I told her to take her to Kanae to explain about this world. Kanae was the best at explaining things among us.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, this also reminded me how much of a bet summoning someone was.</p><p><br></p><p>Although it said that whatever or whoever I summon will not be able to harm me, it doesn’t mean they wouldn’t try to harm me.</p><p><br></p><p>Till now, everyone I had summoned had turned out to be pretty good but that doesn’t mean the future would be the same as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh, and here I thought things had been going good.</p><p><br><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The door to my room opened and Kuina entered.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are ready to leave.” She said before taking a look at me. “Oh, you are looking good, dressed like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, are you hitting on me?” I asked with a smile, making her roll her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina and I had a funny relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>We were bros.</p><p><br></p><p>With how tomboyish she was, it wasn’t even odd.</p><p><br></p><p>I haven’t had any friends my age due to my position and so when she came, she became my first friend.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why she has always been very special to me.</p><p><br></p><p>We often joked around with each other like this.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, feeling nervous? You are going to get engaged today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am feeling nervous but not about the engagement itself but the other things that will come afterwards.”</p><p><br></p><p>She patted my shoulders. “Don’t worry. We will take care of every problem together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>With this, we left the palace and went to the place where my Grandpa was waiting with the other nobles.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of him another man sat in the traditional clothing of the Daimyo. He looked to be around the same age as my Grandpa. Behind him was a girl sitting with her head bowed and looking at the ground. Princess Kasumi, the sacrifice from their side in a bid to usurp the Land of Flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>She had long black hair and red eyes, dressed in a red kimono, she looked like a doll of some kind.</p><p><br></p><p>My arrival brought all the eyes on me. Grandpa looked at me and signalled me to sit beside him. I bowed and politely took a seat there.</p><p><br></p><p>While doing so, I almost unconsciously spread my chakra sensory skill and quickly pinched myself in the leg to prevent showing any expressions.</p><p><br></p><p>Six Chakra signatures in the people sitting in the envoy brought by the Stairs Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>One was far above my own Chakra level, three were around my Chakra level and two were below mine.</p><p><br></p><p>One Jōnin, three Chunin and two Genin.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t look in their direction and just smiled at the Stairs Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa and the guy talked with each other and then Stairs Daimyo formally presented the marriage proposal which Grandpa accepted. They then looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya Katsuyoshi, do you agree to take Princess Kasumi Fujimoto, the Granddaughter of the Sixth Daimyo of the Land of Stairs as your fiance?” Grandpa asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kasumi Fujimoto, do you agree to take Prince Kazuya Katsuyoshi, the Grandson of the Fourteenth Daimyo of the Land of Flowers as your finance?” The Stairs Daimyo asked her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” The girl spoke in a very small voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then, from today onwards, Princess Kasumi Fujimoto of the Land of Stairs is engaged to Prince Kazuya Katsuyoshi of the Land of Flowers.”</p><p><br></p><p>What followed was a long and tiring introduction and celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, the Jōnin three Chunins were actually introduced as the attendants of the Princess, which I knew to be utter bullshit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jōnin’s name was Mogami or at least that’s how she introduced herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Were they planning to send these four from the start to infiltrate my home?</p><p><br></p><p>They would stay here for a week before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, that just complicated things.</p><p><br></p><p>But, maybe not.</p><p><br></p><p>A thought came to my mind and I began planning.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see if I can use this situation to my advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa took the Stairs Daimyo for an official tour of the City while I had to do the same for the Princess.</p><p><br></p><p>Her attendants followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>On a simple signal from me, Kuina followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked my other subordinates to stay away from the sight of the Stairs entourage. I didn’t want to give them any indication of our power.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the place where Saitō conducted training was changed to look like a school.</p><p><br></p><p>I showed her around the town, avoiding the direction of the school and my warehouse.</p><p><br></p><p>From what little we talked, I could say that the girl was actually a good person.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, simply noticing her gaze during our travels was enough to give me an idea about her nature.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what do you think about the Land of Flowers?” I asked,</p><p><br></p><p>“Your people seem to be happy. Lord Daimyo must be a very good leader.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed, our Grandfather is a very able and kind ruler. He always places the happiness of our people above all else. This is what has earned him the love and trust of our people.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this time that the Jōnin spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Daimyo is indeed an able ruler but you must not discount your own contribution towards the people, Prince Kazuya.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked in the direction of the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t understand what you are referring to?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously the new farming method you have introduced to the population of the Land of Flowers. It is due to this that even during such dire times, the people of the Land of Flowers can live such peaceful lives.” She spoke with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind ran at a fast speed, considering the implications of her words.</p><p><br>Were they here to get that method?</p><p><br></p><p>No, it would be easier to just get it out of some random farmer than come to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are rumours that the Prince himself invented these methods as well as brought reforms for all the farmers of the land. It goes to show that the Prince is a very learned researcher too.” She praised.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, I see.</p><p><br></p><p>So that’s your plan. Good. Then let’s see how far you can go.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her and nodded. “Thank you. It’s just something we do for our people.”</p><p><br></p><p>Looking closely, I saw a glint in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Prince is very kind.” She bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>I concentrated back on the Princess and didn’t speak further on this topic.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Attendant Jōnin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Six days had passed since they had come to the Land of Flowers for their mission.</p><p><br></p><p>Her team’s mission was to infiltrate the Daimyo’s mansion and discover the information about the new farming methods, the formula for the fertilisers and finally the special seeds which the Daimyo’s lands used to grow their crops.</p><p><br></p><p>The information about the miraculous growth of the crops in the Land of Flowers had spread to the neighbouring lands as well and everyone wanted to know how they could do such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously finding the information was quite easy as the fool had spread the information among every common farmer.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, they soon noticed a difference.</p><p><br></p><p>While the produce in the other lands increased as well, they were still lower than the produce of the Daimyo’s lands.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then guessed that the Daimyo must be using some other secret method for his lands which further increased the production of crops.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mission this time was to find this method and slip away with the procession of the Princess of the Land of Stairs.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously the Daimyos of the Land of Stairs and her own Daimyo must have some kind of agreement behind the scenes which she was not aware of.</p><p><br></p><p>But her question was not asking questions but completing the mission.</p><p><br></p><p>It had taken her three days to figure out the locations where the Prince worked and three more days to verify the entire place. Tomorrow they were scheduled to leave and today was the day they had to work everything out.</p><p><br></p><p>An unusually large warehouse a little distance away from the main Palace. There was also a school and a martial arts dojo combined with the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Late at night, after the royal families had gone to sleep, she and her team left their rooms and vanished in the darkness of the night, gathering in the forest in the outskirts, looking at the building from a distance away.</p><p><br></p><p>The building looked quiet and they checked for anyone around the place but didn’t find anything except the guards on the gates and some guards making rounds around the place. None of them went inside the place.</p><p><br></p><p>From the information she had found out, only the Prince and two girls who were thought to be his lovers were allowed inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy apparently had two or three lovers, one of them being the samurai girl following him. Still, what Daimyo didn’t?</p><p><br></p><p>At least the boy was far more attractive than any other Daimyo she had seen. Hell, she had felt her heart skip a beat the first time she had seen him.</p><p><br></p><p>That Princess was lucky to get a shot with this hottie instead of being married off to some fat bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, this is also what made her sure that the secrets of the Prince’s research were obviously inside this place.</p><p><br></p><p>With a signal from her, all of them rushed inside the building from several directions.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of them took a different route to ensure they could check the whole buildings at the fastest speed possible.</p><p><br></p><p>She herself headed towards the most important rooms, like the Principal’s Room and other official rooms but didn’t find anything inside them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when she was about to leave that she noticed another courtyard which looked like living rooms, perhaps the quarters for the teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>Did the teachers go on a vacation because she couldn’t see anything there?</p><p><br></p><p>She went ahead and found the rooms indeed looked like people were living there until recently. She checked around and found a locked door to the basement.</p><p><br></p><p>To her surprise, the room’s doors were actually reinforced steel under the wooden outer layer. Instead of frowning, her eyes lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it this place?</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously the room was locked with several locks but these things were as simple as flicking a finger for her to unlock. Behind the door were stairs which went below. She lit up a matchstick and slowly walked down carefully before she stopped. A thin wire shining under the light of the matchstick.</p><p><br></p><p>Trap.</p><p><br></p><p>It was well hidden and could probably catch even inexperienced Chunin off guard but she was a Jōnin and it would be stupid for her to fall for something like this.</p><p><br></p><p>The trap only served to make her more excited as she was sure that this place had something to hide.</p><p><br></p><p>She checked the place and simply walked on the walls to avoid the traps until she reached below to another door.</p><p><br></p><p>This one had more complicated locks and even took fifteen minutes to unlock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn that Flower Boy has gone beyond his level to protect this place.” She muttered.</p><p><br></p><p>On opening the room, she found it to be outlined with books everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a desk with paper and many shelves with what looked like containers full of seeds. Jackpot.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly brought out the sealing scrolls and began storing everything inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“You missed one on the bottom shelf.” Suddenly a voice made her freeze. On reflex, she reached for her kunai but found herself frozen. No matter how much she tried, she couldn’t move a muscle.</p><p><br></p><p>She heard footsteps behind her as the figure came in front and she saw the face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Prince Kazuya!”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy didn’t show any expression but brought spoke paper seals and placed it on her and then a handcuff and cuffing her hands, finally making a hand seal.</p><p><br></p><p>She found herself losing control of her chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>This is...the chakra suppression seal!</p><p><br></p><p>After that, the boy brought an injection from his pocket and injected her with some kind of liquid.</p><p><br></p><p>Poison.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit!</p><p><br></p><p>She felt her muscles relax and drowsiness trying to settle in.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly thinking of a plan, she pretended to sleep while forcing herself to stay awake. This poison must be strong because she was from the Land of Medicine and had high resistance to poisons and yet she felt the effects. If it were any normal shinobi, they would have fallen asleep already.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a bet. It all depended on if her ploy worked.</p><p><br></p><p>If he catches her, she dies, if he doesn’t, she escapes.</p><p><br></p><p>She waited and thankfully, the boy seemed to be assured and she felt the paralysis fall as she felt the boy’s hands on her back, grabbing a hold of her collar to pick her up.</p><p><br></p><p>Using this opportunity, she bit her tongue, forcing her to push away the drowsiness, turned and took a hold of the boy between her thighs and in a quick motion of her hands, she snapped his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>A smile came to her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Even without chakra, the power of a Jōnin was not something people like these could contend with.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure, the Prince dying would be a big problem but that has nothing to do with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe someone didn’t want the relationship between the two Lands and assassinated the Prince.</p><p><br></p><p>She has already gotten what she had come here for and will leave early tomorrow morning along with the rest of the envoy.</p><p><br></p><p>These thoughts of hers however crashed as the figure between her legs...burst into a cloud of smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bunshin!”</p><p><br></p><p>The paralysis on her body was activated again and several voices came from behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I told you, it wouldn’t be so easy.” A girl’s voice came and she raised her head to look at the figure of the samurai girl who always followed the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside him, the boy was rubbing his neck and was frowning.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I know. Why do you think I was using a clone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, you could have paid more attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuina-chan is not wrong, Your Highness.” Another girl’s voice came as she looked at three figures climbing down the stairs. To her horror, each one of them had one of her team members with them, all knocked unconscious and chakra sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Underestimating ninja, vampire or human, is always foolish.” Another voice came and the speaker was a girl with black hair and green eyes, someone she hadn’t seen before.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems you need to increase your training more, Your Highness.” The rough looking man in the group said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I took measures, didn’t I? Stop picking on me already.” The boy complained as he looked at her. “Hello, Mogami-san or should I call you Tsukimi Kodon?” The boy smiled, his eyes shining in the dark, suddenly sending shivers down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I chucked the entire team in different cells, this time, making it so that they couldn’t even move properly if I didn’t want it.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, I had to thank Tamami for helping me out with the seals or I would be stuck without any options against such kinds of attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Paralysis Seals and Chakra Sealing Seals were extremely useful for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“What should we do now?” Asked Saitō. “Because there is no way they would ignore the missing ninja in their envoy considering their true intention of bringing them here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not intending to let them ignore it either.” I said, taking out one of the kunai I had confiscated from them and playing with it.</p><p><br></p><p>While these people were investigating me, I was doing the same for them.</p><p><br></p><p>I found out the information about the Jōnin just this morning. Six days for the information was understandable considering she was just a common Jōnin from a small village without any special skills.</p><p><br></p><p>From this, I found out about her mission.</p><p><br></p><p>The Medicine Daimyo was really pushing his limits now so it was time to bring him down a notch.</p><p><br></p><p>“Set explosions in several places of this warehouse as well as set off an alarm. Kill one of the chunin from their team and spread the news that they tried to rob the warehouse and attacked me. Even stole fifty pounds of gold and several bits of research data while destroying the rest.” I commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can forge the identities of the chunin as well as reveal the identity of the Jōnin, putting a bounty on their head.” Saitō added and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes and I will have Grandpa and the Stairs Daimyo put some extra pressure on the Medicine guy to drive away the Kodon Clan from his land.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think it will work? I mean the Medicine Daimyo can deny any involvement too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh he sure could, but he will not. That guy is counting a lot on this marriage. After all, it’s his long term plan to take over the Land of Flowers. He will absolutely take action even if it's only to satiate our anger. After all, there is no way he would give up potentially acquiring both our lands over one small ninja clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But wouldn’t that put the Clan against us?” Kanae asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are bound to go against us, after all, the clan protecting the seal of Rōen is the Kodon Clan. We have to face them sooner or later so it’s better to have them removed from the Land of Medicine sooner rather than later.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, even if it weren’t the Kodon Clan, I would have found a way to pin this on them and have them removed from the Land of Medicine. They were a Clan with three Jōnin and several Chunin level ninja which would also serve to cut a bit of the Medicine Daimyo’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>This attack had turned into an unexpected boon for us.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially since it gave me the extra chunin level ninja I needed for my next ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>“But how would we fool them? After all, you are unhurt.” Kuina asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh you will see that soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>We quickly got ready to arrange the scene according to our requirements.</p><p><br></p><p>When everything was done, I made a hand sign and detonated the whole place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now for your question, Kuina.” I took the kunai I had been playing with and quickly stabbed myself in the shoulder, taking all of them by surprise. “What are you saying? I think I am plenty hurt.” I replied through gritted teeth.</p><p><br>Dammit, that hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya! Are you insane?” She quickly shouted and hurried to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was bleeding and in moments, my entire haori was dyed red.</p><p><br></p><p>They helped me remove my kunai and bandage while Saitō took another kunai and stabbed himself and even cut himself at different places as well. At their confused looks, he replied. “Someone has to save our untrained Prince and make them retreat. I am just a common samurai from their point of view so being unhurt against a Jōnin and possibly other chunin could make it suspicious especially when I was protecting someone like him.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>They helped us treat our wounds while many others quickly rushed.</p><p><br></p><p>An explosion so close to the palace would attract anyone’s attention after all.</p><p><br></p><p>Let the drama begin.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ruling by the Book’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A few things happened and we got another summon in the group.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kazuya got an in with the clan of redheads and even faced the first attack against him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am planning to write this story in a full story format instead of a snippet so the pacing will be slow.

Did you girls have fun?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They had gone out to Tempest to meet Shuna’s friends and teach them about our world before they used our town as their new base. All of them were quite enthusiastic about the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The Goblins and Goblinas were so funny. Even the puppies were well behaved. We all had a lot of fun walking around Tempest.”</p><p><br></p><p>... those were Dire and Star Wolves.</p><p><br></p><p>Only Lavy can call them puppies.</p><p><br></p><p>While talking, she slipped out of her dress, revealing her creamy white skin underneath.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a pure white set of lingerie. She removed her bra and her golden hair fell on her breasts hypnotically.</p><p><br></p><p>I gazed at her as if in a trance and apparently she noticed my gaze too as she looked up at me and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t an erotic smile or anything, instead it looked so... so pure... </p><p><br></p><p>Was this girl secretly an angel?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked away to avoid showing her an embarrassed look and quickly got into bed, before realising that I was still in my towel.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, before I could get out something happened which immediately cancelled my plans to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy’s bra fell on the floor and she bent down to pick it up, giving me the full view of her shapely ass in white lace panties. I could even see some hint of golden pubes due to my enhanced sights.</p><p><br></p><p>Truly, I had the senses of a demon... and right now, I wasn’t unhappy about it either. </p><p><br></p><p>Her action and the view in front of me made me hard in an instant and I was pretty sure my towel would not be able to cover it up at all.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I decided against getting out for the time being.</p><p><br></p><p>She, on the other hand, was completely unaware of my difficulties and continued speaking as she wore my shirt without buttoning it up as she came over.</p><p><br></p><p>“... and the Goblinas even made flower garlands for us from the flowers. Sakura-chan even brought some of those flowers to decorate the Restaurant.” She finished before wrapping an arm around my neck and kissing my cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>... yeah. Apparently she actually believed the story about the Good Night Kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already holding back with difficulty and that kiss made it just that much harder.</p><p><br></p><p>Our relationship is quite complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, even I was sure about something. There was no way she was doing this all because of her obliviousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy was actually interested in me and I wouldn’t lie and say I didn’t have any feelings for her or she wouldn’t be sleeping beside me right now.</p><p><br></p><p>She has tactically agreed to everything we have done but never said anything expressly. She even participated and initiated many of those things so I know I am not forcing her but she always acts oblivious. It's like she enjoys my reactions or just enjoys this game. So I play along.</p><p><br></p><p>We have just never voiced out our own thoughts to each other yet.</p><p><br></p><p>But not having things cleared out made me hesitate to take this any further.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, till now she has never done anything to harm me or anyone close to me in any way so... </p><p><br></p><p>\"Lavy?\" I called her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm?\" She looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wanna go out with me?\" I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay.\" She looked at me as her smile brightened.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sure.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>Was that it?</p><p><br></p><p>Quite anticlimactic.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, what else were we supposed to do?</p><p><br></p><p>We were already living as a normal couple would do.</p><p><br></p><p>The sheer absurdity of the situation made me laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?” She asked, tilting her head.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and laughed again. “No. No, it’s nothing. Just never change, Lavy. Never change.” I said before pulling her into a hug and laying down on the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” She looked confused so I cupped her face in my hands and brought her face to mine.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t give you a Good Night’s Kiss, did I?” I smiled and saw a light blush on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She closed her eyes and tilted her face towards mine and I didn’t need any more indication. I leaned in and took her lips with mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Her lips were soft and had a taste of mint.</p><p><br></p><p>She relaxed in my arms and I pulled her into a hug, deepening the kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, I was rock hard and the towel was doing a bad job at keeping my excitement restrained. My length was poking her thighs and I was sure she was feeling it too as her arms wrapped around and pulled me closer to her.</p><p><br></p><p>We pulled back with a strand of saliva between our tongues. Her eyes looked hazy as she gazed at me, breathing heavily due to the excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was that enough to make your night good?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t answer but pulled me in for another kiss instead.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess that was an answer in itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her on top of me as my hands slid down to her ass, feeling the softness of her plump bottom on my palms while her panty clad crotch slid over my length due to my ministrations.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still busy kissing me so I decided to take things further. My hands slid under her panties, making her gasp in my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>The surprise was enough to stop from kissing me and look at me with surprise for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Just when I thought I had pushed too far, she leaned in for a kiss but not before whispering to me. “Be gentle.”</p><p><br></p><p>My dick twitched at her words but I replied with a nod. “I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>After that I started to slowly play with her ass while she was taking her time with the kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day I found that Lavy loved kissing.</p><p><br></p><p>When she was done, I turned her over and got on top of her. The blanket was removed from my body and the towel along with it, revealing my rock hard length to her.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw her eyes widen a little at the sight but then the look turned to curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can touch it.” I said and she slowly brought her hands to grip me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s hot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now slowly move your hand. Don’t grip it too hard.” I instructed and she followed the instructions well.</p><p><br></p><p>She suddenly did something I was not expecting. She leaned in and placed a kiss on the tip, sending shivers of pleasure down my spine. I looked at her with a raised eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“I... saw it in a manga when we went to buy them earlier.”</p><p><br></p><p>... what kind of manga are you girls reading?</p><p><br></p><p>Still... Good Work, Mangaka-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does it not feel good?” She asked with that same innocence of her, making the scene a lot more erotic.</p><p><br></p><p>“It feels amazing.” I replied as I put my hand on her head and caressed her hair. “Continue. Just mind your teeth.”</p><p><br></p><p>She started raining kisses on the entire length from the tip to the balls, the stimulation only edging me further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lick it.” I commanded, finally not being able to hold back.</p><p><br></p><p>She followed instantly, bringing out her tongue and started licking the tip.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh~ Yes, that's it. Now open your mouth and take the tip inside. Mind your teeth.” I assisted her by slowly moving my waist while she held my thighs for support. I started slowly before slowly going deeper. </p><p><br></p><p>She gagged but the girl was stubborn and didn’t pull back and pressed forward, taking almost half of my length.</p><p><br></p><p>I too was lost in pleasure to slow down and started trusting more, going slightly deeper every time.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally feeling my climax approaching, I held her hair and pulled her shoving my entire length into her gullet as I shot ropes after ropes of cum.</p><p><br></p><p>When I pulled back, she coughed a little, putting a hand on her mouth to avoid spitting anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her, eyes watery, hair dishevelled. She looked like a ravished angel, an angel I had ravished.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn... I really was a devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Under my gaze, she finally calmed down and actually gulped everything down, even licking her hand to clean off everything clear.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s..salty.” She said licking her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that I was hard again.</p><p><br></p><p>A snap of my finger and everything was clean and I pulled her in for a kiss, something she happily reciprocated.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was... amazing, Lavy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, really. So, what else did you read in the manga?” I asked, making the girl blush at the question.</p><p><br></p><p>A blushing Lavinia was an entirely new experience for me, something I found I loved.</p><p><br></p><p>“I... ” She stuttered as my smile widened. “Sil-kun is bullying me!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, how about I do something and you tell me if you read that in the manga?” I asked her with a smirk.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Before she could understand anything, I slid between her thighs and dove into her pantyclad pussy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahhhh~~~”</p><p><br></p><p>She was already wet by then and I slid her panty aside revealing her lower lips for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>Pink lips with slight trimmed golden pubes at the top.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s beautiful.” I whispered, loud enough for her to hear and then looked at her. “Did you read this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face was completely red by now.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her another lick, making her take a sharp breath and asked again. “Did you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded, making me smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I was enjoying this a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good girl. Now let me reward you for being a good girl.” I dove directly into her pussy, starting with a kiss and then gave her slit a long lick swirling my tongue around her clit.</p><p><br></p><p>She took a sharp breath and one of her hands came on to my head while the other hand gripped the bedsheet while I continued working on her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mhhahhhh, Sil-kunnn~” Her moans sounded like music to my ears, making me work harder on her.</p><p><br></p><p>My finger found the entrance to her pussy and I slowly pushed a finger in.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hot and warm, the walls gripping my finger and massaging me lovingly as I pushed further in, similarly, when I started to pull out, it stuck to me, trying to pull me back in.</p><p><br></p><p>The grip on my hair became stronger. I started moving my finger faster.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a minute later, her body shook violently and arched as she came with a loud groan.</p><p><br></p><p>I went and lay beside her and pulled her back to my chest, feeling the warm softness of her breasts on me again.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was it?” I asked her after she came down from her orgasmic high. She just hugged me tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sil-kun is a bully.” I heard her whisper. </p><p><br></p><p>“If you didn’t like it then I won’t do it next time.”</p><p><br></p><p>She stiffened a bit before replying in an ant-like voice.“I... didn’t... dislike it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did it feel good?” I asked and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will make you feel even better from now on.” I whispered into her ears making her hug me tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t exactly satisfied with just one release but Lavy was quite exhausted so I didn’t push her anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Shu-chan is going to be so mad when she finds out about this.\" She said, slowly giggling.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Shu-chan was planning on sleeping with you too, so don't let her down, okay.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl strangely. \"You know, other girls would be jealous and not tell me to treat her well.\" I deadpanned and she just put her cheeks on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Shu-chan, Sakura-chan and you are my family now. I don't want anyone to feel bad. Not because of me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>This was probably the first time I talked to the real Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, Sakura?” I asked, taken aback by the sudden name.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Sakura-chan likes you too.” She said, stunning me.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s... I think you are mistaken.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie and say that I wasn’t attracted to her at all. We have been together for months now. In fact, she was the first person to stay with me in this place and has helped me through some very difficult times.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have feelings for her and at times I felt she was the same but when it seems that things could be more, she always pulls back.</p><p><br></p><p>I never push her either as it could hurt her. She didn’t have anywhere to go and I didn’t want to make living in this place awkward for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Worst case, if she accepted my advances just to repay me back, I would never be able to live that down.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she even pushed Lavy towards me. So I just accepted that she didn’t like me as a partner and just like a friend.</p><p><br></p><p>“She must have meant it as a friend. There are more than one ways to like someone.” I said, shaking my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that so?” She asked a little confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Now come here.” I pulled her into a hug which she gladly returned before closing our eyes and having the best nap I have had in a while.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Cid Kagenou -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He quickly arranged everything in his setup before those girls came here. The new furniture Ainz had given him looked really good in these types of settings. It even matched with all the other furniture he had collected with his pocket money.</p><p><br></p><p>As he did this, he wondered about the biggest change in his current life.</p><p><br></p><p>The Crossroads Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Who could have thought that there was such an incredible place in the world... or worlds?</p><p><br></p><p>A place which connected to infinite worlds, infinite possibilities... and sold the most  delicious food he had ever tasted in both of his lives.</p><p><br></p><p>The place helped him uncover so many mysteries and gave him a chance to do things he hadn’t even imagined before.</p><p><br></p><p>So much to learn, so much to master.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting against the world and breaking literal shackles of fate... that was a next level of cool he hadn’t even thought about before.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t the only one of his kind who had been isekai’d. There were others too.</p><p><br></p><p>Many different versions of Earth and even more magical worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Just going to one such world gave him his trusty weapons. The set of crowbars, Umbra and Penumbra.</p><p><br></p><p>The power of his Device was to open things. This was what he felt but… he didn’t know the full extent of this power. Just what could be opened?</p><p><br></p><p>And powers were not all.</p><p><br></p><p>The people inside were also unique. Each a master of their art. He had talked to the masters of the Ryozanpaku Dojo and acknowledged their power and mastery of their respective fields.</p><p><br></p><p>He had often lamented over the fact that people gave up their childhood dreams, but here, he found people who pursued them even now, after being sent to another world, just like he had done.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz was one such person.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy played the role of the Shadow of his own world and he did so amazingly. Even he had to commend him for his acting and mannerisms and even took some notes to improve his own Shadow role.</p><p><br></p><p>But not all things go as planned.</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday, he was listening to Ainz’s problems with his subordinates and how he had cooked up a story to convince them all about the Restaurant’s existence. But who would have thought that the moment he opened the door of the cabin, he would be face to face with Alpha and Delta.</p><p><br></p><p>Did those girls follow him there?</p><p><br></p><p>If so then, they would obviously be here to ask him more about the Restaurant and that’s why he needed to prepare in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he finished his preparations, he felt their presence approaching him and sat down on the throne with the limited edition red wine filled in a golden goblet in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you have come.” He said, looking at their reflection on one of the jewels on the picture frame in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha had come with Beta.</p><p><br></p><p>Was Beta here too?</p><p><br></p><p>He was expecting only Alpha and Delta.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Alpha sat on the armrest of the chair while Beta stood behind him. “We figured out everything about the Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, figures. He had trained the girls too well.</p><p><br></p><p>“... just as you wanted us to.”</p><p><br></p><p>Eh?</p><p><br></p><p>Wanted?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, were they still playing around.</p><p><br></p><p>Since that was the case, he had to give his best performance.</p><p><br></p><p>He had some amazing ideas from observing Ainz and wanted to try them out and now he got the perfect opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>“So now that you have glimpsed the true depths of the Abyss, do you have the courage to dive deeper? A warning though, when you stare at the abyss, it stares back at you. This decision of yours will be far greater than anything you have done or even thought until now, far more than just one world. Once you take this step, you will expose yourself to monsters beyond your imagination. Monsters which can make the Cult of Diabolus look like children playing in the park.”</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the two girls paused before replying with seriousness. “We are ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then tell me what you have found in the Restaurant?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows what they might have seen there? He was inside the room with Ainz, Rimuru and Saitama the entire time. He didn’t even know they were there.</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha nodded and then started explaining.</p><p><br></p><p>So they had met Ainz’s maid and she told them the story which Ainz had filled them with. That works.</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. Me and my comrades have fought against untold foes and lost a lot in the process. It was only by the sacrifice of Silas that we even have a chance to gather together once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are all the Shadows of our own worlds, coordinating our subordinates while Silas is the one who coordinates us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, doesn’t that make him the Shadow of Shadows?</p><p><br></p><p>That sounds cooler somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are your orders?” Alpha asked while he was thinking all this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cooperate with them. They will always be our allies. You can learn a lot, even grow stronger with the knowledge of the other worlds. The Cult of Diabolus has lots of advantages but it doesn’t mean we don’t have advantages of our own either. Use this advantage to its fullest. The magic of other worlds is far different from this world’s. You can try learning. Even the technology of those worlds are beyond this world. With just bare basics, you can completely control the technological part of this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It will be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>After that they discussed several other things before the girls had enough of the roleplay and left.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Beta -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They gathered with the rest of the Seven Shadows of Shadow Garden and Alpha explained everything to them all.</p><p><br></p><p>Other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Supreme Beings.</p><p><br></p><p>The true meaning of Shadows.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant between all worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally the one who coordinates all the Shadows, the Shadow of Shadows, Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of it, there was only silence in the whole room.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was still processing the information and Beta didn’t blame them either. She still had a hard time believing everything even when everything was right in front of their eyes, clear as a day.</p><p><br></p><p>Eta was the one who spoke next, breaking the silence of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“You said, there were people under other Shadows, with the same title as us. What kind of people were they?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha nodded at the question. “I was only able to meet one of them. She was called Yuri Alpha. It must be noted that she is someone actually created by the Supreme Beings of their world and the reincarnated Shadows might not use the same naming terminologies for their subordinates. Still, Yuri told me that they were a part of the Seven Pleiades, the combat maids who serve the Supreme Beings of Nazarick. Unfortunately, right now only Ainz-sama remains among them as their leader while they were all transferred to a new world. Apart from them there are also floor Guardians who guard different floors of Nazarick Fort. A unique thing about them is that most of them were from completely different races just like us. For example, Yuri Alpha is a Dullahan. They are a species of Undead beings.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of skills do they possess?” Zeta asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are all experts in different kinds of magic and martial arts. The System of Magic in their world is far more advanced than in our world. They can make many magical items and medicines which could only be called the stuff of legends in this world. Supreme Beings all had their own specialities and at full power they were capable of fighting Gods. They can cause Miracles to happen on a whim. For example, Zeref-sama, a friend of Silas-sama... selectively wiped out all the members of an organisation throughout the whole country, regardless of their strengths... in one spell when they had attacked the Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s... ”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole room was stunned into silence once again.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are also new technologies from other worlds which Shadow had taught us about. They are far more advanced than this world.” She added.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Supreme Beings hold Silas-sama in great respect and are very protective of him. In fact, the reason Yuri was there was to help him set up a business in his world and help establish a base for him while he regains his memories. That world has Gods and monsters of great power and they could be a danger to Silas-sama’s life while he is in a weakened state. Silas-sama himself doesn’t have many subordinates right now and so she and Narberal Gamma were sent to serve him. Similarly Rimuru-sama also sent several people they had saved to serve under him. Shadow has also asked us to cooperate with them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour they planned about their future course of action.</p><p><br></p><p>The reveal of the true identity of the Shadow and the Restaurant has caused major changes in their future plans.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally it was decided that they will visit the Restaurant and get to know the Pleiades and then decide on whom to send there for assistance.</p><p><br></p><p>Beta had a feeling that Shadow Garden was about to change in the coming days.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I served the hotpot to Kisuke-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here’s your order, Kisuke-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, this looks wonderful as always. I am honestly spoiled by all this great food. Food made at home doesn’t taste the same anymore.” He praised as he picked up his chopsticks and got to eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I smiled. “By the way, I was wondering how Ikki-kun is doing? We haven’t seen him in days. How is his training going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Ikki-kun is a wonderful student. A very hard worker. His training is going extremely well. You know what? Why don’t you guys come over and visit every now and then? Give me an opportunity to play host sometimes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I will impose upon you then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha you won’t be imposing on anyone. Always feel welcome. By the way, how is your magic training going? I heard that you guys went off on a training trip. How was it?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>There weren’t that many people in the Restaurant right now so I sat down in front of him and we talked.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him about the training trip, the war and all that happened later.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone has been busy with their own work since then.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls were teaching the Kijin before bringing them to my world. Normally they would have their magic lessons with August but he had gone somewhere with Zeref and Irene so we had some time off to ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Tanya was making preparations for establishing our new Publishing House.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to put my name out for now so it was the girls who were going to be listed as the owners of the company. In fact, Lavy was not using her name either as she was quite well known in some magician circles and they could come look for her here.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally it was decided that Shuna would be listed as the owner as Sakura was still not of age yet and she was the princess of the Kijin who would be staying here so it made more sense for her to be the owner.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri and Narberal would be partners in the company.</p><p><br></p><p>I was busy with my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru on the other hand had been busy. The different races in the Jura forest were wary of his village now that he had all those orcs and ogres or rather Kijin under him. The village was attacked by a bunch of Lizardmen but they were beaten up before they could even get closer to the village.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hobgoblin Riders had gone to the other Goblin villages and gathered them all under one wing and all of them agreed after they found out that the Kijin had joined, even the ones who had rejected previously.</p><p><br></p><p>They formed a pact with the guardians of the Jura Forest, the dryads under someone called Treyni to protect the forest from outside invasion because now Veldora was absent in return for being recognised by the Dryads.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had then sent a few Kijins to the Lizardman territory to send a message to the Lizardman chief about the attack on Tempest and found out that they were doing so on their own initiative.</p><p><br></p><p>The idiots who had attacked were led by the son of the chief who actually tried to rebel against his father to attack the Kijin but was beaten to an inch of his life by them. He was later banished along with a hundred of his followers and they ended up joining Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, fate's ways are strange.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz on the other hand had decided to take a break from levelling and explore his own world. He encountered some attackers who were attacking the nearby village from a different country. He took them out and brought the village under his protection and went to investigate the situation in the nearby city.</p><p><br></p><p>After Kisuke-san left, I went back to the kitchen as Bang-san had come in immediately afterwards and ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Mr. Bang's order for a hotpot is done.\" I called out as I placed the fish on the counter where Shuna carried it from.</p><p><br></p><p>Issac-san was waiting there too. He wanted to discuss the business deal for Nitro Rice with me.</p><p><br></p><p>We had found a middle path for our trade.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that while I couldn’t sell raw ingredients, I could use those ingredients as dressing or make dishes which used those ingredients in raw form and sell them that way.</p><p><br></p><p>This money could help us with relocating the Kijin to this town and also establish the Publishing House.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas, come, I was just waiting for you.” Issac-san called me. Tanya was already sitting in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>I had no experience in these things and had put Tanya to it.</p><p><br></p><p>She had gone to his world with Tohru and had returned a day later after collecting some information she needed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for making you wait.” I said while taking a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“No worries. I am the one who should apologise for interrupting your work. Anyways, our Hunters Association has agreed to go on with the trade. Will will buy a set amount of Nitro Rice as well as the Herb of All-Illness each month.”</p><p><br></p><p>I watched as Tanya discussed the price for the item and by gods, she was savage when it came to business.</p><p><br></p><p>She haggled and brought the price from nine hundred to twelve hundred times the original price, at which I got those things from the System.</p><p><br></p><p>Not twelve or one hundred and twenty… twelve hundred times.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, that was the current price of those items in his world. It was something she had found out from her bare basics understanding of that world and the fact that there was extremely high demand but no supply for that product, allowing her to jack up the prices however she wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>We all agreed to the price and Issac-san agreed to pick up the goods the next day and transfer the money at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind was still buzzing at the amount of money we had just made with this one deal.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Tanya looked proud. “This is the biggest deal I have closed in both my lives.” She smiled proudly. “I am getting my cut for this, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“5% as agreed.” I nodded. “Still, this much will be enough to get us enough property in this town to settle the Kijin and even set up the Publishing House and get the equipment required. We might even have some extra left over.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Easily.” Tanya nodded. “We would even have enough left over to open some other businesses too. I was thinking about expanding into collectibles and figurines. We could try introducing a manga based on Card Games and use it to market cards using gacha. Those things sell for a lot of money.”</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>Some of her plans made me shiver, despite my resistance to the cold.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl is evil.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, this same girl just made me a billionaire.</p><p><br></p><p>I sometimes wondered how the System managed the currency exchange thing between worlds without crashing the economies of entire countries… then I realise that I am thinking about a System which can open gates to different worlds, completely different universes. Compared to that, what’s a few billions?</p><p><br></p><p>The System never answers any questions but it still does so many things behind the scenes that I have no idea about.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the door to the shop opened and in came Rimuru who was looking tired. He was followed by Benimaru and Hakurou and another young girl with pink coloured twin tails.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ohh, what place is this? And what is that scent?\" The girl jumped around looking at everything curiously before jumping to Bang's seat and staring at his Hotpot.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Behave Milim.\" Rimuru dragged her back to a different place while the girl stared and almost drooled at the hotpot. \"I'm sorry, Bang-san.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahaha no worries. It's good for young ones to be energetic.\" the old man waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>\"She is more than two thousand years old though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>This caused the man to almost choke on his food as he stared at the cute girl with shock in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas, get a full course of the best you can get. Actually, get us a serving of the rabbit dish you gave us that day and then start cooking the main course.\" Rimuru ordered while Benimaru came and said something in Shuna's ears, making her stiff.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him questioningly but he just pointed at Shuna before going back to take a seat behind Rimuru while Hakurou took a seat with Mr. Bang. He was already a part of the old monsters group.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuna came and relayed the information to me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was called Milim Nava, one of the oldest and strongest Demon Lords from Rimuru's world who had come to Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru enticed her with food and brought her here to soothe her because the top brass had picked a fight with her thinking that she was there to kill Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>...  damn, talk about fucking up.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, this is a Demon Lord?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ohh, are you a daemon? You can cook?\" I looked back to see her looking over the counter, right inside the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am a Devil apparently. The Daemons from your world are different but then again I haven't met any to give an exact difference between us.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"My world?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"This restaurant operates between several worlds. I am not from your world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What! Really?\" Her eyes glittered as I brought out some of the chocolate for the dish. \"Ehh, what is that? Looks and smells amazing. Can I eat some? Hey, can I eat some?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm, Milim-sama please wait on your seat. The dish will be served as soon as Silas-sama is done.\" Shuna came to the rescue.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Rimuru, I want it now. I want that sweet thing he is using, now.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sure, we can get you one of those but that would be it. You cannot eat the dishes after that.\" Rimuru explained with his hands spread out.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ehh? Why?\"</p><p><br></p><p>...  </p><p><br></p><p>Is she really a Demon Lord?</p><p><br></p><p>My impression of Demon Lords is going down very quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"NO! I WANT IT NOW.\" She stomped on the ground and I sensed a massive amount of power behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>This power made that clown look like a candle compared to the sun.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath to reorganise myself from the sudden surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>I took control of the shop and the very next instant, her power was dispelled as she looked around in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This shop is a place for people to enjoy their food and good food needs time to be cooked. Do you want me to give you raw food which tastes like crap? If so, then I can get it to you in a minute.\"</p><p><br></p><p>That did the job as she sat down quickly although with a pout.</p><p><br></p><p>Really? That easily?</p><p><br></p><p>The power of a God with the mind of a child.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a dangerous combination. Seriously, how do you even deal with someone like this?</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that Tohru of all people said. “B-boss, that girl is dangerous. Don’t mess with her.” was a testament to her power level.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru was someone who didn’t back down from any fights and had even fought Gods in her world and yet Milim’s presence made her back away.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to heed her warning and work on the dish with all my concentration.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl in the meantime was playing games with Saitama and Rimuru while I prepared the dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>I served the first dish as soon as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Lièvre À La Royale. The same dish I had served to my customers as an apology.</p><p><br></p><p>She practically jumped on the plate and I got some time to cook the other dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only after three whole hours that she was satisfied and I could sit down in peace.</p><p><br></p><p>The guests had more or less left the place except for Rimuru and his party.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oi, Devil.\" She got up on the chair, hands on her waist as she looked directly at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Work for me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No thanks.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What? Why?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I enjoy working here. I meet many people from different worlds, visit different places and make new friends from everywhere. I don't want to leave this job.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But that's not fair. I wanna have fun too.\" She cried.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Then you can come and visit me anytime you want.\" I shrugged. By this time I had gotten a read on her personality and understood how to deal with her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was like a kid.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly like a kid.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes yes, I can bring you here to visit Silas whenever you want.\" Rimuru came up for my backup.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Really? Promise?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Promise.\" Both me and Rimuru said at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>I accompanied her out till Tempest and even packed an entire chocolate cake for her making her light up instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You know what Devil? I like you. I will call you Sil.\"</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, my demonic power soared and all I could think about before blacking out was...  <em>Not again</em>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Requirements for Evolution have been met.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Starting Evolution.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Rare Skill: Water Manipulation has evolved into Unique Skill: Flood.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Rare Skill: Ice manipulation has evolved into Unique Skill: Frost.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Water Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Fire Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Cold Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Shock Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skills: Water Resistance, Fire Resistance, Cold Resistance and Shock Resistance were combined to All Elemental Resistance.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: High Speed Regeneration.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Physical Damage Resistance.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Greater Magic Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Corruption Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Spiritual Damage Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Evolution to Arch Daemon successful.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes to find myself in Shuna's lap and she was brushing my hair. I was still in the Restaurant but there were no other people there.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How many days was I out this time? I asked, not even trying to get up. \"What about the guests?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eight hours. We closed the shop for the day. We didn't have many guests after that.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Did Milim leave?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is staying in Tempest for the time being.” Shuna replied and I saw a strained smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, after you passed out, Tohru-chan thought you were hurt and almost attacked Milim-sama. She was stopped at the right time by Rimuru-sama but she was very angry. She only stopped when she found out that you were actually evolving and not exactly hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie but I felt quite warm knowing that she did that especially since I knew she was shit scared of Milim’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>“Milim didn’t get angry, did she?” I asked, suddenly remembering the actual demon lord in the basket.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. She just laughed it off and even praised Tohru-chan. She said you had good subordinates and that she would let everything go for two chocolate cakes.”</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>She was really a child.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head at the antics of the little Demon Lord.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about Sakura and Lavy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They haven’t returned yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” Thank goodness they haven’t returned or they would be worried for no reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for taking care of the situation, Shuna.\" I smiled at her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's my job.\" She replied with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and lay there resting for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuna’s scent felt nice. She smelled sweet, like cherry blossoms.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered what Lavy had told me about Shuna last night and suddenly the whole situation felt quite intimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she really interested in me?</p><p><br></p><p>“Shuna.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?’</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me something about yourself, about your life in the Ogre Village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to know more about you.” I said seriously and saw the girl blush.</p><p><br></p><p>The lights in the Restaurant were dim but my senses were extremely sharp after evolving. Seeing in the dark was nothing, I could do so earlier too.</p><p><br></p><p>But now, it was on a whole other level.</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought that my evolution to a Daemon Chevalier had made me stronger but all that was nothing compared to what I was feeling right now.</p><p><br></p><p>This evolution… it was something… far deeper as if something fundamental has changed about me.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll have to ask Rimuru later on.</p><p><br></p><p>Arch Daemon.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds like the Demon version of Archangels.</p><p><br></p><p>But still, how freaking strong was Milim?</p><p><br></p><p>We had to fight and risk our lives and even then my previous evolution had occurred due to me accidentally eating that Clown’s soul and Milim pushed me further with just simple naming. Moreover while Rimuru was weakened by naming the ogres, she didn’t even look like she was breathing heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon Lords were scary.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder, Tohru was so scared of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, it looked like she was quite easygoing and didn’t take it to heart.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and snapped out of these thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuna was telling me her story and I didn’t want to think about other things while she was pouring her heart out to me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zeref -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He waited in the room as the door was opened and a figure entered. The figure paused looking at him, his eyes widening but he still let out a sigh and sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't think I would ever see you again. Not that I am unhappy. It brings back some nostalgic memories of my youth but why are you here, Zeref?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Warrod. You look…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Old, like a tree? Yes. Magic is strange. I can't say I dislike this form of mine. Rather I find myself much closer to nature.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was going to say well but… I need your help, Warrod.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He didn't answer but looked questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I found a way to remove the curse of contradiction. I am free now.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Warrod Sequen was probably one of the only people in Ishgar who knew about him and the truth about the Black Wizard Zeref so the fact that the man's eyes widened and his jaws hung open was not a big surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. I am here to take her back.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They will not allow you to step foot in Ishgar. Your name is….\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"And yet I stand here. You know as well as I do that if I really wanted to push, they cannot stop me. But I don't wish for any bloodshed. Not anymore. I just wish to take Mavis away with me and free her of her curse. In return, I will remove Tartarus and all the demons inside it. This is my offer to you. Should the Magic Council refuse it, even the Etherion or Face will not be able to save you, this… I promise.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A tense atmosphere descended on the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Let her decide what she wants to do. I will ask Makarov. We will meet on Tenroujima Island in a week.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Very well.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Zeref… Precht, he…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Went rogue. He is now the leader of a Dark Guild working together with Tartarus.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"... I see.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He got up and was about to leave the room when he heard the voice of Warrod once more. \"Congratulations on being free, Zeref.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, old friend.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Irene –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the bunch of children behind her, following one who looked like a miniature version of her.</p><p><br></p><p>She never thought that there would be a day where she would be able to return for her daughter again.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, when the day comes, she is afraid to even call out to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Being able to taste food again had done a lot of good for her. Especially when she discovered the fact that she could sleep after eating the food from the restaurant. The voices in her head started to become quieter.</p><p><br></p><p>She was regaining her lost sanity bit by bit and this reignited her hope of reuniting with her daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>And what does she see when she comes back?</p><p><br></p><p>Her daughter, enslaved and forced to work by some cultists? The audacity.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind them lay the smouldering wreckage of the Tower of Heaven. A way to resurrect Zeref, the black haired girl had claimed. What foolishness!</p><p><br></p><p>How would you revive someone who is already alive?</p><p><br></p><p>They were obviously being used by someone, the one called Precht.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I assume you will be taking care of Tartarus?\" She asked Zeref who was sitting on a rock nearby, waiting for them.</p><p><br></p><p>\"August found a child with an innate Satan Soul Take Over Magic. He wants her to devour the magic of the ones in Tartarus for her growth.\" He looked at the children behind her. \"Congratulations on finding your daughter.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She froze. The children behind her froze as she looked back.</p><p><br></p><p>Her daughter was staring at her with shock on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She had the urge to glare at Zeref but then again, it made things a lot easier for her by breaking the ice between the two of them.</p><p><br></p><p>She turned back to Zeref. \"The person behind this was the second Guild Master of Fairy Tail, Precht. He was manipulating the children to build the tower. I will take care of him myself.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He thought for a moment before answering. \"Take August with you. He is related to Tartarus. August will take care of that side.\" She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"And you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You have reunited with your family. It's about time I got reunited with mine as well.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tsunade -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Has Sensei finally gone over the edge?” She asked as she stepped under the gates of the village which she had vowed never to return.</p><p>“I warn you Tsunade, Sensei was not his usual easy going self the last time I met him. You should watch how you speak in front of him.” Jiraiya warned, seriously making her grit her teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Or what? It’s not like I have anything to lose. What can he do to me either way?” She rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>This village had already taken everything from her.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t have anything left to lose anymore so she wasn’t afraid of what the old man might do.</p><p><br></p><p>While they walked, she saw several people looking in her direction and speaking to themselves. Apart from that she even noticed a strange atmosphere, a strange tension of sorts in the village.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she had felt some unkind gazes from unseen corners of the village.</p><p><br></p><p>Has the friction between the village and the Uchiha clan reached this point already? </p><p><br></p><p>Was that why she was called back right now, because there could be a war anytime?</p><p><br></p><p>As they walked towards the Hokage building, she saw a few familiar faces. No, calling them familiar would be a stretch as they had changed a lot with age.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kakashi, Guy.” Jiraiya greeted them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jiraiya-sama, Tsunade-sama.” The two bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Off to a mission again? You should take a break sometimes” Jiraiya asked Kakashi and Tsunade remembered more about the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Kakashi Hatake, the son of the White Fang, Sakumo Hatake and the student of the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s eyes looked dead. Then again, so did many other people’s.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the ones who could remain in this profession and still keep their sanity who were the odd ones.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have just returned from a mission and am on my way to the Hokage Tower to report.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, come then. We were going to report to sensei too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kakashi nodded and looked at Guy “Then I will be off, Guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, Kakashi, my friend. I can take you to my favourite Restaurant next time.” The guy in the green jumpsuit shouted loud enough to make Tsunade check her ear drums for any damages.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure sure.” Kakashi waved off and followed them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has there been any updates since I left the village”? Jiraiya asked, while they were walking towards the Hokage tower.</p><p><br></p><p>Kakashi shook his head, looking more… dead somehow as if that was even possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade looked confused at them not knowing the topic of their discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything on your end?” Kakashi asked and Jiraiya also shook his head looking tired.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has something happened?” She asked, her curiosity getting the best of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will know when we are inside.” Jiraiya said, cryptically.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and in minutes, they were already at the Hokage’s tower.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya knocked on the door and a familiar voice answered it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>On entering the door, she saw her sensei again, after over a decade. He seemed so old and frail all of a sudden. How long had it been again?</p><p><br></p><p>The old man smiled. “It’s good to have you back, Tsunade.”</p><p><br></p><p>His voice broke her thoughts and her eyebrows scrunched. “I wish I could say the same but I have no good feelings about returning to this place again.”</p><p><br></p><p>She saw his face shift through several emotions, first sadness, then helplessness and guilt and finally resolve.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I am afraid that you will have to make do with it. I have given you more than enough time to recuperate, far more than anyone else. It’s time you dealt with your problems once and for all.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was taken aback at his words. She had never seen him behave like this.</p><p><br></p><p>After shock came anger.</p><p><br>“I am retired.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shinobi only retire when they are dead.” He replied, his voice cold. “The village needs your assistance at this time. I cannot allow you to throw your tantrums anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>She gritted her teeth but didn’t reply. The old man was just like he had been during the wars, the one which had earned him the title of a God of Shinobi.</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly has been going on in the village? What is so important that you have forced me to come here again?” Finally taking a breath, she asked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Konoha is on the verge of a Civil War and I need your help to stop it.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that all her hopes of sneaking away were crushed altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So the misunderstandings are spreading and this time Shadow himself confirmed everything.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Shadow Garden will be joining the fray soon.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the topic of joining the frays, our favourite Demon Lord, Milim has entered the Restaurant finally.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will clear up some plots of different worlds first before exploring more of the Dxd world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

It will help establish your voice in the entire land and shut down those who might plan to raise voices against your rule.” He said as he looked around.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Reputation and trust are a great thing, Kazu-kun. As long as you have a good reputation and trust in the hearts of people, people would even die for you with a single word. It’s the biggest power of a Daimyo. We don’t rely on strength otherwise what would be the difference between us and the Kages of the Ninja Villages? What a good daimyo must rule over is not the lands of the people but their hearts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we talked, we reached the lands and I saw him stop and stare at the fields. Taking a look at him, a smile crept on my face at his stunned looking face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had heard of the reports but this….just how in the world did you do it?” He asked in a surprised voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“A combination of knowledge and hard work.” I smiled and walked forward towards the group of people who had gathered by Kensho and Kuina. “My people. In these last four months, you have worked hard. Every day and night, you have used your blood and sweat to grow these crops. Today….we reap the fruits of our hard work. Are you ready?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes!” They shouted at once.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then let’s get to work. After work, I have a grand feast organised for all of you so that you all can relax after months of hard work.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd cheered at this and I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and one last thing, the competition from before….is still on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those were the last words needed for the group to get to work at their fastest.</p><p><br></p><p>While they worked, I was not sitting idly either.</p><p><br></p><p>The nobles had all surrounded me, asking me about the methods and what we could do to improve the productivity of the crops of their lands.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa left the discussions to me. His words were that I needed to learn to take care of things myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I was able to negotiate the rights for those methods for some trade benefits and support from the nobles, nothing excessive but enough for me and my plans.</p><p><br></p><p>The harvesting process was completed by evening and even the weighing of the produce was completed.</p><p><br></p><p>The total harvest was two and a half times greater than before, a result which was completely unheard of around here.</p><p><br></p><p>I rewarded the winners twenty percent extra pay on top of their promised wages and they were quite happy.</p><p><br></p><p>And even after all that, the entire harvest went to my personal funds as Grandpa had promised. This should be enough to support my plans to support the kids for a year at least. Once things calm down, I will have to send Saitō to sell some of the gold and jewels I had summoned for cash to buy other necessary stuff for them.</p><p><br></p><p>With the immense success of the new methods, Grandpa officially appointed me as the one in charge of all of the Daimyo’s lands to do as I please and none of the nobles protested either. Hell, some of them even offered their own lands for experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>Profits from this were enough to turn anyone’s heads.</p><p><br></p><p>That night I went back to my warehouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day I was planning to work on medicines.</p><p><br></p><p>The medicinal herbs brought by Grandpa were necessary for the whole process. These medicines could assist in the growth of the body, increase vitality, boost physical fitness and chakra growth to some extent and even improve bloodline abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>In the Shinobi World, there was a reason why the Clans were always ahead of normal shinobi. In this world, you either have some special bloodlines or the heritage of hundreds of years or there is almost no chance for you to rise to the top.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, even in anime, all the endgame people were all descendants of the Otsutsuki.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure Might Guy could temporarily reach that level but even just that much led him to almost dying if not for Naruto magically saving him in the end.</p><p><br></p><p>But not everyone is Might Guy. Not everyone could push themselves to that extent otherwise there would be plenty of Eight Gates users in Root.</p><p><br></p><p>Would someone like Danzo care for their pain and exhaustion?</p><p><br></p><p>No, he would be happy if one person among hundreds could get that result.</p><p><br></p><p>These medicines will help strengthen the bodies of my people and then I will plan on teaching them how to open the first gate at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with just that, they could reach Chunin levels of strength if matched with the Samurai Training of Iron Nation.</p><p><br></p><p>One hundred chunin levels would be enough to start a small village and a good starting level for protecting my land.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, these medicines can also be used by Grandpa and could increase his vitality.</p><p><br></p><p>As for me?</p><p><br></p><p>Rituals gave me much better results at a faster pace.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, if I wanted to, I could have become stronger if I used some of the crazier rituals but even the thoughts about those churned my stomach and made me start to lose my faith in humanity and this is something I was saying after using three genins for my rituals.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head clearing my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>While some of the rituals I had chosen were cruel, I made it a point to never cross a line. Obviously I was no saint. I knew I had to take many questionable decisions in my post as the Daimyo of my Land and get my hands dirty too but I had sworn not to cross some lines.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, the Grimoire understood my problem and gave me several options. I had chosen some comparatively tamer rituals.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, to gain the bloodlines of other people, there were rituals like the one done in anime by Hiruko turning me into a zombie look-alike like the guy himself. Or there was another better ritual in which I had to become a part of their clan, their family through….a tantric ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically, I had to marry the member of the clan whose powers I wanted and consummate the marriage.</p><p><br></p><p>And wasn’t this quiet convenient.</p><p><br></p><p>Daimyo were known to take wives from shinobi clans too and the clans agreed as well to create relationships and bonds with Daimyo to expand businesses.</p><p><br></p><p>I could just find a wife from the Uzumaki, Uchiha and Senju clans and get the genetic lottery if I wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, there was also the option of getting the members of these clans and sacrificing them but I had nowhere near the power to pull something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>But obviously these actions will attract too much attention towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only of the villages but also from the hidden darkness of this world….Zetsu.</p><p><br></p><p>The stronger the ritual, the more costly the ingredients. That’s why all this needed to be done with the utmost secrecy.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still an insignificant ant in this world. I can’t attract any attention to myself.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Those damned Stairs bastards.” I cursed as I read the Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” Kuina asked, looking from her own book.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t answer and looked at the Grimoire once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Two months had passed since the day of the harvest and in this time, I had collected the information about the Stairs Daimyo and his family including the girl who was proposed to be married to me and I did find some crazy things which made it clear to me why they were going so far as to merge their land with ours and even absolve the position of the Stairs Daimyo. Turns out that they had their eyes set up on our lands from the very beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>And it wasn’t just them but also the Medicine guys who were secretly backing them up, having a stake in the whole plan.</p><p><br></p><p>The Stairs Daimyo had a son who had an official wife and five concubines. The daughter from his main wife was married to the grandson of the Medicine Daimyo while the one proposed to marry me was the ostracised daughter he had with a woman of common birth. Her mother wasn’t even recognised as a wife and was disposed off while the girl was treated as a pariah. </p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have a problem with marrying the girl herself. It’s what they plan to do after that that I have a problem with.</p><p><br></p><p>They plan to let us have a child and then poison both her and me to death while becoming the guardians of the child and take control over the Land of Flowers. With the assistance of the Land of Medicines who have their own Ninjas and specialise in poison, it wouldn’t be that hard either. With even their daughter dying, they wouldn’t be under any doubts even if it was found out that we were being poisoned. But it didn’t just end there.</p><p><br></p><p>Those bastards even had plans to kill and exchange our child with the child of the Medicine Daimyo’s grandson.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way, within five years, they could take over the Land of Flowers and no one would be aware of anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Or even if they were, they wouldn’t do anything as long as they didn't change any trade agreements, even bypassing the protection of Kumo.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t searched for the Medicine Daimyo and his people yet but I was pretty sure that those bastards would probably have the Stairs guys encounter some accidents after that kid took control of the Land in future.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how in the nine hells did Grandpa agree to something like this?</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not like him to fall for such an obvious trick.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he under some kind of Genjutsu?</p><p><br></p><p>And now that the matters had gotten this far, breaking off this agreement would give those two Daimyos a reason to target us and that could escalate very quickly in these times. Other bigger forces could smell blood and then this matter would be far beyond my control.</p><p><br></p><p>Those two bastards must be eying our lands from the very start. I mean while the Land of Medicine had more land than us, they were still poorer and with them losing land in this war, they were not looking for a way to protect themselves but rather recover their losses by annexing our lands.</p><p><br></p><p>If I wasn’t so pissed off at them, I would even clap at their plans.</p><p><br></p><p>Fucking hell. Those five Great Daimyos must learn something from these two. They could take over the whole land without raising a weapon and still come out smelling like….flowers, pun not intended.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and thought of what I could do to come out of this problem with the least amount of damage to my land.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya?” Kuina called out again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened? You were reading and you suddenly cursed. Is everything alright?” She asked, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. No, nothing is alright. We have a big problem on hand and we need to prepare for the coming storm.” I massaged my head as I explained the problem to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what should we do?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes hardened at the question. “Well, if they think they can just walk in and take control over my land, then they have got a completely different thing coming for them. If they want to kill me….I will just kill them first. Come, we need to prepare.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>In the two months, the training of my forces had begun in the earnest.</p><p><br></p><p>With enough resources and special medicines, the kids were growing at a very fast pace but even then it would take them at least three years to become ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking the characters from anime as a benchmark would be nothing but foolishness as they were the cream of the crop, the future heads of the clans or super geniuses.</p><p><br></p><p>Common people took six years of academy and then three to four years of field duty to become a Chunin and as for Jōnin, well, one in a hundred Chunin becoming a Jōnin would be great news for a village.</p><p><br></p><p>Samurai were a different case but even they needed a lot of equipment. Chakra Blades and Enhanced Armour cost a lot. The only reason the Iron Nation was able to keep a standing army was because of the insane number of mines they had.</p><p><br></p><p>We had no such things so getting equipment for so many people will be harder. Maybe I could try summoning these items.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, summoning has not been giving me much results. Last month’s summoning was a failure. The other side rejected the offer.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hoping that this month’s summoning helps me out.</p><p><br></p><p>With this in mind, I directly went to my lab and started working on the summoning process. In the last two months, I had not once stopped training and my chakra was rising but the increase was not as fast as I wanted it to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Having no bloodlines really puts a damper on things.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew my expectations were a bit unrealistic as even geniuses like Minato and Jiraya who reached that level only did so in their twenties and they had been training since they were six or seven.</p><p><br></p><p>Compared to them, I merely had months of training while my strength was mainly due to rituals.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, apart from this one thing, other things had been going my way. I had summoned several medicinal herbs and put them together with the herbs Grandpa had collected from the Land of Medicine. I had started a Medicine Garden of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this reason, I expanded my workshop by almost four times. At the rate it was going, I think I might end up making a hidden village of sorts on my own.</p><p><br></p><p>The preparations were finished and I started the process. Putting a hand on my Grimoire, I concentrated on what I wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed someone who could teach my people to fight as well as protect me and the Land of Flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Please don’t fuck up this time and accept.</p><p><br></p><p>The light of the ritual circle got brighter and brighter, forming into a figure.</p><p><br></p><p>When the light vanished, an astonished yelp sounded in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina had yelped in surprise as the figure who appeared in front of us was covered in blood and fell down as soon as the summoning completed.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a young woman of a slender build, slightly tall in height and had notably red lips in contrast to her pale complexion. She had long, straight, black hair that reached just below her hips, worn down with two shorter clumps over her shoulders, and arched, ear-length bangs on either side of her face. Her eyes, only half open, were a pale violet and slanted towards the sides of her face, bright and bug-like, with many notable white sparkles reflecting light off of them but right now the sclera of her eyes were completely red. It seemed like she had burst some blood vessels or something. Her breathing was shallow and she looked to be in critical condition.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuina, hurry up and get the medical kit.” I ordered as I quickly rushed to the girl and took a look at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a massive gash wound on her chest and a stab wound in her stomach in which an icicle was lodged.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn,that looks horrible. Just what kind of enemy was she fighting?</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and held the icicle and pulled it out in one swift movement. Blood gushed out immediately. Not delaying one extra moment, I took out a Red Potion, something I had summoned a while ago when doing random summons for something to heal me and used it on her. The potion was from the Overlord world. From what the Grimoire said, it was as good as a second tier healing magic. Sure enough, the wound started closing at a rapid pace until there was nothing left.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, the girl had already bled too much and her breathing hadn’t improved much.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina rushed in with medicines.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, could you please, well, clean her up and apply the medicines to any leftover wounds. I have done the preliminary healing and closed the major wound but she has lost a lot of blood so I would need to make something for her.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and took her to one of the guest rooms while I went to prepare something for her.</p><p><br></p><p>While working on the medicines, I realised something crucial. Till now, I was summoning people who would have died.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina and Saitō were unique as they were not injured and could have died directly.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a high chance that I could get someone who would be gravely injured and could die as soon as they were summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have anything good for healing either. Even the Red Potion I had summoned was a lucky draw.</p><p><br></p><p>I would need a healer next time. In fact, it turns out that I seriously lacked a healer. If I were to get attacked or even poisoned, there would be no one who could heal me.</p><p><br></p><p>Alright, target set. Next time, I am going to summon healers.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two days had passed since the summoning and while we had done all we could do, the girl hadn’t regained her consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, her condition had improved.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a fever which had gone down and even her blood had been replenished now all that was needed was for her to wake up.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, I was in a meeting with Saitō and Kuina to discuss how to deal with the matter with the engagement.</p><p><br></p><p>“The easiest way would be to kill the girl.” Saitō started but knowing him, he would never do so. “But that’s out of the question.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have any enmity with the girl. If anything, she has had a very hard life and was barely treated well right now to put on a show for us and that too, to only use her as a sacrifice later on.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t feel hate for her, just pity.</p><p><br></p><p>“So the only way we have is to face the masterminds. I would suggest that you marry her and let the merger take place and then we organise some accidents for them, finishing them off. They wouldn’t make any moves until she is pregnant with your child so you can have at least two or even three years depending on how long you can delay. In that time, we can prepare enough forces to resist them even if they have a Shinobi village of their own.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It would be like living with a snake but where there are risks, there are also benefits. I have researched the Land of Stairs and the Land of Medicine and found out some interesting things about the places.” Saitō continued.</p><p><br></p><p>He did go on to investigate the land, undercover on my orders.</p><p><br></p><p>“What interesting thing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Apparently, there is a mountain where fire burns from the crack of the mountain. It has been burning there for the last four thousand years, uninterrupted. No matter how bad the rain or the storm, the fire keeps on burning.” He continued. “The fools of the place believe it to be a curse or a demon possessing the place but in reality, those mountains contain immense reserves of Natural Gas which they are wasting due to their ignorance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” I did a take back at the information. “Are you sure?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Absolutely. Those kinds of reserves could make you a superpower in this continent even in terms of economy. That’s why I suggest that you do not let go of this engagement and go through with it. We need to get the Land of Stairs under us.”</p><p><br></p><p>….that….completely changes things.</p><p><br></p><p>Oil and Natural Gas were the two things which controlled the economy in the modern world. Whoever controls them will have a great advantage over others.</p><p><br></p><p>“What of the Land of Medicines?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You told me to research the existence of strong beasts and creatures, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. I needed them for sacrifices and for rituals to summon stronger people.</p><p><br></p><p>“Apparently, there is a legend in the Howling Wolf Village of a monster called Rōen. It used to attack the village in the past before it disappeared. I think it must have been sealed away somewhere in the village or the nearby area.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you Saitō. That’s great news. If we could indeed use this, we might be able to solve all the problems in one go.” I quickly opened the Grimoire and searched for the information on Rōen.</p><p><br></p><p>Five months….</p><p><br></p><p>Damn.</p><p><br></p><p>But that’s not a bad thing. If anything, it’s a good thing. The longer the time the stronger the beast and the better the sacrifice.</p><p><br></p><p>And I would need to come up with a method to control and capture the beast. Five months would be needed at the very least for this.</p><p><br></p><p>I would need to get Grandpa in on this plan.</p><p><br></p><p>But I hadn’t known of the Rōen beast from my memories and while my memories of my previous life and this world were not detailed, I couldn’t claim to know everything about this land either.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, there was some chance that this could be some alternate universe version of the Naruto world.</p><p><br></p><p>Which would mean there would be things I didn’t know about this world or maybe even the things from the movie were included in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the entire scope of my search became far wider.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you understand the weight of your words, Kazuya?” Grandpa asked me in a very serious tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would never joke about this.” I answered unwaveringly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any proof of your words?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“I….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“I….no</a>. I have nothing in hand. The information I have about Princess Kasumi can be verified if you had an insider but I doubt they would leave such an obvious hole in their story.” I really couldn’t explain how I knew about everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you not want to marry her, Kazu-kun?” He sighed and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t have any problems with her, Grandpa. In fact, I am not telling you to cancel this marriage. The merger of the two lands would be a boon for our land like no other. What I want is for you to believe me that they don’t have our best intentions in mind when they do this.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>He massaged his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please trust me on this Grandpa. You know me. I would never lie about such a serious thing.” I urged him again.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not saying that I don’t trust you Kazu-kun. It’s just that the whole thing is a bit too much of a stretch.” He said, looking helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not asking for much. Just a few things. Help me set the engagement in four months and then give us some time to get to know each other. That much should be doable, right? Just give them the excuse that you are taking care of nobles before the merger and ask them to do the same. Overall, you could delay it for eight months or so. That will be enough time for me to get everything ready to protect us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will see what I can do. I am putting the future of the Land of Flowers on your shoulders, Kazu-kun. Please don’t let our people down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I swear, Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was times like these that I realised how lucky I was to have a man like this as my Grandpa. He was willing to trust me even when I was hiding so many things from him.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how are the medicines working?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I had given him the medicines I had made for the training of the kids. They wouldn’t do much but they could still increase his vitality a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh those things are amazing. The joint pains I had all vanished in one day and I feel like I am ten years younger all of a sudden. If you sell those, we could open our stake in the Medicine Business.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Those will not be for sale. Those medicines can be used to train Shinobi forces of our own and increase their potential to some extent. There is no way I can release these to the outside world.” I denied it completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, whatever you think is good. I am not bothering with that side of things either way.” He shrugged. “In a few years, you will be the Daimyo and I will be retired, hopefully playing with my great grandchildren.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You still haven’t given up on that?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously not. I still think Kuina is a good girl and I heard you saved some other girl in an injured state too who is also a beauty.” He smirked, making me facepalm. “I don’t mind if you take both of them as concubines as long as I have great grandchildren to play with.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that the seriousness of the whole incident went down to hell.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few things and when our conversation ended, I left the room to let him rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside, Mira was waiting for me. “Your Highness, Miss Kuina has sent a message that your guest has regained consciousness a while ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did she now? Have someone prepare something to eat for her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.” She bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Mira. We shall go and visit her.”</p><p><br></p><p>I left the palace and went straight for the warehouse where the girl was resting.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, Kuina was waiting and talking with her while Saitō was outside the door.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded at me when I reached there and we entered the room together.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the girls looked at me and the new girl tried to get up and bow but staggered.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to get up. You were injured very badly and it was only through sheer coincidence that we were able to save you. You are still weak though so rest up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness.” She bowed from her place. “I will never forget your kindness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to thank me. I was the one who called for you in my time of need and you accepted my request. For this, I would always be grateful. Thank you. By the way, has Kuina explained the details of everything to you?”</p><p><br>“Oh yes. Kuina-san has been incredibly helpful. To think there would be such a great story behind everything. It feels like it's straight from one of the fairy tales that mother used to read to us.” She smiled kindly. “You are a good man who is trying to do well for his people. Not only that but you also saved my life. I will help you as well as I can.” She answered my unasked question.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….thank you. By the way, I didn’t get your name. So, could you please tell me something about yourself?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Kanao Kocho. In my world, I was part of an organisation which specialises in hunting Demons.” She started her story and suddenly the information hit me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanae Kocho, the Flower Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, the elder sister of Shinobu Kocho.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, Kuina was right. You do know many things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I assume you were fighting the Demon who used Ice?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Yes. That pitiful fellow.” She said sadly.</p><p><br></p><p>“....I don’t think you should have pity for him. That guy….if things go as they are going then in a few years, that same demon would kill your sister.” I spoke making her go pale in shock. “Don’t worry. As long as you work for me, I can make sure that your sister survives. I don’t let my subordinates suffer.” I promised.</p><p><br></p><p>The words seemed to calm her down but I could still see the worry in her eyes. Kuina was glaring at me for springing such a thing on her at this time but I think it’s better to get these things off the way at first.</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise to serve you with all my heart so please, help my sister.” She bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I give you my word.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about several things and I found out that she was the one who created the Flower Breathing Style herself and was the first user of the Style, becoming a Hashira. In fact she was just seventeen right now.</p><p><br></p><p>That kind of talent is insane.</p><p><br></p><p>Flower Breathing is derived from Water Breathing so she knew that too.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked Kuina to explain everything to her till she recovered and then she will begin teaching the students the Breathing Styles.</p><p><br>According to her, the Water Breathing Style was the easiest for people to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I was even eager to learn at least the Total Concentration Breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>With this technique, the kids can finally become an able force.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa worked quite fast.</p><p><br></p><p>My engagement would be in four months. I had asked Grandpa to give us some time to get to know each other before we got married.</p><p><br></p><p>The Stairs guy had no problem with it and even seemed to be happy. If I didn’t know better I would have been fooled by his actions. It was decided that we would get married after eight months and they would offer us a part of their land as gifts to us. It would allow the people there to get used to the idea of living here. Four months later, they would announce the merger.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>With the time bomb set, I began working on the project to get Rōen for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>From the rumours, it was strong enough to devastate a small Ninja Village like the Howling Wolf Village so facing it directly was out of the question.</p><p><br></p><p>That meant we needed to rely on something else. The first option was seals but searching for a method to seal something like Rōen would take months and if I started it now, it would delay the information search about Rōen.</p><p><br></p><p>The next three months went by in a flash.</p><p><br></p><p>All my attempts to summon healers failed. I was hesitating to summon someone who was not in a critical condition before I had any abilities to save them or it would just be a waste again. This meant the people I was trying to summon had to be healthy and probably in a well off position to accept my summoning which ultimately led to my summoning resulting in a failure.</p><p><br></p><p>So after two months of failure, I changed my way of doing things. This time I decided to summon items which could heal just like the Red Potion or methods to make them myself.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was glad that I did so or I wouldn’t have discovered some new things about my power.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that my summoning powers could be used at their best once a month. It’s not just the case with Summoned people. They were inherently hard to summon, that’s why they only worked once a month when I was at my best. </p><p><br></p><p>Summoning items were similar too as I could summon magical items of a far better quality if I used that summoning slot for the process. Apart from this, if I were to use something connected to the world I was targeting for the summon, I was able to reduce the cost of energy used in summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Using this new knowledge and the previous bottle of Red Potion for the summoning ritual’s catalyst, I was able to summon a full crate of Red Potions, eight of them instead of only one.</p><p><br></p><p>My guess was that with the energy not being expended to search through different worlds, I could use more of it for summoning itself. The object connected to the previous world acted as an anchor of sorts to facilitate the summoning process.</p><p><br></p><p>Just learning this has opened up so many pathways for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day, I learn more and more about the Grimoire and I realise how much of a fool I am doing what I did yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, with these healing potions, I can go back to summoning near dead people and healing them back.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad to make more the potions required to learn one to learn Alchemy and pay one of the YGGDRASIL Gold Coins for each potion.</p><p><br></p><p>The last few months I have been concentrating on learning Fuinjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, we selected several kids from the people who were training to learn Fuinjutsu. All of them were tested to see who had a knack for the art.</p><p><br></p><p>Among the one hundred and twenty kids we had under us, only eight of them had any knack for the skill. Apart from them, Kanae seemed to have some knack for the skill too but she was not that good. Kuina had no talent for Fuinjutsu and neither did Saitō.</p><p><br></p><p>So ultimately the bulk of the work fell on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I was both practising the skills and teaching them to the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was glad that I had something like the Grimoire which directly imprinted the basic method instantly or I can’t imagine how difficult it would have been to learn everything from scratch. It also told me why people were so shit scared of the Uzumaki Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuinjutsu was an utter cheat.</p><p><br></p><p>To learn Fuinjutsu, one needed to learn calligraphy first, something which was already taught to me since childhood so I could skip that step quite easily. Kanae had the same advantage, being raised in a well to do household, she was trained in calligraphy too.</p><p><br></p><p>I had started by making basic seals as the materials needed for them were relatively cheaper. The Flash Tag, Sensory Seals and Explosive Tags were the basics.</p><p><br></p><p>After that came the Sealing Scrolls and Weight Seals.</p><p><br></p><p>This month, I was able to make some Weight Seals. It basically increases the weight of a substance. If used on metals, it can make them heavier. These are the kinds of seals used in making Training Weights.</p><p><br></p><p>My introduction of Training Weights had various reactions among my people. Some of them were frightened, some unsure while some were extremely excited. Kuina being the last type. She was extremely happy when she found out about these. She even had me make some tags so that she could increase the weight of her sword for practice.</p><p><br></p><p>These Training Weights had a great role in the development of my forces as I was planning to train all my people to have the capacity to at least open the eight inner gates. Rock Lee had learned how to open five gates in around a year and a half. It wouldn’t be too much to ask for my people to open at least one in a year with all the help and medicines I am providing them to train.</p><p><br></p><p>Even I myself was wearing the same to push my body forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae teaching everyone the breathing methods was also helpful as Total Concentration Breathing helped slowly increase the physical power of the individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were finally looking good for my land but not everything was as good as it seemed.</p><p><br></p><p>Whereas my people growing stronger was a good thing, the war was getting intense. It has been almost a year since the war started and things are starting to get worse now. The main forces had used up the stock they had prepared by now and were going to start buying food and stocks from the smaller nation.</p><p><br></p><p>And while they called it buying, it’s more of extortion with the prices they offered.</p><p><br></p><p>The people of my land had started adopting the new methods of agriculture and their production had increased so it should offset the low prices for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>I am just worried about someone trying to steal from us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you wanna go for another round?” Kuina asked me, breaking me from my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“One more? Well, why not but this would be the last round for me.” I replied breathing heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>Contrary to me, she wasn’t even breathing heavily. Seriously, the One Piece world and its people were crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s make it five more rounds, Kuina-chan.” Kanae said, enthusiastically.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The two girls had gotten quite close in the last three months.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them were genius swordswomen and Kuina being the prodigy she was, was speeding through the Breathing Method training. According to Kanae, she had never seen someone progressing so fast.</p><p><br></p><p>We were still not at the lead of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>At the forefront was Saitō who had been learning chakra techniques and breathing methods like a fish to the water. His experience with manipulating his Chi was coming in handy and his strength was increasing at a visible pace.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, both him and Kuina are at Chunin level while I am at High Genin level due to lacking the skills but my physique and chakra were all as good as a top Chunin. Not to say I was helpless. I still had some tricks up my sleeves.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae was still learning more about chakra so her strength was still in progress but even then she would easily be a Chunin level.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t know any good attack jutsu yet and mainly worked on the basics like breaking Genjutsu, Chakra Enhancement, Tree and Water Walking.</p><p><br></p><p>We were progressing slowly as we didn’t have any good teacher to teach us. Only Kensho and I had any ideas about these things and even then I was just a beginner.</p><p><br></p><p>As we ran further, a Samurai came running towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness!” He was relatively young and looked like he was terrified of something.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“There….there are shinobi fighting a little distance outside the town.” He replied as soon as he regained his breath.</p><p><br></p><p>A chill ran down my spine at the words but I still asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many and how far? What village are they from? Were any of our people injured?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two kilometres outside the city. A group of shinobi from Iwagakure were chasing three shinobi from Uzugakure. The Iwa group had more people and the Uzu group looked like they were in trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Uzu and Iwa?” What are Uzu and Iwa people doing here?</p><p><br></p><p>“What should we do, Your Highness?” The samurai trainee asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Saitō. “We watch from a distance and see the situation for ourselves before deciding.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and our main group went towards the direction of combat.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching the scene, I brought out a few pairs of binoculars for my group and we looked at the fighting scene.</p><p><br></p><p>The three Uzumaki people were clearly identifiable from their distinct red hair. They were surrounded by twice the number of Iwa shinobi….the key word being were</p><p><br></p><p>They had already killed three of them while two others were seriously wounded but it was not without costing them injuries as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“How strong do they look to you, Kensho?” I asked, my eyes narrowing at the scene, several things going on in my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are all Chunin except two of the injured Uzumakis who might be stronger considering that they are fighting at that level even with such injuries. The dead Iwa might have been Jonins or I can’t see them being pushed to this extent.” Kensho said as he inspected the battle.</p><p><br></p><p>“The stronger ones are trying to protect the weakest redhead or they could probably have escaped.” Saitō remarked. “She must be someone <a href=\"https://important….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">important….at</a> least to them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The red haired ones are poisoned.” Kanae said, her usual tone replaced by a calm and serious voice. “Their movements are getting slower. The other party knows this and thus they are delaying the fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“From the look in their eyes, it looks like they would sooner or later go suicidal to take down their enemies.” Saitō said.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked closer and observed another one of the Iwa people getting impatient and tried to sneak an attack on the weakest Uzumaki only for him to get struck by the sword and kicked away by the older ones.</p><p><br></p><p>The other Iwa shinobi didn’t let go of this and a kunai was lodged into the guys of the older Uzumaki in exchange.</p><p><br></p><p>The injured Iwa was picked up by one of his comrade while another one came forward to protect the two.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at that moment that we saw the older Uzumaki making a hand sign and the guy who had just been kicked away blew up.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard Kuina take a breath at the scene. “That’s….”</p><p><br></p><p>“The reason why the Uzumaki Clan are so feared in the Shinobi World. They are a Clan of Fuinjutsu Masters. True Masters could implant an Explosive Seal on your body with just a touch.”</p><p><br></p><p>The blast took down both the injured guy as well as the one healing him while the one protecting the two was injured badly.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the playing field was evened….or so it looked.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the injured Uzumaki suddenly vomited blood and almost kneeled.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate they will all die….</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a thought came to my mind and I turned towards Saitō. “Do you think we can take the Iwa shinobi out?”</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho was surprised. “Your Highness?”</p><p><br></p><p>Saitō was not deterred and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then save the Uzumaki. Take down Iwa. Attack!”</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho was a true samurai as even when the guy was doubtful about the orders, he still took action as soon as an order was given. There was no hesitation at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I observed them from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the first time I had seen my people fight for real.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae was like a completely different person in a fight. She just tore through the Iwa’s surprised defence in a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>While her style was the epitome of gracefulness, Saitō’s style was like watching a surgeon. Fighting with pinpoint accuracy. When he attacked, he always got what he wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho and Kuina were standard Samurai through and through.</p><p><br></p><p>With their help, the Iwa shinobi were taken care of easily and captured.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki however still didn’t leave their defensive position and were guarding against us.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to take the lead at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness!” Kensho noticed me coming towards them and came forward to guard me. The other group also looked at me warily.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved at Kensho and looked at the Uzumaki group.</p><p><br></p><p>“Greetings, shinobi. We are the Prince of the Land of Flowers, Kazuya Katsuyoshi. You do not need to be wary of us. The reason we ordered our people to take action was because some of these Iwa shinobi had been causing trouble in our territory as well. They stole, burned and pillaged our land and killed our people so it is only obvious that as the ruler of the Land, we should take action.” I explained. It wasn’t even a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>Iwa was hated by the people of the Land of Flowers due to the previous war which took the life of the previous Daimyo, my father as well as took away several parts of our lands </p><p><br></p><p>They looked slightly satisfied but didn’t let down their guard completely.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, I observed the group closely. The two older ones were both girls, twins in fact while the youngest one was a guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“We know it is not easy for you to trust us here so you could follow us to our capital city and see for yourself. As it looks, you three don’t look like you can keep standing for much longer.”</p><p><br></p><p>The oldest looking one who looked like in her twenties came forward and bowed slightly. “We thank you for saving our lives, Your Highness. Our Uzumaki village will never forget this favour.” She then hesitated before looking back at the other two and then at us. “I know it’s asking too much but we and the entire Uzushiogakure will be eternally grateful if you could provide us a place to stay until we recover.” She bowed deeply this time.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her words. “Obviously. If we wanted you to die, we could have waited longer before interfering. You are welcome to rest with us till you recover. Just be reminded that you need to follow the rules of the land.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We swear.” She quickly replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Capture the surviving Iwa Shinobi and take the bodies of the dead.” I ordered as I led the three back.</p><p><br></p><p>Three of them were still alive although barely.</p><p><br></p><p>We already had two chunins captured in our cells. If I can get two more, I could do another ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I wasn’t sure I could capture Chunins so easily until my people were a bit stronger so I had left this ritual on the backburner. Soul Rituals always took an insane amount of materials.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure I could kill the Uzumaki too but I had no intention of doing so. I wanted to establish friendly relationships with them. They could be of much greater help if my plan works.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, I began talking with them, introducing them to the city as we walked back home.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Another chapter of ‘Ruling by the Book’ is here.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As you can see the plot is slowly moving.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In this case, the MC needed some time to truly establish himself.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ninjas need years of training to become even Chunin level.

Looking around, I realised that I had fallen asleep in my lab.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn, that last ritual had tired me out more than I was expecting.” I whispered to myself before another knock was heard outside. “Coming. Give me fifteen minutes.” I replied back.</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday night I was using the second round of Ritual to strengthen my Soul.</p><p><br></p><p>After reading and researching for a bit, I discovered that strengthening the soul first was the way to go.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several reasons for that.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the stronger I was, the more materials it took to strengthen me and Soul Strengthening took the most expensive and rare materials. So if I did that last, I would have to spend more money.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, increasing the power of the Soul not only provided me with chakra but also gave me resistance to Genjutsu and certain techniques like the Yamanaka’s Mind Transmission Technique and other techniques related to souls to a certain extent. It wasn’t much but something was better than nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, it was nigh impossible to detect.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus making for the safest increase in strength followed by Mind and lastly Body.</p><p><br></p><p>I hoped these rituals at least pushed me beyond Chunin Level in chakra and I could start summoning again.</p><p><br></p><p>After cleaning everything, I opened the door to find Kuina standing outside. She looked much better today.</p><p><br></p><p>Dressed in a kimono, she had a sword at her side as she stood outside my door.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been a month since she was summoned by me. At first she was a bit scared but she realised that she was dying in that world and only being summoned here saved her life and thus she slowly regained her calm.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it wasn’t easy for such a young girl to accept the fact that she died.</p><p><br></p><p>I had promised her that one day I would help her go back to her world….alive. This had helped her regain hope and decide to work for me.</p><p><br></p><p>The condition I had stipulated when summoning her was that I needed someone to protect me. A sword user with great potential.</p><p><br></p><p>I never said strength and only potential and thus the one given to me was Kuina. The girl had more potential than Zoro, the guy who would one day go on to become the strongest swordsman in the world….or at least I hope he did.</p><p><br></p><p>When watching One Piece, I had always felt bad for Kuina, such great potential exhausted so suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>I had always wondered what would happen if she got the treatment she deserved. Would we see another sword user on the level of Momousagi or maybe even surpassing her?</p><p><br></p><p>And now it looks like I could see it for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part about summoning someone was that they could still use the powers of their home world, regardless of rules or requirements. The only catch was that they couldn’t teach the powers to others if it required the mechanics of that world to work.</p><p><br></p><p>So, in a way, she could still learn Haki and have ridiculous One Piece strength but she might not be able to teach that to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>I might be able to gain those abilities through rituals but that would require me to train like her too, at least until I can go to her world myself and sync my Grimoire to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Gaining Kuina was actually quite a boon for me.</p><p><br></p><p>She was exceptionally talented in swordsmanship. Even now, she could mow down all the kids we had recruited and even the newbie Samurai under Grandpa. She was quite strong physically and I knew that she could get even stronger over time as long as she trained more.</p><p><br></p><p>Her sudden appearance did arouse  doubts, a simple talk with Grandpa made her my personal bodyguard, answerable only to me and thus forbidding anyone to look into her.</p><p><br></p><p>Every Daimyo had his own bodyguards trained personally so that they would be loyal to them only.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina was the first of my bodyguards and I had the right to decide what to do with her. Grandpa had agreed to this.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing that I did was teach her basic chakra exercise. While the people I summon are attuned to this world by the Grimoire’s power, they still need to learn the skills from scratch. </p><p><br></p><p>Samurai of this world used Chakra too although only for reinforcement of their bodies and their blades.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still a very useful technique though.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last three months, I had written several books about basic shinobi arts like meditation method, chakra control method, basic E and D Rank Jutsus, academy level stuff and stored them in a hidden room built in my Warehouse for her to read.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she practised only the skills used by the Samurai, the new power also served to inspire her towards her goal of becoming the strongest swordswoman. I had taken my time to tell her how few of the strongest people in the world were women like Big Mom, Boa Hancock, Yamato and Momousagi. If they could reach there, why couldn’t she?</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say the words lit a flame in her which had previously been doused by the words of her father.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she was training with the goal of returning back to her world and defeating Zoro and taking the title of the strongest sword user in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you sleep in your lab?” She asked, looking at me incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yes, I was doing some work and fell asleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Doing one of your shady experiments again?” She asked, her voice a bit lower this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey! What do you mean by shady experiments? All of my experiments are for the purpose of helping my people.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was still not used to this retainer business and mostly talked to me in her tomboyish way.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought it was funny, unfortunately Mira didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>She was training her in manners and etiquette befitting the retinue of the future Flower Daimyo. However when we were alone, she reverted back to her normal ways.</p><p><br></p><p>She just rolled her eyes at my words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, you were late for breakfast so Mira-sama sent me to get you. In case you forgot, Daimyo-sama is going to be visiting the Land of Medicine for business matters. You don’t want to make him late.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! I completely forgot about it. Gimme fifteen minutes, I will be ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hurry up.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rushing back to my room, I quickly took a bath and arrived at Grandpa’s room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazu-kun, did you sleep while working yesterday? That won’t do, you know. You need to take care of your health too. If you become sick, it will only delay you in your work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I will take care, Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuina-kun. You should watch over him. If he doesn’t follow my instructions, be sure to inform me when I return.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Daimyo-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>My lips twitched at her prompt answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, I heard that you were collecting herbs and medicines. Do you have anything you want me to get from the Land of Medicines?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, yes. I have already prepared the list. I will have someone send it to you. Although doubtful, it would be great if we could get fresh plants and seeds so that we could grow those medicines here too.”</p><p><br></p><p>I mean sure I could summon them to me too but that’s not viable for large scale uses.</p><p><br></p><p>“I doubt they would do that. Most of their income depends on the exports of those medicines.” He shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well too bad, I guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I have heard that your farming methods are quite a success. Although not ripe, we are expecting almost double the amount of produce from your lands compared to our best records yet. If things work out as we are predicting, then after the war, I would like to use this method for all our lands. It would be a boon for our people.”</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked at Mira and Kuina and the older woman took Kuina and left the room, leaving the two of us alone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you have some secrets, Kazu-kun.” My heart froze at his words but he continued. “but….I won’t ask you about them. You are my blood and I trust you and your reasons for hiding them.” He then hesitated before continuing. “These are troubled times, Kazu-kun. Please take care of yourself. While I  couldn’t be prouder of your achievements, I am also worried about the attention it would attract to you. You are the only family I have.”</p><p><br></p><p>I swallowed a lump in my throat I didn’t know I had while he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our land has still not completely recovered from the last war. In terms of power, we are the weakest nations in our area, a position we share with the Land of Stairs and possessing treasure is a crime in such times. Keep this in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.” I nodded hurriedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. I will be back in two weeks at most. Take care of everything till then. If you need anything, you can ask Mira.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things and finally excused ourselves to go on our own way.</p><p><br></p><p>His words also confirmed the fact that the war was getting messier everyday.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only a matter of time before it came to our door.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to hurry up the rituals. I already have some mastery of the Chakra Suppression Technique now. I have been practising it nonstop for the last three months.</p><p><br></p><p>I think I can carry on with the rituals now.</p><p><br></p><p>With this in mind, I directly went to Kensho.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We want those three genins today.” I directly broached the subject without any nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see, when would you need them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“An hour before midnight.”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t show any expression but agreed. “Where should I bring them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To our new warehouse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. They will be there.” He agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>This time he didn’t ask for anything either.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuina.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you spar with Kensho? He is one of our strongest Samurai. You might learn something from him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….I….does Kensho-san have any problems with it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No Miss. I would be glad to accompany you to a fight. I have heard a lot about your skill with the blade, it would be an honour to see it with my own eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then the two of you go ahead and spar while we go and work on some projects of ours.” I clapped my hands and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Without giving them any chances, I returned to the warehouse and started to prepare for the night’s big ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho arrived right on time.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him were three people, dragged along. Their hands and feet were in chains and handcuffs and they could hardly move.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that they had the energy for that.</p><p><br></p><p>He came and bowed in front of me. “Here is what you requested, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Where are they from? What are their crimes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They were from Amegakure. They had left their village and started working as bandits in our Lands, pillaging villages, murdering and raping. They were also involved in human trafficking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How were they captured?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Daimyo hired Shinobi to have them captured.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Their leader was a Chunin Shinobi and there were several normal bandits in their group too.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Very well.” No need to show them any mercy then.</p><p><br></p><p>“Their chakra has been sealed and they are dosed with medicines to keep them powerless. They won’t be able to use any strength for the next twelve hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Thank you, Kensho-san. We shall take this matter from here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho hesitated for a bit. “Your Highness, they are still Shinobi….”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine Kensho-san. We can take care of this. Kuina.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?” The girl beside me answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Knock them out and drag them inside.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>She knocked the three with a hit from her katana’s sheathe and dragged them behind her, following me.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the basement, I had already finished preparing for the ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>The circles had been drawn already.</p><p><br></p><p>“Place them in the three circles and then you can leave the room.” I told Kuina and she nodded. I noticed that she was a bit nervous, probably understanding what was going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you feeling pity for them?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. I heard what they have done. In my world, there were similar pirates too. These kinds of people deserve no mercy.” She said with a hint of steel in her voice. I hadn’t seen this attitude of hers yet.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Then, what are you worried about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you going to do it yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I need to do this.” I replied, resolutely.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and nodded, following orders.</p><p><br></p><p>With her gone, I didn’t stop either.</p><p><br></p><p>I activated the circle and drew my sword, swinging it and taking down one of the unconscious ninja. The blood from it splattered everywhere, some of it on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>Warm.</p><p><br></p><p>His blood was warm.</p><p><br></p><p>My heart was beating rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p>I had felt the entire strike, from the feeling of cutting flesh to the bones and while my new strength made it easy, it didn’t reduce the feelings of disgust I felt from the action.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly pulling looking at the other shinobi, I left this one and headed towards the other, repeating the same thing two more times before going to the centre of the Ritual Circle and sitting inside and began chanting.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire room lit up with an eerie red light as the bodies of the three shinobi in the circle started dissolving into a red liquid. The red liquid transformed into characters and slithered through the magic circles on to my body.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the previous times however, this time I felt pain as if countless ants were biting me throughout my body, even on the insides, even my soul wasn’t spared of the pain.</p><p><br></p><p>I gritted my teeth and tried to endure as best as I could.</p><p><br></p><p>After what seemed like hours, the pain started to become lesser…. Or maybe I was just becoming numb to it.</p><p><br></p><p>When the pain finally stopped and the ritual circle died down, I dragged my body out of the room and collapsed outside.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way I was sleeping in that room now.</p><p><br></p><p>Before losing my consciousness, I heard Kuina’s worried voice and then it was all black.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes to see an unfamiliar roof. It took me a moment to realise that this was the room I had in my lab.</p><p><br></p><p>The memories of last night came flooding in and I remembered that Kuina had probably carried me here after I had passed out.</p><p><br></p><p>And in those memories came the part in which I had killed those three genin ranked shinobi while they were unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew I had to do it. I knew they were scum. I knew that it was my duty to do so to protect my people. And even then, even knowing all this didn’t do anything to assuage the feelings of disgust that welled up in my heart from those memories.</p><p><br></p><p>How could people do this on a regular basis? How could they make a profession out of killing? How do they even sleep at night after murdering people?</p><p><br></p><p>Several thoughts came in my head as I shook them off.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it was the memories of my previous life which was affecting me this way as while it was rare in my previous world, it was a pretty common thing in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t let my moral sensibilities of my previous life affect me here or I would be dead meat before I can do anything at all.</p><p><br></p><p>This world was a jungle. Here you either eat or get eaten.</p><p><br></p><p>If I can’t even take someone’s life, if I lacked even that much resolve then all that was waiting for me was death.</p><p><br></p><p>A deep breath helped me calm down and got up to see myself in the mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt strange looking at myself.</p><p><br></p><p>My brown hair and green eyes were the same but my face looked sharper. It wasn’t childish anymore. Now it was transitioning between a child and a man.</p><p><br></p><p>I think I have grown an inch or so. I removed my kimono and hot damn….those abs.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to say I had fat on my body or anything due to my regular lessons of swordsmanship but now the muscles on my body were something else entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>These were only the visible changes. The main changes were inside.</p><p><br></p><p>My chakra had increased almost three fold which was saying something as my chakra has been constantly increasing in the last three months due to training and had increased even further when I did the soul ritual yesterday. </p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how much Chunin level chakra was but I was pretty sure I wouldn’t be far off from that level now.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind felt a lot sharper than before.</p><p><br></p><p>My senses were sharper too. My eyesight, smell, hearing and even the sense of touch felt far more refined than before. It was an overall improvement.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was due to this improvement that I could smell the scent of blood and sweat on my body.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to test my strength but taking a bath first was necessary so I did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>When I finally came out, I saw Kuina standing there worried. Beside her was Kensho and he looked worried as well. “Are you alright, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. We are sorry, last night was a bit too much for us and we fainted. It seems that we still need to learn a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure Kensho must have noticed the changes in my body but didn’t ask anything. Was it because of Grandpa? He knew I was hiding things too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you really okay?” Kuina asked too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Perfectly. We believe today is the day we have to check on the growth of the fields and decide on the day of harvest?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then we will head there after breakfast. Kensho, would you please inform the men and ask them to be ready by afternoon today?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.” He bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well then. We believe it’s time for our breakfast. We are starving.”</p><p><br></p><p>And indeed I was starving. Was it the changes in my body or something but I felt like I could eat our entire granary out.</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho left and Kuina followed me hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can ask me anything you want, you know.” I asked as I walked towards the palace.</p><p><br></p><p>“What….what was that about? How did you….well, become this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Strengthening rituals.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rituals?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>She scoffed and I looked at her with a frown.</p><p><br></p><p>“I brought you here from the verge of death, isn’t that magic enough for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>That shut her up.</p><p><br></p><p>“So those three people….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are gone. They will never be any danger to us again.” I finished, leaving no room for any further discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t ask anything else either.</p><p><br></p><p>We had a quiet breakfast and the first thing we did was go to the training ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to test out my new strength. Accompany me to a spar.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We used bokken instead of regular swords.</p><p><br></p><p>Until now, I had never won against Kuina. Even with my use of Chakra, she was stronger than me….and far more skilled than me too.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however was different.</p><p><br></p><p>My strikes were heavier. My reactions were faster. My mind was working faster and I could see all her strikers clearer.</p><p><br></p><p>Even without using chakra, I was faster, and could take on her blows and defend against her attacks with an advantage of speed. Although I was not used to my new strength and thus my moves were not controlled. She was using all the holes in my attacks to defend and retaliate against me.</p><p><br></p><p>The match ended abruptly when I actually used chakra and shattered her bokken.</p><p><br></p><p>“What in the world did you do?” She asked, stunned at the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Even I myself was stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know.” I answered, looking at the shattered bokken in her hand and the slightly broken one in my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was as if someone pushed extra power but no control into you all of a sudden. You were better at fighting before. I think you should get used to this level of power first.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded at her advice. That was exactly what I wanted to do.</p><p><br></p><p>My current strength and potential were enough to train to a Jōnin level if I were to put hard work into it. Obviously such a feat would take time and lots of effort but it could be done. Jōnin were not simple people after all.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in the five major villages, among tens of thousands of shinobi, there were only a few hundred Jōnin at best.</p><p><br></p><p>In smaller villages, the kage of the village has the same strength as a Jōnin or Elite Jōnin from a major village.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps my perception of strength has been twisted due to the memories of my previous life where Jōnin were dying left and right.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t an invincible level of strength but it wasn’t bad either.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, the next ritual would need more and stronger ingredients and getting them would be harder.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking of getting some new abilities using the next ritual rather than blindly increasing my strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Some abilities like Sensing or even some Bloodlines could be the difference between life and death for me.</p><p><br></p><p>This level of chakra would be enough to summon materials. There were still many intricacies I didn’t know about the process as why most of the times things were non magical and why sometimes things came out as magical. There was still a lot I needed to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>As for people, after summoning Kuina, I discovered something about summoning intelligent creatures.</p><p><br></p><p>I could only do so once every month and even then the other side had the right to reject the summoning. If that happens, I would have to wait another month before summoning anything. The only silver lining was that I got back half the energy used in such a case. This limit might increase as I become more familiar with the abilities of the Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, such a cheat would have some restrictions or at Kage level, I could just make an army in a year.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, I could only summon a certain number of people depending on my strength after which the chances of successful summoning would be reduced.</p><p><br></p><p>It had something to do with how the Grimoire was allowing them to use the abilities of their worlds even if such things might not be possible in this world. And the Grimoire’s strength depended on my strength, thus the limit.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….so many freaking restrictions.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I had some plans for the energy for summoning others.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I could use the energy of other beings for this and this world has many such sources like the Tailed Beasts and similar creatures. With enough planning, I could make use of those. But that’s a story for later.</p><p><br>For now, I need to focus on what’s in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>After the spar, I cleaned up and left for the fields with Kuina.</p><p><br></p><p>There, Kensho had already gathered everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of me was the product of the last three and half months of everyone’s work.</p><p><br></p><p>The lush fields of rice which swayed with the wind. The production was almost two and half times more in these lands compared to any other.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the bright faces of all the people who had worked together to make this happen and could see pride in their eyes as they looked at the fields and happiness at their achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello everyone. How have you all been?” I asked, addressing the crowd which erupted into a cacophony of replies.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha alright alright, one by one. Just answer yes and no for now. Are you happy with the results of your hard work?” I asked loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes!” Came the united voice of my people.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you learn something new in these last few months?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes!”</p><p><br></p><p>“This my people, is not a miracle. It’s the product of your own hard work and a bit of my knowledge of crops. “This…. can be done by any of you just as easily. I hope you will use this knowledge and bring prosperity to our land.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd cheered at my words.</p><p><br></p><p>I inspected the land and looked decided on the day of harvest before leaving the people with some more instructions.</p><p><br></p><p>While walking back, Kensho and Kuina followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, out with it. What questions do you have?” I asked, looking at Kensho’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness, was it really wise to give away such a magical method to people? Aren’t you afraid that they would leak it to other Lands?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously the method will leak. Whether it leaks today or tomorrow but it will leak for sure. If anything, if it leaks easily, the other lands will not hire shinobi to steal the methods or even our crops. You must understand that when you are not strong enough to protect something, it is better to distribute it at a lower price lest you attract danger.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at me open mouthed and I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Moreover, even if they get the method, they will never be able to replicate our results as it relies on the fertilisers, seeds and the land of our people. That’s something they will not get. So all in all, while their production might increase by 15-18%, they will not reach our levels.” I smiled. “So don’t worry. We will not be losing anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But the best part in all this will be that my people will all have increased produce from next year. They will get a better standard of living and we will have more income in taxes. It’s a win-win for all. Don’t you agree?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Yes, Your Highness is wise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now then, I want you to focus on training the children we recruited as the Police Force of the Land of Flowers. With these crops, we will have enough funds to support them for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will get right on to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Kuina, how about you come with me around the city today? I am quite happy with our success and it’s been a while since I have walked around the capital.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho followed us and after taking a round around the capital, we returned to the palace. He went for his own work while Kuina and I went to my warehouse.</p><p><br></p><p>A month had passed and it was time to summon someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>We locked the place as usual and I summoned my Grimoire and got ready for summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>My goal was to summon someone who could train my people to protect my land. Summon someone who might die otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like the last time, the lights lit up the place and gathered together to form the figure of a person.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt the energy drain from my body but this time it was much more manageable than before I guess my body and soul being stronger helped out.</p><p><br>When the light faded, the entire scene became clear.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of us stood a rather tall man with a lean but fit frame. He had a long face with pronounced cheekbones and tear-troughs. His eyes were piercing and narrow while yellow in colour and his short black hair was neatly slicked back with the exception of four bangs over his forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>The man gave a feeling of a wild animal, a wolf to be precise.</p><p><br></p><p>He just stared at us but didn’t say anything so I opened the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“May I know your name?” I asked politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Isn’t it good manners to give your own before asking for another person’s name?” He replied in a deep voice.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at his words. “Ahahahaha my apologies. My name is Kazuya Katsuyoshi, the Prince of the Land of Flowers.” He raised his eyebrow at the introduction but I continued before he could ask something. “I assume you know that you are not in your world anymore?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “Indeed. I was informed of such but I thought I was hallucinating due to my injuries. He looked at his chest. “Which look like they have vanished too. Did you heal me?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a product of my power, yes.” I nodded. “May I know your name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Saitō Hajime.”</p><p><br></p><p>That made me raise my eyebrows. “The former captain of the third unit of the Shhinsengumi, Saitō Hajime?” I asked curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have heard of me? Well obviously, or you wouldn’t have called me here from the verge of death.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….that’s not the case. I do have knowledge of several worlds and several people. Consider it a gift from the Gods but I don’t know you personally or summon you here specifically. My request was to summon someone who would have otherwise died and someone who could help me teach my people how to protect our country. You just happened to meet the requirements.” I clarified to not it become a problem later on.</p><p><br></p><p>“So I was just a random choice then?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I scratched my cheek. “I am sorry if you were called here without your permission. I was made to believe that you all accepted the summoning and only there you were summoned here.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “I did. The other option was death.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the awkward look on my face, the guy asked more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me everything in detail. If I am to work here, I need to know everything I am dealing with. Leave no detail behind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then please come and have a seat. Also, would you like to take a bath and some food before we start talking?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would appreciate that, thanks.”</p><p><br></p><p>We brought him out to a new room and gave him time to get refreshed and finally had dinner. After that, we began to talk where I explained the brief history of this world to him along with the current structure of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I found out something far more interesting that I was hoping for.</p><p><br></p><p>This version of Saitō Hajime died due to his injuries against….Makoto Shishio.</p><p><br></p><p>Holy Crap! This was the Ruronin Kenshin version of Saitō Hajime. I won the lottery.</p><p><br></p><p>“These Shinobi, how strong would you say they are?” He asked, narrowing his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“The best Swordsman in your world would just be a Chunin and that’s pushing it already.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned. “Are you underestimating the swordsmen of my country?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh no. If anything I am actually respecting their abilities which is why I am putting them up with Chunins. Let me give you an idea about how strong different ranks of Shinobi can be.”</p><p><br></p><p>His frown remained but he was willing to listen. Kuina listened on the side too.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour I went into the different ranks of Shinobi and their average strengths in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>“An Elite Jōnin could take down hundreds of trained Samurai who do not possess any chakra and come back without any scratch. As for the Kage….one Kage could destroy a small country like ours without suffering a single scratch. There are other powers who rival Kages or are even stronger but let’s not talk about them for now. It’s better not to know for now as if they get involved, we would die no matter what. They can destroy and reshape the entire land in their battles.”</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of it all, I saw his mouth open and the look of shock marred on his usually composed face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not looking to go into a war, Saitō-san. I just want my people to have some protection in such troubled times. Also, in case you didn’t know, you have chakra now too. Considering it a more advanced version of Chi. I will give you a method so that you can learn to use it too. It will surely increase your combat power as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked to be in thought so I decided to give him more time.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you saw, there are plenty of books in my lab about every subject you might need to know about this land. I will give you a week’s time to decide.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I decided to accept your offer as soon as I accepted the summoning. I just need to know more about what I am dealing with. I believe you don’t want anyone to know that I don’t belong to this world?”</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and told him of the things he couldn’t reveal to anyone. I even applied commands on him.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, we left him in the warehouse and informed the guards that he was a guest of mine who will be staying there for sometime.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who was that guy?” Kuina asked me as we were heading back to the palace.</p><p><br></p><p>“Saitō Hajime is a great swordsman and was in a position similar to the Marines of your world. He worked for the government to protect the people of his country from criminals.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I could tell that he was strong.” She said, looking forward.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and shook my head. “While he might be one of the strongest people in his world, in your world….he wouldn’t even be able to stand in the presence of the strongest man. Not just him, even Jōnin level shinobi will lose their consciousness in the presence of the top level pirates. If you want to go back and become the strongest swordswoman in your world….you have a far harder goal than me who is trying to make my country one of the strongest in this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>She became quiet and then spoke after some time. “Can you tell me something about my world? I hardly know about anything outside our island.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Alright. First, let’s start from your Island and family itself.” And there I began telling her about the Shimotsuki Family of Wano who had come to East Blue looking to see the outside world and settled there.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we reached the palace, the story was over and we had dinner together.</p><p><br></p><p>I generally ate with Grandpa but since he wasn’t home yet, I ate with Kuina today.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I retired to my room.</p><p><br></p><p>I was feeling exhausted after the summoning and could barely hold back anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa came back two weeks later.</p><p><br></p><p>In that time, Saitō had studied everything he could about this world and even developed a backstory for himself. His years of working as a spy for the government were showing.</p><p><br></p><p>According to his story, he was a mercenary and bounty hunter who was hired by me as a samurai under my service. Kensho was a bit wary of him but didn’t say anything after a word from me.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitō had immediately started working on teaching the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>While he was not a master at using Chakra, his speed of learning was very great, being a Chi user himself. Apart from that, his swordsmanship was great and he was a great leader too.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was among the people who established the entire network of police forces in Japan. I hoped he could do something like that here too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, I know kids grow fast but isn’t this a bit too fast?” Was the first thing Grandpa said after looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Welcome back, Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard that you had changed suddenly but just what have you been up to, Kazu-kun?” The shock in his voice was apparent.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….did some experiments. Don’t worry. It’s nothing harmful. I have been working on some medicines lately and tried something new.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want to try something, do that on one of the criminals, not yourself.” He scolded.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine, Grandpa. I would never take a risk with my life. I promised you that I would take care of myself, didn’t I?” I assured.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….one day you will have to tell me everything.” He sighed as he sat down in his seat and massaged his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise. In fact, I was planning to show you something if you got the things I asked you to bring.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. I got everything you asked for. Do you know how much those things cost? For a moment I thought I would have to ask for a loan from the Medicine guy. I had to use money from my personal stash. You better be grateful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When am I not grateful?” I rolled my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you should be. In fact, I know just the thing you could do to pay me back.” He said with a conspiratorial grin.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah….?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, do you know how many years of my savings I had to spend on everything? Shouldn't you do something for me too?”</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed. “Okay, what do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“First promise me that you will agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if I don’t know what this is about, how would I know if I could do it? I don’t want to make false promises to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah! Don’t worry. It’s something you could absolutely do.” He said with a snort, which was quite unlike his normal behaviour. Just what was he talking about?</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I promise.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Now I can reply back to the Stairs Daimyo and say that you have agreed to the marriage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed to a….what!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Marriage. What I want is a great grandson from you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, just hold on for a moment. That’s not what….”</p><p><br></p><p>“You promised.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sixteen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Almost seventeen. Your birthday is next month. It’s the age people can get married in the land.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am too young. I have a lot to do and….” I tried protesting.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you could do everything even if you are married. If there is someone you like, for example Kuina-kun, you could also take concubines. She is not going to hold you in your room or anything. And even if she did, it’s not like it would be much different from now….” He whispered the last part.</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard that, you know. I totally heard that. Also there is nothing going on between Kuina and me. We are just friends.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah! Your father said the same thing and then you were born.”</p><p><br></p><p>My lips twitched at the sudden change of topic. Still, that is not what I want to talk about right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Am I lying?” He replied, stubbornly too.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “Can you tell me what brought this on all of a sudden?”</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled widely. “Well, do you know I visited the Land of Medicine?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To discuss business? They want grains and you wanted to discuss the change in prices due to the war.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah, that was a part of it. But there was another more important reason for going there.” He continued. “It was a gathering of the Daimyos of small countries in the surrounding areas.” Here his face became serious, dropping all the joking manner he had just seconds ago. “Can you guess why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are getting tense with the movements of the Big Five, aren’t they?” I asked, already sure of the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “Yes. We talked about alliances. Only by grouping up could we offer even the slightest resistance against the big five, not militarily maybe but economically at the very least. There we discussed ways to strengthen the bonds between our nations through exchange of resources, technology and finally….marriage. It is after all the oldest ways of building relations.” He finished and gave me a second to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that I was actually thinking, he continued. “Land of Stairs is the smallest land in the alliance and their strength is similar to our own. Most of their economy is dependent on their Blacksmiths. They share a border with the Land of Fire and that’s why they have been safe mostly as the Land of Fire already has enough fertile land and resources. There is hardly anything they could obtain from a small country filled with mountains like the Land of Stairs. It’s how they have been surviving till now….”</p><p><br></p><p>“But now that position is being threatened? I don’t think the Land of Fire will care?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They don’t. Ame does.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rain?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “Ame is the centre of war this time and while I understand their pain, they are starting to send their shinobi to smaller nations like Stairs and even Medicines to rob for the resources. In the last attack, almost half of their soldiers died. Even the Stairs Prince died in the attack. The shinobi were working under the guise of bandits so they could never be pinned on Ame but the signs were clear.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Land of Rain is a mid-sized country and the Daimyo of that country is merely a figurehead. Hanzo, the Salamander is the actual incharge.</p><p><br></p><p>That man is very ambitious. I could totally see him doing such a thing and then I remembered something.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are planning to attack us too?” I asked, my eyes widening.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, not now. We are the main food suppliers of Earth and we have the alliance of the Lightning. Attacking us would make the two nations come down on them like a pile of rocks, pun intended.” He laughed at the joke, trying to lighten the atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>These words also made me understand the situation more.</p><p><br></p><p>“And thus the Land of Stairs want to make an alliance with us to put Ame at bay? That wouldn’t work, you know. Hanzo is not the kind of man to give up so easily. He would still attack them even if they are our allies and the Earth and Lightning would not lift a finger for our allies. They only do so for us because it has benefits for them.” I retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled. “Yes. We understand that, that’s why what the Stairs Daimyo is looking for is not a simple marriage alliance but rather a merger of the countries.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” This time I shouted for a completely different reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep calm. Such a reaction is not suitable for someone of your position.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait just a moment, I think I just misheard something.” I interrupted. Yeah, that sounds more feasible.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been working overnight a lot so I might be mishearing things.</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t mishear anything. The Stairs guy’s Granddaughter. She is sixteen years old too. Their country is suffering in the war. Food prices are rising. They are being continuously attacked. Even their blacksmiths are being robbed for weapons by Ame and are working in debt. If this continues, which it will, there is a high chance that they will be annexed by Rain. If that happens, their people will not have a good time. If they merge with us however, their people will still keep their rights as their princess will be the new Lady of their Land. It will also allow for a peaceful transition of the future rulers of both the countries to get married.” He finished. “Now you understand why I asked you for this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my mouth. Indeed, it was all profit for us. A win-win for both sides.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you want to increase our military power and the Blacksmiths from the Land of Stairs will be a great asset to you. After all, every army needs to be equipped with weapons to function.” He continued.</p><p><br></p><p>All his points were valid.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would the Land of Fire have any say on this matter if an ally of their enemy suddenly appeared on their borders?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. We are not exactly allies of the Lightning or Earth. Both of them are using us to get hands on the grains we produce. Fire knows this. If anything, they could offer us help to deny their enemies support to fight a protracted war.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Or they could just conquer us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. They would never do that. That would directly connect their borders with Earth. They already share a border with the Wind and are fighting a war on that front. This would simply open another front of war for them. That’s a stupid decision. They would never do that.” He replied confidently. I thought and found the decision to be reasonable.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the Earth and Lightning?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Earth wouldn’t do anything at this moment for the same reason as Konoha. Lightning, well those greedy bastards would surely demand more ‘protection fees’ from us to ‘protect’ a larger piece of land.” He said with a dark look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, that sounded something those muscle heads would do.</p><p><br></p><p>“And I have seen the portraits of the Princess. Princess Kasumi is a very pretty girl and from what I have heard, very well mannered and soft spoken too. Her people like her a lot as she always helps out the people of her land personally. She has been doing so since she was a kid.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that why you are so late? Finding out more about this girl?” I asked, annoyed, although most of my annoyance had faded after his reasoning. “What about the rest of the family of the Stairs Daimyo? Do they agree to this union? How will the distribution of power be done?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Stairs guy has decided to convene his family and discuss this matter further with them although it will most probably be ordering them. That guy has always been a strict fellow who doesn't like his decisions to be questioned by his people, even his own family. After that he will come here personally for a visit and we will discuss the details of the matter. I didn't get into the details because I didn't know what you would want.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't say anything for a few minutes and thought about the whole matter. “Can you give me some time to investigate things on my own?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “I have sent some people to investigate too. You can do the same if you want to. Such a huge matter will take some time to be finalised. Alright, you go and rest today. I heard the harvest of your crops is tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't say anything and just nodded, several thoughts in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching my room, I lay down on my bed and decided on a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>While the opportunity to integrate the Land of Stairs within our Land of Flowers was too good, it was exactly this reason which made me hesitate.</p><p><br></p><p>It seemed to be too good to be true.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just what are these people thinking? Let's find out.”</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned my Grimiore.</p><p><br></p><p>“Search Daimyo of the Land of Stairs, Shinouske Yasutora.”</p><p><br></p><p>An estimated time appeared in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks….</p><p><br></p><p>Normally the Grimoire could search information about people depending on how strong or important they were and how difficult it would be to get information about them normally.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, he might be the Daimyo of a small country but he was still a Daimyo. I should have expected at least this much.</p><p><br></p><p>Info about the likes of Kaguya or the information on how to achieve the Six Paths Sage Mode would take me years at my current level of strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, my searches are focused on Chakra Techniques and Jutsu both to get stronger and in preparation to train my own Shinobi one day. </p><p><br></p><p>I haven't been concentrating on people but it seems that I have to.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's see what kind of people the Stairs Daimyo and his family are.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kazuya is getting a hang of things.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Just in case someone hasn’t noticed it already and starts bombing me in the comments about different plots about the anime or movies, Kazuya doesn’t have perfect and complete knowledge of the anime and doesn’t even know about the movies.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I haven’t thought about the Boruto plot but it most likely won’t include those.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

Not that I had been able to sleep properly.</p><p><br></p><p>Three days.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been three days since I gained the memories of my past life and to think this messed up world of mine would be even crazier than I had imagined.</p><p><br></p><p>As much as I enjoyed watching the anime in my previous life, the reality of this world was just that dire.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another knock on the door and this time there was a voice following it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Highness, it’s time for your breakfast. Please get up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are awake.” I replied back, causing the knocks to stop while I got up from my bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Your Highness.</p><p><br></p><p>Three Days ago this was normal for me and yet with this new set of memories, everything seems so strange all of a sudden, as if this world I had lived in all this time had become unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>My name is Kazuya Katsuyoshi, the Prince of the Land of Flowers and the next in line for the position of the Daimyo of the Land.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, many would think such a position was enviable….but it was anything but that.</p><p><br></p><p>The Land of Flowers was not a big country like the Land of Fire or our neighbours, Land of Earth. It was a relatively smaller country between the Land of Earth and separated from the Land of Rain and Land of Wind by the Land of Medicine and Land of Fire by the Land of Stairs.</p><p><br></p><p>Although it was a small country, the land was very fertile. Most of the people here were involved in agriculture and had plentiful harvests every year.</p><p><br></p><p>This fertility however was both the boon and curse of the land.</p><p><br></p><p>Our immediate neighbours, the Land of Earth, had barren and rocky land which was unsuitable for agriculture. This made them the biggest buyers of our food products to feed their people.</p><p><br></p><p>But the relationship between us is….like feeding a wild animal to keep it at bay. One day, the animal might have a change of heart and just swallow us up.</p><p><br></p><p>It would not even be the first time either.</p><p><br></p><p>Last time, almost nine years ago, there was a very bad winter and their crops were destroyed so they invaded us, in an attempt to usurp our country.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the timely aid of the Land of Lightning who wanted to prevent the Earth from getting this fertile country and becoming stronger that saved us from being eradicated, although not unscathed.</p><p><br></p><p>The war took away large parts of our land as well as the life of the then Daimyo of the country, my father in this life, Lord Kiyoshi Katsuyoshi.</p><p><br></p><p>After this, my grandfather had come back as the Daimyo to rule again.</p><p><br></p><p>My mother had passed away giving birth to me while the concubines father had taken, did not have any children.</p><p><br></p><p>I was the only and eldest child of the family so while other royal families are fretting about the throne, I didn’t have such <a href=\"https://worries….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">worries….at</a> least from my family.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobles….they were not trustworthy.</p><p><br></p><p>My grandpa adored me though, always doing everything to fulfil my wishes since I can remember. He personally oversaw everything I was taught and he even brought me with himself to the court sometimes to teach me how to manage the land.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….if only things were that simple.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and freshened up.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, I would be assisted by some maid in this but ever since I awakened my memories, I kept them at a distance, fearing that I might slip somewhere and reveal something about myself.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I had almost given up hope after recovering the memories of this world…. Almost being the key word here.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my hand and a book appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a hardbound book with crimson red velvet cover and gold and black metal designs on the edges, giving it a more ancient and magical feel.</p><p><br></p><p>The book’s presence gave off power which calmed me down even in this dire world.</p><p><br></p><p>The Akashic Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>I did not remember how or when I got this power but only what it was.</p><p><br></p><p>The Essence of the Akashic Grimoire gave me this book which basically provided me with several functions.</p><p><br></p><p>First was knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>I could assign this book to search for any knowledge, be it Jutsu or Magic or even information on any person and it would do so in a certain period of time. The time depended on the rarity of the knowledge and the strength and secrecy of the person, basically the difficulty to obtain the information. I could then read this knowledge or have the basic form of this knowledge be imprinted on my mind after which I had to practise and gain further mastery over the Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>However the information was limited to the world I was in.</p><p><br></p><p>Second was power.</p><p><br></p><p>It contains rituals which could help me increase the power of my mind, body and soul and even grant me abilities. There were even ways to break my limits in ways unimaginable in many worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Basic rituals were easy to do but the cost would increase the stronger I got as it’s harder to change stronger beings and thus more materials would be required.</p><p><br></p><p>These rituals were however only for myself. For others, I would have to study and devise them myself. The Grimoire can only help with that.</p><p><br></p><p>Third was the world travel function.</p><p><br></p><p>I could, at great cost of energy, travel to other worlds or even open permanent gates to other worlds. These gates however will create bridges between the two worlds which can then be used without my permission, one of the reasons I was not going to do that.</p><p><br></p><p>This world was messed up as it is. I did not need to add other things to fuck it up even more.</p><p><br></p><p>On second thought, if all else fails, I could perhaps make a bridge to the Warhammer 40k world or some other death world and fuck off to a third, unrelated world myself.</p><p><br></p><p>It will serve my enemies well if they force me into a corner.</p><p><br></p><p>Only for the purpose of World Travel, the Grimoire could even gather and store energy on its own. Although it would take a year or so to do it by itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Fourth was Summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>At the cost of my energy, I could summon any items or people from different worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>At the start, I could only be vague about the summons. The more precise I am, the greater the energy needed. Similarly, the stronger or rarer the thing, the stronger I needed to be</p><p><br></p><p>They can be summoned from anywhere, even the destroyed world timelines.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything with a level of intelligence from simple animals or basic magical constructs to sapient artifacts or people is unable to harm me intentionally or unintentionally by lack of control or instability instead simply becoming inert or subdued enough until I am safely beyond the range of effect. They cannot disobey or subvert any commands I give them. I may also layer commands or set triggers for certain commands to take effect. The Grimoire will not summon items hazardous to me unless expressly told to. The items I summon which need conditions being fulfilled, like me being worthy of them, will automatically work for me or those I give them to.</p><p><br></p><p>I could however bypass the energy requirements by using rituals and using outside sources of energy to summon things or even make rituals which would collect the energy from the surroundings for the summonings but those would be painfully long.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least.</p><p><br></p><p>The Grimoire contains a pocket dimension where I can store the items under stasis. I could even hide there myself with triggers to let me out at a certain time.</p><p><br></p><p>The book can provide me an accurate knowledge of the items I store inside, including their actual History and their notable traits.</p><p><br></p><p>There were many details about these powers that I have to understand and other powers of the Grimoire will be revealed as I explore it more.</p><p><br></p><p>All these abilities will be strengthened depending on my own strength, so all in all, I was the weakest link of this power.</p><p><br></p><p>This was especially so in a world like this where ninjas are ever present to take advantage of the slightest lapse in one's attention.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially in countries like the Land of Flowers, where there was no Shinobi village. The most we had were a few hundred samurai who managed the security of the entire country.</p><p><br></p><p>We were totally dependent on other Shinobi villages for protection.</p><p><br></p><p>This was something which needed to be changed and this change has to start from me first.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked outside my room where the maid was waiting for me. I recognised her as my grandfather's maid.</p><p><br></p><p>“His Majesty is waiting for you in his room for breakfast.” She said with a bow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well.” l replied and began walking towards my grandfather's room.</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching the room, the maid slowly opened the gates and I saw the man sitting in front of the table.</p><p><br></p><p>My grandfather, Lord Kazuki Katsuyoshi, was sixty eight years old this year. The white hair and moustache gave him a very wise and dignified feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling was however dispersed as soon as he saw me.</p><p><br></p><p>A goofy smile appeared on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come and have a seat, Kazu-kun. The soup tastes best when it is hot.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mira was saying that you have been staying most of the last three days in your room. Is everything alright?” He asked, between his bites.</p><p><br></p><p>I paused for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last three days, I had thought of the excuses for my absence as I already knew that grandpa always kept tabs on what I was doing to protect me. This was especially after the death of my father and me being the only heir of the Land of Flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you know, I went outside the capital a week ago.” I started and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard that the Second Ninja War had started a few months ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It is unfortunate but sadly there is nothing we can do about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I saw how our people were suffering. In the Flower Capital, it might not be that apparent but outside, our people, the finest farmers of all lands, are finding it difficult to buy food and this is just the start. Over time this problem will only increase. Will our people have to beg….why do we have to suffer even when we are not participating in these wars? Our people have barely recovered from the attacks of Iwagakura and the loss of our lands and now this. We honestly work all our lives, do we not deserve peace and safety too?”</p><p><br></p><p>These were not just excuses.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa would catch lies from me immediately. The man had almost brought me up all my life.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why the best way to divert the topic is to mix my real feelings with something else. The condition of my people was something which actually pained me to witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa let out a sigh at my words.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is a saying Kazu-kun. When Elephants fight, it’s the grass that suffers. The Ninja War is between the five Great Shinobi Villages, and most importantly, the Daimyos behind them, the elephants of this land and we are the grass. We do not have enough power to resist their might. If we attract attention, we might get stomped to the ground and be erased. The best we can hope for is this troubled time to pass as quickly as possible so that we can focus on rebuilding.”</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my fists at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>Logically, I knew that the words he spoke were the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>There was nothing cowardly about his words, just cold hard facts.</p><p><br></p><p>If we do resist, we will just get wiped out and then the damage to our land and people would be far more than now.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire population of the Land of Flowers is not as much as the combined forces of all these five Hidden Villages so there is nothing we can do.</p><p><br></p><p>From my future knowledge, I knew that the Land of Whirlpools would suffer the end due to becoming too strong and becoming a threat in the eyes of the major villages.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Konoha did not lift a finger to stop them. Officially they would be stopped by their enemies, unofficially, it is because of the Daimyos.</p><p><br></p><p>Those five are connected to each other through marriages and interests.</p><p><br></p><p>They can fight each other, start wars for petty reasons but they will not let each other collapse for their shared interests.</p><p><br></p><p>For people like them, who never step out of their capitals, the whole world is similar to their capitals.</p><p><br></p><p>They have never seen the horrors of wars. In fact, for them, wars just fuel their businesses so they start it every decade or so.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s an endless cycle….and something which I wish to break.</p><p><br></p><p>“You do not look like you want to accept the answer, Kazu-kun. What are your thoughts about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do we not train our own people? At least enough to protect our own place more?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have our Samurai and training more people requires better resources, medicines, techniques and equipment all of which we lack. While we are protected by our shaky alliance with the Land of Lightning, it is by no means a friendship. It is just a way for them to deny their enemy of a valuable resource which are our fertile lands. We also have to give them tributes for a decade for the help they offered us, two years are still left of that. It is causing another drain on our income. Tell me, with all this, how can we afford to train our people?” He asked calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa’s method of teaching in such situations is to give me the problem and ask me to find a solution. He would then poke holes in my solution unless he could not anymore and only then he was satisfied with my answer.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, if he gave me the answers directly, I would never learn to think for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>We, the Daimyo, need our ability to make decisions just as much as a Kage needs strength and jutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>He was correct.</p><p><br></p><p>To begin anything, we would first need money.</p><p><br></p><p>And how do we get money?</p><p><br></p><p>It cannot be something extremely new or people wouldn’t easily shift towards that. We need to do something new within the expertise of our people.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing which our people are good at is agriculture. This was something even I was trained in. Grandpa did this to make me understand the life source of our people. </p><p><br></p><p>The thing I remember is that they still use primitive methods of agriculture and the produce was good mainly because of the quality of land.</p><p><br></p><p>If I could use modern agricultural methods ….then I could probably increase the production of our crops by several times.</p><p><br></p><p>It would not only help us survive the Second Shinobi War more comfortably but also give us the much needed funds.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure, I could summon gold too or precious gems but selling many of those could attract the attention of dangerous people and during such troubled times, attention was the last thing we needed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up at Grandpa resolutely. “I have a plan but I need your help.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow. “Convince me to help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and began relaying my plan to him.</p><p><br></p><p>That day, Grandpa postponed his meetings with other nobles and stayed with me for the rest of the morning, discussing everything about my plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazu-kun, I am thoroughly impressed with your plans and convictions for the betterment of our people. I am proud to have a successor like you. I will grant you the command over our personal lands for the next planting season to test your experiments. If we get good results, we will expand the method to the rest of our country.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not disappoint you, Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, is there anything else you need?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….need three Ninja Prisoners. I heard we have a few of them in our cells.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked surprised at my request so I continued. “Going forward, I will have to make decisions which could bring and will bring deaths, either of our people or of our enemies. I want to experience blood so that I don’t lack the resolve at that time. I don’t want to be like the Daimyos of those five Great Nations who don’t know what war and blood feels like.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me seriously and nodded. “Very well. I will grant your request.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about some normal topics and he left for work after that while I went back to my room.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally had a direction and a goal. Now I need to work hard to achieve said goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching my room, I locked it and searched for the ritual to make me stronger first.</p><p><br></p><p>The ingredients for the first ritual were quite simple.</p><p><br></p><p>Just some energy and blood.</p><p><br></p><p>This blood could belong to animals or even humans.</p><p><br></p><p>I copied the list of ingredients I would need for the following rituals and then I tried something else.</p><p><br></p><p>Summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Normal unenhanced humans could also summon things at the cost of their stamina although those things will also have to be normal stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed my hand on the Grimoire and imagined what I wanted to summon, all the details, every specification.</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment, a flash of light burst in the room and I felt an intense burst of weakness fill me as I fell to my knees.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, there was an item placed in front of me, I felt joy.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly opening the pouch, I saw grains of rice. To be precise, a genetically engineered variety of rice which gives a higher yield than normal rice in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>These seeds were called Miracle Seeds in my previous world with several times the increase in production of crops in limited areas paired with suitable methods of growth.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to summon more but I really didn’t have energy for it.</p><p><br></p><p>I really needed to get the ritual done first.</p><p><br></p><p>With this in mind, I forced myself to get up and left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The maid outside bowed as soon as I came out.</p><p><br></p><p>“His Majesty has asked me to inform you that your request for prisoners has been granted. You can ask Kensho-sama to assist you whenever you wish to do so.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kensho was the Samurai assigned to me when I left the palace. His only duty was to protect me. He had a dozen other Samurai under him but he was the strongest among the group.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa had hired him from the Land of Iron and said that his strength was comparable to a Chunin Ninja.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very Well. Clean the cellar for me. I want it devoid of everything except the lights, a bed, a table and a chair. And get these ingredients for me. Inform me when you are done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.” She bowed and took the paper and left while I came back to my room to rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhaustion from the summoning was really getting to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now my chakra reserves were lower than an academy student’s which was really not enough. I needed to get stronger first before I could do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was awakened from my sleep by a knock on my door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything has been arranged, your highness.” Mira's voice came from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and left the room, eager for the next part.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I got out of the room, she bowed to me. “Everything has been arranged as per your orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. Please empty the area around the Cellar. I want complete privacy while I am working. I don’t want to be disturbed unless it’s an emergency or an urgent order from Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, I entered the Cellar and locked the door.</p><p><br></p><p>In the future, I would need to use Sealing Jutsu and Barrier Jutsu to guard this place if I am conducting experiments here.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, maybe not doing it in the palace is the best idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, this place was the safest for me for now.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, as instructed everything was placed on the table, one of them being the blood of a chicken.</p><p><br></p><p>For the ritual, I needed to make a circle.</p><p><br></p><p>I used a chalk to draw the outline for it first and then used the blood to draw over it, forming the ritual circle finally.</p><p><br></p><p>Standing in the middle of the ritual circle, I summoned the Grimoire and placed my hands on it and chanted.</p><p><br></p><p>The circle lit up and I felt a warm surge of energy in my body at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>I could feel my muscles stretch and skin tighten as my bones crackled with power.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally after what seemed like forever and yet was barely a minute, the light of the circle faded.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my hand and clenched my fist before going towards the table and punching at the wooden post nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>The punch left a fist mark on the post.</p><p><br></p><p>This much from just some chicken’s blood?</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how strong I was in terms of this world but I was surely far beyond my previous self.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, the surroundings in the cellar now seemed clearer to me and I could even smell the smell of chicken blood which I couldn’t do earlier.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest gain however was not the physical strength but the energy I could feel flowing through me.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly summoned my Grimoire and searched for the best basic methods of meditating to control chakra and exercises they taught in the ninja world and had them imprinted into my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The knowledge flowed flawlessly into my mind and I decided to give it a try.</p><p><br></p><p>Picking up a leaf from the potted plant nearby, I kept it on my head and tried to focus on it. An energy flowed through my body, reaching my head and grabbing or rather sticking on to the leaf. It stayed there for a few more seconds before it fell.</p><p><br></p><p>I will need to practise more.</p><p><br></p><p>I imprinted some more knowledge onto my head like Swordsmanship, throwing weapons, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>Before doing other enhancement rituals, I decided to get used to my strength first. It would be harder to control my strength if I did multiple rituals in succession right now.</p><p><br></p><p>The ingredients for the second ritual were also here while the ingredients for the third ritual would need three Shinobi lives, Genin level and thus the request to Grandpa.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, I cleaned everything up in the Cellar, stored the ingredients in my Grimoire and left.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Over the night, I summoned several things, mainly genetically engineered seeds of different crops as well as a bit of gold and precious minerals.</p><p><br></p><p>The increase in my strength was apparent as what had me exhausted after just one summon, could now be summoned several times before I needed to sleep it off.</p><p><br></p><p>The current time was the start of the second great Shinobi War. If I remembered things correctly, the Uzumaki Village and the Land of Whirlpools were destroyed at the end of the second War.</p><p><br></p><p>Our Land doesn’t have any ninja villages and while getting Uzumakis to shift here is out of the question, we could still get some of the bloodline to introduce to my people.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of that would be a thing for later.</p><p><br></p><p>First things first, I needed to deal with the task at hand and that’s exactly where I was going today.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa worked fast. He had already allocated the lands under me, a large amount of land too, which showed his trust in me as well as several dozen people to work with.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright everyone, gather up around in groups of twelve. There will be eight groups here. Each in charge of one plot of land. Before I start this, let me tell you all, that the one who grows the most crops at the end of this will get a reward from me personally.” Their faces brightened at the mention of the reward. “However, do remember, you can only work honestly on your own land and not interfere with others in any way. If I discover that, I will have to punish the ones involved.” And those faces paled all at once.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained the steps to them one by one. I explained to them the Modern Rice Cultivation Method as well as several ways to make organic fertilisers.</p><p><br></p><p>Then a suitable group of crops were selected for the crop rotation method of cultivation.</p><p><br></p><p>“These methods require a lot of hard work, that I understand but tell me this….when has anything worth high rewards been easy? I will regularly inspect the fields and check on everyone so keep working hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Highness!”</p><p><br></p><p>After giving them some more instructions, I left the fields to return to the palace.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure these methods will work, Your Highness?” Kensho asked as we were returning back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you doubt my decisions, Kensho?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I dare not.” he bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to have some questions, Kensho. Go on, I will answer them for you.” I said, waving at him.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked surprised but spoke nonetheless “This….new method of plantation, if it fails, the Land and the Daimyo’s house will be facing a large loss. Is it wise to do such experiments in times like these, with a war going on between the major nations? Our people are already in trouble as it is. Shouldn’t you play safe first?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Desperate times need desperate measures. As you said, the war has just started. Right now, we have the time to experiment for one season. While I am absolutely sure that this method will work, if it doesn’t, there wouldn’t be any problems either as we could just revert to the previous method the next season before the war intensifies. Moreover, when I took this responsibility from his Majesty, I used my own savings as a collateral in case the crops failed. If anything happens, the one suffering the loss will only be me. The labourers will be paid as they were promised. Does that answer your question?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and looked at me seriously and then spoke again. “May I ask one more question?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Why are you doing all this? Why risk yourself a loss for all this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man as if he was an idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Before I answer your question, could you answer one of mine?” I asked and he nodded so I continued. “You are a samurai sworn to protect me. You would gladly lay down your life for this cause, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “Without hesitation”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Why would you put all your life’s work, training and everything you are for something like that? Why would you risk your life for me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is my duty.” He answered solemnly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. As the Prince of this country and the next in line for the position of its ruler, it is my duty to do whatever I can for the people of this land. Does that answer your question?”</p><p><br></p><p>He bowed deeply. “Yes, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>We walked after that in peace before I spoke, breaking the silence again. “Kensho, I am thinking of continuing my swordsmanship lessons. Would you help me out?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would be honoured, Your Highness.” He said happily.</p><p><br></p><p>He used to teach me Swordsmanship as a kid but I gave it up.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobles, the Daimyo especially, rarely ever took lessons in Martial Arts. They never needed to.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then let’s begin tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuki Katsuyoshi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Report.” He said and Kensho kneeled in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“His Highness was not under any genjutsu nor was he any impersonator. I was able to enter his room and verify it while he was sleeping. It seems that whatever His Highness has seen outside the capital has had a great impact on him and caused this change in him.” Kensho reported.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>Kazuya was the last of his bloodline, his only remaining family alive. He would never forgive himself if he were to lose him.</p><p><br></p><p>If it were some imposter or someone trying to control him, he would have done anything and everything in his power to ruin that <a href=\"https://person….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">person….no</a> matter who. Even if it were those big ones, he would at least take a pound of their flesh to the grave with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, it seems to not be the case.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think of his actions, Kensho?”</p><p><br></p><p>“While I cannot speak of the veracity of his claims, one thing I can say for sure is that His Highness has his mind in the right direction. He seems to genuinely care for his people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So did his father. He will need more than that to survive in this world. Did he ask you about the prisoners?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not yet. He did ask me to resume his swordsmanship lessons though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. You have my permission to do so. As long as he doesn’t do anything harmful to himself, let him do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You may leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man left the room and closed the door behind him, finally giving Kazuki to let out a sigh and look at the picture on the wall. “You son is growing up, Kazuma. You would have been so proud to see him like this.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My sword clashed with Kensho’s and while he diverted my attack with practised ease, I took a step forward and launched another attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Our blades clashed one after another, sending sparks flying everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>After several minutes of fighting, he finally took a step forward and pushed me back and before I could stabilise, I had a sword in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have become a lot stronger than you were before, Your Highness. I believe you might have talent in swordsmanship.” Kensho said while sheathing his katana back into his scabbard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your lessons.” I did the same and bowed to him.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, the manners of a prince were trained into my bones so even the memories I had gained of my previous life could only do so much.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where would you put my strength at?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He thought for a second before replying. “A trainee samurai or a Shinobi Academy Student in terms of physical powers and a little less in terms of the sword. But considering the fact that you haven’t trained for the last few years, it’s still a great achievement. They have to train for years to get to this power. Compared to them, you can only be called blessed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>So this was just Academy Student level strength.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems I have to do the other rituals sooner.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kensho, I have a task for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want you to send some people to find children for me. Between the ages of seven to twelve. Preferably orphans, or those who don’t have any other way of survival. The better the talent, the better for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t even blink an eye and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>This type of thing was not uncommon in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>All forces took in children, especially war orphans and trained them into their forces. Although only a few went as bad as Danzo and his kind.</p><p><br></p><p>Samurai were far more honourable than Shinobi in this matter.</p><p><br></p><p>They trained the children and gave them education. When they grow up, they could serve for a set period in the army and then either leave or continue.</p><p><br></p><p>Even their treatment was far better than Shinobi, although the catch was that they earned less money.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to increase the power of my country to at least face the dangers of some crazy stray shinobi coming in and destroying my country on a whim.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember Orochimaru had conquered an entire country on his own and Sasori had destroyed one.</p><p><br></p><p>My country was not even strong enough to resist a couple of Elite Jounin, let alone a Kage level.</p><p><br></p><p>Even summoning could only let me summon so many people, not to mention, new people suddenly popping up would be found out and we would be under suspicion when that happens later.</p><p><br></p><p>The best way is to train some kids from a young age.</p><p><br></p><p>I could keep the loyal ones and enhance them with some rituals, teach them some techniques to make a small force to manage peace in the country by the time I start ruling.</p><p><br></p><p>As for actual deterrent, those can only be Kage Levels and above.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a long way to go until then.</p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks had passed since I had introduced the new farming methods and began my swordsmanship training.</p><p><br></p><p>While the first ritual increased my strength and physical attributes. It did nothing for my talents. I needed to do something about my mind and soul next.</p><p><br></p><p>I had gathered several materials in these two weeks for the rituals.</p><p><br></p><p>My plan is to complete all the rituals I can and then start summoning help.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaving Kensho to his work, I went back to the Cellar, which I was slowly modifying as my lab.</p><p><br></p><p>The place had changed over the last two weeks.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the place had cupboards lining the walls, each filled with different types of ingredients. The place looked like a witch’s hideout or a magician’s tower, not that it was much different.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side of the room however, things changed.</p><p><br></p><p>They contained books.</p><p><br></p><p>Books on Geography, History and several other subjects.</p><p><br></p><p>On the wall was a big map of the Elemental Nations with as much detail as was possible.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for me to plan my moves.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however, I had another purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>I began preparing for the next ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>This one would increase the power of my mind, and make me smarter overall.</p><p><br></p><p>Drawing the Magic Circle was easy. It was more complicated than the last time but still nothing. After everything was done, I placed the required items in different parts of the circle and sat in the middle and began chanting.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual took a few minutes to start but when it did, the Magic Circle lit up again and this time I could feel the energy from those items crawl up to me and enter my body.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the last time where my whole body felt warm from inside, this time, I felt sleepy.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind was both getting clearer and hazy at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I realised, I had collapsed in the room.</p><p><br><br><br></p><p>I woke up five hours later and found myself laying on the floor of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost time for dinner so I went back to my room and got cleaned up. I would do the next ritual for the empowerment of the soul at night.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa was waiting for me in his room.</p><p><br></p><p>I greeted him as I sat in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is your work going?” He asked between bites.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good for now. The people are picking up new things well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard that you have asked for children to train as your retinue?</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I wanted to increase the number of people under me as well as in our country to help with the security of the country. Our produce is going to be higher. This will obviously attract the eyes of others. We need to start preparing for these things starting now or it will be too late.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow. “Are you really that confident that your method will work?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Absolutely.” I nodded. “Moreover, some of the seeds I have purchased are of a new variety of rice. I heard from the trader that this variety of rice was only found on a different continent. It will be a novelty for the people of other countries.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get swindled?” He asked, suspiciously making my lips twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa, is there a variety of rice on the continent that I don’t know? Didn’t you personally make sure of that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….well I did. So, what’s special about this one?”</p><p><br></p><p>Long grain rice was mainly found in the South Asian countries in my old world. They were however not found anywhere in this one.</p><p><br></p><p>I had planted those in one part of the field and wanted to see how they were received by the people of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am also working on some fertiliser formulas to help grow better crops.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. As long as you know what you are doing. I am looking forward to tasting the rice grown by you.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave him a smile in return.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you need any help from me?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” I wanted to ask for a Shinobi to teach my people but stopped myself.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, any shinobi we hire will be a spy so it’s better to avoid them.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. It’s fine. I will ask you if I need anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conversation then shifted to normal things and I left after an hour.</p><p><br></p><p>I went straight to prepare for the night’s ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>This ritual required several eggs.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Eggs.</p><p><br></p><p>Fertilised Eggs of Birds were required to be sacrificed, a total of seven of them, each one from a different species.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it was normally hard to tell if an egg was fertilised or not but that problem was solved when I stored them in my Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>I got all the information about them.</p><p><br></p><p>So selecting the eggs was quite easy.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual had some requirements like it had to be after the sun sets and in a room with no natural light.</p><p><br></p><p>My Cellar provided me with such an environment easily.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ritual Circle for the Soul Empowerment Ritual was far more complicated than Body and Mind Empowerment ones.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, soul was a very complicated thing too.</p><p><br></p><p>After the preparations were completed, I checked everything twice.</p><p><br></p><p>The last step was placing the eggs in their places and sitting in the middle and activating the circle with Chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, the reaction was instantaneous.</p><p><br></p><p>The ritual circle lit up and almost immediately, I felt myself lose consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>My last thoughts before losing consciousness was being glad that I had the whole night to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two months had passed since I did the soul ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing that I noticed right after the ritual was the increase in my chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>My chakra capacity had more than doubled with the ritual. Sure it was nothing, merely Genin level and my strength was probably lower than that, but it was obtained without any training and instantly too.</p><p><br></p><p>Normal children had to train for several years to get to this level.</p><p><br></p><p>This Grimoire is extremely broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Other than this, the increase to my mind’s power was also visible. I could think faster, make calculations faster, understand things better and even remember things more easily.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to get used to my increased powers. Sometimes things could be disorienting due to my increased capacity because the body was not used to its new powers.</p><p><br></p><p>A month of training with Kensho brought me back to my usual control.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason I was waiting until now was because I was trying to learn chakra control. First, learning it when I have lower amounts of chakra is easier and second, I needed to learn some technique to mask my chakra because even Kensho was able to feel my increased Chakra later.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t allow this to be found out by some other Ninja Villages or I would be kidnapped and the whole Land of Flowers would be doomed.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the first thing I did was have the Grimoire search for the Chakra Suppression Technique and imprint the basic level in my mind while I practised it. I would do the rituals when I have a decent mastery of the technique.</p><p><br></p><p>Using more chakra also increased my reserves. I had mastered the meditation technique taught in the Ninja Villages and was now on to the Leaf Sticking Technique.</p><p><br></p><p>The second round of rituals needed to be done on certain days so I took the opportunity to collect materials for them as well as research how to use these rituals for others as well as what other kinds of rituals are there.</p><p><br></p><p>What I found out was that the book had almost everything in terms of rituals. From taking possession of someone’s body to gaining someone’s powers, even innate ones like Kekkei Genkai. There were also ones on increasing one’s charm to modifying one’s body and several different aspects.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning on increasing my charm as it was something useful for a leader.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, there were rituals to simply increase chakra reserves as well as the density of chakra, get affinity for Senjutsu, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>If I got a decade to develop, I was sure I could make a village comparable to one of the five Great Shinobi Villages.</p><p><br></p><p>Several things have happened in these two months. First, in these two months, the crops which they had planted have started growing. Second, the news about the Second Great Shinobi War has increased.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire war was started due to economic disparities between nations. They were pushing forward to expand in every direction and this was not just between the five major nations but also Ame.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite this being a war between the Five Great Nations, none of it was actually fought on the land of the five. It was all fought on the lands of the smaller nations, leaving them devastated. Over time, they could easily be captured or parts of these lands taken away as ‘protection fees’ by the big five.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever happens, whether we fight or not, we lose.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the reality of being weak. The ones who suffer the most from it are the nations who share the borders with two or more Great Nations directly like Rain, Grass and Waterfall.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were progressing quicker than I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>On the plus side, Kensho brought over a hundred children who were orphaned in the war. This was only the first batch as I wasn’t allowed more than them by Grandpa at this point. He said that if I wanted to increase the forces more, I would have to pay for them myself. The most he will help me is give the land he had offered me before.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have to think of a new avenue of income.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://Sigh….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sigh….it</a> would have been so easy if it were peace time right now.</p><p><br></p><p>The medicine and food Industry could have flourished so easily but now, while the prices of these things were greater, possessing them with no strength to protect them was a sin.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head concentrating on the work at hand first.</p><p><br></p><p>The kids had been given homes in a building which was built just for them. They had several caretakers, staying there.</p><p><br></p><p>I would need to get teachers for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenshou alone was not enough as he was always guarding me and the rest of the Samurai, except those who protected Grandpa directly….were just too weak.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I need to hurry up and do the summonings.</p><p><br></p><p>I had another place created outside the palace for my experiments and rituals. This place was surrounded by high walls.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason I did this was so that I could do rituals which needed me to be outdoors.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, I reached there and entered the room. After checking that no one was spying, I summoned my Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>It was my first experiment in summoning a living being so it’s better to summon someone relatively weaker at first.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see what I can summon with mid genin level reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>To try things out, I need to be as vague as possible to keep the energy costs lower.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm?</p><p><br>What do I want right now?</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I need someone to protect me, a sword user with great potential maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and placed a hand on my Grimoire and focused on this thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Bring someone who would otherwise die to serve as my retainer.</p><p><br></p><p>My chakra was syphoned quickly and I felt exhausted suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, I have regularly been using my chakra to summon stuff but I never felt this exhausted. Was summoning living beings this hard?</p><p><br></p><p>I fell to my knees when the summoning was completed and in front of me stood a young girl. She looked even younger than me, around twelve or so years old.</p><p><br></p><p>She had short blue hair and black eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked at me in surprise as I forced myself to get up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Kazuya Katsuyoshi. Could you please introduce yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….my name is….Kuina Shimotsuki.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Wow.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What can I say, my muse kicked in and here is the first chapter of the new story.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I wanted to try something in a different world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Naruto seemed interesting as I was planning to write a Daimyo MC for a long time.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As a result of this, this story began.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The first chapter is just an introductory chapter, a simple explanation of the basic situation of the MC and the workings of his power.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In the coming chapters, we will see his challenges and how he makes plans to deal with these challenges.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: This will be a relatively slow story so don't expect kicking Madara and conquering the word in 5 chapters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Isekai Restaurant</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 13: New Guests</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Two orders of Chicken Fried Rice is up.” I said as I handed the plates to Tohru who carried them to the tables.</p><p><br></p><p>“Five servings of karage for Ainz-sama.” Shuna came in with the new orders as soon as Tohru left. Lavinia was taking care of cleaning the tables while Sakura was helping her.</p><p><br></p><p> With enough waitresses things were running smoothly in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the weakest link now was the speed of cooking?</p><p><br></p><p>There was only so much I could do alone, especially with no help.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should look for some other good chefs to help me out in the kitchen?</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, where would I find people who would be skilled enough to cook these levels of dishes? The ingredients I was working on were extremely difficult to work with. I mean except for the mysterious Mathias’ Farm, I didn’t even know anything about where and how these crops came from.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking this, the door to the Restaurant opened and an old man came in.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked like a frail hunched old man. He had a pompadour hairstyle as well as a goatee. “A restaurant? I don’t remember one being here. Did you open this recently?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This place has been running for several months now.” Sakura went and greeted the old man. “Please take a seat. Is there something I can get for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Yes, since I am here I don’t see why not. A drink of sake would be wonderful, unfortunately I have nothing to pay you with.” He said, scratching his head, looking embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked like a goofy old man and I don't know why I found him funny. \"In that case, the first meal can be on the house.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A simple bottle of alcohol wouldn't cause anything.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha thank you so much. I really owe you for this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She took him to the table where the old martial arts masters were already sitting and they readily made a room for him.</p><p><br></p><p>I remodelled the place after the paperwork for Tobio’s old house was transferred to my name. The first thing was to add more rooms as Shuna was staying with Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, that was hardly a problem for her as most of the time Lavy entered my room at night so Shuna had the room to herself.</p><p><br></p><p>And boy was it a surprise for Shuna.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had been just as confused as me the first time she found out about the whole setup. In fact, the poor girl even tried to use something as useless as common sense against Lavinia. She however soon realised the futility of the whole thing and just accepted it.</p><p><br></p><p>The situation also reassured me that I was not the crazy one here. Sakura just had an incredible tolerance for craziness.</p><p><br></p><p>And while going through all this, I decided to remodel the Restaurant. The first thing I did was to construct separate areas for drinking, as many children often visited the Restaurant. It was better to separate the areas.</p><p><br></p><p>I even made private rooms for those who wanted some privacy.</p><p><br></p><p>It also helped that Rimuru, Ainz and the rest had a space for themselves now and could indulge in their activities while no one was suddenly scared of noticing Ainz’s skeletal face on entering the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid joined them sometimes too.</p><p><br></p><p>I think he and Ainz got along a bit too well.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had sent his Dwarves to make the place and even the interiors. Those dwarves worked extremely fast and their work was high quality too so in just a week, the entire place had a completely new makeover.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz had several great pieces of furniture and sent them over to furnish the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this furniture wouldn’t look out of place from a royal palace.</p><p><br></p><p>I seriously need to visit Ainz’s place some day.</p><p><br></p><p>When I wanted to repay them back, they didn’t take money.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dwarves took alcohol while Ainz just gave me a list of several manga and games to order from my world.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, whatever he liked. I went shopping that day and bought anything and everything I could get my hands on.</p><p><br></p><p>I had bought the entire collection of all the top selling mangas and light novels with me and they were currently going through that. I think I heard that they were planning to do a marathon of some kind recently.</p><p><br></p><p>Finishing the last order, I took a bottle of some sake and went to the table to serve the new guest myself.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked like the group had already explained the ability to him and to his credit, the guy, while curious, didn’t look too surprised or amazed either.</p><p><br></p><p>I had observed very few people could see my Restaurant and came to the conclusion that they must be something special or at least they were someone who were approved by the System or passed some criteria. Since I didn’t know what criteria that was, I made it a point to always pay respects to everyone who entered the Restaurant as long as they behaved properly.</p><p><br></p><p>I even made it a point to talk with any new guest in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like now.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man looked very happy to receive the sake and I placed a plate of snacks on the side. “On the house.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha thank you. You are a very good man, Owner-san. I will never forget this gratitude.” He said, extremely sincerely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please enjoy the food.” I then looked at the rest of the people on the table. “Can I get something else for you all?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, we have had enough for today.” Hayato-san shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how is that child, Ikki Kurogane doing, Silas?” Bang-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ikki-kun? I haven’t seen him but Kisuke-san comes here often and even takes food for him. From what I have heard, Kisuke-san’s methods are working on him so he might be doing well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I see. That’s good to hear. It’s very rare to see such determined young men.” He nodded his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. And how is your own Martial Arts training going? I heard you were out for some kind of training trip with your friends?” Issac-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. The trip was very enlightening. I learned a lot about my own powers and was able to fight against many different kinds of monsters with different kinds of abilities. It was a very educational experience. We even got a chance to fight a small war of sorts at the end.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A War?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. An army of orcs had attacked a village of ogres. Eight Hundred Ogres against over ten thousand Orcs being led by several extremely strong beings. We heard of this and decided to help out the ogres since the Orcs were invading the place Rimuru lived in.” I explained the whole situation to the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“It sounds like you had quite an adventure. Did you try Martial Arts against the Clown?” Hayato-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha I doubt I would be able to do so. That monster could take down a small country if left to rampage and it was a physical skill based monster. I doubt that a simple chef like me could take him on with only months of Martial Arts training.”</p><p><br>“Hmm? And who said that chefs can’t be strong Martial Arts Masters?” Surprisingly, it was Jirou-san who had spoken.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at him and he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“To catch better prey and to prepare truly great ingredients, a chef needs to possess incredible willpower, strength and skill. For example, the Tempura you made was from the Sake Salmon. While it is a fish with only a Capture Level 2 it's extremely difficult for a chef, even experienced ones, to keep the flavours locked when cooking it. You have managed to do something which I think only a hundred or so chefs around the world can do. Good job on that one. But for higher level ingredients, you will have to complete the process in a fraction of the time taken for this Tempura. For some dishes I know, it can be as low as a thousandth of a second. Without proper knowledge of Martial Arts, such a task is impossible.\"</p><p><br></p><p>It was the new old man who said this, attracting the glances from all the people around him.</p><p><br></p><p>But I was attracted to something else entirely. \"You know the name of the ingredient.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha I have eaten different types of food in my life.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas boy, is there something special about this dish?\" Issac-san asked, sensing my shock.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… get provided with any raw material I need by the restaurant itself when I pay the money but even I don't know where these food products come from. There were some extremely outrageous things in the list of ingredients. Ingredients costing billions. It's just that I have only been learning to cook for a year and a half so I don't want to waste those ingredients. I will try them when I get better.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Billions?\" Hayato asked, quite shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The things from the Dark Continent can go for that price.\" Isaac scratched his goatee.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You just get the ingredients in the shop? For money?\" The new old man asked, surprised for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>\"They are just kept in my refrigerator or my store room when I buy it. Oh, this restaurant is a bit special.\" I explained about the restaurant to the guy and after an initial shock, he listened to everything quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So you can buy anything you want for <em>money</em>?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Even GOD?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. There is one such ingredient.\" I answered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How much do I need to pay for it?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"This… I am sorry but I still can't cook it and this is a restaurant and not a butcher's shop. I am afraid selling raw ingredients is not allowed. I can sell only food cooked by myself.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He sat back and then shook his head with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>\"As I thought, it would never be so easy. I hope you get there soon, child. GOD is not something money can buy so you don't even realise how lucky you are.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The man went on to explain some things about his world. He worked as a Knocking Master. He was a hunter in his younger days. Just because of this, he got along well with Issac-san. He said that his name was Jiro.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we could talk anymore, the door to the Restaurant opened again and two people entered the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Wow, quite a few new people were coming to the Restaurant today.</p><p><br></p><p>One was an old man wearing a kimono and another was a girl with orange clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't know there was a restaurant near the school? Is this place new?\" He asked, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. Yes. What would you like to eat, Sir?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmph, as if this small place could serve food to satisfy us?\" The girl snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man sighed, \"Be respectful, Erina.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But grandfather…\"</p><p><br></p><p>He shut the girl up and looked at me. \"We will take whatever the chef recommends. Price is not an issue.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow at the price comment.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Alright.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I prepared a very simple dish. An Egg fried rice but with Strawberry Rice, edible Billion Bird Eggs and several other ingredients which would make the dish price at around five hundred thousand.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy said that price wasn't an issue. Let him think about it.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the girl, I made a bowl of udon noodles. The guy asked me for the chef's recommendation. The Chef recommends some humility for the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>The aroma of the dish was kept in the kitchen so they had no idea what I was making. I covered the dish and called for Lavy to serve the dish.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked over the counter to observe the reaction of the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia removed the covers and both their eyes glazed over.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why is my dish different?\" She asked, looking at her noodles.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's the Chef's recommendation for you.\" I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>My Restaurant served food to Emperors and Dragons. A little brat questioning my Restaurant's tastes cannot be left alone… no matter how cute the girl was.</p><p><br></p><p>She glared at me for a moment but still took a bit of the udon.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm ahhhh~\"</p><p><br></p><p>She started rubbing her thighs together and moaning, startling me all of a sudden as everyone looked weirdly at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I swear I didn't mix anything illegal into the dish.\" I quickly raised my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>What the hell?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she one of those scammers who will try to blackmail people after causing such scenes? Where are the cameras?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around the place in panic and then threw the girl a wary look.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man beside him didn't mind anything and instead laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha don't worry about it. This just means that Erina likes your cooking. Our family reacts differently to delicious food. Erina was blessed or rather cursed by an ability called the God's Tongue and she can perceive tastes to a very minute level. This makes her incredibly selective of what she eats. She doesn't mean to insult you.\" He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So this…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is how she reacts to the taste which she gets won over by.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He then took a bite of his own food and paused for a moment before his clothes burst out from his body and he went on for a minute long rant on the details of the dish. I didn't even think that much when I was cooking this. He stopped after a minute and then looked at me and I couldn't help but ask. \"So, these bursting clothes ability was yours?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Damn… that must suck. Everytime he ate good food, he would lose his clothes. I mean imagine this ability on a woman… that would be a nightmare. An inborn training tool to make someone into an exhibitionist.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of a messed up world was this guy living in? The very thought made me shudder.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, his clothes bill must be huge.</p><p><br></p><p>The man and the girl both concentrated on eating after that and then ordered different things too.</p><p><br></p><p>From the cheapest dish to the things going in millions.</p><p><br></p><p>For a minute I was scared if they were going to be scammed but the guy paid everything and added a twenty percent tip.</p><p><br></p><p>I made five million and eighty seven thousand yen from just this guy.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Say, young man, why are you wasting your talents in such a remote place. I am sure that with your skill, you could get jobs anywhere you want? I actually want to invite you to the Totsuki Academy for the position of a teacher.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Totsuki Academy? Teacher?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked confused at the guy who raised an eyebrow but seeing no change in my confused look, he was a bit flustered. \"The Totsuki Culinary Academy for the best chefs in the world.\" He offered more information.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, I am satisfied with my Restaurant. Thank you for inviting me though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What were the ingredients you used in your dishes? I didn't recognize most of them.\" For the first time, the girl enquired.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Those…\"</p><p><br></p><p>It led to a short explanation to what this place was and then the man proceeded to talk to Jiro, even asking if he could procure some ingredients from the Toriko world to help his daughter who got ill whenever she ate anything which she didn't find delicious. He even made me pack the best dishes I could make to bring with him to his daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You know, Silas-kun, the ingredients in the Gourmet World are costly beyond your comprehension. Some of the items cannot even be priced after selling off an entire planet. At this rate, you might not be able to get access to several ingredients.\" Jiro-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man curiously who took this chance and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I suggest that you get a hunter as a partner if you truly want to advance as a chef. Hunters and Chefs make pairs to hunt down ingredients and cook them. They are partners in the truest sense. Even I went on hunts with my Secchan in my younger days. Besides, there are plenty of Chefs who hunt on their own too.\" He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This… I will consider the suggestion. Thank you for your advice, Jiro-san. By the way, how strong are these monsters?\" I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>If things weren’t too bad, maybe Rimuru, Ainz, Saitama and I could go there for a training trip of sorts next time.</p><p><br></p><p>\"They are… hmm, any halfway decent ingredient would have the strength to destroy a big continent at the very least.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>A period of silence came down over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the other oldies looked at Jiro-san in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>\"On second thought, I will hold on to going hunting for a while.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Are you kidding me?</p><p><br></p><p>Just a Demon Lord Seed was dangerous to us. If it hadn’t been for Ainz’s cheat skill, there was a high chance that we would have to fight him alone to get him and even that was only because we had an aerial advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>And now he’s talking about facing Continent level monsters?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s insane.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha don't worry. The more delicious food you eat, the stronger you can become. This is the beauty of our world. Train, eat and get stronger to explore the best parts of the world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“This place sounds like the Dark Continent from our world.” Issac-san said, brushing his beard.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Dark Continent?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, our world’s humanity is confined to what would amount to only a small lake compared to the whole world. The rest of the World is unexplored even with all our technologies and power. This place is called the Dark Continent. That world is….simply beyond our understanding.” He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it really that dangerous?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It is said that the ancestors of the human race had migrated from them to the ‘Known World’. That world is filled with treasures and dangers. For example, there is a special type of product found there called Nitro Rice. It can extend the lifespan of anyone who consumes it. There is also a herb called the ‘Herb of All-Illness’ which can cure all diseases.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Has no one tried to go back there?” Hayato-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously we have. There have been 149 known expeditions and many unknown ones sent there with a survival rate of 0.04 percent from the known ones only. It’s just too dangerous for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This Dark Continent of yours sounds like our Gourmet World.” Jiro-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gourmet World?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Our world’s humanity is also confined within a very small part of the world. The rest of the world is called the Gourmet World which covers about seventy percent of our planet.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“How strong are they?” Bang-san asked, sounding curious.</p><p><br></p><p>“In our world, power is measured in terms of Capture Level. This depends on various factors such as the strength of the prey as well as the danger of the environment. Normally in the human world, the capture levels go from 1 to 100 while they can go in thousands in the Gourmet World. To give you an idea, something in 180s Capture Levels can take a walk and it would destroy countries they pass through while something in 300s will be beyond the Human World’s capabilities normally.”</p><p><br></p><p>….I suddenly felt a chill run down my spine at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the grandfather and granddaughter pair had their faces go pale at the words while the man was simply sipping his sake.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. We also have strong people protecting everyone. Not just anyone can walk in and destroy the world.” He assured us, making us relax.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….the outside world is dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Here I just became a Daemon Chevalier and was feeling relaxed while my Restaurant is connected to these hell worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the things they said in the Gourmet World and the Dark Continent sounded awesome. If someday I become strong enough, I would like to go there myself….someday very far away in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>While thinking of this I searched for something in  my System and suddenly stopped.</p><p><br>“...ilas, Silas!” Issac-san’s voice broke me out of my stupor. “Is something the matter?” He asked. “You looked like you were lost in your own world.”</p><p><br>I looked at him blankly. “I….my shop has the Nitro Rice and Herb of All-Illness for ingredients.” I said, making him freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “The description matches what you said and even the effects match. I think it should be the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face became very serious. ”Could you sell some of those to us?” He asked. “As the Chairman of the Hunter’s Association, I would like to formally negotiate with you for the sales of these two products.”</p><p><br>He was the chairman of the Association?</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I don’t think I can sell the raw ingredients but I can sell the finished products as food items. The only thing I can assure you is that none of the medicinal effects will be lost.” I replied. This was a rule in the Restaurant and even I couldn’t break it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Alright. I will not ask you to break your rule for me. I will talk to the rest of the Association and come back later to negotiate about this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about various topics and even Issac wanted to venture into Jiro-san's world and see it for himself. Bang and Hayato wanted to join too.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, these oldies are too energetic for their own good.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand the grandfather and granddaughter duo were scared out of their minds and just kept sitting on the side and listening to the stories of Jiro-san and Issac-san.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving they promised to return again and also invited me to visit their place in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, maybe I can recruit some good chefs for my Restaurant there?</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________________x______________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The money brought by the two people from the Totsuki Academy came at the right time.</p><p><br></p><p>After buying the house and renovating everything, I was a bit short on cash. With this, I could pay Rimuru and Ainz and even have something left with me to buy ingredients.</p><p><br></p><p>While my System only had limited abilities and I didn’t even know how to level it up, it did give me the ability to buy anything which could be used as ingredients.</p><p><br></p><p>The only catch was money.</p><p><br></p><p>If I wanted to buy pricey ingredients and practise more, I would need to use money from my side.</p><p><br></p><p>This always left me in need of money if I wanted to improve my cooking skills and make different types of dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why don’t you start a business?” Ainz said, while he played his game.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama had won the previous Pokemon challenge and this time Ainz and Rimuru were giving it their all to win.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am already running a Restaurant.” I replied. “In fact, with the number of customers increasing, I don’t have enough time to do anything, let alone start another business.”</p><p><br></p><p>Starting a business was not as easy as speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Moreover, the last mess makes it difficult for me to go around. People are on the lookout for some Devil from what Lavinia has told me about and while things have calmed down, it has not completely settled down. Zeref’s last attack had really cleaned out everyone in that organisation in the entire country.”</p><p><br></p><p>All three of us shivered at the sudden reminder of the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, Zeref was something else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me suddenly appearing in the area would cause many eyes to turn in my direction.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, that's indeed a problem.\" Ainz turned a page of the magazine.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You could always get someone to manage the business for you. Maybe, have Lavinia do it for you? As for the staff. I think this area is controlled by the Youkai.\" He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The nearby area. This one is neutral but yes.\" I corrected.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I can send some Kijin under your command. They would just be happy to help you out. They can set up a territory in this area. In this way, this will be established as a territory of the youkai and people wouldn't try to look for a Devil here. Oni are a type of Youkai, right?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They are.\" I answered, thinking about the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The Youkai can act as a cover for your business. As for what business you can do?</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, how about getting manga, anime and games from other worlds and selling them here? You can easily make a successful entertainment business. It wouldn't even be that hard. And both worlds will get amazing sources of entertainment too. Sorry to say this but your world’s entertainment….it’s severely lacking. It will be a win for everyone.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Moreover, it's not a business relating to supernatural things so it will be relatively safe.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have no idea how to set it all up.\" I only knew things about the Restaurant business because my dad had one.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's fine. We can figure things out.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That would be taking advantage of all of you. You have already done too much for me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Don't mind it. This will also help us considering that some of the things from the modern world will be very convenient for our worlds. And without you, it wouldn't have been possible anyways. You help just by existing. To be honest, this was our original plan and it would be kinda sad to not see it fulfilled.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. I wouldn't mind some funds to buy games and other stuff from the modern world. If you are worried about taking advantage of us, we could always become shareholders. For example, there is a comic convention in a month. We can lay a foundation for our business there.\" Ainz pointed out in the magazine.</p><p><br></p><p>The idea did sound good.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, the door to the Restaurant opened and a little girl who looked around ten walked in. She was wearing a military cosplay uniform and had blonde hair and blue eyes. Now, the military cosplay part might have been a bit doubtful because of the all too real rifle she was carrying. To be honest, she looked like a fantasy nazi.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that her steps were measured and too much like a real soldier.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes turned around the place, widening as she looked at us. She immediately jumped back and brought out her gun and light flashed on the tip of her gun but before she could fire, the shop neutralised the magic.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked with shock at her rifle and shot from her place with the knife on the rifle raised towards us but Rimuru shot a string of spider silk, tying her to the spot.</p><p><br></p><p>She struggled, even when she was bound on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, what's the case with her?\" Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, Ainz must have scared her.\" Out of all us Saitama replied, making the skeleton look abashed, if skeletons could even look like that.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I forgot to wear the mask. Wasn't expecting anyone to come at this late hour.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I got down in front of the girl. \"I will remove the cover from your mouth but I need you to be quiet and listen to me, alright? Nod if you understand.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with anger enough to burn a hole through my skull but nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This place is a restaurant between worlds. Not exactly a part of any world but a space connecting them. Do you understand?\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked unimpressed but nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This guy might look like a skeleton from a B Grade horror movie. \"Hey!\" But, he is not a bad guy. He is a human or rather was a human who got transferred to a different word but got stuck in a skeleton body. Reincarnation if you will call it or in this case, transmigration.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was reincarnated in a slime body. I was dying and heard a voice which asked me questions and the next thing I knew, I was in a cave with a giant dragon.\" Rimuru raised a hand and offered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well yeah.\" I shrugged. I did notice the widening of her eyes at this point. \"So, before you start trying to kill anyone, do understand that I <em>will</em> kick you out of the restaurant and ban you forever if you do so. Are we clear till here?\"</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Good.\" I removed the string covering her mouth and she became relaxed or rather composed herself better than before.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Now, who are you and would you like to eat something?\" I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>She however sat down on a chair and stared at us for a while and then picked up the menu. \"A Ramen.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sure.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I went inside to make a bowl of ramen while keeping an ear out to listen in on the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, why did you attack us, kid? Was big bad Ainz really that scary?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You say that you were reincarnated, what did you do before that? What kind of voices did you hear?\" She asked, I assume Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was a salaryman. Had a run in with a mugger and got killed. The voice was asking what I wished for.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, it does sound like him. Did he appear in front of you? I mean, did he talk through other people?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Don't know, I was blacking out so I could only hear voices. Wait, are you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Tanya Degurechaff. Former Japanese resident, a salaryman. Do you think I can go back home from this world?\" She introduced herself, although I could still hear a tinge of suspicion in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Another isekai character.</p><p><br></p><p>What's my shop? A gathering place of isekai characters?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well… there are several Japan's in the world. Ainz was from a far future version of Japan, another guy Hayato comes from a completely different version of Japan. In fact, Silas, the owner, is also from a different version of Japan. So, I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, thought so. It really isn't easy.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wait, you said <em>him</em>. Do you know the guy who reincarnates people?\" Ainz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Really? Do you think he can be the same guy who reincarnated me?\" Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Even my ears perked up at this. I mean I was reincarnated as well.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I call him Being X. He's…\"</p><p><br></p><p>We didn't get to listen to anything else as I felt a presence enter the shop, I left the ramen and came out quickly to see the figure of a man walking in, almost like a zombie. That said, the aura around the zombie was strong.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So your faithlessness has even attracted the attention of devils and monsters? Are you still going to oppose me even at the cost of condemning your soul to demons?\" A voice, completely foreign to the one expected of a zombie, sounded as it started at Tanya.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, what's up with today?</p><p><br></p><p>\"You wanna bet against it?\" The girl mocked.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean the guy was supposedly a God or something similar, right?</p><p><br></p><p>Stop mocking it.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It is all futile. You must be guided towards the path of a believer. Let me show you how even demons or monsters cannot help you with this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The aura thickened and I sensed an attack forming..</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, time to stop this.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant crushed the aura in the very next moment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zombie looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Guest, what would you like to eat? If you don't have anything to order, I suggest that you leave and not cause trouble within the premises. This is private property and I will be forced to take action if you do so.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A creature seeped in demonic power. Your soul is irredeemable. I feel sorry for you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oi, are you the guy who reincarnates people in different worlds?\" Rimuru got up from the seat and asked the zombie but I don't know why a very strange silence fell over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It is but a mere part of my power. Rejoice at being able to witness my presence monster. Do not fear for I shall grant mercy to your souls and purge you right now.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment, the zombie was blasted to the side of the Restaurant, against a wall. \"Return my dick, you crazy bastard!\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I don't think anyone expected that. Not even the zombie guy. Not even when he was devoured by Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only after a minute that he stopped. \"Oh!\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He looked around sheepishly. \"According to Great Sage, it was not this guy.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Did you just accidentally kill the wrong guy? Also, don't act like you don't remember what you just shouted. I thought to myself but didn't say out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Also, it was only a possession. The one it was possessing was already dead. I got some Skills from devouring it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and just went back to finish cooking the Ramen. I should have accepted such a life when I got this System in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>Tanya Degurchaff didn’t want to go back to her world so I decided to give her a place to stay. We even got to know her story in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>Tanya was apparently someone at a high level in a respected company in her previous life. She jumped at the fact that she could stay in a modern world and decided to work for me.</p><p><br></p><p>She was in fact more than happy to jump from her previous world which was drowned in war because that asshole being wanted to make her a so-called believer.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, talk about taking things too far.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can stay here or I can arrange for a new residence for you soon if you want.” I told her and she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the day, we had decided to go forward with the business plan for the Manga and Light Novel Business.</p><p><br></p><p>We had even decided the name of the company.</p><p><br></p><p>The Crossroads Publications.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The next day, Ainz came first but he wasn’t alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him were two girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas. These are Yuri Alpha and Narberal Gamma. They will be serving you and assisting you with your new business.</p><p><br></p><p>The two bowed respectively in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is our honour to serve Silas-sama.” They said together.</p><p><br></p><p>I even got to know some things about them.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, they aren’t exactly humans despite their looks.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz had told me already that his guild was specifically for non-human characters so I should have expected this.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri is a Dullahan while Narberal is a Doppelganger.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming to the two maids, they were both absolutely professional.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri Alpha was a beauty with an intelligent look. She wore black lensless glasses and a blue-collar around her neck, most likely to keep her head attached to her body since she was a Dullahan. She wore her hair tied into a low-cropped bun at the back of her head and a maid uniform.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, Narberal Gamma could only be described as an elegant, snow-white skinned, black-pony tailed beauty. She also wore a maid uniform.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to say, Ainz’s guild members had great taste.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz was behaving in his role play manner until he was inside his private room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me introduce you to the rest of the staff here. You all can talk and know more about my world. You will need to know the background of the world to start a business first.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded and I took them to Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to find a way to get fake identities for them as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, this was indeed not easy.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe Lavinia would know something since she was more used to dealing with the Supernatural World?</p><p><br></p><p>All this had to be put on the side as it was time for the guests to arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>The usual guests like Naruto, Kanna and Miu and Touma came first for their daily bentos. Naruto and Kanna were in the same school now and it seems that Kanna was actually enjoying her time at her new home.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid was next.</p><p><br></p><p>He apparently had a day off at school today.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid on the other hand went and played with Ainz and the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>After they left, two new guests entered the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was a  young elf with long golden-blonde hair and blue eyes. Her general appearance could only be described as breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>The second one was actually a girl with animal ears and even a tail. Was she a youkai?</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I had seen one.</p><p><br></p><p>She had black hair, canine ears and a fluffy tail. She sported purple eyes with vertical slit pupils.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru was the first to greet them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome Guests. What would you like to eat?” She asked politely.</p><p><br></p><p>In all these months, Tohru had gotten very good at this waitress business.</p><p><br></p><p>The two girls looked at Tohru, surprised for a few moments before taking a seat and taking a look at the menu.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Alpha -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Hey hey Alpha. I don’t recognise most of the dishes from the menu. Do you know what these are?” Delta asked, after trying to decide what to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha on the other hand was looking at the menu which was written in a language she was not expecting to encounter.</p><p><br>Wasn’t this the language Shadow had taught them?</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, many of the dishes here were the ones Shadow had told them about.</p><p><br></p><p>What exactly is this place which can make these things?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it another organisation Shadow had started behind their backs?</p><p><br></p><p>Were they not doing their duty adequately enough for him to take such measures?</p><p><br></p><p>Several thoughts went through her mind in one moment before she reigned them in.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still too early to say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>She needed to investigate more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two orders of Chicken Ramen.” She ordered and began observing everything in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>“Certainly.” The girl bowed and left to relay their orders to the chef.</p><p><br></p><p>While their order was prepared, she looked around trying to observe every person in the Restaurant closely while being as discreet as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly she heard a voice beside her. “Are you looking for something or someone, Miss? May I help you with something?”</p><p><br></p><p>She held herself back from accidentally attacking and turned around to see a black haired woman in glasses.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she could say anything however, Delta opened her mouth and spoke first. “Is Shadow here?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha felt an urge to face palm. Maybe bringing Alpha here was not the best idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow?” The woman tilted her head, looking confused. “I apologise but I do not know of anyone with such a name. Today is my first day working here. I can ask the others and let you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman then called for a blonde human girl. “Is there someone called Shadow here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow? Oh, Cid-kun. Yes. He is inside the private room with Rimuru-san, Ainz-san and Saitama-san.” The girl pointed towards the room but what attracted Alpha’s attention was not the location but rather the name she addressed him with.</p><p><br>Cid.</p><p><br></p><p>Did they know his identity?</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow hadn’t even told his identity to his real family then why can these people know his identity?</p><p><br></p><p>A look of realisation came to the eyes of the black haired woman who then looked at them. “May I know who you people are and how you know Cid-sama?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are from Shadow Garden made by Boss.” Delta answered before she had the chance to say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, she will have to consider bringing her to future spying missions.</p><p><br></p><p>“His subordinates then. I see. So you were perhaps told to come here too.” She asked in a much quieter voice. “ I am sorry but Cid-sama is currently talking to the rest of the….” She suddenly stopped before looking around, especially at the kitchen and then spoke again. ”Would you like to go to a private room for the time being?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha sensed the change in her tone of voice and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see what is going on here.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, the woman first brought their order for them and then locked the room behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>Delta smelled the food and almost drooled. Even she found herself salivating at the scent of the food and her stomach made a sound making her blush a little.</p><p><br></p><p>Delta immediately dove in, eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be embarrassed. This food is made by Silas-sama himself. It is no less than a work or art, a miracle which even Supreme Beings can only praise. For people like us, having a chance to taste it….is nothing short of a boon.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha broke out of her trance and suddenly registered some of the words the woman had said.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas-sama, Supreme Beings?</p><p><br></p><p>“You look confused. Has Cid-sama not explained everything to you yet?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are on a test by Shadow to find out about this place.” Delta answered and Alpha let her. Whatever she had done till now, had only served to answer more of their questions.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Guiding people to find their answers. Indeed, the minds and thoughts of Supreme Beings are beyond our understanding. Even we had to figure out the clues and ask Ainz-sama before he clarified our doubts. I guess Cid-sama is doing the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha had enough of these cryptic words so she took the initiative to ask. “Could you please tell us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Certainly.”</p><p><br></p><p>What the woman told her next….was certainly not something Alpha had been expecting even with everything she had been through till now.</p><p><br></p><p>Supreme Beings.</p><p><br></p><p>A Great War.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant which connected to infinite worlds with the goal of reuniting all the Supreme Beings back.</p><p><br></p><p>The story was so outlandish and yet everything was right in front of their eyes to see that Alpha couldn’t even refute it at all.</p><p><br></p><p>But the more she thought of it, the more things became clearer.</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow was born to the Kagenou Household and yet he had memories and abilities completely unknown to anyone else.</p><p><br></p><p>The memories of his previous life, the memories of a Supreme Being.</p><p><br></p><p>He was doing exactly what the Supreme Beings had done in their previous life, fought against great dangers to unveil the face of darkness….and even when most of them met their ends in the Great War, they were still doing it….even in their next lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, they had gone through a war to protect several Clans in Rimuru-sama’s world, one of them being the pink haired girl who is working outside.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, these Supreme Beings were Shadows of their own worlds, each carrying such heavy burdens on their shoulders all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>The maid, Yuri Alpha, a name which had caught her off guard but again came as a realisation, said that they were made to serve the Supreme Beings.</p><p><br></p><p>The Seven Shadows were named similarly to the Pleiades Seven Sisters, a name given to them by Shadow, probably in an attempt to create his own version of the Pleiades.</p><p><br></p><p>To think that this simple test would reveal such news to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe, Shadow has thought them to be worthy of knowing everything and guided them to this Restaurant?</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you doing here then?” She asked Yuri. Calling her Alpha was a bit odd for her even now.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you know, the spell cast by Silas-sama has left him without any power.” Yuri began and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“This has also led him to be vulnerable. And while he is regaining his powers at a very fast speed, he is still not even close to his full power. Moreover, the world where he was reincarnated, is extremely dangerous. Gods and monsters roam around everywhere. In fact, this Restaurant had even been attacked recently but thankfully, the rest of the Supreme Beings were here. They protected this place and from what I have heard, one of them had selectively wiped out all members of the organisation which had attacked this place in the whole country with just a single spell, sending a warning to every force in this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha’s eyes widened at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there really such a spell which can do that?” She asked, shaken completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a person could wipe out the members of the Cult in moments….was this really how strong the so called Supreme Beings were?</p><p><br></p><p>“As I said, the means of Supreme Beings are beyond our understanding. Anyways, we were sent here to protect and assist him in establishing a business in this world. Unfortunately Silas-sama doesn’t have many subordinates who can help him out. That’s why Ainz-sama has assigned us to help him out while Rimuru-sama has assigned several Kijin.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly another thought struck her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did Shadow choose this time to guide them here?</p><p><br></p><p>Why was it that no one could find the place before today and yet she and Delta suddenly found this place magically?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it to let her meet Yuri?</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe he was trying to tell them to help him too.</p><p><br></p><p>She will have to discuss it with the rest of the Seven Shadows.</p><p><br></p><p>They stayed there for over an hour and promised to return later to know more. In the meantime, Yuri had brought them several meals for the rest of their members too.</p><p><br></p><p>When she left the room, the door to the room next to them opened to….by Shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eye at her while Delta jumped at him. “Shadow!”</p><p><br></p><p>She was however dodged by Shadow. “I am sorry but you are mistaking me for someone else maybe.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, he took some food packed for him and left the place, completely ignoring them both.</p><p><br></p><p>She couldn’t understand what was happening when she heard a voice behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t mind Cid. He is very dedicated to his role….well, his Shadow thing. He does that even with us.”</p><p><br></p><p>She turned around to see a boy with black hair and blue eyes smiling at the door and shaking his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri bowed. “Silas-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, so he was Silas, the one who sacrificed everything, even his memories and life, all for the sake of reuniting his friends again.</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha felt a burst of respect well up within her and was about to bow before he spoke again. “You don’t have to bow all the time, Yuri. Relax.”</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked at her and spoke again. “So you are friends with Cid-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my name is Alpha.” She answered, not saying anything else. Yuri had already warned her about not speaking anything about the Supreme Beings and specially in front of Silas-sama to not disturb the spell cast by him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nice to meet you, Alpha-san. Did you enjoy your food today?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, It was the best meal I have had the pleasure of eating. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, since you are Cid-kun’s friends then this first meal will be on the house. Just take care of him, alright. He can be….well you already know that I guess?” He said and she could feel the care in his voice, something which warmed her heart.</p><p><br></p><p>This person was really like the stories of Yuri, even when he didn’t have any of those memories yet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please leave him to us.” She nodded resolutely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great then. Visit us again.” With those words, he walked into the room Shadow had left, the room where the rest of the….Supreme Beings were.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Yuri again and nodded before leaving the place, thousands of thoughts in her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As promised, I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are picking up pace now as most of the Snippet’s characters are back now.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We also saw Alpha and Delta’s visit and the confusion rolling.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Seriously, both Nazarick and Shadow Garden members can cook.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Now, how will Cid handle all this news?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Maybe in the next chapter we will see our favourite Demon Lord making an entrance.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will try to work more on this for the rest of the month.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I want to get most of the introductions for the Snippets out of the way before we can concentrate on the plot next.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

It is also what’s granting them the ability to adapt to new situations by consuming the flesh of others. This Skill is unique to the Orc Lord and so finishing him off is our top priority.”</p><p><br></p><p>We nodded at his analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>“The strongest one here is the fat clown. After that is the Orc Lord and then the bird head. Our first priority is the Orc Lord. I could take him down but I have doubts that the bird head and the clown will not let me do so. I could take on the bird head but the Clown would be too much for me.” Rimuru finished.</p><p><br></p><p>“And all this is not even considering the orc army.” Ainz added. “Well, I could keep them busy but that would require some time on my part but that still leaves us with the clown.”</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my mouth here. “Well….if it’s just delaying him for a while, I could do so. I am not sure I can kill it off though.” I added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure, Silas?” Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, I just have to play the defensive battle style for a while. Moreover, it doesn’t look like the guy can fly so stalling him would be difficult but not impossible. Just make it quick though. I am not sure if I could hold him back for long.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to worry. I will only need fifteen minutes to engage the army. I will come and back you up after that.” Ainz added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it. Fifteen minutes should be doable.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, let’s get to work. Ranga, go and hide in Silas’ shadow and protect him. Great Sage, connect with Silas’ sage and keep an eye on him. I can use my trump card in case things go south.” Rimuru shouted and just around this time, the ice wall started to crack.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hai, my Lord.” The wolf answered as he jumped into my shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost immediately, I sensed a presence trying to connect to me and allowed it access. It wasn’t the first time so I was already used to it.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around to see the clown using a roll type attack, which looked like something straight out of Pokemon to ram against the wall, shaking the huge wall with every hit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He shot forward, using Water Blades to cut a path in front of him. The orcs were beheaded while the water swirled in the air forming many rain type droplets and freezing mid air, while the bodies of the orcs lit up with a purple-black magic circle and large Death Knights rose from them.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Great Sage, guide the attacks to hit the vitals of the orcs. Target their eyes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>They had tried this move several times during the past two weeks when all three of them tried to create an ultra combo to fight a raid boss level enemy if they ever met anyone. It led to the discovery that Great Sage being a Skill evolved from Sage could connect to it with Silas' permission and use the extra computational ability to guide the magic attacks of Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was a lovable cutie but that was only till he fought. It showed him why he was a Devil. While using the Ice Devil Slayer magic he fought like a beast but it was his Water Magic that could send chills down anyone’s spine. He used Water in ways that would ensure the most painful deaths to their enemies and yet used the least amount of magicules.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, he manipulated the water in a large bear monster's eyes and created an ice needle which pierced its brain, downing the massive beast in a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>He further reduced the use of his Magicules if the water and ice were provided by others or there was a source nearby, which is why, when fighting together, Ainz always surrounded him by Ice and Water elementals and he used Water Blade.</p><p><br></p><p>And now, with a field surrounded by ice, he was on his home turf. Whenever he got low on magicules, he just ate some ice and recovered.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, the Slayer Magics were such utter cheats. That's why when he said he would distract the strongest monster in the group, none of them even flinched, despite the huge disparity in both their powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz immediately summoned some elementals to keep the birdface occupied.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest orc roared and jumped to slash with his cleaver towards Rimuru. The birdface tried to attack but was distracted by the elementals. He parried the attack of the orc and used fire of Ifrit to burn through his cleaver and slashed towards the orc's face.</p><p><br></p><p>The orc resisted with reddish black tentacles of energy and countered him. They clashed with each other with injuries slowly piling on the orc.</p><p><br></p><p>It seemed injured already due to the previous fight with the ogres and was thrown backwards with a strong blast. Without giving it any chance to get up, Rimuru created a magic circle and blasted the area with a flame pillar. Immediately afterwards, the entire area was rained down upon by metre long icicles. Yeah, that should keep it down.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards the birdface who had defeated two elementals.</p><p><br></p><p>The birdface was shooting red spheres of energy like bullets all over the area to overwhelm the enemy but Rimuru could tell that it was not specialised in fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacks were nothing to him because he could just Devour the energy directly with his slime physique.</p><p><br></p><p>He punched the birdface's stomach and it shot towards the same place as the Orc. What followed was a rain of several spells from Rimuru, the ogres and the elementals.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas had changed to target the clown.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Connecting to Great Sage was like having a super advanced AI in my head. I wonder if Tony Stark felt like them when he was using the Iron Man suit.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you analyse the Skill of the Clown?\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>'The Clown is using a Unique Skill called Amplifier. It amplifies the already strong physique of the monster, allowing it to do attacks beyond his level. By an estimate, it is as strong as a Demon Lord Seed level monster and can fight a Demon Lord Seed on equal ground with the Unique Skill.'</em></p><p><br></p><p>Demon Lord Seed…</p><p><br></p><p>Son of a…</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had explained the power levels of monsters in his world. The funny thing is that not even he knew what the divisions were and had to ask his Great Sage Skill when Ainz asked him the question.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz was the type of guy who would read the whole guide book before starting a game while Rimuru was someone who jumped in to enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the basic difference between their characters and that’s why they kept each other in check.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon Lord Seeds are monsters who could become True Demon Lords. The Demon Lord Seed not only showed that they were stronger than the rest, it was also a mark of Kingship, something which qualified them to become rulers.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I don't need to kill it, only delay it for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>While the Ice Devil Slayer Magic was good, it was mostly brute force techniques. I preferred finesse in my techniques. It did have the effect of boosting the quality of my ice so that was always a plus.</p><p><br></p><p>The Water Manipulation Skill I had gained from this world complimented my Ice Magic very well.I controlled the water in the area and pelted it with water droplets. My normal icicle to the eye was not working because of its magicules protecting him. The attack was useless as it just bounced off his body but also told me that there were no weak spots to take advantage of.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s try something new.</p><p><br></p><p>I did the same move again and as expected, the clown didn’t bother to dodge. This time however, I had infused the Ice Devil Slayer Magic in the attack and the attack pierced the Clown’s eyes. The attacks on the rest of his body were still ineffective. That’s one tough skill the guy has.</p><p><br></p><p>He fell on the ground and grunted in pain and looked at me in anger. He grunted before jumping into the air and rolling into a ball.</p><p><br></p><p>He even neglected the ogres he had been fighting to try and bash at the ice wall on which I was standing.</p><p><br></p><p>The way it attacked reminded me of the Rollout attack from Pokemon which got stronger the more they rolled.</p><p><br></p><p>He was bashing straight through the Death Knights which Ainz had created to fight the orcs as if they were straw targets without any kind of resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I knew the way to handle it.</p><p><br></p><p>The clown looked like he was short tempered and harassing him with attacks which didn't cause any damage, especially after I had pierced his eyes  but made it angry and gave up any of his enemies to solely concentrate on me.</p><p><br></p><p>He started attacking blindly, trying to topple the ice wall to get to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I manipulated the ice to make trenches around the area in the path of the rolling clown. And created a lot of inclined planes of ice on its path. He got caught on one such inclined plane and was thrown up in the air, in a direction away from me.</p><p><br></p><p>This slowed its momentum by a lot and gave me an opportunity to blast him with ice on all his joints. Great Sage can do a very great job of guiding attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>I concentrated mainly on his joints to cause any injury to slow it down and finally to land a heavy blow, I took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ice Devil’s Rage!” The roar took the form of a beam of icy energy and blasted the clown into the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The place where he crashed was frozen as a tower of ice formed in the area. Great Sage had however already analysed that the attack wouldn’t take down the monster so we had to prepare for more.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How long, Ainz?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Five minutes more.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Five minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, the icy tower cracked slightly at first and then completely shattered as the clown howled in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ogres.\" I shouted. \"Attack the clown with fire when I command.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The red haired leader of ogres agreed and stood beside me, waiting for my order.</p><p><br></p><p>I took control of the ice on the ground and the wall and pushed my Demonic Power into it, freezing the limbs of the clown. \"Now!\"</p><p><br></p><p>The entire area was drowned by a shower of flames, with the guy beside me taking the lead.</p><p><br></p><p>A massive pillar of flames rose to the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is it over?\" The red haired leader asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>His answer however came from an entirely different place.</p><p><br></p><p>A roar resounded in the area as the flame pillar was dispersed.</p><p><br></p><p>The clown was releasing a massive amount of magicules but the injuries on his body were visible. He was hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>But my attack wasn't over yet.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes shone a red light and rolled into a ball once more, rolling towards me, radiating insane amounts of magicules.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster however stopped before he reached the ice wall, and fell to his knees, looking at me in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>The very next moment, his body was riddled with holes from inside. Each part with a soft tissue and no muscles was shredded apart from inside and he fell to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was still healing but the extent of injuries I had caused him would keep it down for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, how did that work?</p><p><br></p><p>I first analysed its healing and defence and found out that he was using his magicules as a layer on his body to stop the attacks. This is what caused my own Demonic Power to be unable to freeze the liquid in his eyes and even my Ice Devil Slayer could barely pass through his defences and that too in the eye.</p><p><br></p><p>I did notice that his magicules focused on healing and the defence broke for a very short while when he was injured.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus I created a moment where he could be showered with a ton of magic attacks by everyone around us. This in turn created a moment where his magicules were truly focused on healing and attack and gave up all his defence. And that's what I needed.</p><p><br></p><p>When the ogres attacked the place, they also evaporated all the ice which was stopping it as well as the ice around the area. I controlled the water vapour and guided it inside his body. This vapour was infused with my Demonic Power and the moment he became a rolling ball, I froze everything, shredding him from inside out.</p><p><br></p><p>The dodged areas were taken care of by my Chef Skill. I kept this Skill on hold all this time to prevent the guy from doing anything too desperate or just running away. It needed to be used on the killer move and it did. If he survived from a scrambled brain, I didn't know what would be needed to keep him down.</p><p><br></p><p>And if all else went to hell, I was ready to summon my knives and use my Cursed Techniques. The only reason I didn’t use it was because of the distance and the speed of the clown.</p><p><br></p><p>If he got hit by the attack and understood what it did, he could easily dodge the attacks with his high speed.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I was keeping that as the last trump card to use in case all else failed and he got close.</p><p><br></p><p>I was breathing heavily due to the exertion. Using Chef always took a lot out of me and while I could regain lost magic with the Ice Devil Slayer Magic, it did nothing about stamina and mental exhaustion.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Good job. Let me take care of the rest.\" Ainz's voice sounded behind me. Several Magic Circles lit up all around us at the moment. <strong><em>\"The Goal of All Life is Death.\"</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Grasp Heart.\"</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>The golden clock-like magic circle that had formed behind Ainz reached twelve. A phantom hand appeared behind the clown, crushing its heart and its lifeless body fell down to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is it dead?\" I asked but soon my attention was captured by something else.</p><p><br></p><p>A ball of bluish white light came forward towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, I should have been wary but here I wasn’t. In fact, I almost instinctively knew what it was. As if there was an innate part of me which knew.</p><p><br></p><p>A soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost in a daze, I extended my hand and….gulped down the soul.</p><p><br></p><p>And then I fainted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ainz -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas!\" He quickly reached beside him and caught him before he could fall.</p><p><br></p><p>The Goal of All Life is Death is a spell which had a one hundred hour cooldown time and bypassed all the immunities and defences against instant death spells. The only way to survive was to use a resurrection spell within twelve seconds….or at least that's how it worked in YGGDRASIL and the New World. In this world, he had to use some time to prepare the spell. He guessed that it had something to do with the different laws of this world? Perhaps things might change if he got connected to this world’s system.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, according to Rimuru, there was another System governing this world so it might have something to do with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, even the slight nerf didn’t make this Skill any less dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew that the monster was stronger than him in raw stats, a boss level monster. It was easily stronger than many floor guardians combined and thus he didn't even hesitate before using his trump card. He even used everything he could to buff his base stats and reduce the monster’s stats in case the different laws of this world affected his magic. Thankfully, all of it was just useless worry.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the way Silas handled the fight was really masterful.</p><p><br></p><p>Bringing him out to train was the best decision for him. In the past two weeks, he had seen the progress made was incredible. Maybe it was his inborn instinct as a Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>As much as he tried to brush it off, it was a fact that he was a natural born devil and did inherit the powers of one and was now training a Devil based magic as well.</p><p><br></p><p>His personality might not be like one, and in fact, Ainz might not have been surprised if he were actually an Angel but he wasn't and it showed when he got lost in fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Each one of his attacks hit where it hurts.</p><p><br></p><p>When he had asked him how he knew about where to hit, he had replied that as a Chef, he must know his ingredients.</p><p><br></p><p>That Chef Skill was cheating.</p><p><br></p><p>The only problem was that he often got lost in fighting. Just like now and didn't realise that he was getting tired from fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, the enemies fighting Rimuru had risen up. The orc had lost an arm but now it looked like it was eating birdface and regenerating.</p><p><br></p><p>He checked his mana and it would take a while to recover. Not to mention the cooldown on his spells.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Rimuru, do you need help?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No.\" A very fast answer. \"This fight, don't interfere.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The answer was brief but this was probably the first time Ainz had sensed this level of seriousness from Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>The orc walked ahead and ate the remains of the clown but Rimuru didn't interfere and just kept on watching. Even when the orc changed and looked like it was evolving, he didn't interfere.</p><p><br></p><p>Well… if he was so serious about this, let him be. He will smash that orc with one of his one time usable items if push came to shove.</p><p><br></p><p>He checked on Silas and found that his Magic Power was rising at a very fast pace. Was it because of the white light he ate?</p><p><br></p><p>A soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, he had heard that he had digested that bad guy who had tried possessing his body so there was a precedent for this.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite similar to what that orc had done on the other side and looking at it, it seemed as if it was done evolving, so maybe Silas was also in the process of evolving.</p><p><br></p><p>So he did the only thing he could and sat beside him to protect him while he completed his transformation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"I take all your sins, Geld. Rest in Peace.\"</p><p><br></p><p>His mood right now was quite difficult to describe. The memories of the Orc Lord… no, it was the Orc Disaster now, was heavy for someone like him who had lived a normal life till now. How could he bear to hate someone like him?… He could only hate the circumstances and the ones who took advantage of innocent people in bad circumstances.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What is Silas' condition, Great Sage?\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>'The individual, Silas, is undergoing an evolution. His original power was just a step below a Greater Demon but the soul he consumed was of a Demon Lord Seed level being.

Is he alright?\" Ainz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What happened, Great Sage?\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>'Great Sage found an alternate evolution route to a Daemon Chevalier. When a powerful Greater Daemon gains a material body, they can evolve into a Daemon Chavalier who is much stronger than normal Greater Daemons. They can kill a Greater Daemon with a single attack. Great Sage then noticed an incomplete Demon Lord Seed inside the Individual Silas and guided the excessive energy to evolve it into a complete Demon Lord Seed. The individual Silas now holds two Demon Lord Seeds in his body which is only possible because of a Daemon Chevalier's body and the unique race of the Individual Silas.'</em></p><p><br></p><p>“He got a Demon Lord Seed and that too two of them. Wasn’t that cheating?” Damn, Silas seemed to have become some kind of mini boss all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Host also gained a Demon Lord Seed from consuming Orc Disaster Geld</em></p><p><br></p><p>\"Wait what, I  did?\" He asked, shocked.</p><p><br></p><p><em>'Yes, host.'</em></p><p><br></p><p>The orcs had stopped fighting and with his order, even the ogres had stopped fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Ainz and he nodded as if understanding what to do already. He brought out a robe from one of his rings and covered Silas while Rimuru left towards the orcs and ogres.</p><p><br></p><p>Since he promised to take all of Geld's sins, he will not break his word and take care of his people as his own.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes to the same scene as the last time but this time, there was a pink haired girl with horns on her head in the room while the same goblin as last time ran quickly when he saw me waking up… Am I that scary?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas-sama, you have awakened.\" The girl whom I didn't know asked me and I could only nod my head lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Wait, didn’t she look somewhat familiar?</p><p><br></p><p>I think I had seen that hair and eye colour somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>….it took me another moment to realise that the girl was actually the princess of the Ogres. How did she look like this?</p><p><br></p><p>“You….are you perhaps the princess of the Ogre Tribe?” I asked, still not sure. The difference was quite huge.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my name is Shuna. I was given this name by Rimuru-sama when we decided to join his town.” She replied and her voice was also different from the previous time.</p><p><br></p><p>Had they already joined Rimuru’s town? And they were named too. Didn’t they faint too? If so then, how come they are awake before me?</p><p><br></p><p>How long has it been since I fainted?</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….</p><p><br></p><p>Twice I have fainted and ended up in this situation when evolving.</p><p><br></p><p>Man, becoming strong is hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Why do I even need to train to run a restaurant in peace?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, yeah… I live in a world where children can be born with NotPokemon which can destroy countries because God… thought it was a good idea… somehow. And also the fact that God, well exists and I am a Devil. <em>Sigh</em></p><p><br></p><p>Oh and the occasional customers who would try to shove soul bearing cursed fingers down my throat….fuck….my life was certifiably weird.</p><p><br><br></p><p>While having deja vu, I got up from my bed but this time and realised that I was naked. Almost instinctively, I grabbed the bedsheet and tugged it towards me in order to wrap it around me only resulting in a surprised cry as I dragged the girl on me accidentally while trying to pull the bedsheets.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl fell on my chest and I felt two soft lumps on my body, causing heat to rush to a certain part of my body.</p><p><br></p><p>She smelled like strawberries.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it her shampoo?</p><p><br></p><p>Did ogres even use shampoo?</p><p><br></p><p>Wait….was she even an ogre anymore?</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts halted as I sensed some movements below and stiffened in realisation.</p><p><br></p><p>I did notice that I had <em>grown</em>… in more than one way. And I was sure that the girl felt my <em>growth</em> too due to our close vicinity.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl's blush made it look like she would bleed from her face.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I'm sorry. I was trying to get the bedsheets.\" I apologised and released her, trying to untangle the bedsheets.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I-it's o-oka-y.\" Her blush was even redder somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas! You are awake?\" Rimuru bounced into the room in his slime form only to freeze at the door. \"Oops, should have knocked. Carry on.\" He jumped back.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Why does this always happen to me?</p><p><br></p><p>I got a headache.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oi come back. It's not what you think.\" I shouted but he was already out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck, that didn’t look good from any angle.</p><p><br></p><p>I hurried to tear the bed sheets to get out of this mess but somehow, things were not going my way as I ended up tearing the girl's kimono as well.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sorry!\" I bowed but little Silas in attention didn't help so I quickly turned around and grabbed the blanket and wrapped it around her quickly and then tied the torn up bed sheets around my waist like a towel, not looking at the girl and embarrassing her even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have to run long as the bastard was waiting outside the door in his slime form. I didn't need to look at his human face because I could just sense his smugness dripping from his slime face.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas….while you might have certain <em>cough</em> <em>exhibitionist</em> <em>cough</em> tendencies, I am not a voyeur and I don't think little Shuna is one too. You should consider her feelings.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Fuck you, whose an exhibitionist?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Who would have thought that the shy and cute ones were your type. Still, you play fast. Didn’t you have enough with Lavinia-chan, Sakura-chan and Tohru-chan? Now even Shuna-chan….damn Harem Protagonist.\" The blob of slime wiggled annoyingly and then went into a rant. I reflexively kicked him. But the effect was totally unexpected. The simple kick made him go like a cannonball, causing several of the trees to collapse in a row.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Fuck! Rimuru.\" I rushed to see if he was alright.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, I am fine. I have physical damage resistance.\" He just bounced back as if nothing happened just now.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"Can I kick you once more?\" My lips twitched.</p><p><br></p><p>\"No.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, having trouble controlling your power?\" He asked and I took a moment to check my condition. My Demonic Power alone was far beyond what I had before, same was the case with my Cursed Energy which had increased by leaps and bounds. Finally was the surprise increase in my physical strength.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt as if I could shatter a mountain with a punch.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is this going to be a regular thing? How did this happen anyway? I don’t remember things clearly before I fainted.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You ate the wrong food.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?\" I deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What you ate at the end of the fight was the soul of the clown who we later found was a Deathman, an undead. This particular Deathman was someone made from the amalgamation of countless corpses and was very strong. In fact, it was too strong for you to digest so your body had to change in order to get the energy settled. So, what you had was basically a case of severe indigestion.\" He explained quite excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This is too troublesome.\" I sighed and lay down. \"How long was I out this time?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A week.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“A week! Damn, I am late. Sakura and Lavy will be worried about me going missing.\" I realised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, you can go there and inform them first. But hey, now you are stronger than me and Ainz in terms of base stats.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am?\" I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Surprisingly, yes. I can still kick your butt though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Then I will reopen my shop. I think this level of strength should keep me safe. I can’t delay for longer. The girls must be worried. Even the customers must be wondering why I closed for longer than expected.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They wouldn't mind but sure. I think you should try getting used to your strength and rest for a while.\" He agreed with me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Where is Ainz? I haven't seen him.\" I asked not seeing our bone headed friend anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, I named him because I got enough power after the fight. It caused him to bind with this world's system and break his game's level cap. He's out hunting.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"He broke his level cap? Isn't that hacking?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"We are jumping worlds. If that's hacking then you and your shop are the hack.\" Rimuru, back in his human form, rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"... point.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You should have seen his happiness. It looked like he had jumped directly out of a horror movie. Even the little goblins were scared.\" he chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p>… yeah, I can imagine that.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, I noticed the Ogre Princess. She….looked different.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeah, they evolved.” Rimuru answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“All of them?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So all those ogres… they turned into…?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Kijin.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That. Yes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not all. Only a dozen. Naming even half a dozen of them almost drained me and caused me to sleep for a day. I also have to name the hundred and eighty thousand orcs who joined me. Great Sage made a ritual to name them without using my own magicules but it will still take me around a month or so to name all of them.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"How many orcs?\" I asked, incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, the ones we fought were just a small battalion of soldiers led by their leader. The real camp was in the swamps, led by his friend. They were under the influence of the Orc Disaster's Unique Skill: Starved and were out of control. I promised them food and safety and they joined me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Food for that many will be a problem.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not really. I am planning to make a deal with Zeref for the restoration potions in exchange for the food. They can supply us enough food for a million, let alone one hundred and eighty thousand. With the new workforce, we will be able to produce our own food in a year, enough to feed everyone.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's… a surprisingly great plan.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We talked around for a while about various topics.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Rimuru.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Don't mind it. We are friends.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Lavinia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Sakura staring at the window in the direction of the Restaurant and let out a sigh. She has been like this for the last five days.</p><p><br></p><p>Sil-kun and the rest had gone for the hunt and were supposed to be back in a week, which was five days ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura however had become quiet since then. She didn’t say anything or even complain but anyone taking one look at her could see the worries in her eyes as she sat for long hours beside the window looking outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s time for lunch, Sakura-chan. Let’s go. Everyone is waiting for you.” She called out but got no response.</p><p><br></p><p>She went forward and touched her shoulder. “Sakura-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah!” The girl was shaken from her thoughts and looked towards her. “Lavy. I am sorry I didn’t realise you were here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Holding back a sigh, she patted her head. “Lunch is ready. Brandish-chan and the rest are waiting for you.” Then with some hesitation added. “Sil-kun will return, you know. He is not the type to make others worry. They must have gotten stuck in some work and that’s why they are late.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura smiled. “I know.”</p><p><br></p><p>Although her smile looked as usual, she noticed that whenever the topic came to Sil-kun, the smile always reached her eyes, although just barely. Normal people who didn’t know her better would never be able to notice it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You like Sil-kun, don’t you?” She asked, making the girl pause.</p><p><br></p><p>But after a moment, she continued walking. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>When she didn’t continue anymore, she asked again. “Then why don’t you tell him? I always see you getting closer to him and I think you two would get together but then you suddenly pull back. Do you not trust him?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura looked at her with a blank look on her face. “I trust him more than I trust anyone in this world, Lavy. There is probably not a single thing in this world I wouldn’t do for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was taken aback by the conviction behind her words. It was probably the surest she had seen Sakura in all their time together.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why? Why do you always pull back? You know that he likes you too. He would be very happy if you two got together.” She asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura just looked at her and asked. “Why are you asking me this? From what I have seen, you are interested in him too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously I am. He is a kind boy who cares for everyone. Such people are rare to meet.” Lavinia replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why do you want me to get closer to him?” Sakura asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why does me being with Sil-kun mean you can’t be with him too?” She asked, confused by her question too.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not how things work, Lavy.” Sakura sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“....not really, Sakura-chan. While it might not be so common among humans, among devils having more than one partner is a very common thing.” She explained, taking the girl by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils have harems. It’s a very common thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A devil can have almost infinite lifespan. To be honest, I have never heard of a Devil dying from old age. Apart from that, they can maintain their youth for as long as they want. They also have a very low fertility rate. In fact, it’s not common for Devils to have one child after trying for several centuries. Due to all these reasons, a single devil often takes more than one partner. In fact, not just them but most long lived supernatural races. That’s why I don’t think it’s anything odd.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Sakura-chan, mouth agape. “B-b-but….”</p><p><br></p><p>“But what, Sakura-chan? I like Sil-kun but I also like you. I want you both to be happy. I don’t see why we can’t be happy together. I have always wanted to have a big family after all. Moreover don’t you think keeping him all to myself would be a bit selfish? After all, we might lose our lives one day and he would be left alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>These words gave Sakura a pause but she suddenly shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. no, I cannot. I….I am….”</p><p><br></p><p>“What Sakura-chan? If there is any problem then tell us. Maybe we could help?” She urged the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura just stared in the distance. “There is nothing anyone can do. We cannot be together. I….am not worthy of him.” She whispered the last part.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was about to ask what she meant but there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura, Lavinia, are you two inside? May I come in?” A voice came from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>She recognised the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she could say anything, Sakura rushed to the door and opened it to reveal Sil-kun outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey there. I’m sorry we got stuck in some trouble and it took longer to get back than we were expecting.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both Sakura and her stopped and looked at Sil-kun.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked….different.</p><p><br></p><p>A closer look made her realise that he was slightly taller. He had always been fit. After all, Devils could passively change into their ideal body shape and he worked out in the Ryozanpaku dojo too but now he looked….more refined.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look different.” Sakura asked the question in her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. Well, some things happened and I kinda evolved during our trip. It’s a long story. I will tell you when we get back home.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were not hurt, were you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hurt? No, not really.”</p><p><br></p><p>They sighed in relief at the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I heard you were all coming down for dinner. Come on. I am hungry too.” He smiled and she found her heart skipping a beat at the smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he suddenly become more handsome somehow?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Alpha -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s all we could find about the Cult of Diabolus.” Epsilon said, finishing her report.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the expansion of our businesses?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh the business is going far better than we had expected. Everything Shadow-sama introduced us to has been well received by the people of this country. At this rate, we might be able to surpass the Major Corporate Alliance in a year or two at best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. What about Shadow? How has he been doing in this new place?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow….he seems to be happier somehow.” Gamma said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? I take it he is pleased by our work?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that may be the case. Although I haven’t been able to invite him here yet, knowing him he should already know of our progress. But that’s not the case.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow seems to be visiting a small store, a Restaurant of sorts everyday.” She said and then her brows furrowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something wrong with the Restaurant?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” She was confused. Knowing Gamma, she would always keep all information about Shadow to be able to assist him whenever he needed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not that I didn’t try but I just couldn’t find anything about the place. Whenever I send any of the numbers, they just don’t seem to find the Restaurant. Even if they walk the street for hours, they just can’t seem to realise the location of the Restaurant. It’s….a very mysterious place. I wanted to go there myself but….”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, that would be a foolish idea. After all, Gamma is not a fighter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh, I have been trying to find out more about the place but no matter what I do I never get any clues. I even bought the building right across the place and stayed there the whole day, watching, observing the place. Every day, in the morning Shadow uses some excuse to go to this place and when he comes out, he has a lunch box with him. Someone is there, cooking for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a Restaurant. Obviously people there would be cooking.” Delta said.</p><p><br>“No. It isn’t a Restaurant.” Eta shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? What do you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it’s a test.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A test?” They asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, a test. After all, why would Shadow walk to this Restaurant everyday in front of us and yet none of the numbers are able to find the place? It is obviously a test for us to go inside the Restaurant. Maybe Shadow wants us to see something there or find out the secret of the Mysterious Restaurant?”</p><p><br></p><p>All of them became quiet at Eta’s assessment.</p><p><br></p><p>It did seem to be Shadow's style to throw such a test their way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, I will go and check out the situation in the Restaurant myself. Delta can come with me. The rest will investigate the signs of the Cult in this city.”</p><p><br></p><p>They all agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see what kind of test Shadow had set for them now.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you sure that you want to work here, Shuna?\" I asked the girl again who looked determined to follow me. The young princess of the Oni nodded resolutely at my question.</p><p><br></p><p>I had returned from Zeref’s palace with Sakura and Lavy. It had been a while since I had opened my Restaurant so I decided to go ahead and clean the place.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s when Ainz returned from his hunting trip or as he says, a levelling spree. They had come in for some food and Shuna followed them.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing us working there, she decided to come and help me out here too and that’s how this conversation began.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Your place is just behind the door. It's not like she is going anywhere too far after all.\" Rimuru offered.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past week, when I was asleep, she was the one who was taking care of me.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to repay me for saving her village.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, even Ainz was offered the services of the ogres but Nazarick is not a good place for them. At least, not currently. Ainz was looking for undead from this world to take under his wings.</p><p><br></p><p>The current leader of the ogres, Benimaru was actually supportive of Shuna's decision because it would keep her in a relatively safe place which was just a few steps away from him.</p><p><br></p><p>I could understand his reasoning.</p><p><br></p><p>I did need some people for my restaurant as I was planning to expand more. With more people coming in, more staff were needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz would offer the maids he said but there was a problem with it and that was actually funny if nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>What he was actually worried about was that if any of the Nazarick people worked in my restaurant, he would have to keep up his chunni act all the time and my restaurant was the only place where he could be who he actually was.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed. He did say that if I opened any businesses outside my restaurant, he would lend me anyone I needed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Alright then. Unfortunately we don’t have any spare rooms so I will have to arrange for some housing nearby.\" I still don't know how to allow others to use the shop door without me being present all the time.</p><p><br></p><p>It might be something I unlock when the restaurant levels up.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not a problem, Sil-kun. Shuna-chan can share a room with me.” Lavy said, making us look at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not a problem, Silas-san.” Sakura agreed too. “Shuna-san can stay with us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure? It won’t be a problem for you all, right?” I asked, once more and they nodded again.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the door and let her in while stopping on hearing Rimuru's voice, just loud enough for me to head.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh and by the way don't get too <em>hard</em> on her.\" The ero-slime wriggled his eyebrows making mine twitch as well.</p><p><br></p><p>This bastard also told Ainz about the incident and I had never thought that I would see a lewd look on a skeleton face. It was disturbing in many different ways. They would just give me smug looks about Shuna and say nothing which was even worse than the teasing with Lavy.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You guys are not going to stop this, are you?\" I asked, resigned.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not until it stops being funny. I mean, you lucky bastard had an anime type ecchi encounter. We'll be damned as friends if we drop this without squeezing every drop of fun from this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well, at least I can get <em>hard</em>.\" I quipped.</p><p><br></p><p>The slime froze.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Bastard! You wanna fight huh?!….\"</p><p><br></p><p>I closed the door after me with a smile, ignoring the engaged shouts of the slime behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, two can play at this game.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Demiurge -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Ainz-sama, pardon my ignorance but this is the first time I have heard of the names Silas and Rimuru and I believe that this is shared by most of our fellow guardians. Might I ask you to enlighten us?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You may.\" Sounded the voice of the Supreme Being who sat upon his throne, his majesty somehow even more pronounced now.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if a layer of darkness obscured his presence, for those unworthy to not even be granted the honour of gazing at his awe-inspiring form.</p><p><br></p><p>He was stronger than a month ago… which should have been impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz-sama was already at the level cap. An overlord and yet he somehow became stronger. This had plagued his thoughts for several nights before Albedo of all people gave him the words of wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>He is a Supreme Being. Obviously something like this should be within his reach.</p><p><br></p><p>The Supreme Being spoke, looking at the entire gathering of the Nazarick staff. \"I believe that you all have the same thought in your mind?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Some members looked at the ground but didn't answer. \"Our apologies. We just enquired the information so that we may not slight the guests of Ainz-sama. We do not mean it as any insult towards the guest. Please punish me if we were too presumptuous.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas and Rimuru are… both Supreme Beings.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?!\"</p><p><br></p><p>The roars and exclaims of shock echoed throughout the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silence!\" He roared, making them all gather their bearings to listen to the Supreme One's instructions further.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What do you know of the Supreme Beings?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The forty one Supreme Beings created Nazarick and all of us. They are all beings of great power who have fought monsters and gods alike. Ultimately, they left for other worlds and only Ainz-sama stayed with us.\" His words brought up painful memories of all the guardians.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umu. But that's not all. Long before Nazarick was even formed, there were several hundred Supreme Beings.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Gasps of shock went everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thousands of years ago, even before the world of Yggdrasil, there was a great war, a war so big that entire planets were erased. Gods and monsters were killed and so were my fellow Supreme Beings while many of us were left severely weakened… including myself. At the end of the war, only less than fifty of us were left. Some were grieving for the death of friends and left for different worlds to spend their time alone.\" Ainz-sama paused and stared into space as if being reminded of the past days.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Among the ones who were left, there was one person who was probably the kindest of us all. He used all his powers, sacrificing everything he had, even the memories others had of him in the world except us forty one, even his own memories….to make a place which everyone of our lost brethren would be able to find. A restaurant connecting several worlds. A place which can only be opened in worlds with the souls of the Supreme Beings. For you see while our brethren died, he believed that their souls must have reincarnated somewhere… and he was right.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He could hear the sounds of each person's breath in the room and the heartbeats of the ones who were alive.</p><p><br></p><p>A history which none of them knew of. A hero among Supreme Beings, their sacrifices…</p><p><br></p><p>\"What was the name of the Supreme One?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Silas.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"He doesn't remember any of his past memories or has any of his past powers as do several others. But they are regaining their powers slowly. If and when you meet them, do not treat them with disrespect. Anyone in the restaurant can be people with the souls of former Supreme Beings, even the most common looking humans. They might look simple but one day they will all return to their own form. You are not to interfere with it in any way, nor talk about what you have heard about today lest it affects the Spell cast by Silas.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, Ainz-sama.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Rimuru is one of those people. He had reincarnated as a human but later on reincarnated as a Slime. His personality is very similar to Touch Me-san. A very kind and heroic person. He was and is one of my best friends. In future you all will be acting together with his subordinates.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"We will not let the name of the Great Tomb of Nazarick down.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Now, I believe that you both encountered these names from the memories of some of the Paleadis, correct.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Four of the combat maids bowed before confirming.</p><p><br></p><p>\"We have memories that we are to serve them but we didn't know their faces or even who they were so we thought that someone might be trying to control us somehow.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umu. A very reasonable and wise choice. Caution is the better part of safety. You have those names in your memories because they were unlocked when I came in contact with them. They were the superiors of your creators and saved their lives several times. You were made as a memoir for them in hopes that they will one day reunite with us… and that day has come.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"We will be honoured to fulfil the wishes of the Supreme Beings.\"</p><p><br></p><p>How lucky are they to be allowed such an honour?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ainz-sama, you didn't tell us what race Silas-sama is?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A Devil.\"</p><p><br></p><p>As expected of a Supreme Being.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Ainz–</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They bought that?</p><p><br></p><p>Well obviously they would. It took him a month to come up with that pile of bull crap and practice in front of the mirror. Now, he just needs to inform Rimuru and Silas of this.</p><p><br></p><p>They will not complain.</p><p><br></p><p>They will be getting two hot maids each after all. How can they complain?</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________x__________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As some of you might have noticed, this chapter was quite similar to the Snippets.

Would it be the same as being summoned to another world to fight a Demon King or something?</p><p><br></p><p>All that cliche about joining the adventurer’s guild, building a party and fighting some world ending danger….yeah, the thought turned me off.</p><p><br></p><p>Man, if I wanted a next life, I wanted something where I could relax or chill. I had no intention of risking my life as those isekai protagonists.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should I go and fight their battles for them?</p><p><br></p><p>They should go and do that themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only thing which appealed to me in those stories was the harem part. I mean, I was a normal guy after all.</p><p><br></p><p>The reality however is that isekai is….extremely boring.</p><p><br></p><p>At least my Isekai Adventures was not one which could be made into a novel.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, I didn’t even have any of the so-called cheat powers which were the staple of the Isekai anime troupes.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have the memories of my previous life so I guess it was not all bad.</p><p><br></p><p>It did help me stay ahead of most of the people of my age and excel at anything I tried. I couldn’t call my life very great but it wasn’t bad either. If anything it was the prime example of average.</p><p><br></p><p>I was born in a lower middle class family with loving parents. They have supported me by sending me to study in a big city despite having financial difficulties of their own which is more than I was expecting. For this I am and will be eternally grateful to them.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I wasn’t even sure that this world was different from my own because the places in this world were all the same, similar history as well.</p><p><br></p><p>My only clue was the people with different colours of hair and eyes which looked to be straight out of some anime.</p><p><br></p><p>In my last life, I was a businessman dealing mainly with stocks and while that life brought me money, it also distanced me away from my friends and family due to my busy schedule. In the end, when I was suffering from terminal cancer in a hospital, the only people who even came to visit me were my parents.</p><p><br></p><p>None of those so-called friends or business partners showed up for me.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, my dad who was just a simple teacher had his students visit him regularly even when he had retired. They talked and laughed with him and shared their achievements with him whenever they had time.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then I had often rolled my eyes at such things. My thoughts being that only money helped in the end but I was wrong. I didn’t want to experience such a life ever again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was during those times that I watched anime and manga to spend my time, taking some time to spend on myself and my family and I won’t lie, despite my inevitable end coming near, those were some of the most peaceful days of my life.</p><p><br></p><p>My experience with the stocks and the possible future knowledge helped me earn quite a bit on the side so I decided to follow my father’s example and became….a teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what brought me to this place.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the gates of the posh looking building that was the Kuoh Academy, in a small town near Tokyo.</p><p><br></p><p>The town was quiet and peaceful and the school was offering a well paying job so I accepted it.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and saw the students, mainly girls staring at me as I walked towards the school building.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, nine out of ten students were girls.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuoh Academy had turned co-ed this year after being a girls school for years and so the numbers were understandable. In fact, I was one of the first male teachers to be recruited here.</p><p><br></p><p>The funny thing was that I could see the blushes on the faces of the girls as they giggled and talked among themselves while spying looks at me.</p><p><br></p><p>….teenagers.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, their behaviour was also understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>I was my age. In fact, I was only a few years older than some of these girls at twenty one years of age.</p><p><br></p><p>My experiences and knowledge of my previous life helped me complete my studies very quickly. For this reason, I was far younger than any other teacher in this school. Many of these girls could mistake me for a senior if I were to wear their school uniform.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, where is the Principal’s Office?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and spotted a girl in glasses. She had long black hair and a no nonsense look on her face. Perhaps the most eye-catching thing about her were her eyes. Heterochromia, quite a rare trait.</p><p><br></p><p>But the thing which had attracted me was the badge on her chest. The vice president of the Student Council.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?” I called out to her.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was a bit surprised by my call and looked at me. “Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Could you please point me in the direction of the Principal’s office?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Are you new to this school? A transfer student?” She asked, making me chuckle.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked confused so I answered her question.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am indeed new to this school but I am not a student. My name is Takashi Furukawa and I am a new teacher in this school. This is my first day.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened and she quickly bowed. “My apologies, Furukawa-Sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t mind. Now, could you please show me the way?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Let me lead you, I am going to the Student Council room in the same direction.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Miss….?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsubaki, Shinra Tsubaki.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Shinra then.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl led me towards the Student Council room while I questioned her about some things about the school and the girl herself.</p><p><br></p><p>I came to know that she was a second year student who was elected as the Vice President of the Kuoh Academy by the student’s votes, a great achievement. Student Council President and Vice President were generally elected from among the third years. In fact even the President was a second year student. I guess they must be quite famous. And from the looks and frequent greetings of the students towards the girl and even some of the stink eyed looks thrown towards me from the male students, I could tell that my guess was not that far off the mark.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that she was quite well liked by everyone in the school.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the Principal’s office soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Miss Shinra.” I nodded towards the girl who bowed towards me formally.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, well mannered girl. Nice.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes later, I was having a meeting with the Principal who was impressed with my academic achievements and was more than glad to have me as a teacher in the school. He welcomed me and gave me a run down of my duties and even personally brought me to introduce me to the rest of the teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>It turned out that the previous teacher had to leave for a different country after marriage and the post was vacant.</p><p><br></p><p>That would explain the urgent hiring, I guess.</p><p><br></p><p>The school had a Middle School part attached to it but I was assigned to teach in the High School classes.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus started my life as a Teacher in Kuoh Academy.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope I can relax and work here.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes twitched as I looked at the one in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, I think I misheard you. Could you repeat that again?” I asked, truly doubting her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you please go out with me?” The girl repeated again, unbothered by my question but I could see the blush on her face. She was embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how did it come to this?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean sure I had received a love letter a day ago but for someone to come out and say it to my face like this was astonishing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Gremory, if you are being forced by someone to do this, you can tell me. I will help you out. But if this is a game of dare or something similar, I will treat this time as a joke and request that you do not make a habit of this.” I replied in a calm and collected tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“No! I am not being forced by anyone nor is this a game. I am asking you out because I l-like you.” She replied blushing.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. While I am flattered by your feelings towards me, I will have to politely decline your request. I am sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened in shock as if it was really that shocking for a teacher to reject romantic advances from a student.</p><p><br></p><p>Alright, I will accept that she was beautiful. Actually screw that, she was downright gorgeous, especially the crimson hair framing her perfect face and a figure which was completely beyond her years. Let me repeat, Rias Gremory was drop dead gorgeous. I could see why she was the most famous girl in the school, one of the so-called four great Onee-sama’s of the school, a title which I couldn’t for the life of me wrap my head around.</p><p><br></p><p>But a relationship between teacher and a student was frowned upon by society and was completely forbidden in most places too.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no intention of pushing my nose in such a mess.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She felt her face burning from embarrassment as she hurried back to the Old School Building and locked herself in her room and screamed in her pillow, letting out all her embarrassment. She could still feel her ears get hot when she recalled the incident from minutes ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank Satans, there was no one else around due to the barrier she had set or she wouldn’t be able to show her face around the school for a few days.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ughhh, it better be worth it.” She raised and a virtual screen appeared in front of her eyes. Written on the screen was the quest.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorial Quest: Baby Steps</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Every long journey begins with baby steps.

The same one from all those manga, novels and anime she had seen and read. What were the chances?</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment nothing happened and she was disappointed but before she could think of anything else, she felt a change in her body.</p><p><br></p><p>Her Demonic Power surged uncontrollably and it kept on rising before stopping after a certain point.</p><p><br></p><p>Stunned, she checked her state to find that her demonic power had indeed doubled.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is….real?” A whisper came out of her lips because even when the proof was right in front of her, she was finding it hard to believe.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t know anything which could increase someone’s demonic power like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mind went back to how all this had started, two days ago.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She had woken up to see a screen in front of her eyes and thought she was still sleeping and all of it was probably a dream of some kind.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Do you want to have the power to change your fate?”</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Yes/No”</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In her sleepy state, she clicked the yes option and closed her eyes again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only when her eyes opened after some time and the screen had not disappeared that she was completely roused from her sleepy state and stared at the screen in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Welcome, Rias Gremory</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations on gaining a chance to change your fate.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Was someone using magic on her while she was asleep?</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly used several spells to check herself and even tried to dispel the magic but to no avail.</p><p><br></p><p>Every check showed a negative result.</p><p><br></p><p>A pit grew in her stomach and she hurried out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Akeno! Where are you?” She called out her best friend and queen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, what is it?” Akeno asked, coming out of her room.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you see this? She tried to speak but couldn’t. Her body would just not move at her command.

Kuoh Academy was actually one of the premiere institutes of the country so this much was expected. Perhaps the only thing which embarrassed me a bit were the looks the girls threw me sometimes. Dammit, I looked too young.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, I started growing a beard to look a bit older but this only made them fawn even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, these girls are too horny for their own good sometimes. That said, they had never come out and done something like this</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head, shaking off these thoughts. “Maybe, it was just them playing some kind of game?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, I couldn’t think of any other reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, what to eat tonight?” I sighed, facing a much bigger problem than some teenage girl confessing her feelings to me. What to cook for dinner?</p><p><br></p><p>I, despite the experiences of both my lives, have always sucked at cooking.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I did try to learn something to cook for myself but the salt and pepper always rebelled in my hands and fire always urged me to try my fire bending skills on it….and I, being the weak mortal that I am, gave in to those feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>And what can I say, the few pieces of chicken legs never stood a chance against my peerless fire bending skills and got reduced to ashes.</p><p><br>Sigh….such is the loneliness of the strong. Fated to forever live a life where they cannot enjoy a meal made by their own hands….except cereal. Boiling milk was no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>But cereal for dinner was not something I could eat.</p><p><br></p><p>I was new to this place so I hadn’t hired any maids to cook. I guess I will have to go out and eat. I couldn’t stand eating instant ramen another day.</p><p><br></p><p>With that in mind, I put on my coat and left my house.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Kuoh was a very quiet place, away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo and yet not isolated so there were amenities of all types available nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around the place and found a small restaurant nearby and had my dinner there.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the time, I decided to go out for a walk to look around the place and know where everything was.</p><p><br></p><p>Deciding to rest for a while in the park before going back, I heard something nearby and turned to the side to see a black cat sitting on the bench and staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey there. Are you out for a walk after dinner too?” I joked, slowly going forward to pat its head. To my surprise, the cat didn’t shy away and actually enjoyed the ministrations.</p><p><br></p><p>The cat’s reactions made me smile as she tried to paw at my hand when I tried tickling her. I guess I was always a cat person after all.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked the cat up and brought her to my lap, playing with her. “Such a good girl, aren’t you?” Is she domesticated?</p><p><br></p><p>Because with how relaxed she was with me, she didn’t seem to be a wild cat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get lost?” But then again, there are no collars on her.</p><p><br></p><p>The cat was however not interested in any of this and just pawed at my hands, still busy with playing.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if you have nowhere to go, would you like to come with me?” I asked and the cat suddenly stopped and stared at me, her golden eyes staring into mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Wait….she understood?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this really a stray cat and not domesticated?</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, in any case, I will just return her in case I find anyone searching for her.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a chance that something might happen to her if I left her alone outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then. Come with me. I have milk and cookies. Oh God, that sounds so wrong.” I laughed at my own joke.</p><p><br></p><p>The cat seemed to laugh in my arms too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you like my joke? Sigh, such a good girl. Not many seem to appreciate my sense of humour. Alright come, let’s get you home for a bath and some food.”</p><p><br></p><p>I carried the cat and walked back towards my home. On the way, I made sure to pick up something for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, what do I call you? Hmm, let me think. Okay, how about Yoruichi?” I suddenly remembered the figure of one of my favourite anime characters from my previous life.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yoruichi is one of my favourite anime characters. She was actually a Shinigami and could turn into a cat….” And with that I walked back home talking to her all the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Looks like I won’t be living alone in my home anymore.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the figure sleeping in front of her and considered what to do next.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything started when a screen appeared in front of her all of a sudden few days ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you want power to change your fate?” It had asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She had considered it a joke or some kind from that Monkey Bikou and agreed to it and that’s how she was stuck in all this mess.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorial Quest - Baby Steps</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Getting things ready for Yoru-chan took more time than I had realised, finally leaving me in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I have to wait till school is over.</p><p><br></p><p>The other teachers were eating in the staff room and I didn’t want to feel awkward as the only one not eating so I decided to take a walk around the school. Maybe the library would be a good place.</p><p><br></p><p>With this in mind, I went to the library.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuoh Academy Library was huge and yet had a tranquil atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>There were not many people in the library at that time either as most of them were out to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up a book and within moments was lost in reading.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, I sensed someone sitting in front of me and looked up.</p><p><br></p><p>Purple eyes stared back at me.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a moment to realise who the girl smiling at me was.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno Himejima, the second most famous girl in this school. Actually, hold on a moment, who makes these rankings again?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t they have anything better to do?</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara sensei, why are you sitting alone in the library? Aren’t you eating your lunch?” She asked me with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Himejima, right. I am not alone in the library….” I started speaking but realised midway that others had left the library when I wasn’t paying attention so I changed my statement in between. “You are here too.”</p><p><br></p><p>She giggled at my statement. “That’s true I guess. By the way, are you not eating lunch?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I….didn’t have the time to get lunch in a hurry today. I will eat something later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s no good, you know. Taking care of your health is important. After all, I know many people who would be very sad if their favourite teacher gets ill. You know what? Here, I cooked extra today. Please share some with me.” She said as she opened a bento box on the table. When did she bring out the bento box without me realising?</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your offer, Miss Himejima but I couldn’t possibly….” I tried denying but by then she had already separated some for me and if I were honest….the food looked delicious. It was probably the best looking meal I had seen since leaving home for work.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently my stomach agreed too as it made a gurgling sound at the sight of the food.</p><p><br></p><p>This made the girl in front of me giggle and I couldn’t help but blush at the untimely rebellion of my stomach. In my defence, the food looked awesome.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then don’t mind if I take a bite.” I thanked her and picked up the chopsticks and took a bite of the food. “Oh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How is it? Did you like it, Sensei?” She asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is amazing.” I took another bite.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? I am pleased that you like my cooking.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait what! You cooked this?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, was this girl a genius chef or did I just suck that bad at cooking?</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I cook my bento myself.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….you are seriously talented, Miss Himejima. This is probably the second best cooking I have eaten in my whole life.” I praised.</p><p><br></p><p>“What only second? Who is the first then? Your girlfriend?” She teased.</p><p><br></p><p>“I rolled my eyes. “Interested in those things already? Then again, I guess you are at that age now. But for your answer, no. My favourite cook is my mother.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. You are very close to your Okaa-sama, Sensei?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She has always supported me in my dreams. I would be an ungrateful twerp if I didn’t like them.” I replied as I took another bite of the food. “This is seriously good. You would make your future husband a lucky man, Miss Himejima.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara ara.” She laughed with a hand on her cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>I finished half of her food without realising while we talked when another person entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked back and it was Akeno who spoke. “Rias!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Akeno and….sensei?” She asked surprised and then looked around the room. “What are you doing here, Akeno?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I saw sensei reading alone in the library and decided to talk to him. Turns out that sensei didn’t have his lunch today so I offered him some of mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei didn’t have lunch?” She asked, suddenly looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I didn’t have time to buy something today.” I answered awkwardly. The incident from yesterday came to the forefront of my mind again.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried not to let it bother me as the girl sat down in front of me, beside Akeno and put up a bento box on the table. “Then sensei, please have some of mine too. I was offered some cookies from some juniors and I don’t think I will be able to eat everything.” She opened the box and slid it towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>This box, while not even close to Akeno’s bento, was also good.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I was already eating one student’s lunch so it would be awkward if I rejected hers….thinking of this, I, a bit hesitantly took a bite of her food.</p><p><br></p><p>As I ate the food, I saw the girl’s face brighten up.</p><p><br></p><p>Ignore it.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls talked to me for a while and it was almost the end of the lunch break so we decided to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way back, I heard some commotion and saw a group of students chasing three boys with shinai in their hands.</p><p><br></p><p>What the hell?!</p><p><br></p><p>Are they fighting on school premises?</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly ran there to see what was going on and the two girls followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls had the three boys surrounded between them and it looked like they were going to give them the beating of their lifetime.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?” I asked, stopping the girls from attacking as they looked towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Furukawa-Sensei!”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the brown haired girl. “Murayama, correct? What is going on here? What are you girls doing? Why are you attacking these boys?” I asked, seriously. This was the first time I had encountered this kind of behaviour in this school.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered these students.</p><p><br></p><p>They were mostly first years.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, these….these perverts were peeping at us in the changing room.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” I was taken aback at the accusation and looked at the three boys who were scared shit at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked. These kinds of allegations were quite serious. It was better to confirm it before taking action.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sensei. It’s not the first time either. This year alone, it’s the sixth time we have caught them doing so. Who knows how many times they have escaped without being caught.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....hah!” I was actually stunned and at a loss of words. “Sixth time?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you girls complain to the teachers?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We told the Student Council and they said they would take care of the matter but these three always return back to their usual behaviour. They are infamous in the school as the Perverted Trio.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a vein bulge on my forehead at the words of the girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Don’t worry. Let me take care of them. Also, I understand the anger and frustration of you all for the breach of your privacy but please, resorting to violence is not the way society works. Don’t degrade yourself for this.” I reassured them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sensei.” The girls looked a bit reluctant but still moved back.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked in front of the boys and I realised that one of them was not looking at me even as I stood in front of him and was instead staring behind me. It took me a moment to realise that he was looking at Rias and Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boobs.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Did this guy….just say what I think he did?</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the reaction of the girls, especially as Rias crossed her arms a bit defensively while the rest looked at them as if they were lower than bugs, it seems that I was not mishearing things.</p><p><br></p><p>This confirms it. These guys….they are really the culprits.</p><p><br></p><p>I moved slightly, standing right in front of the two girls, covering them from his gaze and looked at the enraged students.</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise that I will take care of this matter. You all are here to learn with the peace of your mind. If you don’t feel protected here, it’s the fault of us teachers. I will definitely give you all a satisfactory answer.” I reassured them again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards both Rias and Akeno. “Thank you for today but I have to take care of this matter first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please take your time, sensei.” They nodded and moved aside. </p><p><br></p><p>Finally looking at the three guys, I ordered in a cold tone. “<em>Follow me</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first place I led them was to the Teacher’s office and asked around if any of the teacher’s knew about the whole mess they had been creating.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that the teacher’s didn’t know everything and had left everything to the Student Council because the Student Council President had reassured them that she could take care of this matter….which seemed utterly stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>As this was not even the first offence, I had their parents called over to the school and personally had them suspended for a month.</p><p><br></p><p>Even their parents seemed to have given up.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt kinda sorry for them but then again, if they couldn’t even teach their kids basic manners, then some fault for it lies in them as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Next up, I called for one of the staff to help fix the place where the fools were peeping from. Seriously, how was there a hole in the wall and if so, why does no one fix it?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when everything was done, it was time to deal with the Student Council.</p><p><br></p><p>I was seriously pissed at these brats.</p><p><br></p><p>I knocked at the door of the Student Council Room and the door was opened by the girl who had shown me to the Principal’s office on my first day. Tsubaki Shinra.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Miss Shitori in there? I have something to talk to her about.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, yes. Please come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The office looked like a teacher’s room. In fact, it was actually better than the teacher’s room. What even was the work of the Student Council for them to need something like this at their disposal?</p><p><br></p><p>But let’s not get off topic.</p><p><br></p><p>The students in the room stood up and greeted me and I nodded back.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have had a very tiring day today so let’s get straight to the point, Miss Shitori. What did the Student Council do to deal with the case of the three first year boys who were caught peeping on the girls of the Kendo Club?”</p><p><br></p><p>They were taken aback by my question but answered nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were punished by extra duty after school.” She answered, straightening her glasses, something which was unnecessary as it was already perfectly in place.</p><p><br></p><p>“I assume that was the first time you encountered this problem. While a bit light, I accept your reasoning. Then what about the next four times?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br>“What did you do the next four times they were caught doing the same. I was informed that the students had complained to the Student Council. Did you get the complaints or were they lying?” I asked, staring at her, looking for any hints of lies.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were punished accordingly.” She said after some time.</p><p><br></p><p>“‘Accordingly’ is a very flexible word, Miss Shitori. It varies from person to person. I would like to know the exact details of their punishment because if they were not bothered to correct their behaviour, it was evident that your methods didn’t work. Did you inform the teachers about this?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….took permission from the teachers and they allowed me to deal with the matter.” She defended.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many times?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was only told that you informed them once. Only once were they told that such a thing had happened on the school premises. I think you misunderstood something. When he gave you the permission to deal with this matter, it was only for that once. Then what of the next four times. Why did you not inform the teachers of this matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I assure you….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Assurances don’t run the school, Miss Shitori. Actions do. I have heard some good things about you from the teachers so I will give you this advice. You are here to learn, so learn. If something is beyond your capabilities, ask the person in charge to deal with it. Knowing when to pull back is also a skill necessary in management. In this case, you, by not going to the required authority on time, the problem which could have been solved much earlier lasted longer. Tell me, are you perhaps friends with the boys?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought of several reasons why the incidents were never reported and this was one of the top ones.</p><p><br></p><p>“Furukawa-sensei, are you insinuating that I am covering for the boys?” She asked hotly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yes. Look at it from my position and tell me if that doesn’t sound probable?” I asked. “Or if you have any better reason, give me one?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t want to escalate the matter to not affect the reputation of the school and ruin the lives of those boys.” She replied, angry at the accusation but this reply just made the vein in my head throb even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and tried to control my temper and was finding it extremely hard to do so. “Tell me something, Miss Shitori….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”<br><br></p><p>“Are you stupid!” I bursted out. They were taken aback at my outburst but I didn’t give them any chances of taking back and went on.</p><p><br></p><p>“You think covering for those fools is saving the reputation of the school?! Peeping is a crime punishable by law in this country, do you know that?” I asked and saw her mouth opening but she closed it again. “Well, do you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then pray tell me, what would happen if these same students got the impression that their behaviour was not that serious, and started doing this outside the school and got caught? Or would those girls chasing and beating other students in broad daylight be a good thing? Would that bring great laurels to the school’s reputation?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened like a fish and was about to reply but I raised my hand and shut her up.</p><p><br></p><p>“And pray tell me this, if the problem continues like it has been, do you think the girls of the Kendo Club or any others who were the victims of their crimes are just going to keep quiet? That they won’t complain to their parents and the word that Kuoh Academy has a deplorable security for girls won’t spread? There are so many things wrong with your reasoning that I could stand here all day and lecture you and we still won’t be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath calming myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was told by some teachers that you are planning to open a school of your own and wanted to learn management by the means of this position. Well, if this is your attitude then you would perhaps make for a great businesswoman but I promise you that you would be an incredibly shitty educator.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei!”<br><br></p><p>“What, Miss Shitori? Am I wrong?” I challenged and she actually backed down. “You were selected by the votes of the students of this school, correct?” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“They selected you because they trusted you enough to protect them and help maintain a safe environment for them to learn. But here you are completely ignoring the very students who put their faith in you….to do whatever it is that you were doing. You did nothing to solve their problems. Hell, you all probably didn’t even investigate this matter. Those three were peeping through a hole in the changing room….all six times from the same place. The least you could have done was get someone to get it fixed. Sigh….what a disappointment.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked down and I observed that she had her fists clenched and there were actually tears in the corner of her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and left the room leaving the Student Council in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>The day’s events exhausted me.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am here with a new story.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Recently, I read a Naruto fic with a similar premise and found it hilarious and was thinking of writing one of my own.

    "content": "<p><strong>To Be A Hero</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 10: Closures</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We looked at the clown, groaning in pain as the magic did its work.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally dragging the soul of Jahil wouldn’t have been so hard. The reason for the difficulty was the fact that Footman himself was made of tens of thousands of souls all mashed up together in ritualistic mix.</p><p><br></p><p>This made not only hiding inside the gaps of the soul easier for someone with Jahil’s magical expertise, especially considering that he had the help of Feldway, but also made it hard to separate the guy away.</p><p><br></p><p>It would have been impossible for normal people to do this but for Rimuru and I, it wasn’t that big of a problem. The combined power of Raphael and Solomon made the work a breeze.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, a shadow-like figure burst out of Footman’s soul and rushed out at a quick speed, trying to leave the room and escape, only to be met face first by the Barriers cast using Uriel and modified to contain souls by Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>Got him!</p><p><br></p><p>Within moments, Solomon manipulated the barriers to shrink around him, trapping him inside the small cubic barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>The form of the monster slowly became visible mostly as a ghostly shadow as he didn’t possess a body anymore but still clear to show everyone his identity.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jahil!” I heard the Elven Ancestor growl, something which seemed quite contrary to her character. Even the other people in the room were pissed.</p><p><br></p><p>I, however, couldn't be bothered by them as I had to concentrate on Footman.</p><p><br></p><p>Jahil bursting out of him had injured his soul which Solomon was currently patching up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru, heal Footman.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” She directly used some of the potion on him to restore him back to full health although it would still take some time for him to regain consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Kagali and nodded. “You can take him. He is free now.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had a complicated look on her face as she nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are welcome.” I answered and again looked towards Jahil who was now struggling desperately to break through the barriers and escape but to no avail.</p><p><br></p><p>Throwing several more seals on it, I turned towards the rest. “So….who wants a go at him?”</p><p><br></p><p>My question immediately got an answer with Milim directly walking to the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Sylvia gritted her teeth but didn’t go forward so I guess they had decided something among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright Milim. I will create a barrier around you both and then remove the barrier around him. Be careful though, the guy can be tricky. Make sure he doesn’t catch you off guard.” I said, patting her head. She nodded inattentively, her eyes still locked on to the ghostly form in the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then. Here I go. Oh, and please don’t destroy the dungeon. I don’t think I would be able to hold back if you decide to go all out. On second thought, lend me a hand, Rimuru, Vritra.” I called out.</p><p><br></p><p>Vritra appeared right next to me leaning on my side. “Need my help, do you? Alright, I will help you out today. I have been in a very good mood since I had a great sleep last night.” She smirked and threw me a wink. Rimuru smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not the time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kihihihi so precious. Alright then, let’s get to work.” She lifted her hand and barriers formed around Milim and Jahil.</p><p><br></p><p>These barriers were completely different from Uriel.</p><p><br></p><p>While Uriel focused on Space Manipulation to ‘Bind’ something, these barriers focused on ‘Isolating’ things.</p><p><br></p><p>It went along with Vritra’s Ultimate Skill’s theme, the Prison Dragon Vritra.</p><p><br></p><p>FInally when the barriers were completed, I released the barrier around Jahil and an explosion happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim transformed directly into her assault mode.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not holding back, ya know.” I gritted my teeth and tried to maintain the barrier while Milim was bashing the fool until nothing was left.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, she is angry alright.” Vritra commented casually but I could see that she was actually focusing consciously to keep the Barrier up.</p><p><br></p><p>The barrier created by a True Hero, a True Demon Lord and a True Dragon was facing difficulties. It went on to show just how absurdly broken Milim’s powers were.</p><p><br></p><p>After what seemed like hours, the attacks stopped and I scanned for any signs of Jahil and found nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ancestor of the High Human race, one of the first creations of Twilight Valentine, Jahil….permanently gone.</p><p><br></p><p>The barriers were dropped and Rimuru went ahead and hugged Milim while I turned towards the rest of the crowd. “Could you please give us some time. Milim is a bit emotional right now and I am sure many of you are in the same condition too. We can convene our meeting in a few hours.” I requested.</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Sylvia took one last look towards the place where Jahil was and finally her anger turned into helplessness as she let out a sigh and bowed towards me. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded at her and she left with Kagali and the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Vritra wasn’t good with these kinds of things and so she went back inside my body to rest, leaving only Rimuru, Milim and me in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the sleeping Milim and then at Rimuru who was caressing her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene looked quite fulfilling somehow. Both of them liked it.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru liked mothering her and Milim enjoyed being pampered.</p><p><br></p><p>It was understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>She never experienced the love of parents due to Veldanava and his wife passing away after her birth.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole situation saddened me too. It kinda made me associate her with myself.</p><p><br></p><p>In my case, after our parents passed away, Isiah and I were left alone similar to her and her dragon. And then I was dragged away here just as her dragon was dragged away from her due to the foolishness of Jahil. It made me understand what she was going through to some extent too.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I wanted her to be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh, I wonder how Isiah is doing right now?</p><p><br></p><p>How much time has passed in that world?</p><p><br></p><p>How much longer would it take for me to gather all of Veldanava’s memories so that I can find a way back home? The extra skills I gained yesterday have been putting stress on my soul too.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess this was the reason why Raphael always kept on making new Skills by merging the old ones, to reduce the stress on Rimuru’s soul by decreasing the number of Ultimate Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite my stronger than normal soul due to being a reincarnator, twice over and having a Dragonoid body and soul, there was still a limit to how much I could contain before it starts to put a strain on my soul too.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, I only had room for one or two more but even that would be pushing it.</p><p><br></p><p>I might have to find a way to make my body stronger to contain more skills. The next step would obviously be to gain Divinity and become something like a Divine Human or something similar.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was easier said than done.</p><p><br></p><p>Any ideas Sol?</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Host has two ways to become stronger. First is the path of a Divine Human in which you have to gain divinity through your Human Side. This has to be done by experience and is not easy to achieve and will not allow you to use the full extent of Star King Dragon, Veldanava’s powers. Second would be to gain Divinity through your Dragon side. This method can even help the Host take one extra step and become a True Dragon himself, gaining full access to the magic and powers of Veldanava.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Becoming a True Dragon?</p><p><br></p><p>How would that work?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, sure Rimuru could become one too but….</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Host is different from Rimuru Tempest as Slimes have a different physiology, allowing them to embody the structure of other creatures with relative ease. You on the other hand will have to increase the power of your Dragon side more and slowly bring about the chance.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“And how would I do that?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“It is suggested to obtain the Dragon Factors of True Dragons and absorb it using the Ultimate Skill, Beelzebuth, Lord of Gluttony analyse and assimilate it within your body. The process will increase the power of both your body and soul, thus allowing you to house more Skills. According to the information provided from the Host’s memories, the Star King Dragon, Veldanava had more than fourteen Ultimate Skills at his full power.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Become as strong as Veldanava….</p><p><br></p><p>That guy was the creator of this whole Multiverse dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>But if that’s what it will take, then so be it.</p><p><br></p><p>“How do I obtain the Dragon factors?” I asked in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Body parts like nails or hair of beings containing the Dragon Factor should be enough.”</em> Sol answered.</p><p><br></p><p>That should be easy.</p><p><br></p><p>I currently had access to two True Dragons and they would happily give me a strand of their hair.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Milim Nava’s hair also qualifies. It is suggested that the Host obtains it too.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><br></p><p>She could use the Star King Dragon Magic too.</p><p><br></p><p>Sol had already told me about this before but I was hesitating till now but it looks like I have to do this.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long will it take to assimilate the factors and will I be able to work while doing so?”</p><p><br></p><p><em>“The power will depend on the Dragon it was from and the compatibility with the Host. You will be unconscious for a period of time while assimilating.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Then let’s do it after the mess with Mariabell is taken care of.” This matter was the most urgent one.</p><p><br></p><p>I still got a strand of Milim’s hair though, making Rimuru raise an eyebrow so I explained to her the situation over our link. She agreed and asked Veldora for a strand of his hair too while Vritra was ready from the beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>Great.</p><p><br></p><p>I could finally see a path to return back.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the room with Rimuru and saw everyone had gathered there already.</p><p><br></p><p>Sylvia, Elmensia, and their family, Kagali and her subordinates, Gazel, Leon, Luminous, Hinata and the rest gathered there too.</p><p><br></p><p>On our side were Dino and his subordinates, Masaomi, Shiro, Shion, Diablo and Irisviel and finally in the corner of the room were Vritra and Veldora, chilling with Ramiris.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim was sleeping so we didn’t disturb her.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the seat and as the host, convened the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for the delay. Let’s start the meeting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. You are already doing a lot.” Sylvia said and Gazel nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Leon and Luminous didn’t speak anything and just sat there without any words.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like to start with the announcement that Yuuki Kagurazaka’s threat has been taken care of. We have however encountered some other problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What problems?” Gazel asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mariabell Rosso is planning to free Yuuki Kagurazaka.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, she tried to control me through her Skill. It failed but she doesn’t know that yet.” I finished and sensed several auras fluctuating at that moment from our subordinate’s side while Sylvia had the look of incredulity on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Children nowadays are really dumb.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sylvia spoke finally.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, she’s a reincarnator. She is the reincarnation of Granbell’s wife, her own grandmother.” Rimuru added, rolling her eyes. “So a hag in a kid’s body. You shouldn’t feel bad for her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“His Wife?” Gazel was surprised at this too.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I, of course, didn’t have enough evidence to keep her under custody so I had to let her go. Keeping Yuuki on hold was already making many people suspicious of us. I could hardly afford doing the same for Mariabell, especially with her family controlling the majority of the Council of the West, especially with Granbell Rosso backing them up. It would have been….quite troublesome. So I let her go in the end.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gazel nodded. “Indeed. If something had happened to her, your Kingdom would have been blacklisted from the Council of the West, not to mention a war could have started.”</p><p><br></p><p>Here Rimuru continued. “Yeah, that’s why I ordered my people to let her enter her Kingdom, pass through a town or two and <em>then</em> finish her off.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Gazel’s eyes twitch at the statement but he wisely kept his mouth shut and didn’t comment on this.</p><p><br></p><p>“And I am glad that I did. I was able to find something interesting which made me drop….or rather postpone the idea of finishing off that woman. She is planning to launch a sneak attack to try and rescue Yuuki Kagurazaka. If he dies, she will just blame everything on Sal. If he flees, even then Sal gets blamed. Either way she wins. And in the worst case that their plan fails, she can still control him using her Skill, Greed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We want to catch her red handed and oust them. That's why we don’t wish to release the news about Yuuki Kagurazaka’s death. Our final plan is to release the news that Yuuki Kagurazaka had died some time ago and his position had been taken by one of Demon Lord’s subordinates who was posing as Yuuki. This way, we can prevent the Free Guild from facing any backlash. There is also the relation between Yuuki and the Eastern Empire. Did you guys get any information on that side?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Sylvia nodded and looked towards Kagali who spoke for the first time in the meeting. “Yuuki was working with the Cerberus Organisation to spy and plant his people in different kingdoms as well as weaken the foundation of the kingdoms so that when the Eastern Empire attacked, they would be assisted by his people. They controlled the Underworld and the Black Market, making them a decent power behind the scenes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you give us the names of the members and the location of the organisation’s headquarters?” Gazel asked and the girl in question nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, a swift response will be needed to wipe out the entire organisation as soon as we can so that they don’t get any time to reorganise and retaliate.” Erald added as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you know about the relationship between Yuuki and Mariabell? Actually, what do you know about Mariabell Rosso, the Rosso Family and the Council of the West?” I asked. “While I do know bits and pieces about them, I don’t have the details and in our case, we need every detail we can get about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “While she is the princess of the Kingdom<a href=\"https://tensura.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdom_of_Siltrosso\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> of Siltrosso</a>, a small constituent nation of the western alliance north of the <a href=\"https://tensura.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdom_of_Falmuth\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kingdom of Fal</a>….Camelot, the truth is anything but that simple.” She looked at others who were now paying attention to her and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Royal family of Siltrosso is called the Rosso family and it built its strong roots in the Western Nations and owns all authority. The members of their family have a hand in every powerful nation, including the likes of Falmuth and <a href=\"https://tensura.fandom.com/wiki/Englassia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Englassia</a>. It was also their family's contributions that led to the creation of the <a href=\"https://tensura.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_the_West\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Western States Council</a>. To the outside world, it appears that the Council elects its members from every nation. But they are, in fact, mostly members of the Rosso family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I got some similar information from my spies too although never enough to verify things concretely.” Gazel nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>And their increased presence grants them enough prestige to surpass powerful nations. Yuuki Kagurazaka's funds to found the Freedom Association also came from the Rossos. If anything, these elders can be considered the rulers of the Western Nations and their leader is Granbell.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is their goal?” Sylvia asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dominating the <a href=\"https://tensura.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">human</a> world through the economy, that is the ultimate goal of the Rosso family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch….I should have killed Rosso the first time we fought.” Luminous clicked her tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wouldn’t have been good. That guy….well he’s complicated.” I spoke, remembering some things about him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all, he is the apprentice of Rudra Nam Ul Nasca, the Emperor of the Eastern Empire.” I said, eliciting surprise from all the participants. “He was sent here for the same task which the Cerberus is doing, weaken the surrounding nations and make them prime for the invasion of the Empire.”</p><p><br>“So, he’s an enemy?” Gazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. As I said, it’s complicated. Granbell actually betrayed Rudra later down the line but still might have connections with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Granbell trained under Emperor Rudra Nam Ul Nasca, and was for a time hailed as the Light Chosen hero. To manifest his, and his master's, lofty goal of protecting humanity from the numerous threats that plagued the world, he left Rudra's side and departed for the West, going on to face many powerful adversaries, the biggest among them being Luminous Valentine.” I looked towards the girl who just huffed.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Told you she was a tsundere.”</em> Rimuru’s voice sounded in my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Meeting with you made him have a mutual understanding and he really worked towards the peace of the Western Nations for years to come. Even the Council of the West was originally formed for this very reason, to increase the cooperation between the nations. All these efforts bore fruits as well, establishing a thousand year period of peace in these nations. He also kept the advance of Demons from Guy Crimson under control with the help of an Insectar friend and subordinate of his.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what changed? I can’t see how such a person became someone who wants to dominate the world.” The Empress asked, curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grief. His fall came due to Grief. He changed when his wife was killed by an opposing human faction. The man fell into depression and madness, even going so far as to preserve her corpse and use the ‘Raise Dead’ spell on her to turn her into a ‘Servant’. He kept her stored in the ‘Love Energy’ supplied to him by.” I looked at Luminous who was gawking at me right now and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just how….how do you even know all this?” She asked, and for the first time I sensed curiosity and not her usual frustration or snark in the question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well what can I say? Sometimes it seems as if the world speaks to me. I just know things even if I don’t know how.” I shrugged nonchalantly, making her fume.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean how in the hell was I going to tell her about the whole isekai and this world being a story in my world.</p><p><br></p><p>To my surprise, some of them even nodded as if what I said was understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>….One day, I would like to know what goes on in their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that</p><p><br></p><p>“Over time, his goals shifted from protecting the Western Nations to ruling over the Western Nations using the Rosso family. He became active for many years behind the scenes as the ruler of the Western economy, using the Kingdom of Siltrosso as his primary base while having a sole monopoly on the region's organised crime. Mariabell Rosso is his greatest hope of achieving this goal and thus he is very protective of her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just that and not because she is the reincarnation of his wife?” Sylvia asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah…..about that. Mariabell remembers the memories of her previous life. The life in which she was the wife of Granbell was the one before that. In her previous life, she was someone from Rimuru or my world or one of the parallel worlds. I can’t really say. My memories of several worlds are quite similar, at least in terms of their history. It all mixed up. It’s not that important anyways. The thing which is important is that she has a Sin Series Unique Skill, Greed which allows her to control people. She tried to use it on me and she was probably using it on Yuuki too, although that guy was immune due to his Anti-Skill Skill.” I looked at Kagali for confirmation and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So if you kill Mariabell, you have to go to war with Granbell.” Gazel concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Correction. If we kill Mariabell and Granbell finds out….are we going to have to go to war with Granbell.” Rimuru interrupted making everyone look at her. “What? That bitch tried to control my Sal. Do you know how long I waited for Sal and how difficult it was for us to meet? And now I finally have my dream life, good friends and a family and suddenly an uppity bitch comes out of nowhere and thinks she can mind control my boyfriend. Well, she’s got another thing coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Okay….I knew she was angry but….wow.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not the only one stunned. Even Gazel, Erald and Leon looked surprised at her statement. It was the reaction of Sylvia, Dino and their subordinates which surprised me. They seemed to think it was quite a normal and obvious reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it kinda was but I couldn’t help but feel there was something else going on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay Rimuru, calm down. No need to get too angry.” I patted her back, trying to calm her down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am calm, Sal.” She suddenly turned towards Sylvia. “Tell me Lady Sylvia. As a married woman, do you think I am overreacting to the assault on my partner?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am quite surprised you let her go back to Siltrosso in the first place. I would have skinned the woman alive if she had done something like that to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>….stop throwing oil to the fire, Sylvia-san. My lips twitched at her comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, alright. Let’s concentrate on the matter at hand. Any idea when they are attacking?” Gazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two days later.” Rimuru answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. In that case, let’s deal with them then. If she disappears somewhere, not even Rosso will be able to attack us directly without any proof. Or at least he wouldn’t be able to move the entire nation. If he is alone, that won’t be a problem, right? After all, you are a Hero too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I could probably take him on.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, my King. We can stop him if he ever decides to attack.” Dino said from behind me, making me look at him in surprise. Was the Slothful King talking about doing work? Man….some people have different personalities in this world. I think I should keep relying on my meta that much from now on.But still, a smile formed on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I appreciate the sentiment but that would reveal you to the public and they could use your identity as a Demon Lord as a propaganda against Camelot. You are already doing a lot in helping me train the people of the Kingdom. Let me take care of a few things too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not fail you.” He nodded, and I could help but feel that the guy was pleased and so were his subordinates. Were they like this?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Kagali who continued. “They have a group called the ‘Blood Shadows’, which comprises of many A and S Ranked fighters, even many Otherworlders who were summoned by the countries under the Rosso family. There are even members of the Western Church under their control. All of them are bound with spells to follow the Rosso Family’s orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>A frown appeared on my face at the mention of the Otherworlders being summoned and bound. Memories of my own past flashing in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous looked pissed off too.</p><p><br></p><p>She was extremely possessive of what she considers hers and so learning that her own people were involved and they were even puppets of the Rosso would be incredibly enraging for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then you don’t need to worry either. We have an alliance. If they attack you, they will be attacking a member of our alliance and they will suffer. Moreover, without the Free Guild, they will not be able to attack you either.” Luminous looked at Kagali. “Do you have any names?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I only know the names of the commanders of the group. While the entire group is under the Five Elders, the field commanders of the group are Glenda Attley and Rama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Glenda and Rama! That’s not….” Hinata started to speak but paused in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not trying to say that they are responsible but perhaps you should check upon your Seven Clerics.” I told Luminous who frowned.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What I mean is, water which stays still for too long breeds diseases. While it is not my place to say this, have you ever thought why in even a thousand years, none of the people you have recruited have ever surpassed those seven?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her frown deepened so I continued. “One of the five fingers of Clayman was called Adalmann. He was one of your people, one of your devout believers. He was just one step from becoming a Saint but your Seven Stooges feared his power and sent him to his death along with his trusted friend and followers so that they don’t get replaced and lose their supply of power to maintain their life. The guy’s friend Gadra, used the Reincarnation spell on him but his soul was corrupted by the Miasma and became a wight.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Kagali who blanched at what was coming. “He was then bound by Demon Lord Kazelim to serve and protect her land for hundreds of years until he was defeated recently and joined Rimuru. You would be delighted to know that their next target was Hinata herself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous didn’t say anything but her aura was easy for everyone to feel.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to give one last push to the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know it might not seem much but sometimes these small changes can snowball into a mighty avalanche. For example, did you know that Gadra, due to the death of his closest friend, swore revenge on the Seven Luminaries. He went and joined the Eastern Empire. There due to his proddings, the Emperor focused more on the Otherworlders and trained them. The research on their skills and technology has led to the Eastern Empire becoming the most advanced of any other Kingdom in this world. This….is the change even a single person can bring so you should never underestimate anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, on the side note, Gadra was also the teacher of Razen, the guy who summoned Sal to this world and bound him using the Lock Curse.” Rimuru added, throwing one last hit of her own.</p><p><br></p><p>I just hope that she cleans house after getting back.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, I have been meaning to ask this but who is that woman?” Gazel asked, pointing at Vritra who was chilling with Ramiris and Veldora.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….well, I guess I forgot to introduce her to you all.” I remembered that the Demon Lords knew Vritra from the Walpurgis but they had no idea about her. “She is the Draught Dragon Vritra, the newest True Dragon and my partner.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>Gazel looked like he had his world shaken all of a sudden but others were not that surprised. I mean even Erald didn’t look that surprised so maybe Leon told them.</p><p><br></p><p>Kagali was looking at her with her mouth hanging open.</p><p><br></p><p>After that we discussed some other things and Gazel decided to leave for his Kingdom. He had been away for over two weeks and needed to go back.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous and Leon decided to stay till the attack of Mariabell.</p><p><br>Both of them were worried about Chloe, I guess.</p><p><br></p><p>The Elves had stayed back however as I still had one more thing to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Laplace stood in front of me, unbothered by what he was going to do.</p><p><br></p><p>“The process is dangerous. It might lead to your death too.” I reminded him once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“In case you didn’t notice, I am already dead.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not what I meant….sigh….very well. I will continue.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both Rimuru and I separated his core from his body and saw as his body collapsed. She absorbed the core into her body and we began to work on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next twelve hours, Solomon and Raphael worked trying to recreate every memory of the guy. In doing so, both of us even got copies of his Skills too.</p><p><br></p><p>Although just unique skills, they were incredibly useful.</p><p><br></p><p>Falsifier could create incredibly realistic illusions and Seer allowed prediction into the Future making it a deadly combo in battle.</p><p><br></p><p>While this was going on, every single one of the Elves, even Kagali and her subordinates, the recently recovered Footman, looked at the scene with anticipation.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when the process was completed we looked at Erald. “Bring the Homunculus.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and quickly brought a body and placed it in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>This body was similar to what was given to Kagali only this one was shaped in the form of Sarion Grimwald, the Hero of the Elves and the father of the current Empress.</p><p><br></p><p>We carefully placed the core into the body and then I used Luminous’ Lust Skill to <em>heal</em> the body, making it adapt to the power quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t use this on Footman earlier because Luminous was there and I didn’t want to open that can of worms.</p><p><br></p><p>If anyone doubted me, collecting the rest of the Skills would have been nigh impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes later, the guy opened his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Now was the hardest part.</p><p><br></p><p>Would he remember?</p><p><br></p><p>I moved back with Rimuru and let the elves surround him.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked around and his eyes saw the Elven Ancestor first. “Sylvia?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Sarion.” She whispered back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where am I?” He shook his head, trying to get up slowly. “My head hurts a lot. I remember fighting the Chaos Dragon and the memories after that are….all messed up. There are….What is happening to me?” He asked, looking confused but was only met with a crushing hug from his wife.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will leave you guys alone for now.” I said and looked at Kagali. “He might remember bits and pieces of his time as Laplace but it was very difficult to save those memories without affecting him negatively. I am sorry for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No….you have already done more than I could ask for. Thank you.” She whispered the last part.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Take care then.” With that said, I left the room with Rimuru, giving them some space to clear things out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything is wrapped up, right?” Rimuru said. “Now we just have to wait for the fool to attack.” She clenched her fist.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know how and when they will attack?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. I used the same parasite which Yuuki was using on her. Moreover, Souei is keeping an eye on her too. We will know when she comes here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I will go and see what Leon is doing. I haven’t met them all day today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, take care.” She quickly jumped and kissed me on my cheek before teleporting away back to Jura Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Two days had passed since the whole event with Jahil and Sarion.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim finally got some closure and her Dragon seemed like it would be reborn soon so things were looking good for him too.</p><p><br></p><p>Sal managed to snag the Ultimate Skill Metatron from Leon by inviting him to a game with Chloe. Overall, things had calmed down for a bit but for her, this was just the calm before a storm.</p><p><br></p><p>A sound outside the room alerted her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s me, Rimuru-sama. I have a message from Souei-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah Souka-chan. Yes, come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened and the Dragonewt girl peeked in while still kneeled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Souei-sama has sent a message that the attackers have come for Camelot.” She started making Rimuru narrow her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who else is attacking?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They sent messengers to Ingrassia as well as Western Church. We couldn’t follow inside the territory of the Western Church but we did get the identities of the ones in Ingrassia. A group of eighty people are coming from our estimates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eighty? They are not holding back. Then again, Yuuki was just that important to them. I see. Do you have the routes they will be taking?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Rimuru-sama.” She placed the scrolls with the details of the routes the enemies were planning to take.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” She absorbed the scrolls and made several copies of the scrolls. “Give these to Diablo and ask him to move the Black Numbers to capture them. We will decide what to do after that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By your orders.” She bowed and vanished while she took the last copy and teleported back to Camelot.</p><p><br></p><p>The hunt had begun.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Cleria -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She flew above the clouds, keeping an eye on the route mentioned in the scrolls for the invading enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>While doing so, she wondered how her life had changed over the last few years?</p><p><br></p><p>From meeting the love of her life, Masaomi to discovering the plot behind the Rating Games and being framed to prevent it from being discovered.</p><p><br></p><p>If she could go back to her world, she would lynch that bastard, Zekram and his gang of cronies from the balconies of the Lucifer Castle.</p><p><br></p><p>She jaws clenched at the reminder of that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>Masaomi might have forgiven his comrades but she was not one to forgive and forget so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>They had thought that they would be dead for sure but neither of them had expected to be summoned into a different world and bound against their wills by a madman who called himself a Demon Lord.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only silver lining in all this was the fact that she was together with Masaomi all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>She did meet some good friends in the year and half she had served under Clayman.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Rin and Aletia were like younger sisters to her while Shiro-san, he was an elder brother to both Masaomi and her.</p><p><br></p><p>She could have never imagined there would be a man like Shiro-san, the strongest Paladin of the Church, perhaps one of the most devout worshipers of the Father of Angels and yet someone with such kindness that he would raise the Sons of literal Satan as his own children.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Masaomi and her had often talked about how their relationship was odd, not that either of them regretted it one bit but they still thought that they would never meet someone who would share the thoughts like theirs.</p><p><br></p><p>Meeting Shiro-san was an eyeopener for the two of them.</p><p><br></p><p>He not only never questioned their relationship but also saw it as the sign of all people being able to coexist peacefully.</p><p><br></p><p>The exact words were, if everyone could look beyond races like you two, the world would be a truly beautiful place to live. It was heartwarming to hear such words after everything they had faced.</p><p><br></p><p>Friendship between their group helped them live under the control of Clayman and still maintain hope and their hopes were rewarded in the form of Salvatore.</p><p><br></p><p>The Saviour.</p><p><br></p><p>His parents had indeed chosen the perfect name for him. Salvatore had come in like a storm, blowing away all their problems and then offering them shelter and a new life.</p><p><br></p><p>On the battlefield they thought would be their last, he had broken through their bindings and gave them freedom again.</p><p><br></p><p>She still remembered his fight with the Chaos Dragon on that day….</p><p><br></p><p>While Cleria didn’t know how strong Heavenly Dragons were, she had seen a former Dragon King like Tannin fight and….even Tannin’s strength seemed insignificant in front of that monstrous dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>And Sal had not only fought it but contained and purified it, stopping it from causing any harm to others.</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard rumours in the Underworld that Sirzechs Lucifer was ten times stronger than the previous Lucifer but she didn’t think he would last five minutes against King Salvatore in a fight, especially considering that Salvatore used Holy Magic infused Swordsmanship as his primary means.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was the fact that they were from the same world and despite being brought up in a Church Orphanage with his brother for more than half his life, he was not at all biassed towards devils, even having supported her relationship. He understood their situation the best, being involved with Rimuru-sama in a relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Her life had changed completely in the last month once more after coming under his rule. She was named, a ritual which increased her power to levels at which she was confident of facing her cousin in a straight fight. Even Masaomi became stronger, becoming a sage.</p><p><br></p><p>But perhaps the best part was the fact that she got married to the love of her life.</p><p><br></p><p>Cleria loved her current life.</p><p><br></p><p>Working for King Salvatore with her husband, teaching the kids and watching over the workings of the Kingdom and spending time  with her new <a href=\"https://friends….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">friends….it</a> was a perfect life.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say they didn’t have any worries.</p><p><br></p><p>King Salvatore’s memories of different worlds had been a smack on the face for both Masaomi and her.</p><p><br></p><p>Their world….couldn’t be that messed up right?</p><p><br></p><p>Could it be that Salvatore was too drunk on the day and forgot or misremembered the memories for once?</p><p><br></p><p>The future of their entire world lies in the hands of a….dumb teenager who retains nothing but breasts in his mind….</p><p><br></p><p>Was it perhaps a blessing that they were summoned to this world? A reward for remaining faithful to their love?</p><p><br></p><p>Because just thinking about it made her shiver with disgust.</p><p><br></p><p>Salvatore felt the same too, being a resident of their world too.</p><p><br></p><p>Talk about surprises, the wielder of Dragon King Vritra’s Sacred Gear had somehow revived the Dragon and even transformed her into a True Dragon….a True Dragon. That title was only given to one being in their world.</p><p><br></p><p>While Masaomi was happy to know that he was related to the church and his brother might be trained as an exorcist, the whole probable future of the world still weighed heavily on their minds too.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder Salvatore was trying so hard to get back to their world.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, she had sworn an oath to serve him with Masaomi, loyally and she would follow through with her oaths. She didn’t want anyone to ruin her perfect life either.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why when she spotted the invaders in the line of sight, she didn’t hold back.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Five Intruders detected.”</em>  the voice of Lord Solomon echoed in her head as the information about the intruders flooded her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Her Clan Trait Worthless had evolved into an Intrinsic Skill when she was summoned to this world. It had the same function as her magic but was far more efficient in the use of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, she got another Skill, a Unique Skill, Disrupter.</p><p><br></p><p>It had a similar function to her Worthless Skill, only in this case it could disrupt any physical attack completely.</p><p><br></p><p>When combined with her Worthless Ability, it gave her great defensive potential.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally the Extra Skill: Sage given to her after she was named.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the final piece of the puzzle. It gave her higher comprehension and thought acceleration thus allowing her to understand the Skills of her opponent far more easier than before.</p><p><br></p><p>It only took her a moment to understand all the information and lock onto the position of the intruders and with her next move, a barrier formed over the area.</p><p><br></p><p>This barrier was reinforced with both her Skills, Worthless and Disrupter, making it a perfect barrier for trapping anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the mice were in the cage, let the hunt begin.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Unnamed Blood Shadow -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He rushed through the forests of Falmuth, or was it Camelot now?</p><p><br></p><p>What did it matter for him?</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing that mattered was completing the mission. </p><p><br></p><p>His life rested on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….</p><p><br></p><p>Just how did he get stuck in this mess?</p><p><br></p><p>One moment he was submitting a thesis for his Doctorate degree and the next moment he was in this damned world, stamped with a slave brand, forever bound to serve the ones who summoned him or die.</p><p><br></p><p>Those five bastards treated all the summoned otherworlders lower than dirt. Even disposable pawns would be treated better than them.</p><p><br></p><p>Evans was sure they must have killed at least hundred or so of them to have such kind indifference.</p><p><br></p><p>He hated the feeling of being treated like dirt….but there was nothing he could do.</p><p><br></p><p>They had the switch to his life under their thumbs and would dispose of him at the slightest inconvenience.</p><p><br></p><p>He had witnessed enough deaths of his fellow friends to know this.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why he worked hard. In the last four years, he fought tooth and nail to survive, just for a chance at survival, just in the hopes that one day things would change.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps he could become strong enough to break through these shackles.</p><p><br></p><p>His hard work paid off as he rose through the ranks at a high speed and even became an Enlightened, something very rare few became in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>It was however still not enough to free him from these chains.</p><p><br></p><p>As for becoming a Saint….Evans never hoped for it, realising the rarity of those in this world, the less said about a Hero, the better. That one had a lot to do with a matter of chance rather than skill of an individual. Existences such as them was far beyond his level. The likes of Hinata Sakaguchi and Salvatore, the king of the nation they were infiltrating were like stars in the sky. He could see them but never hoped to reach them.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially Salvatore. That was the person Evans both admired and envied.</p><p><br></p><p>A person in exactly the same position  as him and yet he rose beyond the crowd and became someone who could take over his captors and rule.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when infiltrating his Kingdom, he couldn’t help but think of the man and how he might be face to face with the same guy in this mission.</p><p><br></p><p>He doubted his chances of survival. Unfortunately for him, at least this way he still had some chances.</p><p><br></p><p>The other side was certain death.</p><p><br></p><p>All his thoughts were suddenly broken when he sensed the shift in mana of the area.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking around, he saw a semi-transparent barrier all around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Shit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Separate and run!” He commanded in a loud voice.</p><p><br></p><p>His squad members in his command suddenly became aware of the situation and tried to run in different directions but were unsuccessful.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid that’s not an option anymore.” He heard a voice in front of him as a figure entered the barrier from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had black hair and black eyes and was holding a sword in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“I suggest that you don’t put up any resistance. If you do that, we could free you from your bindings and take you under the protection of Camelot. Trust us, we do not have any intention of fighting if you don’t.” Another voice came from behind them. On looking in that direction, he saw a man white haired man in glasses walking slowly towards them from there.</p><p><br></p><p>His heart stopped for a moment at those words but he quickly shook off the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way that’s true. They were probably baiting him to drop guard.</p><p><br></p><p>He unsheathed his blade and dashed forward, intending to create a diversion with his attack. While doing this, he activated his Skill, Gemini, creating a clone of himself and joining him to flank the black haired guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, his teammates took on the while haired one.</p><p><br></p><p>The man defended himself with his sword, pushing him back.</p><p><br></p><p>What strength! However that would not be enough.</p><p><br></p><p>His clone was already in position to take down the neck of the guy but the next instant, something unbelievable happened.</p><p><br></p><p>The clone, whose sword was just on the verge of touching the black haired guy….just vanished suddenly in thin air.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” The sudden change broke his concentration and one of his steps fell in the wrong place, destabilising his balance and the black haired guy didn’t miss this opportunity and was on his face in the next instant, the next attack flinging his sword from his hand, leaving him without any weapon.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this the end?</p><p><br></p><p>Evans closed his eyes, accepting his death but the finishing blow never came.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, he felt his magic being suppressed and his body being bound, leaving him unable to move.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….they were probably going to be tortured for information.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad for them, they were just not capable of giving out any information.</p><p><br></p><p>While he couldn’t move, he could hear the voices of his squadmates and see flames of a blue colour which felt….demonic.</p><p><br></p><p>In a matter of minutes, the whole fight was over.</p><p><br></p><p>His entire squad of four A Rankers and one Special A Rank was taken down in minutes without any way of resisting.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you remove the binding spells on them, Cleria?” The words shook him awake from the darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment, he felt a hand on his forehead and a foreign power invaded his body and after four years of hell….he felt the binding on his soul….dissolve.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his eyes to look at the figure in front of his eyes and saw a white haired woman sitting beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him and smiled. “Don’t worry. You are free now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt a lump in his throat those words and even the years of training didn’t prevent his eyes from getting wet.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will be checked and if found clean, will be given a room and offered the protection of Camelot. I am sure you understand the procedures. We cannot afford spies among us.”</p><p><br></p><p>A tense look appeared on his face at the words. Was he just switching hands from one cruel master to another one?</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. You will just be asked a few questions. Nothing complicated. I suggest that you do not lie as our King can easily catch lies. Trust me, if you were forced to do this, you will not be punished. After all, we were in the same situation as you until a while ago. King Salvatore is not the kind of person who would force you into such a situation. He has even worked and banned summoning of otherworlders since becoming a King and has been working towards it since then.” The woman reassured him and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, we are on the clock. Could you guys give us the details of your plans? That would help out a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and slowly spoke the details of the plans….or at least the part which he knew about.</p><p><br>Each group only knew their own route of invasion and were never told about the other groups and only the place where they would parley to act on the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>They were then left to the custody of a group of soldiers while the three left for their own work.</p><p><br></p><p>While being led to Camelot, there was only one thought in Evans’ mind. Was this his chance at a new life?</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘To be a Hero’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We finally took care of the smaller things.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Many people got long deserved closures in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Elves saw Jahil die and their loved one being revived.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Milim got her revenge and is going to be reunited with her pet dragon again.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chloe and Leon finally spend some time together.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And the summoned otherworlders from Blood Shadows getting their freedom too.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On a side note, the misunderstandings of the rest of the group is increasing due to Sal and Rimuru’s unconscious actions.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Just where is this bubble going to burst?….If it ever does?….</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Anyways, the attacks have begun and things will get interesting in the coming chapters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

We don’t mean any harm. We are just curious about what is happening in the outside world. As you can guess, being trapped inside, we have no idea about the events going on in the outside world and that has left us with many questions and worries. We would appreciate it a lot if you could clarify some things for us. Is that alright with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl hesitated a bit but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then please go on. We will ask you any questions we have after that.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl then went on to tell us about the Game Master and what he had done in the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>What reason might he have behind all this?</p><p><br></p><p>With his power, there would hardly be anything he can’t get, so why pull something like this?</p><p><br></p><p>“Did anyone go against him?” Veena asked, the worry in her voice easy to hear. She was probably worried that her son went ahead and fucked up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lucifer.” Elaine spoke, making her pale for a second before she added. “Rizevim Livan Lucifer went against him. He tried to tamper with the game and….”</p><p><br></p><p>“And?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Game Master killed him and hung his body on top of the Lucifer Castle. He then gave the entire Devil Race one last warning before erasing the Agreas Island as a punishment for the actions of Rizevim.” She gulped before taking a sip of the water on the table. “He then showed what he would do to anyone who tries to mess with the game after that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He has the Beast of Apocalypse under his control and has threatened to release it on the faction who tries something like that.” She then went on to explain about the Beast of Apocalypse and Veena gripped my hand in shock. The girl however continued. “….and.”</p><p><br></p><p>And?</p><p><br></p><p>What and?</p><p><br></p><p>Is there even another and left after all this?</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was going to release the big bad beast whom the Biblical God had died sealing. What else could he do?</p><p><br></p><p>“If someone managed to survive that, he and his lovers, Great Red, Ophis and the Dragon Goddess Tiamat would personally take action.” She shivered even as she spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the story I only had one thing to say, ‘What the hell, dude?’</p><p><br></p><p>Did he suddenly go into his villain arc all of a sudden?</p><p><br></p><p>Also Great Red is a female in this world? And what about Tiamat?</p><p><br>Wasn’t she a Dragon King level? How did she suddenly become a Dragon Goddess?</p><p><br></p><p>Is this even the world I knew of?</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine then went on to explain about the middle path discovered by Ajuka and how the Game Master allowed other people to be sent inside the Game to rescue the ones inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking advantage of this, many people were sent inside the game to rescue the trapped individuals, Veena being one of the most important ones among them.</p><p><br></p><p>Even they entered the game due to this.</p><p><br></p><p>If what she says is correct then it wouldn’t be far before more people enter the game sooner or later and they would increase the number of players too.</p><p><br></p><p>That changes our plans by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s safe to say that the revelations had left Veena tense. She didn’t say anything but the look on her face made her emotions clear.</p><p><br></p><p>I had never seen her lose composure like this, not even when we were attacked by those villagers the first time we had met each other.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Elaine, thank you for letting us know about everything. I really appreciate your courage to come inside to save your loved ones. Rest assured, you will not be discriminated against or troubled in any way and can stay in the guild as you have. If you could tell us the rough description of your friends? If possible, we could keep an eye out for them. If you need anything else, feel free to let us know. We will do our best to accommodate you.” I looked at Veena to see if she wanted to ask anything.</p><p><br></p><p>She controlled herself and looked at the girl. “Thank you Elaine. Arthas has already said everything I wanted to say apart from the fact that we were planning to invite you to our team. We think your experience as a magician could translate very well to real fighting ability in the game. If you are interested, you can talk to Shiroe and see what you want to do. He is our strategist and games expert. Right now, we need some time to….go through all the information we have received. I apologise for not being able to entertain you well today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. It’s fine. I….thank you for your help.” She bowed slightly and got up.</p><p><br></p><p>I escorted her outside first and then returned back and sat beside Veena, slowly placing my hand on her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and leaned on my shoulder. “I was prepared for something like this when the matter wasn’t solved in the first few months but….I wasn’t expecting something like this. The Game Master….just what in the world is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>The most OP species in the multiverse….an Isekai Protagonist.</p><p><br></p><p>No way I could say that.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t look like she was in any mood to do anything so I called Shiroe and Star and told them that we would be taking a break today.</p><p><br></p><p>Either way, they had their own work today with scouting and all so they didn’t mind either. Shiroe would also talk to Elaine and see if she would become our group’s healer.</p><p><br></p><p>I, in the meanwhile, stepped into the kitchen and prepared some tea for ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Arthas.” Veena smiled as I placed her cup in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are welcome.” I sat beside her and took my own cup, taking a sip first.</p><p><br></p><p>She drank her tea quietly and finally spoke after a few minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>“It looks like we are stuck inside till we complete the game. Taking things half heartedly is no longer an option. We need to go at it with everything we have.” There was a tone of seriousness in her voice which I hadn’t heard before.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to find my family members too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We could always make a group of people who search for people related to our guild members or if the guild expands, we can list their names at our branches. I am sure that like us many other guild members are facing the same problem too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That’s a good idea. But first of all, we need to expand our guild. What was the hunt you were talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The bosses around Llyne. All of them will be T5 and have special abilities.We plan to hunt a few of them as they give more loot for the first kill bonus to get some Gold for the trip as well as get something good if we can.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. That’s a good plan. I will prepare something for the hunt too.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and we had our breakfast before separating our ways for our daily work.</p><p><br></p><p>I spent the rest of the day levelling up my Skills while Veena worked on her potions as usual. The entire atmosphere was sombre in the house.</p><p><br></p><p>In the evening, Shiroe and Star came to our house and Elaine came with them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you decided to join the team?” I asked and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the team, Miss Elaine.” I smiled as everyone took their seats. Veena served some cookies and sat down beside me. “So, any information on the rest of the bosses?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. They were actually easier to find than I was expecting. Apparently, they are quite famous. Although getting exact details about their skills was hard. I think you would have better chances asking in the Knight’s Guild. They often take care of the beasts around Llyne. They might have more ideas about their Skills and abilities.” Shiroe said as he picked up some cookies from the table and took a bite. “Ohh, these are nice. Did you make them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Getting an oven was a great help.”</p><p><br></p><p>Normally people cooked on open stoves in LLyne. Ovens were a rarity and something we got recently.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena wanted to try some baking on them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will go and try to find out more. Which ones do you want to target?”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe brought out a map and Star picked up the plate of cookies, placing them in his lap with a smirk as he started feasting on them.</p><p><br></p><p>We rolled our eyes at his antics.</p><p><br></p><p>In the short time that we have known each other, we have discovered that Star has a sweet tooth like no other.</p><p><br></p><p>Ignoring him munching on the cookies, we concentrated on the map.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is a bear monster here. Its hide is thick enough to resist attacks from T3 Archers so none of the other teams will be able to hunt it anytime soon. We would need to trap it first but there is a very good location nearby where we can do it. You will have to lure him there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is a Rhinoceros with a nigh unbreakable defence and then there is a Tiger. The Tiger will obviously be more dangerous as it is the fastest. I suggest facing it when we are stronger. But even it is nothing compared to the Snake Monster. It has the highest number of kills from what I have heard. Its poison will be far more dangerous than anything else. We just cannot face it without a Healer. The rest are mostly pack animals and we would need to face them with more members. Our current strength is not enough to take them without considerable risk to ourselves. We need to level up more before we are ready for those.” He finished.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Bear and the Rhino then. Got it. By the way, how can we get a Healer Class?”</p><p><br></p><p>“By going to Church.” He said with a deadpan. “Scholars can become Cleric. It’s a T4 Class. There are other variations but we don’t know how to get those right now. We will have to power level Elaine to get it quickly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shouldn’t be hard. At least with the boss battles coming up, she could be levelled up very easily.” Star said, finished with the cookies already.</p><p><br></p><p>“When are we going to go after them?” Veena asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“As soon as Arthas finds out more info, I can perfect my plans for the attack. We will need one more day to scout everything, so the day after tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. In that case, I will go and have a talk with Kenneth today and see what I can find out. You can come along if you have any questions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great.”</p><p><br></p><p>And we did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth was more than happy to assist us. They didn’t have much information about their skills but there were apparently bounties for those monsters in the Adventurer’s Guild and the Knight Guild too, something we collected.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Boar Boss we killed had a bounty of twenty thousand Gold Coins.</p><p><br></p><p>This led us to search for other quests regarding these Bosses and we were in luck as even the Blacksmith had a quest for the Rhino. Its leather was a premium material.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe went back to plan while I returned home.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I got back, it was late in the evening.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena didn’t seem to be in the mood to cook due to whatever happened in the morning so I got something from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Contrary to what I was expecting, she was back to her usual self when I returned. Either that or she was just that good at keeping herself controlled.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did your visit go?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We got quests. Turns out there are bounties for those Bosses. We got money for the Boar Boss we had killed. Shiroe expects that we can earn at least fifty thousand more if we can take down the Rhino Boss. The Blacksmith will buy everything. Shiroe asked me to tell you that we would need some strong poisons to take it down.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere was still relatively quieter than other days.</p><p><br></p><p>When it was time for bed, as a daily ritual, both of us took baths turn by turn.</p><p><br></p><p>I waited in the bedroom for her. The memories of last night were still fresh in my mind, although I doubted there would be a repeat of that today considering her mood.</p><p><br></p><p>I was pleasantly surprised when she entered the room, in just the towel. Then again, this much was normal for her by now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, are you still dressed?” She asked, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….thought you might not be in the mood considering the news in the morning.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “While I appreciate your concern, I think a long night of lovemaking is just what we need to get the serious topics out of our head. As the people nowadays say, fuck the worries out of our minds.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Who says that?</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I’m going to complain.</p><p><br></p><p>If anything, her using those words only made me harder.</p><p><br></p><p>I was out of my clothes in seconds and she giggled and she got onto the bed, directly into my chest and captured my lips with hers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Today, I want you to not hold back. Be as rough with me as you can.” She whispered and my dick twitched at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes my lady.” I replied, gripping her hair tightly and pulling her into a ferocious kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>In minutes both of us were lost in seeking pleasure in each other.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, unlike yesterday, the sex was wild, without any restraint.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like having sex with a wild animal.</p><p><br></p><p>She was really trying to vent everything out today and I was more than happy to indulge her with all her wishes.</p><p><br></p><p>While I was no match for her in terms of experience, I made it up with my greater stamina. In the words of Abridged Kirito, my numbers were greater than hers.</p><p><br></p><p>The stamina of T4 and T5 Players was quite a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Veena, my strength was in the mid ranges of the Middle Class level according to Devil Standards and was only growing.</p><p><br></p><p>It was evident too as we only stopped after three hours and when we did, she was completely covered in my cum and our sweat.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately both of us were too tired to care and fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>We might have to find a spell to clean ourselves next time.</p><p><br></p><p>She was right though. The sex did help release all the stress we had accumulated from the information of the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a rhino?! That thing is the size of a truck. No, now that I look closer, it’s bigger than a truck.” Star said as we looked at our target from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a T5 monster, what did you expect?” Shiroe asked but the tension in his voice was apparent to me after knowing him for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>And I could understand their worries.</p><p><br></p><p>The Iron Horned Rhinoceros was far stronger than the Mad Boar we had fought a few days ago.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s sheer size made it impossible for us to use our normal methods against it. Normally, we dug pits to fight against heavy enemies like this and baited them to fall inside.</p><p><br></p><p>After that we could shoot them down as we wished.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however, pulling something like that in this place didn’t seem to be possible. At least not with our skills.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Our plan will work.” Shiroe said after collecting himself again.</p><p><br></p><p>Our plan was simple. Since we couldn’t dig a hole, we used a natural made one.</p><p><br></p><p>Star and I will attack the Rhino from a distance and then I will close in to draw the agro.</p><p><br></p><p>After it’s focused on me, I bait it towards the location of our choice, a nearby cliff.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously the Rhino wouldn’t just jump and commit suicide itself. That’s where our real plan comes in.</p><p><br></p><p>We will block away its vision using Earth Wall, Ice Wall, Mist Spells, Poisons and Aim Eyes, making it follow our sounds and attacks all the while trying to shave off its hp bit by bit.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I even agreed to this crazy plan was because of all my Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Any other group using this skill would die without a doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>If things turn awry, we quit the mission and run away.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“I am never doing this kind of mission….ever again.” I complained as I huffed for breath on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>That fucking Rhino was a mad beast, completely beyond anything I had faced before.</p><p><br></p><p>Even that Mutated Goblin Chieftain was easier than this….whatever the hell it was.</p><p><br></p><p>My attacks barely made a dent, only decreasing its HP in tens.</p><p><br></p><p>Tens! Not even hundreds.</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds were for my Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, my skills only did hundreds of HP of damage against a beast which had above one hundred and twenty thousand HP.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure that if it were not for the plan, we wouldn’t be able to fight it off without an army.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time in this world, I felt real danger breathing so close to me.</p><p><br></p><p>A large truck sized monster chasing you, crushing everything in the path can do that to people.</p><p><br></p><p>Its attacks were taking down a quarter or so of my HP every time it used a Skill and it connected to me.</p><p><br></p><p>And most of its Skills were AoE ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Star was doing an amazing job of keeping it out of the way and Shiroe and Veena were working overtime to stop it.</p><p><br></p><p>“The plan wasn’t supposed to be this hard. We just didn’t know about its passive skill which reduced the time for normal status effects by half. This monster really was a tank.” Shiroe said as he sat beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>He had thrown some assisting spells in some crucial times, saving my hide or things could have gotten trickier.</p><p><br></p><p>We all sat down beside the corpse of the beast which towered like a small hill in front of us and wondered how we did this at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“The fall took down most of its HP and induced severe status effects on it. Thank goodness that the beast was as dumb as it was or we would be running for our lives.” Star said as he went ahead and looked at its body.</p><p><br></p><p>All the drop items were still laying around the beast. We were so exhausted that we hadn't even picked them up yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Star did that for us today.</p><p><br></p><p>“2 accessories, both rings, 1 Hammer and wow, are those two skill books? Let's see. Iron Guard and Reckless Charge, both tank Skills. Well, I guess we did take down a tank type beast. Here you go, Arty?” He threw the books at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the Skills. Iron Guard was like Dragonskin and Reckless Charge was an upgraded version of the Knight's Charge Skill with the added benefit of reducing the duration of Common Debuffs by half.</p><p><br></p><p>So this was the Skill the monster was using. No wonder our plan became so difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will use one and keep the other one for sale or for when we get another tank.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sounds Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>We checked the list of drops. Thirty five thousand Gold Coins and fifteen thousand Gold Coins first time bonus. So a total of fifty thousand Gold.</p><p><br></p><p>That was what we had expected to earn after selling the body of the Iron Rhino.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, we will have a decent amount of Gold for our trip.</p><p><br></p><p>“And it looks like Elaine got levelled up too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, she had gained 14 levels all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess even shared exp from a T5 monster was something extremely high for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Even I got two levels with just this monster alone. The Rhino gave a very high exp with the first kill bonus.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great, at this rate, we will only need a few more bosses to get her to max level.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t have to be only bosses, you know.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I was getting a bit overconfident in my strength. This boss did a lot to remind me that I was still very weak in this….world. There are numerous others who are far stronger than this Rhino and could take me out with a look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We need more preparations before facing any other bosses.” Shiroe nodded too, a serious look on his face. “This fight was….a bit too close for my liking. We are already far ahead of the other players. It would be foolish to risk ourselves so much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p><br></p><p>We stayed there for a while before collecting everything and leaving. On the way back we kept hunting everything we encountered and I gained one more level while doing so.</p><p><br></p><p>That Rhino really did give a lot of experience.</p><p><br></p><p>If only we could lay a trap and farm it….”Yes!” I  shouted reflexively as soon as I got this idea, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” Shiroe asked, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just got an idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The bosses will take a while to respawn, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, yeah. Around a fortnight.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can’t we just dig a hole that big in that time? The only reason we couldn’t do that before was because we were afraid of attracting the attention of the boss and that we didn’t have enough time. That area will be relatively safer for the next few days. Maybe we could post it as a request. Get some guild members and have them dig a hole the size which could trap the damned Rhino the next time we face it. Then all we would need to do is keep hitting it till it dies or just fill it with water and let the monster suffocate to death. It will be a one time investment and we could get an easy area to farm the Boss. In fact, we could probably do the same with the Boar Boss from the last time.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at me with an open mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arty….could it be….that you are smart?” Star asked, making me roll my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s possible. It will be a bit of an investment but nothing impossible.” Shiroe said after some thought. “We could probably assign some people to do so before we leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>The plan actually felt more feasible the more we thought about it so we hurried back to Llyne and the first thing we did was post the Quest in our Guild.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The road towards Lannisport was cleared two days after our hunt of the Rhino.</p><p><br></p><p>While we couldn’t hunt two bosses as we had predicted earlier, the Rhino fetched us more than we had expected, especially with the bounties so we were not lacking in money. In fact, we had far more than we were initially expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>In total, we had collected nine hundred thousand gold coins even with the gold we had traded off to Gareth’s team.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, we had three Skill Books, several equipment and accessories and many Greater Healing Pills for sale when we got there.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, our assets should be around eight hundred thousand gold coins. With this, we were expecting to buy something good in the auction house.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, here’s the plan.” Shiroe, as usual, laid down his map in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where do you always get maps from?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“I buy some and make some myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You make them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Cartographer class can be accessed after Scribe.” He answered as a matter of fact. “You just have to take classes in the academy for three days and have a Writing Skill at Level 15 or above.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah. Makes sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Our journey to Lannisport is going to take around three days. From there, we will have to go by a Ship to the Sabaody Archipelago island. This part will take two more days. Taking in the time we stay in those places, we would need around two weeks to return. We need to pack all necessities today. We set out early tomorrow morning. On the way, there are several places we can hunt. Most of them are T4 Bosses and one T5 Boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have taken care of the Guild matters. We will be keeping contact with them using Guild Chat till we get back.” Veena added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then we leave tomorrow. Let’s see what our trip brings us.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She used Ice Wall to block the retreat of the bandits and Arthas cut them down with his next attack, finishing all the enemies and ending the battle.</p><p><br></p><p>Two days had passed since they set off for Lannisport.</p><p><br></p><p>Until now, their journey had been pleasant.</p><p><br></p><p>It reminded her of her youth.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite all the faults of this game, it was simply undeniable that it did excite her.</p><p><br></p><p>The Devil Race was created to fight against the forces of Heaven. Fighting is in their very being, an inseparable instinct for her and while she was a human here, she has lived with her instincts for too long for them to change now.</p><p><br></p><p>The fights in this game gave her the thrill which she had lost in the last five hundred years since her son became the new Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not just her but every devil. They all had this instinct. But with changing times, they were changing themselves to adapt. Some engaged in Rating Games while older ones like her took on hobbies to engage in to take their minds off these instincts.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus took on Politics while she had dedicated herself to managing the Gremory house all these years.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias and later Milicas being born did serve as a fresh breath after such a long and monotonous life.</p><p><br></p><p>It also made both her and Zeoticus realise that it was time to let go rather than live in the monotony.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, she never expected a change to come in this way.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at Arthas who returned after finishing the fight, a smile formed on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a good <a href=\"https://boy….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">boy….no</a>, calling him a boy would not do him justice anymore. He was becoming more of a man with each passing day.</p><p><br></p><p>She would know after all, being the one who helped him climb those stairs. And she hadn’t regretted it once since then.</p><p><br><br></p><p>While he was not as experienced, he could always learn over time. It was his enthusiasm that made her fall for him even more. The enthusiasm of a young man was simply different from what she was used to feeling all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>It made her feel young again. But most of all, it helped her shake off depressing thoughts and worries.</p><p><br></p><p>The news which Elaine had revealed had shaken her more than she had shown anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Game Master, someone stronger than even the Infinity, Dream and Creation, taking them as his <a href=\"https://lovers….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lovers….it</a> was straight out of stories used to scare children.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, Creation, the Dragon Goddess Tiamat was said to have passed away before the Devil Race was even created. Her children being the ones who betrayed their parents for power, killed their father and later fought their mother over centuries, before finally overcoming her and ripping her apart to establish their pantheon from her corpse itself.</p><p><br></p><p>She remembered it because it was completely opposite of their own situation in which Lucifer was driven to the Underworld and fought against his father.</p><p><br></p><p>Then how in the world did she walk the world again? And from what Elaine said, she seemed stronger than before. All of them seemed stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>They were already the strongest beings in the world. What would an even stronger version of them be?</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder they had been able to do nothing to stop this game.</p><p><br></p><p>But for the life of her, she couldn’t understand the reason why they, beings who never involved themselves with the world, would do such a thing?</p><p><br></p><p>And above all, who exactly was this Game Master?</p><p><br></p><p>How was this kind of existence hidden all this time from the world?</p><p><br>And if he was, then why did he come out?</p><p><br></p><p>Could it be that he was someone who had been behind Infinity, Dream and Creation all this time?</p><p><br></p><p>So many questions and no way to gain any answers.</p><p><br></p><p>All these questions did was to increase her worries, not that knowing who he was would change anything. They were just too far beyond his power.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now all she could do was try to find her family members and keep them safe until this game was over.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the people who were sent to save them….she had serious doubts about them since she heard that there were several criminals mixed among them.</p><p><br></p><p>The Satans didn’t know about the workings of the game and had gambled but she could see many ways the plans would fail due to the structure of the game.</p><p><br></p><p>While the plan could have been good if the game could be finished in a short period of time, it was anything but that simple of a case.</p><p><br></p><p>It could take several decades for the game to finish and there will be high casualties without a doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>Over time, this world….is going to become a real world for everyone and not just a game. And what would these criminals do in a new world, especially against the family members of those who had put them beyond the bars?</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, criminals like them would have no hesitation in taking advantage of the system of the game to gather others and with the ability to get stronger as long as they were not killed, they could become a major problem down the line.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” She was awakened from her thoughts by Arthas who was standing in front of her, looking worried.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded at him with a smile. “Just thinking about something. Don’t worry.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and she went ahead with the rest to collect the drops before continuing on their journey.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We came out of the forest to the scene of the ocean greeting us after the three day long journey. Blue as far as eyes could see. How long has it been since I saw the ocean?</p><p><br></p><p>In the distance was the silhouette of a town which became clearer the more we walked towards the town.</p><p><br></p><p>Lannisport was a port town.</p><p><br></p><p>There were dozens of ships visible on the port and several going in and out of the port too. Overall, the scene looked straight out of some mediaeval fantasy….oh wait….</p><p><br></p><p>We were stopped at the gates of the town where the guards asked for entry fees before allowing us in.</p><p><br></p><p>This was easily bypassed by my Baron badge. Nobles didn’t need to pay entry fees in their own country.</p><p><br></p><p>Lannisport was bigger than Llyne. I had asked Kenneth about this place before leaving and he was kind enough to give me some suggestions as well as write a recommendation letter to one of his friends staying here.</p><p><br></p><p>Richard was a former Knight in Llyne and one of Kenneth’s friends. He had lost one of his arms in battle and retired from duty and became a merchant in Lannisport, the town where was born. He took over his father’s business and with the help of the City Lord, his business had flourished.</p><p><br></p><p>He had eight ships of his own and ran trade with other countries as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth had suggested that I go and talk to him if I wanted to know more about the situation of other countries. He could also point me towards some rare goods.</p><p><br></p><p>I also got a quest from him to deliver some alcohol to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, we found the Dolphin’s Song Trading Agency, the place Richard owned. It was a nice three storied building with two guards at the front and several people going in and out.</p><p><br></p><p>Looks like the business was going well.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the guard for Richard and was led directly to him after showing my badge.</p><p><br></p><p>….this noble thing might be more useful than I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>We were soon led to the office on the top floor where a dignified looking man greeted us.</p><p><br></p><p>He had blonde hair and blue eyes and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was a noble himself. His mannerisms were immaculate as he offered us a seat in his office. “Welcome Baron Arthas. My name is Richard Clyde, the owner of the Dolphin’s Song Trading Agency. I was informed that you have some business with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>I took out the letter and the bottle of alcohol and forwarded it to him. “I am Arthas, a Knight of Llyne. I was recently given the position of a Baron and had been planning to visit Lannisport and maybe Sabaody Archipelago. I was given this letter of introduction by Kenneth who pointed me in your direction.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes lit up on hearing Kenneth’s name. “Kenneth? How is Kenneth doing? That stubborn brother-in-law of mine finally remembered me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Brother-in-law?” I asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously. That moron married my little sister. He had come to drop me off at Lannisport when I retired, tricked my sister and married her and now he doesn’t even have time to visit us. It’s been over a year since I have seen my sister and my niece.” He complained but I could see a good natured smile on his face as he did that.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at his humour while he opened the letter and read. Few moments later, a serious look came on his face and he gripped the letter tightly before sighing and placing the letter down.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy then bowed towards me. “Thank you for saving my niece’s life. I don’t have any children of my own and have always treated her as my own daughter. Those damned Goblins!” He growled, banging the desk with one of his remaining arms, the noble demeanour fading away and the rough Knight look coming to surface for a moment. </p><p><br></p><p>Amelia, Kenneth’s daughter and his niece, was the girl we had rescued from that Goblin’s cave.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did what anyone should have done. If anything, I am sorry for not being able to prevent such a thing from happening in the first place.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked sad. “Kenneth praised you a lot. He rarely does that. He even wrote how you and your team fought against the Goblin horde and got the rank of Baron. If you ever need any help from me, don't hesitate to speak.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. My friends and I were looking for places to buy something good here and in Sabaody. I was wondering if you could give us some advice and help us get a ship to Sabaody.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, looking for goods eh. Well, I'll be honest, if you are looking for unique things, you should go to Sabaody. Despite the environment there, there is no doubt that the place gets the most unique items. That place sells <em>everything</em>. You might get things from other continents. Many nobles of our kingdom and surrounding kingdoms go there for auctions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When is the next auction?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In five days. There are different types of auctions. Weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually and yearly. The quality of goods increases from weekly to yearly. Five days later are the monthly auctions, two months later, the quarterly and so on.” </p><p><br></p><p>He brought out a book from his drawers and passed it over to me.</p><p><br></p><p>The book contained the dates for the auctions.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want to buy things, you could always get something from Lannisport later or just send me a message and I will have the things sent over. Auctions are not always easy to catch. The number of seats are limited.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Limited?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You will have to go there two days earlier and book seats to participate. The price of each seat in the monthly auctions is 500 gold coins. I suggest you leave tomorrow to get there with time in hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “We will. Thank you for your advice.” I then asked him a few more questions and the man took us for a meal, introducing us to some places in the town and then ordered one of his servants to escort us to his house and arrange a place for us to stay there for the day. He was busy with work so I didn't disturb him either and left.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I am going to drop dead on my bed. Haven't been able to get a chance to sleep properly in the last three days.” Star said as he stretched his body, yawning.</p><p><br></p><p>“He's not wrong. I am exhausted too.” Shiroe agreed and left for his room.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine did the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, it was just Veena and I left.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at each other and entered her room which was in the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as the door closed, she pulled me in for a hungry kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that three days of sleeping in different tents was not easy for her too.</p><p><br></p><p>During our journey, she and Elaine shared a tent while I shared one with the guys.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn't get any action in the last three days and the stress was building up for me but now it seems that it was the same for her too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Kuroka –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Three thousand Gold Coins for the assassination and two thousand Gold Coins for the information. Glad to work with you.” The dealer offered her money and she checked it once before keeping it in her inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>When she got the Tier 2 Job of Thief, she hadn’t thought much of it and accepted it as it was the class with best stat gain available for her at that point of time.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t expected the gains to be so good.</p><p><br></p><p>The black market had places which had jobs for these kinds of classes and the quests paid far better than normal quests. The only catch was the danger of being caught which had severe punishments but it wasn’t a big deal for Kuroka.</p><p><br></p><p>As long as it was just NPCs she didn’t care about the assassination target and the results were visible too.</p><p><br></p><p>She had become a T3 Rogue very quickly but she didn’t slack off. She was still too far behind. After the world quest when the First Guild announcement had appeared before everyone. It would take her several more weeks to understand the meaning of the announcement.</p><p><br></p><p>There were people in the Game who were T5 already and the gap between them was increasing even now as Guilds would have Perks for all its participants.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t even heard of a T4 player in the town till last week. Just how in the world was someone a T5 already?</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of a monster was the Guild Master of the Fairy Tail Guild?</p><p><br></p><p>She was however not deterred. If anything, she was excited even more. If he had reached such a high level, it only meant there was a way and she could get there too. All this knowledge only pushed her to level up faster.</p><p><br></p><p>She sneaked away through the shadows till she reached the place she was staying at and knocked at the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-w-who is there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s me. Open up, Gaspy.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened to reveal the cute little blondie on the other side. “Welcome.”</p><p><br></p><p>She rubbed his head and entered the door, closing it behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>Throwing the cloak she was wearing to the side, she slumped on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was your day, Gaspy? Got any orders?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-yes. I got four orders today and even my Heavy Armour Crafting Skill became Level 5. The people you send all ordered custom weapons too.” He answered, excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled at the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>To think he had come so far along the way from the kid who had downright fainted after hearing her name.</p><p><br>Although convincing him was not easy, she was glad that she had kept visiting him and finally persuaded him (threatened him) to come with her. After entering the game, she had realised how difficult it would be to find Shirone alone and even if she did, there was a high chance that she might not want to come with her so she decided to bring the blondie with her.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that he was a Blacksmith only helped more.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to say that she was the only one profiting from all this. The Blondie was able to get more customers and was climbing up the levels quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>He was already higher levelled than her, even with just crafting and now he was level 22 without having stepped out to hunt for a single day.</p><p><br></p><p>The equipment he crafted is well liked by the people of the town as they gave better stats than the ones crafted by other Blacksmiths.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, he got an achievement in the first village.</p><p><br></p><p>Super Rookie Blacksmith.</p><p><br></p><p>Obtained by crafting 100 Equipment as an Apprentice Blacksmith without leaving the Starter Village.</p><p><br></p><p>If someone left the Starter Village even once, they would not get the Achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>The Achievement gave him increased experience gain for each piece of equipment he crafted.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the equipment he made had higher stats than others had a very small chance of gaining a passive skill depending on the level of the equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>Did this game reward people for being a Hikkikomori?</p><p><br></p><p>But whatever may be the case, his presence had helped her keep her spirits up and not go crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way, she was benefiting more from his presence than she had thought and now the cutie felt like a little brother to her. She looked at him and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? That’s great. How about I take you out for a treat?”</p><p><br></p><p>“O-o-out! No way!” He ran away and hid in a box he had made for himself. “I don’t wannaaaa go out!”</p><p><br></p><p>Her smile twitched.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, he was still a Hikkikomori.</p><p><br></p><p>She will have to slowly break him out of his shell in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>But she had time.</p><p><br></p><p>She was planning to leave this town when both of them became decently strong T4 and go to the next town.</p><p><br></p><p>Greenfrost was a large city ruled by Marquis Conrad Black of the House of Black.</p><p><br></p><p>She had seen several assignments related to the city which paid really well. Too bad most of them were targets in T5, currently outside her strength to take on.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe in a few months or so, she could go there and check out the city.</p><p><br></p><p>Till then all they could do was grind till they levelled up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, we won’t go out. I will get you an apple pie instead.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup, really. Have I ever lied to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s mood brightened up instantly as he came out of the box, excited for his treat.</p><p><br></p><p>She chuckled at his antics.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Game Master -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Luci’s mom has got it going on~”</p><p><br></p><p>He chuckled as he heard Red sing and shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Truly, he hadn’t expected that his junior would snag the milf so quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>His Isekai Protagonist Aura was on fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if he could snag the maid and the Princess too.</p><p><br></p><p>All three generations….wouldn’t that be an achievement of its own?</p><p><br></p><p>Achievement: Balls of Orichalcum.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe he should send two Nerve Gears to the two Gremory Ladies outside. Five generations of the Lucifer’s family, now wouldn’t that be grand?….</p><p><br></p><p>Achievement: Balls of Adamantium.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look quite happy?” Tia said as she leaned on to his side. He wrapped his arm around her and caressed her arm.</p><p><br></p><p>It was very rare that Tia initiated these moments of physical contacts. Her past experiences had left her detached from such emotional relationships. She was down for sex as it rarely meant anything for beings of her age but he didn’t want that. No, that would be an insult to both of them. He actually wanted to take her as his lover. It had taken him over three centuries to get her to agree for a romantic relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Her story was far more complicated than Red or Ophis who had rarely had any contact with others. They had joined him quite easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Tia however was different. She had been betrayed by her own children and had lost her lovers twice already.</p><p><br></p><p>One her husband, who was killed by her own children and the second one being her child, whom she had created to battle against his siblings. She had become his lover, trying to fill the void left in her life by her husband and yet, he was killed soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>This made her consider herself unlucky and undeserving of love. The whole thing made no sense but trauma rarely made sense after all.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only after he had reached a level of strength where he could take on all three of them, Red, Ophis and her in a single combat and win, did she get assured of his safety and agree to open her heart to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Looking at him growing up makes me happy. Despite having a considerable lead on others, he hasn’t slacked off and is still racing forward. It has even increased more since he discovered the world he is in. This spirit reminds me of myself when I had just started off. Unfortunately, I didn’t have things go as easily for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that why you are making things difficult for him too?” She asked and he smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you noticed?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. That Rhino was nearly a T6 monster. No monsters in that level of area were supposed to be that strong. Is it some kind of test that you are putting him through?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Test? No, not really. It’s more of a reminder. If he has everything going as he planned, he would grow lax. The enemies he is going to encounter in the future won’t give him any chances. In the wise words of the Joker, ‘Nobody panics when things go according to plan’. No heroes are born walking simple paths. Every one of them have lived through great obstacles and only then did they get to carve their names on the annals of history. I am merely giving him a tutorial of such a life. What, any questions? After all, you have been personally observing him all this time, you should know better?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She apparently saw his relationship with Junior as what she had with her own children before their betrayal. She and her husband had raised them, trained them and protected them and when they grew up, they turned on their own parents. She feared that Junior would do the same when he grew up.</p><p><br></p><p>“He….seemed like a decent person till now. The anger he had against those goblins as well as the bandits who had captured the girls or even against the fool who had insulted the <a href=\"https://devil….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">devil….it</a> was not fake. He seemed to deeply care about them, despite knowing that the ones captured by Goblins were <a href=\"https://fake….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fake….it</a> still pained him, haunted his dreams for days. Moreover, even when he was tempted by the Devil, he controlled himself and thought about <em>her</em> family first, about how they would feel and if they would be hurt. Such people….are hard to find.” She finished reluctantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, he didn’t jump her?” He asked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t checked on anyone’s private moments. He had no interest in voyeurism after all. Only the girls did that, especially Red.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, she had been doing so since the beginning of time through everyone’s dreams. It was just another day for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Tia rolled her eyes</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, such high praise. If I didn’t know better, I would think you were impressed by him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am only saying that his performance has been acceptable until now.” She huffed.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a tsundere.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I guess that works.” He left the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>He held her tighter and closed his eyes, relaxing.</p><p><br></p><p>Junior might be living his adventure but he had already become the Hidden Boss. He has earned his well-deserved rest.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Phew.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter took a bit longer than expected.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I got stuck in some work of my own.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, a few things happened.

To think they would send her to receive me.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of me stood a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous body, appearing to be in her early twenties with back-length silver hair that features a long braid on each side with small blue bows at the ends, while the rest is let down which ends in twin braids and red eyes. Wearing a blue and white french maid uniform and looking at me with a stoic look on her face was the strongest Queen, Grayfia Lucifuge, the Queen of Saelena Lucifer herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Even as I stood just a few metres away from her, I could feel her power. It wasn’t as if she was exuding her Demonic Power or anything, if anything her power was restrained greatly to an extent where I couldn’t even feel it but my instincts told me that I wouldn’t stand a chance against her in a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>My instincts had become even more pronounced since I had used the Demon’s Extract Teigu on myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Our stare off was broken by the voice of Mephisto who decided that he had had enough of the uncomfortable silence. “I wasn’t expecting you to be here. I was expecting someone from Ajuka’s place….then again, it’s understandable considering how busy he is.”</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed slightly towards the man.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Mephisto and he answered my unasked question. “Ajuka is very picky when choosing peerage members for his peerage. He generally hires people for himself rather than having his own peerage. For example, if he is working on a certain project, he would hire people suitable for that project under contract and after the deal is completed. If they wish to join under him, he can ask any of his subordinates to reincarnate them but not himself personally. He has very high standards of hiring people.” Then he came near my ears and whispered in a voice which I was sure was easily heard by Grayfia. “He had asked Tiamat to become his queen but she rejected. Poor boy. Got burned the first time he asked a girl out.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I guess you are in a hurry so here, take him away. Just make sure to drop him back on Sunday night. He has classes to teach on Monday morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will inform Lord Beelzebub about it.” The woman spoke for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She then looked at me. “We will be leaving now. Do you have anything to do before that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like to see my students before leaving.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, be quick.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had actually come here to talk to Mephisto about when we would be leaving as the guy hadn’t given me any time, just that someone will be coming to pick me up.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t expecting to leave right now.</p><p><br></p><p>I went back to my room with Grayfia following me.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy and Akeno were playing around with Kuroka and Shirone while Matsu was actually practising magic.</p><p><br></p><p>She had really invested all her free time in practising magic since I took her as my apprentice. </p><p><br></p><p>‘I cannot let people disrespect you for having a bad apprentice like me.’ were her exact words.</p><p><br></p><p>As she started learning, we discovered that she was extremely talented in the Human Magic System which involved large calculations so I had her take classes under other teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not going to let her talents go to waste because I myself didn’t know much about the Human Magic System.</p><p><br></p><p>I rarely got time from learning the magic from the Wizarding World to bother about other types of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Potions were not my cup of tea and yet necessary for learning Alchemy under Dumbledore.</p><p><br></p><p>I was more interested in other types of magic which I had learned from the books given to me by Sirius.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a few days since Lucius had summoned me and I was waiting to swindle him too.</p><p><br></p><p>The subjects which had me interested the most were Charms and Enchantments. The former was quite easy for me but the latter required lots of studying.</p><p><br></p><p>Arithmancy was easy for me but I still needed to learn and memorise the Ancient Runes to help me progress further.</p><p><br></p><p>Funny enough, this world had runes too.</p><p><br></p><p>Most factions had a runic language of their own, including the Devils. This was also how Devil Magic Circles were made.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizarding World Runes were very similar to the Norse Runes and I plan to study them when I finish these books in my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls all looked at me when I opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I am going to the Underworld for the next two days. Don’t slack off while I am gone and don’t get in trouble.” I looked at Matsu. “If you need anything, just ask Mephisto while I’m gone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take care.” Matsu wished. She was worried about me going to the underworld as she understood things better.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>They gave me a quick hug and I turned towards the silver haired maid. “I am ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just nodded and a silver magic circle enveloped us, transporting us from our mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>When the light of the Magic Circle subsided I found myself in a hall I was unfamiliar with. Many people were walking around without paying attention to others.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Grayfia’s appearance only caused them to turn towards her for a brief moment and give her a slight bow and nothing more than that.</p><p><br></p><p>She led the way without a single world and I followed her.</p><p><br>Five minutes later, we were outside the door of an office, the nameplate on the door already making it clear whom that office belonged to.</p><p><br></p><p>Satan Ajuka Beelzebub.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia knocked on the door and a voice came from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>She opened the door and we entered.</p><p><br></p><p>The man behind the desk looked up from his paperwork at us. “Thank you, Grayfia.”</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed and left the room, leaving the two of us alone but not before giving me one last look.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy pointed me towards a chair and got back to his work again and another uncomfortable silence prevailed over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything and took this time to look around and check out things in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The room had several book cases. In fact, all the walls of the room were covered with books.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked more like a library than anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>A quick look at the books revealed that there were books on many topics and not just magic. From science to politics, history and geography, there were books on all subjects from what I could see.</p><p><br></p><p>He finished his work after a few more minutes and kept his pen aside and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Before we start anything, you need to sign this.” He brought out a piece of paper from his drawer and put it in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up the paper and read while he spoke again.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a non-disclosure agreement stating that you will not reveal anything you see or hear while working in my facility. Apart from this, you will not carry anything out of here without permission from any authorised officials. The rest is basically the terms of the internship.” He said and gave me the time to read through everything.</p><p><br></p><p>I took my time and read through the entire twenty eight page contract.</p><p><br></p><p>“It says that I have to reveal my true identity.” I said looking at him. I had already expected this much. Apparently Mephisto hadn’t revealed anything to him about my true identity, keeping his side of the deal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Despite however this whole thing is termed, it is a sentence for your crime. You have to reveal your identity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wanted to leave that day if your subordinate hadn’t forced me.” I argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you could have. My subordinates watch over the safety of this city. If they find anything or anyone suspicious, they have full right to investigate. He only asked you to come in for questioning, didn’t attack you, didn’t use force. You were the one who went out of line first, caused destruction of property, caused public disturbance and chaos. Those are all charges of crime against you. The only reason I am doing this is because Mephisto paid the fine and even compensated the owner of the inn for the loss. That only leaves the charge of public disturbance against you, which comes to three months of public service of which you are getting two months. Page number 32 of the fifth book on the third shelf on the wall to your left.” He replied in a bored tone and pointed towards the wall of books.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part was that the thing about the right to investigate was not something he made up just for me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was actually a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the main reasons for that being this town itself was something he watched over directly. It was actually a <em>personal</em> property of the Beelzebub and he could decide however he wanted to protect it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was necessary too as in just one year, they get several cases of attempted attacks as well as thefts but none of them are successful due to their measures.</p><p><br></p><p>I had actually read about everything to prepare for myself if this thing ever went to the legal system despite Mephisto’s assurances.</p><p><br></p><p>But still, just to piss the guy off, I still walked up to the wall and pulled over to the page he had mentioned and took five minutes to read everything.</p><p><br></p><p>After it was done, I kept the book back on the wall and turned towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will I have to reveal my identity to everyone in this place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Just me and a few others.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. It was going to happen one day or the other.</p><p><br></p><p>I moved my fingers slightly and let my Transfiguration fall off as I saw him looking at me curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Acelin Abaddon.” I spoke and saw a look of realisation flash in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Alright, you can go back to your disguise. It was not an illusion. Was it another application of your Transfiguration Magic?” He asked. “There were no visible signs of the transformation, even the magic around you didn’t give any indications.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It is an advanced application of Transfiguration called Self-Transfiguration. Learning this part requires a high mastery of the subject so I haven’t been able to teach this to anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, troubling. It would be troublesome to guard against someone who can change how they look on a whim. I will have to think about something as a countermeasure.” He started to speak to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I just waited for him to get back and he did….fifteen minutes later and looked at me again.</p><p><br></p><p>“What will be my job here?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. I completely forgot about that….”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>This guy has a natural talent of getting on people’s nerves.</p><p><br></p><p>“First sign the documents.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and did.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have seen your book on Transfiguration and while only the basics, it gave me some ideas about some of my own projects. Your job will be to assist me in those projects.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “May I ask what these projects entail?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am planning to upgrade the workings of the Evil Pieces.” He then summoned some papers for me to read. “These contain a simple summary of how the Evil Pieces work. Roughly explained, they have two functions, first is the conversion of the target’s race to a devil. It is a sort of transmutation ritual which changes the target’s body and soul to that of a devil, either fully or partly depending on the race of the user. This is why if the user has some form of divinity in their souls like Gods and Buddhas, they are not affected by it as Divinity is simply above that kind of ritual. Are we clear to this point?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The second part is using the energy of the Agerasite Crystal, out of which the Evil Pieces are made up of, to boost certain aspects of the target’s power depending on the piece used. Speed for Knights, Defense for the Rooks, Magic for the Bishop and everything for the Queens and Pawns.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pawns give boosts too?” I asked. “I thought they only converted others into devils and the boost was due to the racial conversion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They do. The boost is however small for a single piece. It however becomes noticeable if multiple pieces are used.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, my plan is to improve the Transmutation Ritual using Transfiguration to stabilise the transformation so that more energy can be allocated towards empowering the target. Or well, this is at least one of the things I have in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>He summoned a magic circle in his hand and in front of my eyes, one of his paper weights transformed into a little mouse.</p><p><br></p><p>The mouse moved around and was about to bite a paper when the transformation fell and it turned back into a paper weight.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have noticed some things about Transfiguration Magic and wanted your views on it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Some things were not covered in your books or in your classes either so I couldn’t find any answers to those. The creatures you create, are they alive?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes and no. I haven’t taught this to any of my students because no one has reached this level. They are something in between.  They are alive in every biological sense however, they are not alive because they don’t have any soul or spirits inside. They are created by my power and my thoughts when creating them moulds their will. For example….”</p><p><br></p><p>I snapped a finger and the same paper weight transformed into a mouse exactly similar to the one he had created and this time, it simply went to the pen stand and grabbed a pen and dragged it out.</p><p><br></p><p>The transfiguration faded after that.</p><p><br></p><p>“This however requires a great expertise on the subject.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you create intelligent creatures with this?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, no…..not yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eye at the answer and I explained more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Creating small creatures is easy as they basically work on instincts. The more intelligent the creature, the more complex their brains. To create them, I would need to understand everything about the functioning and structure of their brain….and even then it’s difficult to say if they will have true intelligence or just be like newborn children.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that sounds reasonable.”</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not like I haven’t thought about this problem but creating a true and intelligent life is anything but easy.</p><p><br></p><p>I had some ideas but I didn’t have enough expertise in transfiguration magic to create a fully functional human, let alone do something beyond that.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look like you have some ideas.” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>….was my face that easy to read?</p><p><br></p><p>“I am working on something but it’s not complete yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Something to create intelligent life?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I still have no clue about that. This is a completely different topic but might be helpful later on.” I wasn’t going to give him the <a href=\"https://details….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">details….at</a> least not free of cost.</p><p><br></p><p>This was my private magic and I had full right to distribute it to those I wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>Not even the Satans could force me to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>This was something I researched and Mephisto explained to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, the guy didn’t force me but thought for a moment and spoke again. “May I ask for a demonstration of your magic?”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about it too and nodded. If I could attract him with this magic, I might just get something I have wanted for several years now. “I would need a test subject, preferably a criminal who is being interrogated.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow at my demand but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Fifteen minutes later, we were in one of the cells where a devil was being held in chains.</p><p><br></p><p>There were injuries on his body and I could sense no magic from him but that was due to the handcuffs he was wearing. Those things were used to bind someone’s magic.</p><p><br></p><p>The guards bowed to Ajuka and he picked up the file from the table and read it out aloud.</p><p><br></p><p>“Abigory Tishmah, High Class Devil, was reincarnated by Gareth Nebiros and later traded to Maelkin Amy, found trying to steal data from the Research and Development Department and selling to someone outside. He was captured for two days and hasn’t opened his mouth yet. Will he be good enough?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He would be perfect.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else would you need?”<br><br></p><p>“A canvas, paint brushes and colours.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”<br><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I have been studying anything I could from the Wizarding World magic and one of the most interesting things were the spells used to make portraits.</p><p><br></p><p>There was nothing like that in this world and I really wanted to learn about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The spell basically required the magic from the target to be inserted into the painting and this magic copied their memories and personality to the painting, creating a clone of sorts in the painting.</p><p><br></p><p>It reminded me of the Shadow Clones from Naruto and how they had all the memories of the original despite only being made up of the user’s chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>My theory was similar.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra was made up of both Physical and Spiritual energies of the user. The Physical energy was used to create the boy while the Spiritual Energy was used to create the memories and personality.</p><p><br></p><p>In the case of the paintings, only the Spiritual energy or magic was used as a soul of sorts while the Painting itself acted as a body.</p><p><br></p><p>The spell was used to push the user’s magic in the painting in a specific manner and the enchantments were used to lock the said magic inside, finally creating the whole painting.</p><p><br></p><p>The process however required the user to voluntarily push his magic inside. If they resisted, the consciousness inside the painting would be muddled.</p><p><br></p><p>On further reading, especially from the Black Library, I found out that there were ways to forcibly create the painting too by using the blood of the victim as the ritual medium.</p><p><br></p><p>This was also my own plan for creating an intelligent life. I planned on using this technique on transfigured humans instead and see if they would be like a clone of the target.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, the paint brush charmed by me was continuously drawing a portrait of the guy for me.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way I was going to learn how to paint just to learn this spell. While I was interested, I didn’t have that much time.</p><p><br></p><p>On the side, Ajuka was sitting and watching what I did.</p><p><br></p><p>The portrait would be completed in another hour.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, I was preparing the frame for the portrait and using some enchantments on it.</p><p><br></p><p>The enchantments on the frame were the ones which allowed the portraits to travel from one to another as well as the part which allowed for the painting to act like a world of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to do more experiments with these but those will have to be reserved for later when I am on my own.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I was done with the enchantments and at the same time, the portrait was completed.</p><p><br></p><p>I stood up and walked towards the prisoner with a knife of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>The Goblin Silver knife was something I had received from Sirius from the Black Family Vaults.</p><p><br></p><p>It was very good for preparing materials used in rituals.</p><p><br></p><p>The devil in front of me was already unconscious so it didn’t take much effort to cut and extract some blood from him.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving, I cast another spell on him to keep him asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the last step was using that blood in the colours to give some final touches in the painting and one extra step, one last magic.</p><p><br></p><p>With a wave of my wand, the picture came alive.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy in the picture looked around in panic, not understanding what was happening. It was understandable too as in the Wizarding world knew about how portraits worked and the target also injected their power voluntarily so the portraits knew that they were portraits which was not the case here. For this guy, he was just being interrogated and suddenly he is trapped in this painting. This gives me a lot of room to manoeuvre.</p><p><br></p><p>I just looked at the guy with a smile. “Hello Mr. Abigory. My name is Ace, the one who has your soul in my grasp”</p><p><br></p><p>“W-what!”</p><p><br></p><p>I turned the portrait and showed him the unconscious body of Abigory before going there and slapping the unconscious devil in the face.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, just a soulless body in a comatose state.” I smiled again. “I have a lot of work to do so let’s keep things to the point shall we? The sooner you finish answering my questions, the faster we will be done and the better it is for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me out. No, you cannot do this. Let me out! Stealing souls is forbidden. You cannot do this”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh but I can and I am. Don’t you see me doing this. You forget who the ones forbidding Soul Magic are. You tried to steal from the very same people and now you talk about laws? If you don’t answer, your body will be thrown outside, claimed to be suffering from some disease, perhaps the Sleeping Illness while we can torture your soul for the next few centuries until you break. As devils, you already know how much time we have on our hands and trust me, I can be very creative with my tortures.” I waved my hand again.</p><p><br></p><p>The paint brush flew to the portrait and started drawing a huge flame beside it.</p><p><br></p><p>“No! Stop this, please. Stop this!”</p><p><br></p><p>“And do you know the best part about all this? We can torture you as much as we want and you will not die. Pretty fun, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop this. I will answer everything. Stop this please.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha great. You should have done that sooner and we could have avoided all this unnecessary work. Oh my, I forgot to stop the paint brush. My apologies.” I said while waving my wand again and stopping the paint brush.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards Ajuka. “Have someone take him outside and get your answers.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and had one of his subordinates take the portrait outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally with just us in the room, he spoke, his voice still calm. “While I appreciate the answer, stealing souls is indeed forbidden.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged and sent a stinging hex towards the unconscious devil and he woke up with a start.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good thing I didn’t do that now, did I?”</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time since coming here, I saw the guy being surprised and went on to check the now conscious devil.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then that was?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just a spiritual imprint, a copy of him, a clone of his mind up to this point in time, whatever you want to call it. I just lied to get what I wanted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else can it do?” He asked, understanding that at this point I was selling him the technique too.</p><p><br></p><p>“The people in the portraits can travel between one frame to another. They don’t have to be spiritual imprints and even new consciousness can be created using one’s own magic. They can spy for the one designated as the owner as well as act as an overseer for locations. For all matters and purposes, they will be the clone of the person at the time of the creation of the portrait. You can imagine all kinds of usage for such things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was this also your plan to create intelligent life?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A part of it, yes. It’s still quite a long way from completion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Very well, I will have to do some tests on the portrait and I will get back to you. Till then you should go to Lab 8. I will inform the one incharge there to instruct you about your work here.” He then gave me an ID Card. “Don’t lose this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and he teleported out of the room, leaving me to find Lab 8 alone.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I returned back to my room by 9 at night, several books with me courtesy of Reed, the one incharge of Lab 8.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a human who had approached Ajuka to progress his research and was recruited by him.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the years, he rose up the ranks and became the incharge of one his the labs of the Research and Development Department and was personally reincarnated by Ajuka as a pawn piece.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he was incharge of one of the most important projects right now.</p><p><br></p><p>The books were basically about devil biology and magic in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>After I showed him my magic for creating portraits, he removed me from the Evil Piece project and sent me to Lab 8 which was researching a completely different thing entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>They were researching how to create new Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, creating new life and not just reincarnating Devils from other races.</p><p><br></p><p>Reed was a surprisingly easy going guy and helped me out by answering my questions.</p><p><br></p><p>I got to learn more about the situation of the Devil Race, the Evil Pieces and the three factions as well as the other factions in a lot more detail than most common people did.</p><p><br></p><p>For example the need of Evil Pieces despite it arousing irritation among other factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Initially when Lucifer created the Devil Race, there were seventy two Pillar Houses and several Extra Devil <a href=\"https://houses….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">houses….at</a> least that’s what common people nowadays know and talk about.</p><p><br></p><p>What they don’t talk about is the legions of Devils he had created to populate the lands.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a total of six million six hundred and sixty six thousand six hundred and sixty six devils and even more demonic beasts under his rule. With over five hundred Ultimate Class beings and nine thousand High Class beings. Right now the population of the entire underworld, even with the reincarnated Devils, was just one and half million devils including reincarnated devils.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the Civil War, with only thirty four houses surviving and less than ten members in almost each house the number of devils ranked High Class and above alone was less than five hundred.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now that number has increased to nineteen hundred, an increase of fourteen hundred hundred in four hundred years.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if all of these people had Evil Pieces, and used all fifteen pieces to reincarnate fifteen separate individuals, it would only be around twenty one thousand new devils, a far cry from the original numbers. But the actual numbers were far lesser than that as many people reincarnated people with multiple pieces and those who reincarnate other devils as peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>As easy as it seemed in the Novels, finding Devils and getting reincarnated was not at all that common.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all, even in a country like Japan, I only knew about two High Class devils in one town from the story. The actual number is a bit higher and about five.</p><p><br></p><p>There were only about five High Class Devils in the entire country, actually four since the death of Cleria Belial. The main reason they spend time in the Human World apart from the hobbies of some people was to find good and talented subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>People converted to Devils for several reasons, the prime reason being to gain longer life spans and better magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Before the Evil Pieces were invented, there were numerous cases of people doing unthinkable things to gain longer life spans and youth or greater power. Rituals of sacrificing hundreds were not uncommon even among humans.</p><p><br></p><p>These rituals were dangerous and the participants, if found out, would be hunted vigorously by other supernatural factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Nowadays however, these cases have gone down and most of these people choose to become devils instead.</p><p><br></p><p>Many able magicians come to devils to get reincarnated so as to gain the buffs from the Evil Pieces to reach a higher level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes however, the gain in power is not enough for them and they go towards the one restriction which the new Satans have followed with an iron fist….eating souls.</p><p><br></p><p>As Devils, we gain power the fastest when devouring souls. It is in the basic biology of the Devil Race.</p><p><br></p><p>They used to make deals in return for the souls of the owners, the case of Faust and Mephisto is one prime example.</p><p><br></p><p>The main reason behind this was Lucifer himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He had rebelled against his Father on the topic of the Free Will of humans so he wanted to seduce and make those same humans sell away their most important thing, their souls. It was his way of rubbing it in his Father’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, there are ways to directly devour humans and eat their souls.</p><p><br></p><p>It is mainly done by Youkai but Devils can do it too.</p><p><br></p><p>The downside is that their power becomes corrupted and twists their bodies, turning them into hideous monsters or as they call it, Stray Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>To bypass this and give the people another way of gaining power, Ajuka Beelzebub made the system to gain power from Deals although this method was approximately one thousand times slower than eating souls.</p><p><br></p><p>After this, to force the people to actually put effort into training instead of consuming souls, the entire Rating Game thing was invented.</p><p><br></p><p>The purpose of the Rating Games was far more than just a means of gaining fame and money as well as promotion to higher ranks.</p><p><br></p><p>The main reason was to cover for the reduced numbers by increased strength of each individual as well as encourage the High Class Devils to make stronger peerages instead of just using the pieces as a means to gather harem members.</p><p><br></p><p>But even after all this, the rate at which the Devil race was recovering was not good enough. For this reason Ajuka was focusing on creating devils like Lucifer did. This plan was however unknown to other factions as well as other houses of the Underworld’s devil race or they might restart the Great War before he has a chance to succeed.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why he put me in Lab 8 to work on the project with his end goal being using the Ageresite Crystals and Evil Pieces to actually strengthen Devils by making Sacred Gear type of artifacts from them.</p><p><br></p><p>Man….I wonder what would happen if the guy found out about Malebranche existing already?</p><p><br></p><p>I guess the Transfiguration and Portrait Spells did impress him.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, I am surprised that he hasn’t asked me for these two. I showed him the techniques because I had something I wanted to trade with him.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I just have to wait for a while till he asks me for the spells.</p><p><br></p><p>When inside my room, I checked the entire room for any spells or devices which could be used to spy on me but didn’t find anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Regardless, not willing to take any risks and reveal my greatest secret, I removed the trunk from my locket and enlarged it, entering the room inside.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way I was going to do any deals in that room.</p><p><br></p><p>The inside of the trunk had several rooms which I had furnished over the period of the last year. Sirius had really outdone himself with this one. There were a total of fifty one rooms inside and would be no less than a small castle.</p><p><br></p><p>There was even a decent library which contained books I had traded or had copied from the libraries of Grauzaberer Magician Organisation and now I was planning to do the same to the books from Ajuka’s labs.</p><p><br></p><p>As I sat down and put the quills to work, I felt a summoning and got ready for the usual.</p><p><br></p><p>Opening the portal, I saw an unknown face on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had blonde hair and looked almost nordic.</p><p><br></p><p>“My word, the thing actually worked. What manner of sorcery is this?” The man spoke in an old english accent or at least that’s how I heard it.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my personal spell. It allows me to speak with people far away from me and trade with them for I am a trader who wishes to be the best in the world. May I know what place you are in and your name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Place? I am a little distance from Windhelm and this is Skyrim in the lands of Tamriel.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and may I know who I am having the pleasure to speak to?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am called Kilth Copper-Bearer.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy and felt his power, searched through his surface thoughts and couldn’t help but think….I couldn’t be this lucky, could I?</p><p><br></p><p>He was apparently quite excited at the magic I was showing and asked me while I was still in thought. “What wares do you sell, trader?”</p><p><br></p><p>That broke me from my thoughts and made me concentrate on the person in front of me. “My wares are according to the needs of the buyer. You seem like a warrior, exceptionally powerful at that. Is that a Dragon’s power I sense from you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, I am Kilth Copper-Bearer, the Dovahkiin.” He answered proudly and a smile automatically found its place on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I have just the things you need.” I quickly summoned the items which I had bought from Wiz and lined the armour and weapons in front of the man. “These are the finest sets of armour and weapons created by the masters of blacksmithing renowned throughout the world. Each one of them is enchanted to have special effects. As someone who is on a quest to fight dragons, may I suggest these weapons and armour. They have the property to do extra damage against Dragons and resist their magic too. With these, your quest will have a higher chance of succeeding.”</p><p><br></p><p>I started displaying the products one after the other and explaining the effects to him.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy didn’t seem to be interested in magic stuff which was not bad for me but he had a glint in his eyes when looking at the weapons and armour, clearly interested in them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there something which interests you, warrior?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The swords, Dragon Slayer ones. What do you want for those?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very good choice for one like yourself. These beauties will greatly assist you in your quest. I generally trade my wares not for money but for other things that might interest me, weapons, books and tomes on magic, blacksmithing, alchemy, rare potions or recipes, artifacts….or if you would be willing to run an errand or two for me, I wouldn’t mind that either.” I said as my mind worked in overdrive, trying to think of things I could ask him for.</p><p><br></p><p>Few things came to mind but it would depend on the guy himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sounds fine. Let me show you what I possess. We can discuss further after that.” He nodded and unloaded everything in his possessions.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw a variety of things, including some potions, spell tomes, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the spell tomes and found them to be spells on Transmute Mineral Ore, Telekinesis and last but not the least Heal Other.</p><p><br></p><p>The deal was struck quickly and I exchanged two weapons for the three Spell Tomes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t seem to be interested in the Spell Tomes, warrior?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aye, I am not much of a mage myself. The subject just eludes me no matter how much I try so I gave up on it. I was just planning to sell these when I reached the next town.”</p><p><br></p><p>….damn.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case you are welcome to summon me whenever you plan to sell things like these. I can provide you with other items or even gold and you won’t have to carry these on you till you reach the next time. Always remember me. Actually know what, hold on a moment.” I quickly summoned a bottle of alcohol, something I had started keeping with myself. “Here, take this as a sign of friendship from me.”<br><br></p><p>“I couldn’t….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t worry. Just keep this friend of yours in mind when you get something interesting. I need to become the greatest merchant in the world after all. Can’t do that if I don’t have good products.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy checked the alcohol, opened the bottle and took a sip of it and laughed at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. Then call me Kilth, friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>As I was asking him about other stuff and his journey, to find out what quests he had done, I recalled the location he said he was at and it struck me.</p><p><br></p><p>Windhelm….wasn’t that where that White Phial quest was?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy. “Say friend, you said you were in Windhelm, correct?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am near the place.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. I just happen to require something which is near that place. If you don’t mind, I could reward you if you do me the favour?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way I was going to send him for the White Phial. The artifact was just too precious to entrust it to anyone else. I needed to do it myself.</p><p><br></p><p>But that would involve me going to Skyrim and I would need Matsu to summon me back so it can only be done when I get back to Grauzaberer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. Say what you need. I will do my best to get it done for you, friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s simple. I want you to summon me using one of my summoning contracts two days later. In the meantime, I want you to find the location of the Alchemists living in Windhelm. Just this. Will it be a problem?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Simple enough. I don’t see why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. In that case, see you in two days, friend. I am afraid I am getting called for another deal.” I was indeed getting another summoning request.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good luck, friend.” He waved and I smiled and then closed the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>Putting the Spell Tomes aside, I opened the portal again. This time a familiar face greeted me on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello Lucius. The week was almost up and I was wondering if I had to pay you a visit myself. I hate exerting myself. As you already know from my reputation, Belphegor, the Lord of Sloth. Exerting myself annoys me and annoyed me can be very….dangerous.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw him turn paler. It was surprising considering how pale he already was.”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly threw a pouch towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the pouch for any spells and found nothing. On checking further, I saw that it was filled with coins, around twenty thousand galleons.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Our deal is completed. I always like people who complete their sides of the deal. Now, going by the look on your face, I can deduce that you want another deal. So….what is it that you desire?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I want to know the location of the Dark Lord’s Horcruxes.”</p><p><br></p><p>My smile widened. “Oh my. Lucius, you sly dog. Wanna get one over your Master. Didn’t think you had it in you. Good, no great. I appreciate it. But are you sure you want to know the location of the Horcruxes? It wouldn’t solve anything, ya know. You are just too weak to do anything about them. After all, even Dumbledore would have a high chance of dying if he went after them. You….just can’t get to them no matter what. The information would be wasted on you and I would lose my payment if you died somewhere near. Sure I could take your soul then but, I don’t like payments in souls. Too bad of a currency. Your soul for six fragments of his….is just not worth it. Obviously if you want to know, I can for the small price of one and a half million galleons only.”</p><p><br></p><p>He gritted his teeth and I saw his hand clench on his cane.</p><p><br></p><p>“I could instead make sure that every last one of those horcruxes is gone….a price of course.”</p><p><br></p><p>He thought for a moment and asked. “What do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two million galleons,  five hundred books on Mastery Level or above Enchantments and Potions and twenty House Elves to serve me. A fair deal, right? Just half of your property and your entire family lives. You more than doubled your assets in the last war so you would still be in profit if you ask me. What do you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>I let him seethe for a while but the guy nodded after a while. “I agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then we have a deal. I want the payment in a week. Voldemort will not come after you after that, I give you my word.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Goodbye then, Lucius.” I waved at him before closing the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>Huh….I didn’t think it would work so well.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently, I had picked up a very nifty skill of Devils and Fallen Angels….Charm.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite subtle unlike the mind manipulation spells as it worked on amplifying the innate abilities of the user’s charm and thus acts like a subtler version of Veela’s Charm, making people more agreeable to my advice.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t expected it to work so well.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucius was an occlumens but I guess he was more worried about the Voldemort thing than I was thinking to leave his mind so undefended, especially against someone like me. I think I need to look into more abilities natural to Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>At least I am getting rich again.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore was not going to summon me today so that only left me with the books I needed to study for work.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Saelena Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Acelin Abaddon? The son of Bedeze Abaddon and Mariane Belphagor, that kid?” She asked, stunned at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Ajuka just nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t surprised at the reaction as he had a similar reaction too.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that boy, he….didn’t he have very low Demonic Power reserves? Then how did he….?”</p><p><br></p><p>“As per the rumours, yes. That’s what I heard too. Not that you need Demonic Power to learn Human Magic or his own Transfiguration Magic or anything else that he uses. I haven’t seen or heard him using any Devil Magic yet. That said….the power I sensed from him….it’s definitely Ultimate Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then do you know how he did that?” She asked urgently.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head. “No. No idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You should calm down, Saelena. The kid was just six years old when he was diagnosed with his condition. Bedeze jumped the gun and threw him out with Mariane. What worked for him might not work for others.” Serafall said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know but….” She let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are really making a big deal about Ria-chan’s condition, are they?”</p><p><br></p><p>“More than you would expect. And it’s not just some people talking but other people are actively pushing the issue to make it into a big deal.” She clenched her fists as she remembered Grayfia’s reports.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it because of the new legislation we passed?” Serafall asked and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“A part of it, yes. They discovered that they had no way out of the situation and gave up on it but now they are using Rias’ condition to target me. On one hand they say that Satans cannot be involved with their families and make a big deal out of every thing we do and on the other, they target our families and use them to undermine our positions. Sometimes I wish I could just….” She gritted her teeth as her power seeped out of her body when she recalled what they were doing to harass Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay okay, calm down.” Serafall quickly raised her hand and she again took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“These people never learn. They did the same to Sairaorg until he was unofficially exiled with Lady Misla, they did the same to Acelin Abaddon and now this….sigh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not just them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not just them. The biggest instigator is actually Lord Bael.” She said, narrowing her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. On one hand, he is still pissed off about us passing the new amendment. It’s also about Sairaorg not inheriting the Power of Destruction, something which I thought had gone away when he exiled Sairaorg and his younger son awakened the Power of Destruction, but instead now he is pushing all that onto Rias so that people focus more on us than the Bael House.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And his jealousy.” Falbium added.</p><p><br></p><p>“That too. He never lets go of any chance to rub it in my mother’s face. That bastard had the gall to come to our home and call Rias a failure, that she was affecting the Bael name by association and that we should change the heir to my younger brother Milicas. I was so tempted to show him who the best user of the Power of Destruction in the Devil Race was and erase him right that instant….” Grayfia put a hand on her shoulder, calming her again.</p><p><br></p><p>All this extra work and the things at home had left her irritable and exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is your family taking the whole thing?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are being supportive. To be honest, they don’t care about her condition. They were the same with Sairaorg too so obviously they wouldn’t be different to her. It’s her that I am worried about. She has just closed herself from everyone. She is not even eleven right now. How could people….sigh.” She closed her eyes and massaged her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“It could go away if the boy is revealed, you know. His existence would just prove that having low Demonic Power or inability to use Demonic Magic means nothing in childhood. Things could change.” Falbium suggested but she shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. That boy….he’s gotten to this level all on his own, at such a young age, something which most people cannot do even with all the support. I cannot even imagine the amount of hard work and suffering he must have gone through. And he is still keeping his identity hidden to keep himself away from trouble. If I revealed his identity, sure things on Rias would cool down for a bit but he would be thrown under the dragon instead. How is that any different from what Lord Bael is doing right now? Just thinking about it makes me feel disgusted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case you could always ask him for a trade.” Ajuka spoke up after a long time. “The boy seemed to be odl\\dly willing to do so. He was even baiting me to propose an offer to him today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He has apparently invented another unseen magic, something very interesting too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? What kind of magic?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s the reason I have called you all today.” He said as he summoned something.</p><p><br></p><p>Was that a portrait?</p><p><br></p><p>A snap of his fingers and the portrait was hung on the wall in front of them and they could see the man in it looking around in terror.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now Abigor, would you be kind enough to repeat what you confessed to us today?” Ajuka questioned the portrait.</p><p><br></p><p>….and then the portrait….spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ace in the Hole’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We got to see more about Ace’s visit to Ajuka’s lab and some of his plans.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the other hand, we saw a new face among the customers while Lucius just got scammed hard.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We even found out about some more AU elements in this world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I had an idea and wanted to try something new.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>To be honest, I am tempted to write more of this and would have done so if I hadn’t had two other stories lined up.

Shizuka was the only one I asked to come with me.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t told both Rias and Latia about any of this meeting to not get them worried and knowing Lavinia or Ingvild, they could have blurted out the secret inadvertently so I didn’t involve them either. So, in the end, Shizuka was the only person left.</p><p><br></p><p>The mansion was situated in Rudiger’s own territory on the borders of the Mammon Territory, probably to stay near his own master.</p><p><br></p><p>Devil Races’ ranks were not exactly dependent on strength but rather social positions. It had taken me some time to know the reason for this.</p><p><br></p><p>Positions were based on the contribution they have made to the Devil race and came with various privileges. For example Ultimate Class Devils came with a personal territory of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>And in some manner, it made sense as someone might be an Ultimate Class in strength but they wouldn’t get any territory until they used that strength to help the Underworld out. The exceptions to this rule were the Pillar and Extra Demon Houses who have lived on these lands. The reason they got this land is because it has always belonged to them. Their families and ancestors have stayed and protected these lands with their sweat and blood.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, these things were quite similar to the human world.</p><p><br></p><p>But Leila had explained more.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, the whole process of reincarnated devils ranking up served for them to assimilate with the devil race. If they had been handed out the privileges without this, it would be the same as distributing free land to potential spies and allowing them to make a power base in our own home, an extremely foolish action.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger was one of the most prominent Rating Game players and has been an Ultimate Class for a long period of time and thus having his own territory was not out of ordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>The man himself was near the gates to receive me, a show of appreciation for my help.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Rosenkreutz.” I nodded while Shizuka gave him a slight bow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Call me Rudiger, please Matty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha sorry about that, Rudiger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in, the guest will be arriving soon with Lady Leviathan’s peerage members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Serafall really isn’t taking any risks, is she?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a bit necessary considering the guy coming here is the trump card of Heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just as we were talking a magic circle appeared in the place and two people walked out of the circle.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was Serafall’s Bishop, Medusa. Yeah, the same Medusa from the Greek Mythologies. I have no idea how it happened but Serafall was able to get her as her Bishop. Behemoth was her rook while Ziz was her mutated Knight.</p><p><br></p><p>That woman was really making a trio of the beasts all in her peerage and was only missing a leviathan which I guess she was <a href=\"https://herself….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">herself….in</a> a way.</p><p><br></p><p>Medusa was a woman with purple hair and golden coloured eyes, at least in her human form. In her true form, she was perhaps different but I didn’t know how she looked.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, she had the smell of a serpent and felt slightly draconic.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t met much with her before as she liked to keep to herself.</p><p><br></p><p>While I was looking at her, she was also looking at Shizuka and me, perhaps weighing us. I have no doubt that she could feel our draconic nature too. If anything, she would be able to feel it far better than even Serafall or Behemoth.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded at us after staring at us for a few moments more than necessary and we returned her nod and then turned towards the guy next to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Blonde hair and green eyes, the guy had a smile on his face even when in the territory of his so-called enemies, surrounded by some of his strongest. By reflex my Senjutsu worked to tell me that he wasn’t exactly faking that smile of his.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger took the lead and welcomed them both.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me introduce them to you. He is Lord Mathias Buné Zagan, the Lord of Buné and Zagan Houses and one of my friends. I hope you don’t mind his presence.” He asked the guests who shook their heads and we were led in.</p><p><br></p><p>The mansion was quite lavish, nowhere near the Gremory or Astaroth mansion or even the Glasya-Labolas or Sitri but then again, they were Pillar Houses with several millennia worth of wealth while he was just a few centuries old magician.</p><p><br></p><p>In the living room of the mansion was a child with sea blue coloured hair looking at us with curiosity and excitement in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid looked to be around ten years old and it was honestly painful to think that the kid was suffering so much due to an unlucky draw of fate.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….</p><p><br></p><p>He stood up with slight difficulty with help of one of the maids around him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Al, don’t force yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I am alright.” He shook his head and looked at us and bowed. “Hello, my name is Alfred Rosenkreutz. Thank you for coming to meet me. I am sorry for causing you inconvenience.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. It’s fine really.” Dulio was the first one who went ahead and greeted the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>The two got along quite well and I could tell that the kid was a fan. What I wasn’t expecting was the kid looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Buné Zagan.” He looked in my direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just call me Matty. Lord Buné Zagan is a mouthful, right.” I smiled at the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm Matty, your Rating Game was amazing. There was something I wanted to ask you.” The boy said after hesitating for a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those creatures you created….those were Saibamen from Drag-so-ball, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yes. Yes, they were. Did you like them?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s eyes turned bright at the reveal and he cheered up. “Really! I knew it. They really looked like Saibamen and even grew from the ground and even self-destructed like them. It was awesome.” </p><p><br></p><p>“Glad you liked it.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a bit before Rudiger asked the maids to take him and Dulio to the garden while we stayed back and watched as the two played together.</p><p><br></p><p>Dulio seemed like a really nice guy because I couldn’t sense even the slightest bit of malice from him….for any one of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger on the other hand was looking at his son with sadness in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Rudiger.” I couldn’t help but call out to him after seeing such a look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If I am not being too intrusive, could you tell me what kind of Sacred Gear Alfred has?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a mutated Sterling Green, a light type Sacred Gear which is the main reason for his health deterioration. For other types of Sacred Gears, we could have found solutions but this….it’s not only weakening him by sapping his vitality but also poisoning him at the same time.”</p><p><br></p><p>This….wasn’t this quite similar to Tobio’s case?</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you tried sealing it?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me and nodded. “We are unfortunately not skilled enough to do that. Even Lord Ajuka hasn’t worked with Sacred Gears enough to know how to do  it without causing any problems for Al. Moreover, the light poisoning might still remain.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of something and spoke after a moment. “This….I….might have something which could help him but….”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! What do you need? Please tell me, I can give anything for that chance.” The man suddenly turned around and asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man seriously. “I just need an oath of confidentiality. You will not reveal anything to anyone. Also, I cannot guarantee anything so I make no promises.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter. If there is even the slightest bit of chance, I would take it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Then bring him to my home tomorrow. I will talk to Serafall and see if I can get the help of Euclid and maybe Ajuka for the whole project.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will contact them right away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please stay here. Your son would appreciate your presence here right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at the two playing in the garden and then talking till Alfred was tired and it was time for dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>“So Dulio, what do you normally do when free? What are your hobbies?” I asked, starting a conversation with the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me?” The guy was taken aback by my question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I don’t exactly know what people at church do with their free time. You might not realise it but for most children here, they are monsters just like devils are for normal humans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….well, I like going to places and finding new foods to eat. I bring them to the kids at my orphanage because they like those too.” He said after some thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Which orphanage?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, the one where I grew up although the church manages many of them and I visit those ones too. I like seeing their happy faces when they enjoy new kinds of foods.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, yes. Sharing food with people….is sharing happiness.” I replied, the moments of my own initial days in this world flashed before my eyes. “Only those who have suffered starvation can know the true value and taste of food. You are a good man, Dulio.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no it’s nothing much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t deny it. While many might consider it a simple, even worthless task compared to killing and shedding blood to protect others, it is more important than anything Starvation….that’s one enemy I wouldn’t wish even upon my enemies. You know what? Shizuka.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please have someone prepare 100 tons of food items to be sent to Dulio for the orphanages.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait no, you don’t have to do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Consider it a donation from someone happy with your work and wanting to give some children some food….or would the church not accept donations from a devil? If so then I can have some human organisations make the donations through anonymous means. I mean it’s not like I am giving them the food. It’s for the kids.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not it. I….thank you. I will accept them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. I will talk to Serafall to have the order delivered.”</p><p><br></p><p>One hundred tons of food was not much for me. In fact, I was just going to give them the food without any special effects so it was much cheaper than my other products. What mattered the most is that it would reach the kids in orphanages.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things and Dulio was actually more open to me after my gesture. I liked the guy’s nature and was pretty sure we could become good friends.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time to leave so I invited Alfred to my farm before we left the mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy left with Medusa and Rudiger also decided to go with them to talk to Serafall and Euclid while both Shizuka and I left the place by ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think it was wrong to donate food to them?” I asked Shizuka as we walked out.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is donating food a bad thing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean the kids could become exorcists who could come after us tomorrow or other devil houses could target us for donating food to our enemies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The kids haven’t done anything yet. Moreover, didn’t you say you were donating food to the orphanages? What’s the problem with that? We are not donating anything to the church….and even if we did….do you actually care about what your enemies say?” She asked, looking at me blandly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yes. You are right. It’s just that I am being more careful as my actions as the Lord of the Land will also affect the people of this land in the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Personally I think it was a good move. A show of friendliness from our side in reply to Dulio’s gesture could bring some ease to the ever strained relationships between the two factions. Although if you really want to do something for the orphans, you could always open up some kind of organisation of your own or even build orphanages in your territory. I don’t think there are any as of now.” She added at the end.</p><p><br></p><p>“There aren’t?” I asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“From what I have read, the last one went out of business one hundred and eighty years ago when the Lord of the land couldn’t support it, not to mention there were not many people in the territory either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see….can you please put it in the priority list? We are opening an orphanage for children in our territory….regardless of races. I remember there are children like Shirone and Kuroka who couldn’t get the privileges of the orphanages due to not being devils themselves. I don’t want those kinds of children to be returned from our territory. Accept them too. The orphanage will be funded from my personal funds. Also, In future, if you think there are any more of such problems in the territory, please inform me in our private time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Understood. I will prepare everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger worked quite fast and several people were at my home the very next morning.</p><p><br></p><p>“Things are never boring with you around, are they Matty?” Serafall asked as she sat down and Ingvild served her some fruits. “Thank you Ingvild-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rudiger told me that you had something planned for solving Alfred’s problem. Could you tell me what your idea is?” Euclid asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s a three step plan and I would need permission from the Satans for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am listening.” Serafall said.</p><p><br></p><p>“From what I have heard, Alfred’s problem stems from two main causes. First, his weakness due to the Sacred Gear continuously sucking away his magic and vitality and second, the light poisoning from the light based Sacred Gear. Am I wrong anywhere?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I have personally checked Alfred and those two were the main causes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, about the first case, I have seen someone who has suffered from a similar situation but in his case, he was a normal human and the Sacred Gear he had was….a Longinus which had been in the state of Balance Breaker since birth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin’s Queen, Tobio. His Sacred Gear was sealed away by his grandmother using Buddhist methods so I can assume that sealing away the Sacred Gear would prevent it from sucking away Alfred’s vitality.”</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid looked in thought. “It sounds good and let’s assume that it works but who would do the sealing? Neither Ajuka nor I have any experience with this kind of thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave the sealing to me. I can do something about it for the time being. In fact, it would be the first step for the whole plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>I hoped that my B+ Ranked Sealing wouldn’t let me down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Second step would be to solve the poisoning. For that, I have some temporary solutions. First, I could have Valerie….use her Sacred Gear to temporarily give him immunity against the light poisoning. Doing anything further would have adverse effects on Valerie and I cannot allow that. And the final step would be to feed him things that would allow him to develop resistance to Light Magic on his own. If we carry these three things then he should be able to recover completely in around a decade at best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s actually a reasonable plan. Although we will have to bring Alfred regularly to carry out the second step and the food items for the third step cannot be revealed or both the Grigori and Heaven will start a war against us without any delay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s why I said I needed the permission of the Satans to use those to treat Alfred.” I shrugged then looked at Serafall.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….Rudiger and anyone else involved will have to sign a magical contract to not reveal anything to anyone else. Apart from that, just pay attention. We don’t want any wars on our doorsteps.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am ready to sign any magical contract.” Rudiger agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I will teach Valerie the process. You should bring Alfred to visit after Matty returns from his meeting with the representatives, Rudiger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I will do so.”</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed the details and Rudiger went ahead to arrange the things we would need for Alfred’s treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The only ones left were Serafall, Euclid and I.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get my request to donate food to the orphanages through Dulio?” I asked Serafall who nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“One hundred tons. What made you think of doing that out of nowhere?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I saw how a guy trained to kill our kind came to the underworld to fulfil the wish of a kid, played with him without any kind of ulterior motive and was genuinely caring about his situation and wanted to do something in return.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of food will you be offering?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The normal kind. I don’t want the Church to use them to feed their people and give the kids some random low quality stuff.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would they do that?” Ingvild asked, making us look at her. Seeing our looks, she quickly explained. “I mean would the church people even accept something from a devil? Don’t they hate everything related to us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I would be more reassured if that were the case but things don’t work so simply, Ingvild-chan.” Serafall said. “They hate anything related to the other pantheons, calling them ‘pagan’ and yet that doesn’t stop them from using Holy Swords of other Pantheons or using the blood of their heroes for their experiments. Hypocrisy is the greatest weapon in their arsenal. None of you should underestimate the extent they can do and then use the name of their God to wipe out all of that under the rug.”</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, I sensed no malice in her words. It was as if she was just stating the facts.</p><p><br></p><p>“They can always claim that they burned away the food given by the devil to corrupt the minds of the children and use them for their own top soldiers behind everyone’s back….and even research how to grow their own stock from them. Not that they would succeed. But still….” She turned towards me then. “You understand that other houses, especially the ones you picked up a fight against will use this to smear your name, right?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I do and I have already taken precautions for this. Five hundred tons of food grains will be distributed to all orphanages in the Underworld by House of Buné and Zagan and we are opening the biggest orphanage in the Underworld in the Zagan territory in the next few months. Shizuka is already preparing the plans and they will be handed to Sirzechs for approval by the end of the day since it involves many territories. Moreover, as I said, I am donating to orphanages not the church. If the Church steals the food, that will be on them.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….that should more or less take care of it. Have you decided whom to take with you?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I will take Ingvild, Lavy and Shizuka with me.” I didn’t tell her about Crom and Leafa but they would be in the backup for the worst case scenario.</p><p><br></p><p>“The three of them would be good. I was planning to send Euclid with you but Dulio came here alone and we cannot exactly argue about you having any guards from our side due to this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take care and always be alert. If you feel anything amiss, just leave. We will handle everything.” She said and this time I could sense the seriousness in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>She left after sometime while Euclid went ahead and talked to Valerie before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s all Dulio could tell us about the new Zagan Devil.” Raphael said, finishing the report which had just come from the Vatican. “He donated food for the kids of the orphanages through Dulio, perhaps to show a friendly gesture.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Unnecessary. It must be one of his schemes to make us drop our guard and bewitch the young minds of these children. You shouldn’t fall for his schemes, brother. I am still telling you that we should finish him off while we have the chance. His….creations are too dangerous for us and the current balance of the three factions.” Uriel added, making him sigh in frustration.</p><p><br></p><p>“And I have repeatedly told you that we are not in a state of war. We need to meet the boy before we decide anything further. Moreover, what would people say if we return the gesture of friendship with betrayal?”</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel kept quiet but Michael could see that his rage had not abated in the slightest. He has been holding the grudge of their brother’s death even now.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out another internal sigh and turned towards Raphael. “Have the preparations been made?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes brother. The location has already been checked by the people of both sides and there have been no dangers sighted anywhere. We have also stationed people there to keep an eye on any kind of movements from their side to ensure there is no problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Gabriel and I will go there and have a talk with him.”<br><br></p><p>“As you say brother.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kokabiel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the man in front of him with a smirk on his face. To think there would come a day where he would be approached by these stuck up people.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have five minutes to sell your side or you can give up your life and spare me the effort.” He started as he stared at the man in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Church has decided to propose a temporary alliance with you against a common enemy of our sides.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?” He already had an idea who they were talking about and if he was honest, Kokabiel was probably the first one who wanted to go ahead and rip that filth’s head off. Too bad Azazel was too much of a coward to take the step….just like during the Great War. The fool doesn’t realise that if they didn’t take the last step, they wouldn’t have any chance to take any steps in the future. That demon’s creations would make the Devil Race too strong for them to do anything and by then it would be too late.</p><p><br></p><p>He had obviously started preparing his own methods of countering the dreaded future. It would be for the best if he could kill off that boy but if not, starting a Great War earlier when they had a better chance of winning would be far better than later when they had no chance of winning.</p><p><br></p><p>But he obviously would not get up and walk hand in hand with these church people for such a thing. They probably had some kind of trap prepared for him as well and even if he were to succeed, there was a high chance that he would be killed by them if he were to be weakened enough. And all this was not even considering the fact that Azazel would most likely declare him rogue for his act, even when he saved the entire fallen angel race against such an enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all, since they had come to him so they must be prepared to offer something to him as a bargaining chip to enter the game.</p><p><br></p><p>He had to make the most of it. As for them preparing a trap for him, they were not the only ones who could prepare traps.</p><p><br></p><p>“And who might you be talking about?” he asked, mockingly.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in front of him frowned but answered. “Let’s not pretend that you don’t want this as much as we do. Mathias Zagan is as much of a danger for us as he is for you. This is the best chance for us to end such a danger for both our sides once and for all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well that’s for Azazel to decide. You should go and talk to him, the governor general of the Fallen Angels.” He smiled. “But since you are here, I assume you were turned down by Azazel already and came here when you had no other option. So tell me, why should I go and risk going against my leader and join your side, with the risk of being declared rogue? What is in it for me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man gritted his teeth but controlled himself but he wasn’t going to let them go so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Moreover, if this was actually sanctioned by Michael, they wouldn’t have sent someone like you, David Cero, a no name exorcist to discuss the matter with me. Which means like always, it’s the Church planning things behind Heaven’s back.” Seriously and to think Azazel stopped the war and accepted defeat against such weak willed people.</p><p><br></p><p>No. He shouldn’t let such thoughts influence his mind right now.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected the man’s face turned livid and his hand reached for his sword, the Holy Sword Excalibur Galatine, the sister sword of Excalibur.</p><p><br></p><p>Did this fool think that just because he could wield a holy sword, he could match him, a cadre of the Fallen Angels?</p><p><br></p><p>Not everyone was that freak of nature, Vasco Strada.</p><p><br></p><p>If he actually hadn’t been interested in the deal, he probably would have killed the fool right here if only to retrieve the blade. At least that way the sword would get an able wielder unlike a moron like David Cero.</p><p><br></p><p>All his subordinates raised their weapons and looked at the man at the same time, making him realise the situation he was in and he took a deep breath and pulled his hands back.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Church is willing to offer a Holy Sword and free five hundred stray exorcists for you to take.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahaha one sword and five hundred humans. You must be seriously overestimating yourself if you think that going to make me move. That boy is a Zagan and the betrothed of Sirzechs Lucifer’s sister and Ajuka Beelzebub’s niece. Laying a hand on him would mean restarting the Great War. And you want me to jump in that kind of thing for just five hundred humans of unknown loyalties and physical and mental conditions and one sword? You must be out of your mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>If he was honest, he would gladly do such a thing without the slightest bit of hesitation but when the Great War started, the first one everyone will be gunning for would be Kokabiel himself. For that reason, he needed assurances. He needed assurances</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what do you want?” The man asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Excalibur Fragments that are housed in the Church. I want all six of the Excalibur Fragments the church has and the research on the Siegfried Project used to create Super Exorcists for this arrangement to go anywhere. I am not moving a finger without that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then leave. Oh, and be warned. Azazel, Michael and even the four Satans will be aware of….certain parts of this conversation before the meeting between the boy and the representatives of Heaven.” He smirked, pushing them into the edge.</p><p><br></p><p>“You!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well then I doubt that a fool like you would be high up enough to decide about such a thing so tuck your tail between your legs and scram back to your masters. My time is precious. If my information is correct then your meeting is in one week. I will give you three days. Now get out.”</p><p><br></p><p>The fool scrambled out after his subordinates stepped forward, each with their own weapons and ready for war.</p><p><br></p><p>As he left, Kokabiel was left in his own thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a big plan needed manpower, even if not to kill the Zagan then to save his own life after the fallout of the whole thing, because he was sure that the Church would not only offer him the items but also send their best after him.</p><p><br></p><p>Now….what should he do?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Do you want me to come with you?” Armin asked the moment he heard about the whole meeting business.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin found out about my trip and it was the first thing he asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. For my peerage members, I have a reason but I won’t have the same for you. Dulio did come alone. If anything, it was only due to Serafall’s stubbornness that I could even bring my peerage members with me. You coming along would be….controversial.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who cares about controversies? Your life could be in danger. How did you even make Rias and Latia agree to this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at his question.</p><p><br></p><p>“They don’t know about this, do they?” He asked with a deadpan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are going to get into a load of trouble when they find out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t do this if I didn’t have to. They would never let me go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And for a damn good reason. In this matter, I completely agree with them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin….I will be completely safe. Trust me. You have no idea how many precautions I am taking for this journey.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, then convince me or I tell those two right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well you heard me. At this point those two are the only ones who could talk some sense into you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. Things have already been decided. At this point, they will only get angry and worried for no reason. Trust me, I am taking Lavy, Ingvild and Shizuka with me and just in case, I have also called for my Rook to keep an eye from a distance and Leafa will be on the side to be summoned at my will. At that point, even if all four Archangels gang up on me together….I’d win.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have another rook?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeah, I didn’t tell you about him, did I? He is Tia’s friend….and stronger than me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Stronger than you?” He asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. In a life and death battle, I’d die if I fought against him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep it a secret alright.” I asked and he nodded. “Crom Cruach.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Crescent Circle Dragon, the strongest of the Evil Dragons! How did you even meet that kind of guy, not to mention convince him to join your peerage?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, well….we fought. Remember that day, when we found out about my parents and I returned, beaten up?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. He had come to fight with Tia and I….was not in the best of moods. I wanted to let loose for once and I offered to fight him instead. Hahahaha that guy is strong. He totally kicked my ass and all I could do was rip one of his arms off and that too not completely.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think there are many who can do such a thing. He is comparable to the Dragon Kings.” Armin said, shaking his head and taking a sip of his drink.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, that’s old news. That guy has become a Heavenly Dragon, he trained himself to that point or I wouldn’t have lost. He visited a few times after that and liked the atmosphere here, especially the Dragon farm. We sparred a few more times and he offered to join my peerage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….amazing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right? We didn’t tell anyone about it to keep him as a secret trump card. You know how many people want to see me gone, especially after this farm business. Not to mention, it would have drawn too much attention to me. I didn’t need any of that anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what kind of person is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh he’s a training and battle maniac but when he is not in one of those moods, he is pretty chill. That said, he only gets in one of those moods when he encounters someone he considers worthy of challenge so he is mostly chill. You should see him tilling the soil sometimes. He’s gotten really good at it. It’s just that he roams around the world most of the time. I’ll introduce you when he returns the next time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That <a href=\"https://should….be\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">should….be</a> fine. Still, you shouldn’t put yourself in dangerous situations like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean….I couldn’t let Alfred’s possibly last wish be denied, could I?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….you dumbass….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t worry. I will be fine.” I laughed and reassured him.</p><p><br></p><p>Worst case, I can just call for Red and use my favour to make the three factions become </p><p>two factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s just hope that things don’t come to that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satanael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“My my, and here I thought you came here to arrest me, brother.” He smiled as he sipped on his glass of wine.</p><p><br></p><p>The person in front of him scoffed. “As if. I could care less about Azazel and his cowardly decisions. Let alone one that prevents the Fallen from reaching higher levels of power and claim their rightful place at the top of the Three Factions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad not everyone understands that.” He agreed, supporting Kokabiel’s words. Although he didn’t agree with his brother’s over aggressive thoughts, he agreed with the sentiment of putting the Fallen Angel race over the Angels and Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>But unlike Kokabiel who had the false conceptions about his own strength, Satanael knew that the Fallen Angels were the weakest race among the three factions.</p><p><br></p><p>The Angels had four of the Great Seraphs still alive and each of them have greater power than Azazel, the strongest of the Fallen Angel race.</p><p><br></p><p>They also possessed the weapons left by Father which would put them at an absolute advantage against those at the same level.</p><p><br></p><p>The less said about the Devil Race the better. Those bats had gone from being on the verge of extinction after their Civil War to being the strongest among the three factions, especially with the two anomalies in the new Satans. Although their race was divided into pieces and would fracture in times of war, it still didn’t change the fact that they could still rival the other two factions by themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>And all of this was done by the efforts of Ajuka Beelzebub and Euclid Lucifuge’s scientific prowess.</p><p><br></p><p>If anything, he admired Azazel’s forethought and ideas to create Artificial Sacred Gears as a means to rival them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was after all his reason for starting the research on breaking the limits on the Supernatural races. If Sirzechs Lucifer and Ajuka Beelzebub could break through the limits of their race, there was no reason why the Fallen Angels couldn’t do such a thing as well.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that his research required some things which didn’t match the current thoughts of the Fallen and thus here he was….</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not as if I am displeased by your visit but you are not the type of person to pay welfare checks to others. So, why exactly have you graced me with your presence, Kokabiel?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….require your assistance in a matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To remove the single greatest threat to the survival of the Fallen Angel race. I want your help in taking down Mathias Buné Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael narrowed his eyes at the name.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zagan.</p><p><br></p><p>He still remembered the hunts against that pillar, after all he was one of the people in charge of it.</p><p><br></p><p>To think one had escaped and not just some commoner but one with this kind of power.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias Buné Zagan was the name he both admired and hated at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>This boy, barely an adult, had done something which Satanael had been trying to do for centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>He had found a method to break the limits of Supernatural races.</p><p><br></p><p>Food products which could break one’s limit….</p><p><br></p><p>It had made him drop all his work and start working on those products.</p><p><br></p><p>If it hadn’t been for him being closely guarded by those four Satans all the time, Satanael would have tried to bring him in for his own research as soon as he discovered the news about him. He had obtained those products and tried to research them and even find the method to recreate them but while he could verify the effects, even on the Fallen Angel race, he couldn’t develop a method to recreate them.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, the boy has put such strict regulations on his products that getting higher ranked products is nigh impossible for other races through illegal means.</p><p><br></p><p>He was stuck at a dead end just like that but now it looks like some path had opened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Since you are here, I take it that you have some plans of your own?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was approached by the church. Those fools have been worried about the boy as well and it seems that just like Azazel, Michael isn’t really doing anything about him. Heaven is organising a meeting between him and Michael and the church wants to take this opportunity to finish off the threat before it could become bigger. They have extended me an offer to cooperate with them and I want your help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh! Those church people have always been too enthusiastic in causing trouble, even going against Michael. Seriously, the quality of Heaven has only gone down since the Great War after Father’s death. It just proves that Azazel’s decision to pull out of the war was wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>No. No it wasn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>If Azazel hadn’t pulled out of the war back then, the Fallen Angels would have been reduced to a third grade faction, no more than those magician organisations. Of course he wouldn’t say that to Kokabiel’s face right now and break the chance of cooperation.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Well, I won’t lie and say that I am not interested but even you know that I am in a rather precarious situation right now. While I would like to take action, the rest of my partners wouldn’t take it lightly if I didn’t have anything to show for it. They obviously work for themselves and not for the Fallen Angels.” He said with a resigned voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not a fool, Satanael. I know that you want something out of it too and I can’t expect help from you without any price. I am willing to offer two fragments of Excalibur and the research data on the Siegfried project.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! The church is willing to bring that out? I guess they are really shaken by the idea of the Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And they are right to do so.” Kokabiel finished.</p><p><br></p><p>“Of course. Hmm, this is a nice bargain but you can keep the swords for yourself. They do not interest me. What I want is the data Azazel has on his Artificial Sacred Gears and….the Zagan boy’s body.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want the boy’s dead body for my research. Say what you will about him but this boy developed a method which can be used to break the limits of Supernatural races. I want to see if I can recreate it by myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You want to use that devil’s power….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will use any power to obtain the results I want, brother. I am afraid that’s non negotiable.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kokabiel just stared at him for a while and then nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can have the boy’s body….as long as he is dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I believe we have a deal. Tell me the details of the meeting and I will make some preparations too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will send you all the details of the meeting.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, he left.</p><p><br></p><p>Kokabiel did keep on his promise and just two days later sent the data on the Siegfried Project.</p><p><br></p><p>Siegfried’s blood samples contained traces of Fafnir’s power. This was the reason behind the enhanced physical and magical powers of the test subjects as well as the physical changes in their bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>The test subjects were however driven insane most of the time or died due to their minds and bodies not being able to take on the stress of the Hero’s blood and the dragon’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>It was similar to his own research on using Ophis’ power to enhance the people under him, making it act as a trigger to break through their limits.</p><p><br></p><p>The effects were lost if the Snake was removed from their bodies and this was something he had to work on. To completely fuse the power with their bodies so the effects were permanent….the same thing which the Church had been trying to do with the Siegfried Project.</p><p><br></p><p>And talking of dragons, the Buné were also known for their draconic <a href=\"https://traits….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">traits….it</a> was as if everything was fitting together like pieces of a big puzzle.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, since he had taken the rewards, he had to do his part in the whole thing as well.</p><p><br></p><p>His job was to find a way to teleport them away from the location of the meeting to the place they would ambush him.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy would apparently be coming with his peerage members but he didn’t have any idea about who those peerage members could be.</p><p><br></p><p>There is rough information about them and he could only identify three people among them.</p><p><br></p><p>The former student of Glenda Goodwich and the user of Absolute Demise, Lavinia Reni. The former host of Divine Beast Suzaku and the Heiress of the Himejima Clan, Shizuka Himejima and Natsume Minagawa, the user of Gryphon, one of the Four Fiends Sacred Gears. Apart from this, another girl and the two children in his peerage were still unknown but he doubted they were any danger judging by their ages.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not only interested in the boy but also the Four Fiends girl for his experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>So….how to separate them from the others?</p><p><br></p><p>He thought about it and finally came up with a plan to get just what he wanted. It might drag in one or two stragglers but he wouldn’t mind them. Not to mention, the members of the Utsusemi Agency wanted an in to have a chance to take down the Himejima girl. They had thought that the girl was dead until she appeared in that rating Game as a peerage member of Mathias Buné Zagan.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also the Wizards of Oz who were also interested in the Zagan boy and his magic for research purposes and thus contributed to his plan.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t get why I have to use this?” Crom said as I gave him something Tia had given me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will help you hide your identity. We don’t want to expose you being in my peerage to people for as long as we can. Please….just do me a favour.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just shrugged and wore the bracelet and sure enough his draconic aura disappeared, even his smell changed and he appeared as a normal human.</p><p><br></p><p>I see, so this is what Tia has been using to keep her transformation into a devil a secret.</p><p><br></p><p>“There will be many people from Heaven and the Church. We don’t want them to freak out more about me than they already do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always show them how futile their efforts of going after you would be. They couldn’t even stop Ddraig and Albion by themselves even with their Father alive. With the two of us together and their Father gone, they would just crumble.”</p><p><br></p><p>“First thing, we are not supposed to know about their Father being gone so please don’t blurt it out. Second, their Father was extremely exhausted during the Great War due to some….reasons. If he had been at his full power, Ddraig and Albion wouldn’t have stood any chance against Heaven. They would have obviously caused lots of damage but would have died nonetheless.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He was exhausted?” Crom asked, surprised and suddenly intrigued. “What could exhaust him to such an extent?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....something we all owe him a favour for.” I had no intention of ever recalling Trihexa.</p><p><br></p><p>“I sense fear from you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because it is something to be feared.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Even with the power you keep hiding inside you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....the power inside me is not something I can control and even if I could control it some day, the fight between us would probably destroy the world.” And here I smiled. “And you know how Destruction is not exactly my thing so let’s not talk about this. Some things are better left untouched.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy turned around and scoffed before walking away. “I will keep an eye on things although I would be happier if we had a fight suitable for me. You will be giving me the spar you owe me either way.”</p><p><br></p><p>….yeah, no I am fine as we are.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, I have a weird peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>With Crom taken care of, I walked back to my home.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall will be coming at any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Back at home, Lavy, Ingvild and Shizuka were ready for the trip already.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, a magic circle appeared and Serafall and Euclid came out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything ready?” She asked as soon as she came out.</p><p><br></p><p>She was dressed in a business suit and was in a serious mode unlike her usual bubbly magical girl self.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>She explained some things to us about what and what not to do in front of the leaders of Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>To say that the Underworld and Heaven had a complicated relationship would be like saying the sun is warm.</p><p><br></p><p>On one hand they want us gone, to die in the most unpleasant of ways possible and on the other hand they want us to live and remain decently strong so that we can stand together against other forces.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing which comes in the middle is us getting culled enough to keep our powers in balance. This is the principle on which the Three Factions have existed since the end of the Great War….and now my arrival has threatened to kick this so-called balance in the balls all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>It was obvious that they would be uneasy about me.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid gave me a badge. “Take this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s this?” I asked as I looked at the thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“A tracker.” He gave one to each of my peerage members. This will keep us updated on your position. Just activate it and we will know that you are in danger. Sirzechs’ peerage and members of Falbium’s guard will be standing by. They will arrive at your location as soon as they can. I repeat, use this as soon as you feel any kind of danger.” he then turned towards my peerage members. “Actually, you three do it because I can’t trust him with this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi!”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not joking about anything, Mathias. This is a very serious matter.” Serafall said, not coming out of her serious mode even once.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded seriously. “I will be careful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, we set off.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tiamat -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked over at the distance where the so-called meeting would take place, her trusty bracelet hiding her presence like always when she suddenly felt a presence behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning behind slightly she saw the figure approaching her and turned back to look at the meeting venue again.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you find me?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Instincts.” Crom Cruach said as he sat down on the edge of the cliff overlooking the site of the meeting. “Didn’t know you were coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just passing by. This looked just as good of a place as any to rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>The dragon didn’t reply and just looked in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“You really care for him, don’t you?” Crom spoke after some time.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t reply and just looked ahead, her silence enough of an answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about you?” She questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish to see where the future of dragon kind goes. And my instincts tell me that I will get my answer here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You might be right too.” She replied after remembering everything she did about Mathias. “But is that good enough for you to protect him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>No more words were said between them as both of them focused on what they were here for.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘The Farmer’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sorry to those who were expecting the fight in the chapter but I needed to set things up properly.

That guy would probably tell me to not waste my time on such things and train.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were broken by someone’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will he buy….do you think he will buy our manga?” I turned in the direction of the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Two girls were currently staring at a guy reading a manga. The guy finally nodded and took the manga to pay for it and the girls cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yay! Someone bought our manga!”</p><p><br></p><p>A third woman just sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not the first copy of the manga to be sold. We are a new manga publishing company. The sales will obviously be low at first. Instead of standing there and watching them, you should ask for their opinions on what we should improve to increase our sales.” She said, her words attracting my attention all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>A new manga company.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked up to the shelf where the guy was reading and picked up the manga.</p><p><br></p><p>Monthly Comic Earth Star.</p><p><br></p><p>Huh, that’s a new name.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the manga and read a few pages of the manga.</p><p><br></p><p>….it <a href=\"https://was….alright….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was….alright….no</a>. It was slightly below alright.</p><p><br></p><p>Something else attracted my attention. An advertisement in one of the pages.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could read more I sensed the gaze of one of the girls looking at me and turned towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please buy the manga….don’t read it here.” The brown haired girl, she….almost begged me.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled, embarrassed. “Yes. I intend to buy it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! Really!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I was just reading the advertisement.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The advertisement?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This one about recruiting Mangaka.” I pointed to the advertisement section on the back cover of the book.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….the mangaka recruitment?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I want to apply for this.” I replied calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you aspiring to be a mangaka?” The black haired girl asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, if you don’t mind, could you tell us your views about our manga? Ah, I apologise, my name is Aki Torii. I am the assistant editor-in-chief of the Earth Star Monthly Manga. We are a new company and were wondering what we can do to improve our manga.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I am not exactly an expert or anything but you would need some good mangakas. Since you are new, I doubt the top guys would be willing to come to you instead of going to the more….well established manga publishing houses. The best thing you can do now is find more….consistent mangakas. Those who can keep their quality up and keep producing manga regularly without any delays. Once your manga gains traction, you can try other options. For now….just try surviving in this race. As for reviews, I would need to read the whole thing to give you any review,”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….quite thoughtful of you. Thank you for your opinion.” She brought out her card and passed it over to me. “You can call me when you want to submit your manga. May I ask what kind of manga you wish to submit?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought for a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a monthly manga right now so submitting One Piece would be dumb. Maybe I can publish smaller mangas like ‘Kaichou wa Maid-sama’ here for the time being.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a Shoujo Manga.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, it’s perfect for now.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a bit when Tobi and Sae arrived and then left the place to go back home.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I held my sword up, parrying the strike which sent me flying and crashing into a nearby mountain, sending cracks throughout the area. I felt my blood rise up to my mouth but didn’t even have time to cough it out as I kicked the ground and dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the attack which cleaved the mountain and several others behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>The sheer speed and power behind the attacks was insane. It was nothing like the usual fights between us and even then I knew that this was not even close to the true level of his power.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks was a veritable monster.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t even using Haki right now and I was already struggling this much.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s take this up a notch. You said that guy’s ability overwhelms the mind with fear and prevents your mind from seeing him, correct? Then we are going to beat the fear out of your mind. Get up and get ready for level 2.” And with that said, I felt a mountain crash on my very soul, spatting blood on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t chill around like a princess. Your enemies won’t wait for you for that long. They only need one moment to take your life and then it will all be gone. All your work, all your hopes, dreams, hard work….all gone. Would you like someone to do that to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>His words struck my heart as I remembered everything, the reason I was going through this training at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my sword in my hand and breathed my answer out. “...o.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I couldn’t hear you. You don’t even have the strength to speak, how do you expect to defeat an enemy like this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Louder.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Louder!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Arghhhhhh NO!” My Conqueror’s Haki erupted in rebellion against the vast wave that was Shanks’ Haki and I kicked the ground beneath my feet, rushing forward to swing my sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks dodged my attack with ease and the next moment, I felt a massive blunt force attack my stomach, draining all the air from my lungs along with some vomit and I felt the world go black for once. And yet, despite the pain and hopelessness of the situation, my Conqueror’s flared even stronger than before and I swung my sword towards him. Obviously, he parried it with ease, although the slash from me cleaved the ground behind him leaving a hundred metres long trench. The next moment, I felt the weight of his Haki increase even more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Words are only good when backed up with action. Try harder.” He said as I felt a punch on my face, sending me flying once more.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, the attack was enough to rob me of my consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up to the smell of booze and looked around to see Shanks sitting there, drinking alcohol as usual.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long was I out for?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fifteen minutes. Last time you were out for twenty seven minutes. Hmm, maybe I was holding back my punches.” He said holding his chin in a thinking pose.</p><p><br></p><p>No! No you weren’t holding back.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to retort but I knew for sure that he actually was in fact holding back a lot so I kept silent.</p><p><br></p><p>With only two days left for my duel with Nurarihyon, I decided to throw myself into life and death battles with my mentors to push my battle instincts to the peak.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, it resulted in my death countless times in this dimension as all my mentors were frighteningly competent.</p><p><br></p><p>Even though I was far stronger than Tobirama and Itachi physically now, they could still run circles around me with their battle experience and techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I was getting closer to them with every death. For example, now, I could fight Tobirama for over an hour without dying.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only Hashirama and Shanks, these two who were on a completely different level and by that I mean on a whole nother level, so much so that it wasn’t even funny.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting against Hashirama was like fighting against a monster with thousands of wooden tentacles which come at you in an endless wave until they drown you.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the pollen from flowers was enough to render me unable to fight in just minutes and that’s with my already insane resistance to poisons, not to mention the Shin Susenju. That was a whole other beast in itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Today I was doing the same thing with Shanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Although in this case, if he were to use his full power, I would lose consciousness instantly from his Haki only so it wouldn’t be much of a fight. This was the guy who could make Admirals crumble with his Conqueror’s Haki from kilometres away. So, I left the choice of strength to him only that he has to push me to the brink.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was the result.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, time to get up. Only three days left.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, I was given another round of beating….</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“I will return in two days. Listen to whatever Tojou-san says and don’t cause trouble, okay?” I asked Tobi who nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t worry about Tobi-kun. He is a very good boy. He will not cause any trouble for us.” Sae’s mom, Sanae-san said with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her and then looked at Gin.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take care of Tobi, alright.” I said brushing his head.</p><p><br>“Woof!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nii-san!” Tobi protested at my joke….although considering the fact that Gin was the strongest one in the room apart from me, it wasn’t actually a joke.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should take care on your trip, Tatsuya-kun. Eat on time and don’t stay up too late.” Sanae-san reminded me before handing me a bento.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sanae-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>The excuse I had given them was that I was going to meet my friends and go on a trip with them.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t wholly incorrect as I was indeed planning to meet my friends, there was just no trip. Instead, I was planning to fight Nurarihyon.</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, I turned around and left.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rikuo Nura -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat beside his grandpa and faced the guests who had come to visit the Nura Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>The well built man with a scar on his face looked dangerous but it was the woman beside him who felt more intimidating to Rikuo.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl behind then kept her head bowed but sometimes raised her head to look around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many years has it been, Gozaburo, Ren?” His grandpa spoke, breaking the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Over a decade, Nurari-sama. The last time we met was when you accompanied Rihan-sama for our daughter Sun’s naming ceremony.” The woman said with a bow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. I remember. The Sakamushi of the Seto Group is a delicacy hard to forget.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then please allow us to serve you sometime in the future, Supreme Commander.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha sure sure. But I have retired now. The new commander of the Nura Clan is my grandson, Rikuo.”</p><p><br></p><p>This caused both the older guests to look at him and he greeted them.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Seto Group would be happy to work with Rikuo-sama in the future. Please visit us sometimes. The Seto Inland Sea is a very good place to have some vacations.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be honoured to. Thank you for your invitation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now that the greetings are done with, what brings you here Gozaburo?” His grandpa asked the man who had been quiet for the entire conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>The man took a deep breath and put on an even more serious face as if that was even possible.</p><p><br></p><p>“A while ago, a boy, a human, saw my daughter’s tail.”</p><p><br></p><p>He saw a serious look come up on his grandpa’s face. “I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>Although confused, he looked at them in confusion, choosing not to interrupt their conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Unfortunately we couldn’t find him as he was just a tourist there and he got away. What we were able to find however was that the boy lived here, in Tokyo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” Grandpa took a sip of the tea in his cup and looked at the man. “And I take it that you wish to hunt him down?”</p><p><br></p><p>This caused Rikuo to snap his head in their direction. “What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Mermaids of the Seto Inland Sea along with several other races living under the seas around Japan come under the rule of the Ryujin-sama. They abide by several rules to keep their community safe. In the case of Mermaids, young mermaids’ legs transform when they get wet. They can control it when they become adults but till then, if their tails are seen by anyone human, they have to take care of them to prevent the spread of their existence among common people. If they fail to do so, the mermaids who were revealed….have to kill themselves.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s….not fair.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not and I don’t want to kill him either. He saved my life.” The girl spoke for the very first time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sun!”</p><p><br></p><p>“No father. I would be dead if that person hadn’t saved my life back then. To kill him….would be a shame for all Seto Mermaids.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha….I see. So you have chosen that path.” His grandpa laughed, making him confused again.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. She will not do anything like that. We will just find and take care of that brat who wants to steal my daughter from me….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Father!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, be quiet you two.” The woman shouted, making both of them quiet and then bowed towards his grandpa. “It’s a matter of our daughter’s life. Please, allow us to search for the boy here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see, I see. Sure, why not. You can stay here. I will tell someone to clean some rooms….” Before his grandpa could speak more, the door to the room opened and Rikuo saw it was Kejoro on the other side of the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Supreme Commander, you have a guest.” She said nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s….Shadow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow! Why is he here?” He asked, surprised on hearing the name after such a long time. They had searched for him after that incident with the Shikoku Youkai but there had never been any sightings or news of him throughout the territory.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….it’s been one year already. Hmm, did he bring something for me?” His grandpa asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Kejoro nodded and put several paper bags in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo opened them to check. “Kofuku Manju?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, how many are there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….eight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. That brat remembered.” With that said, his grandpa got up. “Kejoro, clean some rooms for the Seto family. They will be staying with us for a while. I apologise, Gozaburo, but I have an appointment to keep so I will have to leave for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Appointment, Grandpa?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I promised to spar with that brat in a year if he brought me Kofuku Manju and now he is back.” His grandpa said as he walked out of the room with the paper bag, slowly biting the Kofuku Manju. “Oh, he got them from Hina-chan’s shop. The kid’s got taste.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly followed his grandpa outside to the front gates of the Nura Clan where several youkai were standing around one guy.</p><p><br></p><p>The same black hooded coat and sword on his side, there he stood, without any care….Shadow.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sun Seto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They followed Nurarihyon outside along with his grandson to look at what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind her were her parents.</p><p><br></p><p>On coming out, they saw the scene of several youkai surrounding a person in black hooded cloak while the Supreme Commander of the Youkai were walking towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is he?” She asked curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who answered was a young Yuki-onna. “He is Shadow, the one who lives in the shadows to hunt the shadows.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is a human.” Her father clarified. “What is a human doing here?”</p><p><br></p><p>Before they could answer his father, Nurarihyon-sama greeted the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“How are you, brat? You completely disappeared for the whole year. I thought something happened to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am here to keep the promise.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh….do you really think you have any chance?” Nurari-sama asked with a smile as he took a bite of his kofuku manju.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t know if I don’t try.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, alright. Come on. I don’t want my mansion to be destroyed. There is a nice empty spot nearby, although a bit far from here. Do you think you can keep up?”</p><p><br>“Wait, destroyed? What are they talking about?” She asked, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>“That old Nurari made a promise to the boy to answer his questions if he defeated Nurari in a fight. In return, he would have to pay in Kofuku Manju….<em>sigh</em>, that old man is playing around even at this age?” A voice came from behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked back to see the speaker only to see a cat.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of them, her parents and she jumped away in fright.</p><p><br></p><p>The cat then transformed into a woman with cat ears and seven tails behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Magari-sama.” The rest of the youkai bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“M-m-magari-sama. Nice to meet you.” Her mother spoke with hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>All Mermaid Youkai are instinctively afraid of Cats and this youkai in front of them….was one of the strongest ones among all the cat type youkai in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Magari, the Vice Commander of the Nura Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ren. You guys are still afraid of me….sigh. This is why I was keeping a distance. What I didn’t expect was this brat to show up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, you mean Nurari-sama is going to fight with Shadow?” Their talks were interrupted by the Yuki-onna.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and looked at the two.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy just nodded but before they could go anywhere, Rikuo-sama stopped them.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood in front of the guy. He was however completely different than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this his youkai form?</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard that the grandson of Nurarihyon was only a quarter youkai and could only transform into his youkai form for a quarter of the day.</p><p><br></p><p>“Speaking of promises….I remember I had promised to fight you when the battle with the Shikoku youkai was over. You disappeared after that and I couldn’t fulfil the promise. What do you say, before fighting with grandpa, how about a little spar with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was silence in the whole place as they looked at the two.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in question took a look at Nurarihyon who just shrugged so he looked at Rikuo-sama and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them stood in the middle of the ground while the other youkai took distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why is everyone so tense? Is that human really strong?” Her father asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The yuki-onna who had been talking till now, now had her eyes glued to the two but still nodded and answered them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow is strong….very strong. He was able to fight with the seven Phantom Travellers of the Shikoku Youkai and even killed some of them by himself. Later on, the Supreme Commander told us that he could have very likely taken their entire group down if he wasn’t worried about causing too much destruction in the surrounding areas. This was him a year ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at the two fighters in astonishment.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….haven’t changed much since the last fight.” The boy….Shadow, spoke first.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I would say the same but I can’t see you for.” Rikuo-sama smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy shook his head. “I mean your <a href=\"https://strength….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strength….it</a> hasn’t changed much since the last time I saw you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh, are you saying I am weak? Don’t worry, I won’t disappoint you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy just looked down as if sighing and then gripped his sword and spoke. “Let’s get this done with.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon-sama was the one who gave the signal for the fight to start.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was then it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo-sama froze, his eyes wide.</p><p><br></p><p>The other boy just walked forward and came to Nurarihyon-sama. “Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon-sama looked at his grandson, frozen there like that and sighed while shaking his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rikuo still has a lot to learn. Magari, keep the kids here. Don’t let anyone follow.” With that said, they left the place quickly while everyone was still confused about what happened.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only after a moment that they snapped out of their confusion and the youkai of the place, all ran towards Rikuo-sama, the Yuki-onna being the first one.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on Magari-sama? What happened to Rikuo-sama?</p><p><br></p><p>The cat youkai just went forward and slapped Rikuo-sama and he snapped out of his frozen state and looked around confused. “What happened? Where is Shadow?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He left with your grandfather.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo-sama seemed to have realised what happened and gripped his sword tighter, looking down.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long was I out?”</p><p><br></p><p>“From the moment Nurari gave the signal. I had heard about his prowess in illusions but this was something else entirely. I haven’t seen that kind of talent in someone that age.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So….I couldn’t even make one move against him?”</p><p><br>“Well, he wasn’t lying when he said you haven’t changed much in the last year. Maybe use this as a wake up call and start training?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did they go?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Away from here. Their fight would have destroyed the whole area.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he really that strong?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That boy? Yes, from just what I could feel, he seemed stronger than most High Class beings. I don’t know what tricks he has so I can’t say anything about his full strength but if he keeps whatever training he is doing, he would reach the Ultimate Class level in a year at best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ultimate Class….I see.” WIth that said, he didn’t speak anything and just looked down at his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, no moping around. We have guests living with us. Go and show Miss Sun around. She is around your age and will be joining your school. She doesn’t have any friends here. Don’t let her feel left out.” Magari-sama said, making him nod.”</p><p><br></p><p>They led her with them while her parents followed the older youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, the Yuki-onna, Tsurara as she introduced herself, introduced her to the others till they were finally in one of the rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, I couldn’t ask you back then but….what exactly were you talking about? What path was grandpa talking about?” Rikuo-sama asked her, catching her off guard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh!” As she realised the question, a blush appeared on her face. “That….when another human sees our tail, we have to kill them. This was the rule set by Ryujin-sama. This rule however has an alternative. Ryujin-sama is also worshipped by humans and while he understands the reason for keeping them separate, he doesn’t forbid us from associating with each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly is this alternative?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We….we….need to ma-marry the human.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” Tsurara shouted excitedly. “But that’s….what if he is an old man or a creep or someone bad….that would be….”</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s not!” She retorted almost instinctively, surprising not only the yuki-onna but also herself. She then went on to explain to them. “It’s the only way for both of us to live.” The person saved me from dying that day. He could have let go of me when he saw my tail….but he didn’t. He promised me that he would save my life….and he did. Never once did he look badly at me because of me being a mermaid. He even carried me to the sea.”</p><p><br></p><p>They became quiet as they looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, sounds like someone has a crush.” The woman called Kejoro smiled with a hand on her cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>“I…I….it’s….”</p><p><br></p><p>“How does the boy look?” Rikuo-sama asked, making her look at him. “You came here to find him so you must have some kind of picture of him, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….we don’t. I didn’t give the exact details to my father because he was planning to go behind my back and kill him. I….intend to find the boy myself and talk to him. Until then, I want to join a human school and learn more about them.” She said in a determined voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. That is something we can support too.” Rikuo-sama said as he reverted back to his normal human form. “Till then, you can live with us and be friends with everyone. If you need something from us, please don’t hesitate to speak to us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” She bowed lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, Rikuo-sama, we need to go to sleep early. Tatsuya-kun will be coming tomorrow morning and we are going for a picnic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I completely forgot about it in all this rush. Actually, Miss Sun, since you will be joining our school, how about you join us? I can introduce you to my friends. You just need to be careful about not revealing your identity there and everything will be fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Are you sure? I wouldn’t want to impose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not be imposing. Anyways, our picnics are always fun. Although Kiyotsugu, that guy is an idiot sometimes, the rest are good. Tatsuya-kun is smart, actually he was the smartest in all our year.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, he changed schools due to some problems at home but visits us often. His grandma passed away a while ago and so we decided to have a picnic to cheer him up this time.” Tsurara said. “Wait, let me show you the images from the last time we went to the zoo.” With that she ran away and looked in the closet of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun noticed that this was Rikuo-sama’s room and yet Tsurara was checking the closets.</p><p><br></p><p>They were very close.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was searching, they talked about various things and soon, Tsurara was back with the album.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here, this is from the year end ceremony at the school last year.” She opened the album. “This is Rikuo-sama. He looked so handsome, didn’t he? This is our school, this was our homeroom teacher….” Tsurara explained as she showed her pictures.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly Sun saw a picture which made her freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“And this….Sun? Miss Sun.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes were still stuck on the picture in the album which she pointed at with a shaking finger. “W-w-who is this person?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, he is Tatsuya-kun. He is our friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm what happened, Miss Sun? Is everything alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo-sama asked and she looked at him with stunned eyes. “He….he’s the guy who saved me.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“You said it was close. This place is two hours away.” I said looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>This place had mountains all around and I couldn’t sense any people around.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously, I couldn’t have you fight anywhere near the town area. What, scared?” The old man joked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. Just worried about having to carry you back to the Nura Clan if you sprain a leg or something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, feisty. Let’s see if it’s all just words.” The old man said as he drew his sword.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, I didn’t wait and immediately kicked the ground, drawing and slashing with my own sword, making him parry.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to give him the time to use his Fear on me.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was obviously taken aback by my strength and slid behind several steps before he could stop my blade. He pushed back and I continued my assault with another strike, trying to not give him time to breathe.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next fifteen minutes, we clashed our blades and I saw that he was getting serious bit by bit and I was on the backfoot once more.</p><p><br></p><p>His strength was still remarkable despite his old age but it was his swordsmanship and technique which was the real problem for me.</p><p><br></p><p>He was parrying my blows without expending as much power while dancing around to dodge my moves and while his attacks didn’t carry as much power as mine, they were all done with pinpoint accuracy, making me dodge or leave an attack in the middle and parry his attack.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a massive difference in both our skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally after fifteen minutes, he deflected my blade to the side and stepped forward, making a slash which made me jump back and land on the branch of a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>“My my, you have certainly grown a lot in the last year. Just what kind of training have you been doing, brat?” He asked as he looked around the area.</p><p><br></p><p>I kept one eye on him while looking at the surroundings too.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire forest on the mountain was razed to the ground due to our clashes. There were gigantic crevices in the ground at several places.</p><p><br></p><p>With that, he looked up at me and smiled. “Now, let’s get a bit serious, shall we?</p><p><br></p><p>I used my Observation Haki at full power at this instant, my Sharingan flaring not missing his figure for a single instant to not lose him.</p><p><br></p><p>He just slashed the ground under him as a cloud of dust covered him and in that instant, I felt the change.</p><p><br></p><p>A wave of energy surrounded him, overwhelming my Observation Haki and spreading all over the area as if an explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>When the explosion subsided, he was gone but I could still feel….this energy all over the place.</p><p><br></p><p>It was spiritual in nature, kinda similar to how Shanks used his Conqueror’s Haki to block Observation Haki usage.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a chill down my spine at this instant and dodged almost from the instinct of several fights I had been fighting for the last year, preparing for this day.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking quickly on my feet, I made a handsign and created several shadow clones, dividing the attention of the opponent while I tried to create traps for him.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t work much as they were only delaying him for several seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike Tobirama, Nurarihyon was a monster….quite literally.</p><p><br></p><p>Since running was not an option, I decided to go all out, Pirate Style.</p><p><br></p><p>With a shout, my Conqueror’s Haki burst out and to my surprise, the wave blew away the fear of Nurarihyon for an instant, making his Meikyo Suigetsu fade away for a moment and giving me back my sight of him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was midair in a jump towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked surprised too as he looked at himself and then at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t let this opportunity slip and raced towards him, first using a genjutsu to take advantage of his shaken mood and second, using an Armament empowered strike on him with my full power.</p><p><br></p><p>The strike sent him crashing to the mountain side, sending cracks around the crash site.</p><p><br></p><p>With another hand sign, several clones appeared and sent all their chakra in five elemental jutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>This was Hiruzen Sarutobi’s speciality, the five elemental combo which he could do due to his mastery in all different styles of Nature Transformation and while my skill in Nature Transformation was not even close to that of the third Hokage, I had all the affinities due to my bloodlines.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a massive explosion in the place where Nurarihyon had crashed and I kept my Observation Haki on him till the last moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was glad that I did or else I would have missed it completely.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man moved at an incredible speed, incomparable to anything he had done before and the same energy from before, his fear, coated his blade as he slashed, tearing away the explosion and straight towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>I dodged to the side while sending another attack towards him which was blocked by the man coming out of the explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon had his kimono burned and a bit of his skin had burn marks but he was mostly fine.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was too dangerous, brat.” He said with a serious face.</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet you are undefeated. Tell me, if I were to go easier, would I ever be able to defeat you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. No you wouldn’t. Very well then, go all out. I want to see how strong you are.” he said, taking a stance with his sword for the first time as I felt his aura get flaring but this time instead of making him disappear, it wrapped around him like a blanket.</p><p><br></p><p>He made the first move and slashed down with his sword.</p><p><br></p><p>I dashed forward and tried to parry the strike with my own blade but was surprised when I was kicked in the stomach instead and was sent flying with a slash sent after me.</p><p><br></p><p>I gritted my teeth and flared my own Conqueror’s Haki as well as pushed my Observation Haki to the max but found that he had disappeared again. Although I didn’t have the time to worry about it as his slash was still coming towards me. I parried the slash with my own but was still sent rolling backwards where I suddenly felt a cold blade on my neck.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shin Kyoka Suigetsu. It can shift the Opponent’s awareness and cut their fear. Your own technique is quite similar to our own fear, overwhelming one’s mind although it is more of the Spiritual Nature, much like the spells used by the Onmyoji. Then again, that’s understandable knowing your background.” He said as he sheath his sword. </p><p><br></p><p>“....what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on boy. Do you think I, Nurarihyon, the Youkai who specialises in illusions couldn’t see through your illusions. Although this illusion of yours is quite unique, do you think it is enough to fool me? I couldn’t identify you the first time I met you on that rooftop against Muchi because I guess that wasn’t you and instead one of those clones you used during the fight but your aura was unmistakable when you were present in the fight against the Shikoku Youkai. That was the real you, wasn’t it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man with an open mouth while he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“After that I did some digging around and found out about your background. You were living with that woman, Ageha Ikuse and were getting visited by the exiled Shuri Himejima. On digging further, and putting your hatred for the Cult of Hagoromo Gitsune into account, it was easier to pinpoint your true identity, an exile of the Kushihashi Clan, the son of that Lightning Fist brat. If you want to keep your identity hidden, you should learn Senjutsu or anyone with a decent practice of Senjutsu would be able to identify you as long as they see your real form.”</p><p><br></p><p>I forced myself to break away from my trance and quickly concentrate on the thing he had said. “Senjutsu?”</p><p><br></p><p>I remember Grandma telling me about the Senjutsu of this world but she didn’t know much about it so she couldn’t elaborate further on the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Youkai are beings born of the world so they are closely connected to this world. This makes them innately compatible with the energy of the world and thus Senjutsu. Senjutsu is the art of using nature's energy for yourself. It not only allows you to fight at a much higher level but also see through the auras of other people. If you truly wish to keep your identity hidden, you’d sooner learn Senjutsu as there are very few methods of hiding from any Senjutsu user. Being one yourself is the easiest of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said as he sat down beside me and put a hand over his burned arm. The burn wound on his arm healed.</p><p><br></p><p>“That attack was quite vicious, you know? This is one of my favourite kimonos.” He said, a bit annoyed. “Still, I guess I might be getting too old if a kid barely out of his diapers could do this much harm to me. Sigh….now if only Rikuo took his work seriously and trained harder, I could retire with peace.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man who didn’t look anything like the guy who had just handed me my ass on a silver platter.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked just like a normal old man complaining about his grandson.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of something and brought out some of the Kofuku Manju from my inventory and handed it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you had more. Good. At least you know how to apologise.” He said, taking the sweet and eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why haven’t you told Rikuo?” I asked after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Why would I? It’s none of my business.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....” I looked blankly at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“You two are friends. Do whatever you want between yourself. Anyways, that brat needs to get his ass on line. Maybe the loss against you today will make him think carefully. The Nura Clan is not something one can rule over by half-assing things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So….why are you hiding your identity?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the ground below me as I remembered my life until now and let out a sigh. “I don’t have many people close to me and I don’t want people to target anyone close to me. Me revealing myself would make sure that they do so.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. That’s true. Is this about your father?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t answer but sometimes silence can be the best answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“You do know that your father, as a part of the Five Principal Clans, has killed many youkai too. If you think about it, you are trying to do the same thing they did.”</p><p><br></p><p>My neck snapped in his direction and I was pretty sure I was glaring daggers at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>He however seemed unphased by my glare.</p><p><br></p><p>“Humans kill youkai, youkai kill humans. They go after each other for revenge and the cycle of hatred continues.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you telling me to let the people who killed my father go?” I asked, my voice cold.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh….that’s not my place to tell you. I am just stating what I have seen in all these years. Do you think I am lying? If this were some innocent youkai killed by your father, would you care for them?” He stared back at me with calm eyes and I was the one who averted my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You wouldn’t be talking like this if you had lost someone close to you.” I spat in my anger. I knew it was in anger and completely dickish of me but I didn’t want someone to saying anything bad about my father.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? Who says I haven’t lost anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man, surprised at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“My son, Rikuo’s father….was killed by other youkai too.”</p><p><br></p><p>My mouth opened in surprise but I couldn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s a risk you carry when you take such a position. You cannot step on the battlefield and expect only to kill others without being killed by others. My son knew this….And so did your father….and trust me, if he was as caring as you think of him, he would absolutely not want you to risk your life to go after such people.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the sky, at the moon as the scenes of the past appeared in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“The only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed.” </p><p><br></p><p>The old man nodded and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hagoromo Gitsune was someone who actually loved human beings.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was surprised by the sudden change of topic but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“She was married to a human and even had a son with him. In fact, I think you might have heard the name of her son. His name was….Abe no Seimei.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” I blurted out, stunned at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>Abe no Seimei, was the foremost onmyoji of Japan, who devised many of the methods of exorcism used by the onmyoji of Japan other than the Five Principal Clans. He was a legend who gave humans a method to protect themselves against the youkai. And now this guy is telling me that the guy was half youkai himself and not just any but a Nine Tailed Fox Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>“Surprising isn’t it? You see, Hagoromo Gitsune originally wanted a world where humans and youkai could coexist peacefully.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a good but foolish dream.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you don’t think that’s possible?”</p><p><br></p><p>“While I would love to see such a world too, it’s not realistically possible unless someone extremely powerful forces them to coexist peacefully. I mean just look at the history of human beings. Even without the awareness of other races, they fight wars with each other, for their greed and biases. They discriminate with each other based on their colour, religion and even languages, so much so that they would throw away their own blood because one of their parents is of a different country or religion? Do you really think such people would just put aside their biases and get along happily with beings who are far stronger than them? If you do then you must be the biggest fool in the world. I know there are good humans in the world too but expecting so much from them is foolishness.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was taken aback by the bite in my words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Humans always fear what they cannot understand and their first reaction against such things….is violence. I don’t know much about youkai to say anything about them but you cannot clap with one hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well well, looks like Rikuo needs to catch up to you in more than just strength. What you said is true. That is one of the reasons for the secrecy of the Supernatural World from common humans. Anyways, Hagoromo Gitsune’s wishes were appreciated by her son who started working in the court of the emperor to try to slowly make the people more accepting of the Youkai. All that was until she was killed by a court noble of the emperor’s court.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That fool had heard that the liver of a Shinoda fox could grant eternal youth and had sent his armies to hunt her. They brought her body to an onmyoji to prepare the elixir and guess who the guy was?” He suddenly looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes went wide in realisation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, they brought her body….to her own son. It’s safe to say that Seimei went berserk and slaughtered all the court members and left with his mother’s body. From then on, he came to be known as Nue.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But if they both died, then….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes, you don’t know much about her. You see, while Hagoromo Gitsune did die, she could reincarnate at times and possess the bodies of other people. The thing is, Abe no Seimei had devised a method of perfect reincarnation and to do so, he needed to be reborn from the same womb which had given him birth once. Hagoromo Gitsune had obviously agreed to this request of her son. Eight hundred years ago, she reincarnated as a female samurai you might have heard or. She was called Tomoe Gozen.”</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….another big name.</p><p><br></p><p>“Four hundred years ago, she had reincarnated in the courtesan Lady Yodo, she was the mother of Hideyori Toyotomi and the master of Osaka Castle. At the time Hagoromo Gitsune frequently met with her yōkai underlings in secret late at night, where she would ingest the livers they had collected for her - all for the sake of giving birth to the Nue. However the livers of average people were not good enough for the task so she switched to the hearts of people who had unusual abilities like a princess whose tears became pearls, etc. One such princess was Yoihime….my wife.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah….I fought against Hagoromo Gitsune because she was targeting the woman I had fallen in love with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your wife was a human?” I  was surprised again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah, how else would Rikuo be a quarter youkai?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….didn’t know what percentage youkai he was, just that he was part youkai.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You need to learn Senjutsu soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“.....hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I was lucky in that fight as I was assisted by Hidemoto Keikain, the ancestor of your former classmate on that day and even then, I lost my heart, leaving me permanently weakened and in this degrading self from then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your heart?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, quite literally. She ripped it out. Youkai bodies work differently than normal human bodies. If you want to kill one, make sure they are burned completely and even ashes are scattered.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was weakened from that fight so….this was his weakened self and Hagoromo Gitsune and possibly Nue is stronger than him.</p><p><br></p><p>No….I will not let that discourage me.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you see, the fight you are entering is something that has continued for over a thousand years and believe it or <a href=\"https://not….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not….it</a> was not her who did it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you telling me all this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“So that whatever decision you make, you do so with full knowledge. You have a chance, a rare chance to get out of all this mess and start anew. Do you want to risk it all for revenge?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….take your time but think about all this before you enter the fray. I understand the pain of losing someone close to yourself but don’t let it become the sole guiding force in your life. That kind of life….is not pleasant. As for Senjutsu, I could guide you for a bit until you are competent enough to hide your aura. I am not exactly a master of the art myself to teach you much further.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....why are you doing all this for me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? You are Rikuo’s friend, aren’t you? And you will have to pay me with Kofuko Manju. I am not teaching you anything for free. Actually, you know what?...I have another plan in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What plan?” I asked, cautiously.</p><p><br></p><p>He told me his plan and by the end of it, I was looking at him incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure that will work?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s worth a try. Just do it for me, please.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded unsurely.</p><p><br></p><p>“....Thank you for everything, Nurarihyon.”</p><p><br></p><p>We just sat there without any words as I thought about what he had said then.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma had also said something similar.</p><p><br></p><p>To let go.</p><p><br></p><p>But….every time I tried thinking of it, the scene of my father's body appeared in front of my eyes and all that thought went to hell.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Nurarihyon -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He returned back to his Clan early the next morning after guiding the boy with the basics of Senjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>While that was nowhere near enough to learn Senjutsu, it wasn’t someone one learned in a day, who knew with that kid.</p><p><br></p><p>His arm still stung from last night’s attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how the hell did that kid train all this time?</p><p><br></p><p>If anyone heard that the infamous Supreme Commander of the Nura Clan got injured by a fourteen year old, he would become a joke for the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, he needs to kick Rikuo’s ass to get him to train.</p><p><br></p><p>As he reached the gates of his clan, several youkai rushed forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Supreme Commander, are you okay? Did that man attack you? Why is your kimono burnt?” Karasu Tengu was the one in the lead as usual.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, this…. is nothing. I was doing a barbeque and didn’t watch out.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>They all stared at him and soon Rikuo also came running out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa….wait, are you hurt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No….this is nothing. Let’s go inside and talk. I am tired.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting in his room, his daughter-in-law brought him a cup of tea while Rikuo and the rest of his group sat in front of them. Surprisingly, the mermaid was also with them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Wakana. Now, you all seem to have something to talk to me about.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….that Shadow….was he strong?” Rikuo asked after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Didn’t you get beaten by him? What does that tell you?” He asked, making their faces blanche.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-b-but Rikuo-sama would have won if he hadn’t used that trick.” Tsurara tried to complain but one look from him shut her up.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“No….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“No….no</a> he wouldn’t.” He shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Supreme Commander?”</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all, he was using illusions, my speciality….against my descendant and won.” His words made them wither. “Second, no enemy would tell you and attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If Shadow had truly attacked, none of you would have stood a chance against him. He could have taken you all on at the same time….and won. The illusion….was probably the most harmless of his means which he used against Rikuo. Give him a year or two and he might just reach my level.” He said, before taking a sip from his cup.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, what did you all want to talk about?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo snapped out of his thoughts first. “I….well, the boy Miss Sun is searching for….it’s my friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your friend?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Tatsuya. The white haired guy whom you met before. He is one of my closest friends. Her father wants to kill him. Grandpa, what should we do?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>It was only the years of experience that helped prevent him from bursting out into a fit of laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, this was going to be fun.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Drawn to Power’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, a few things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tatsuya met another Manga Company owner.

The tusks were currently red from the heat. It looked like a pig demon from hell. It was the boss of this area whom we had been planning to hunt for the last few days.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a long standing quest for hunting any bosses in the area.</p><p><br></p><p>From what we learned, the boss of an area always respawns after a certain period of time. For example the boar which I had hunted for my Hunter Advancement Quest or the wolf which Veena and I had hunted while on our way to Llyne had both respawned after fifteen days.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t know if other monster bosses also respawned at the same time or if they are different but we intended to find out and hunt them on the day they respawned.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, according to Shiroe, some big guilds in his previous game monopolised the boss areas by not letting anyone go there to keep control on the drops from them. This helped their guilds to grow at a fast speed as well as gave them a monopoly on the items obtained from it.</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked him if he wanted to do that but he had denied it as that would just push the non guild members against us. What we intended to do was wipe out all the bosses around Llyne until any other team was capable of fighting a T5 Monster.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time they get there, we would be well set to go off to other areas with stronger monsters already.</p><p><br></p><p>Star was not far behind as two arrows quickly shot, one piercing through its eyes and the other on its leg, making it limp weakly.</p><p><br></p><p>I couched slightly and jumped for the overhead strike, using Heavy Strike.</p><p><br></p><p>The ground beneath its feet within two metres radius cracked with my strike as the boar crumbled on its knees. I didn’t stop the attack and used Double Strike and Swift Strike back to back to inflict more damage on it as quickly as I could before backing away.</p><p><br></p><p>The beast was strong, perhaps the strongest we had fought after the Goblin Chieftain although that monster was half dead due to the previous attacks and also poisoned.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I was a few metres away from it, a huge fireball crashed on the boar. The beast let out a loud shriek which disoriented me a little.</p><p><br></p><p>Dizzy Status.</p><p><br></p><p>Reduced accuracy by 60% and speed by 40% for the skill duration.</p><p><br></p><p>To cover for me, an Earth Wall appeared before me while I stepped back slightly to clear my head.</p><p><br></p><p>The status effect lasted twelve seconds and in that time, Shiroe and Star kept the beast contained. I could have used the Reversed Cursed Technique to get rid of it but decided not to as it would be better to save it for when my health was low and other emergencies.</p><p><br></p><p>My head cleared at the same time as the Earth Wall before me was crushed by the beast and I raised my shield and braced up for the crash.</p><p><br></p><p>The wall had slowed the monster to a certain extent and I was able to push it back and used another Skill, Focused Strike.</p><p><br></p><p>The strike targeted it directly on its eyes and the beast howled.</p><p><br></p><p>Star took this opportunity to send in a barrage of arrows at it again.</p><p><br></p><p>We slowly chipped away at its health over the next fifteen minutes before that beast finally fell.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn….are T5 Monsters really this strong?” Star asked as he looked at the drops in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a T5 Boss. Obviously it will be strong. A normal T5 Monster would have been done in 2 minutes at best.” Shiroe said as he checked the drops while we checked the notifications.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a level up, I noticed as I checked the other notifications.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, it’s congratulating us for the first kill of the boss. Do you think we would get first kill bonuses for every boss we kill?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“First kill?” I scrolled the notifications and indeed, it said first kill. “I didn’t get these when hunting those bosses for my hunter exams. Is this a new feature?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Has to be. Check out the loot.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>We went ahead and did.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Skill Book, yes. Flame Charge. Guess this will be for Arty too.” Shiroe said as he tossed the book at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the Skill and shook my head. “It’s good but I have enough skills for now. Let’s keep this for our other frontliners.” I really had a whole slew of skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need more as I wanted to concentrate on my current skills and level them up first.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the guys shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, you’re currently our only frontliner so it’s your decision.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and we soon collected everything we could and started heading back to town.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, that debuff was unexpected. It was even an area debuff and could have been troublesome for us. We really need to get our hands on that healer.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Veena said she would talk to Elaine. We can see if she wants to be our healer or not.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, she did? That’s good then. We would be able to act far better with a healer and supporter around.” Shiroe said thoughtfully.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how is your new equipment working, Star?” I asked. “Is it up to your expectations?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah….that old man can really make good stuff. This set feels far less restrictive than my old one and yet has better stats. Thanks for the raw materials though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t sweat it. You are part of the team now. You being strong will only help us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, today’s drops were good. We can probably earn a hefty sum if we sell the horn and the tusks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It dropped three tusks and one horn. I wasn’t expecting that many.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We even got one hundred and twenty thousand exp in total. That’s busted. I gained two levels in my Ranger Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was probably because of the first kill bonus.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we should totally clear out all the bosses in the area and get their first kill bonuses.” Star said. “This shit is great for quickly levelling up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Next time perhaps we should include Veena or she would be left behind too much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. She has been working too hard these days to gather funds.” Shiroe also nodded. “Alright, I will ask around and plan about the other bosses. We can try hunting two or three more before going for our next expedition.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’d be for the best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, we should get some furniture for the Guild. I am tired of sleeping in a sleeping bag even inside the guild room.” Star said. “I miss sleeping on a proper bed, dammit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were actually planning to buy another building as the guild hostels and rent them out to Guild members before this entire Sabaody thing came up. That was the reason we didn’t buy any beds for the Guild rooms. But sure, we should get one for each of you.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am fine. I got a tailor to make me something like a Japanese futon which I am used to sleeping in. I don’t need a bed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As you wish….although I feel most comfortable when sleeping on a bed.” Star shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, a bed is more comfortable for me too.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“See! That’s what I am talking about. By the way Arty….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the deal between you and Veena?” Star suddenly threw the bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? What do you mean by ‘deal’?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Relation. I mean are you two an item?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe, although didn’t speak anything, looked at me with a curious look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, we don’t have anything like that going on between us.” I denied.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t lying. There really wasn’t anything serious going on between <a href=\"https://us….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">us….at</a> least by devil terms.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way I was going to tell them that I was sleeping with her every night.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! I was pretty sure you two were a couple or something. You always have this….chemistry between the both of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” I asked, surprised at the sudden revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if I am being honest, I thought that too. She did call you her partner the first time we met.” Shiroe shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“And your face when that Dwain guy insulted <a href=\"https://her….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">her….it</a> was scary.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah….Dwain….that idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, we are good friends. Very good friends. We have been through some serious shit together and we have been together since then but….we don’t have anything like that between us. Moreover, isn’t it common sense to get angry when your friend is insulted?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….can’t argue with that. After all, I was annoyed at that bastard too.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about some other things as we travelled.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching Llyne, both Star and Shiroe went ahead to buy a bed for Star while I went back towards my home’s direction.</p><p><br></p><p>What came next was not something I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“You two….entered the game to go after her?” She asked, stunned at the reveal but the girl was already too intoxicated and fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>“Elaine, Elaine!” She tried waking up the girl but to no avail. She was already in deep sleep by now.</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh and picked up the girl and carried her to Arthas’ room and let her sleep there.</p><p><br></p><p>The bed was pretty unused as Arthas slept with her in her room so it wouldn’t be a problem to let her sleep here.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, she couldn’t let the drunk and unconscious girl sleep in the living room.</p><p><br></p><p>She returned to the living room and her mind tried to process the information.</p><p><br></p><p>She said that they had entered the game to go after her….which meant they entered the game later than the rest. So there was a high chance that she might know what was going on in the outside world, especially the supernatural side of things.</p><p><br></p><p>There were many things she wanted to ask her.</p><p><br></p><p>How much time had passed?</p><p><br>Who were the people involved in this whole mess?</p><p><br></p><p>What were the people outside doing and why couldn’t they bring out the people from this game?</p><p><br></p><p>Because she was sure that if there was a way, they would have tried it rather than entering the game to rescue her lover’s little sister.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the door of the room once more and then shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that she heard a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>A look from the window told her who it was outside the door.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened the door to see Arthas.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at her for a moment and opened his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened? You look worried.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“They entered the game later? There are still players entering the game?” I asked, absolutely stunned at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>The information was quite unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only Veena’s guess about Elaine turned out to be true and she was a magician, she was no ordinary magician either but rather someone quite famous.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were here to save someone.” She clarified.  </p><p><br></p><p>“Save whom?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her lover’s sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And she’s here alone?”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena shook her head. “Both her lover and she entered the game to save his little sister, someone she took care of as their maid. Although, now that I think of it, she said ‘we’ so maybe someone else might have accompanied them too, I am not sure. We will have to ask her when she wakes up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know anything about them? I mean their identities?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her lover is the heir or rather former heir of the Pendragon family, Arthur Pendragon and his sister is Le Fay Pendragon, someone who entered the game on the first day.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br>Arthur Pendragon….wasn’t he the member of the Khaos Brigade?</p><p><br></p><p>His sister was inside this game?</p><p><br></p><p>Did this mean that the rest of the Vali Team were here too….and that’s if they were the members of the Vali Team in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>….damn, this world is messed up, isn’t it?</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and spoke. “Well, there is nothing we can do worrying about it right now. We just need to wait for her to get up tomorrow. We can hear her story then. Who knows, she might be speaking something odd due to being intoxicated. You did say she was blabbering, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Yes. It’s just that….her words caught me off guard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I know how worried you are about the outside world. Trying to find some hope at this time is not something unexpected.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, such wise words.” She smiled again….and she was back.</p><p><br></p><p>I returned her smile. “Alright, I will get cleaned too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will serve your dinner.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had her dinner earlier with Elaine and had bought food from the inn today.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine was sleeping in my room….not that I was using that bed nowadays so we went to Veena’s room as usual.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how was your day? Did the hunt go well? You guys were planning on raiding an area boss, right?” She asked as she sat on a chair and stretched herself. She must be tired from all the work.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Yes. It went better than I was expecting. We took down the boar and found something interesting too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Turns out that from now on, we get the first kill bonus for the bosses.”</p><p><br></p><p>“First kill?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The first team to kill the boss in the game gets extra experience and maybe even greater drop rates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….that sounds reasonable. After all, other teams can face the enemy prepared after learning of your exploits. It reduces the danger for them considerably so you ought to be paid more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes….and that’s why we have decided to take care of all the bosses around Llyne and the nearby towns before anyone else. Other players are barely near our levels and it will be a while before they can come anywhere near the levels needed to hunt the bosses, especially the T5 ones. We can take all the first Kill Bonuses. We even got a Skill Book drop today, something which Shiroe thinks happened only because of the first kill bonus or the drop rates would have been abysmal. The experience gains were also great. You should join us next time or you might fall behind in levels.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I see. Alright, I will join you guys. When do you plan for the next hunt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shiroe is collecting information about the next boss while Star will scout the area. We will plan for the attack after that, so three days probably.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you need some poisons for the hunt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe, we need to wait for more information?”  I shrugged. </p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly remembering something, I smiled and told her about what Star and Shiroe thought about us.</p><p><br></p><p>The reaction was as I had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>She chuckled at the words. “Well, they weren’t that far off, are they?” She smirked, making my eyes widen slightly before she added. “After all, we do live in the same house and even sleep together every night.”</p><p><br></p><p>It took me only a fraction of second to realise that she was teasing me again and I rolled my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She then got up and yawned. “Hmm….I smell like mead. Ah, I was busy with all the information about Elaine and didn’t get the chance to take a bath. Let me take one now.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and laid down.</p><p><br></p><p>What I wasn’t expecting was her going to her cupboard and bringing out her towel before letting her gown fall without any warning.</p><p><br></p><p>My mouth opened slightly at the sight of her clad in only her underwear.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a black bra and panties. It was nothing fancy as we were in the mediaeval ages but that was not enough to hide her beauty</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, I stared longer than usual and when I looked up, I saw her with a victorious smirk on her face but this time I wasn’t able to roll my eyes and play it off.</p><p><br></p><p>Our eyes met and then she looked down to my crotch and I realised that I was sporting a massive hardon.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly adjusted my position and covered myself while she just smiled and then stretched one last time, making her underwear cling to her body and her curves twisting hypnotically with her movements. With that done, she slowly wrapped her towel around her body and sashayed out.</p><p><br></p><p>When she was gone I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding in.</p><p><br></p><p>She….wow.</p><p><br></p><p>I really had no words.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what did this woman want?</p><p><br></p><p>On one hand I was aroused and at the same time the knowledge of her true identity brought me out of my stupor.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what was this woman thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she coming onto me or….was this just another one of her games?</p><p><br></p><p>I could never tell with her.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the same woman who kept poison with her till only recently.</p><p><br></p><p>Again, remembering what I did about DxD, the devil race, especially the Gremory family had a very weird sense of privacy.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Rias had no problems with being naked….so it could probably be a normal thing for her?</p><p><br></p><p>She did say that Devils had a very different sense of privacy from humans.</p><p><br></p><p>The words of Star and Shiroe from this evening came to my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>No….I shouldn’t rush anything and spoil the current thing we have going on between us.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, there was Elaine in the house….</p><p><br></p><p>Ughh….I need to clear my head.</p><p><br></p><p>So I closed my eyes and took deep breaths and calmed myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened after some time and I opened my eyes to see Veena enter the room and close the door behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wrapped in the same towel but this time, unlike when she went out, she wasn’t wearing her underwear as I could see half her ass peeking out of the towel.</p><p><br></p><p>Her hair was still wet and I couldn’t pry my eyes off of her figure. She went to the cupboard and what happened next made me open my mouth wide in shock. She bent slightly as she picked up her clothes in the lower shelves as the towel went up, giving me an open view of her ass with the light hints of lower lips.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled out a new pair of underwear and straightened before putting on a pair of violet panties. She however didn’t stop to wear her bra or gown, instead she removed her towel and dried her hair and looked back, giving me a full view of her breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me….more than a few seconds to pry my gaze away from that scene and I looked up at her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“What, like what you saw?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem very surprised. I did tell you that devils have a very different sense of privacy. Now that you know about me, I can be more open about it. Although if you mind, I can hold back….I just take from your expression that you have no problems with this either?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….I….well, I….what?”</p><p><br></p><p>She chuckled. “Oh come on, I thought you said you asked me if I was available? Well I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>My mouth opened at her words as my mind raced back to yesterday’s conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>I had shrugged….just shrugged….did she take it as me propositioning her?</p><p><br></p><p>She realised that I was processing the information she had thrown on me so she gave me some time as she came to the bed and took her position, still half naked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, this feels much better. I could never get used to sleeping with clothes.” She said as she laid down.</p><p><br></p><p>….like mother, like daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this where Rias had gotten her habit of sleeping naked from?</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The sight in front of me was absolutely stunning to look at.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it must be the resistance I had developed to her antics over the months that I was able to collect my senses soon enough and after processing everything she had said, I looked at her and asked seriously to clear things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Oh yes. Sleeping with clothes always seems very restrictive, not to mention the marks they leave on your skin. Sleeping without any clothes feels far more free and unrestricted, especially after a bath.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I mean….serious about this….whole thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>She stared at me, directly into my eyes. “While devils do have a more open minded attitude towards nudity, I don’t show my skin to anyone I don’t approve of and like.”</p><p><br></p><p>I realised that my words could be interpreted in a different way and apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, I didn’t mean that. What I mean was….if you want a serious relationship?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, and what do you want?” She asked, casually.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want this….then yes, I would like a serious relationship. I….don’t know how devils do things but….I have lived my life with a certain set of values and I don’t think I would be comfortable with something like this so suddenly. I am sorry if that’s not what you have in mind.” I slowly put my thoughts into words.</p><p><br></p><p>While I didn’t have any problem with this relationship, I didn’t want it to be a casual fling. I guess I am just that sort of guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I can understand that. Yes, it would be too much to just give up what you are all of a sudden. I take it that you want our relationship to be exclusive as in me not having any other men in my life while we are together?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>This part was non negotiable.</p><p><br></p><p>She shrugged. “I don’t see why not. I have been in a relationship with my husband my entire life with no other men. I don’t see why this would be any different. Although you have to make one compromise for me too.” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Compromise?” I asked, a slight frown on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “While I will not take any other male lovers, you….have to take some other female lovers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?!” I was totally caught off guard at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“I told you earlier, didn’t I, that my husband had a harem of his own?” She asked and I nodded, not understanding where she was going with this. “Well, I was the one who managed it as the lady of the house. In my thousand years, I have experienced plenty of female lovers as well. If I cannot have male lovers, I can agree to that….but you have to compromise as well. Get some more female lovers. The choice of partners will be yours. I wouldn’t mind spending some time with them either….oh, looks like you agree as well.” She smirked looking down and I realised a moment later that she was looking at my crotch where I was sporting a rock hard erection.</p><p><br></p><p>And who could blame me?</p><p><br></p><p>This woman….this gorgeous woman, was half naked, only in her panties on my bed and was asking me to get more girls as lovers….</p><p><br></p><p>I could almost see the scenes of women surrounding me with Venelana between them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only the experiences of both my lives stopping me from jumping her right at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you serious?” I was barely able to utter those words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I know exactly what I am asking for. Don’t you think both sides have to compromise on something?”</p><p><br></p><p>How was this a compromise?</p><p><br></p><p>It was obviously a win-win scenario for me?</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Alright. I agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>She held my hand and pulled me to her. “Then come on, here. You look like you are in pain already.”</p><p><br></p><p>I fell on her breasts and felt the soft goodness on my face, only this time the feeling was far more pronounced as there were no clothes dampening the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, since things have come this far, it would be stupid of me to hold back now.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slipped downwards and wrapped around her waist. Her skin was cool due to the bath she had taken. I looked up.</p><p><br></p><p>No words were said but she leaned and I covered the rest of the distance and took her lips for mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Her lips were soft and with slight probing, they parted and I felt her tongue touch my lip. In the next instant, my own lips parted and met her tongue halfway as my hands came upwards and reached her breasts as I felt her soft mountains on my palm, giving it a soft squeeze. She moaned into my mouth and I left her hand travelling down from my thigh, reaching further down and grabbing my length from the top of my shorts, gently stroking it.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt jolts of pleasure as her hands moved slowly but with a firm grip on my length.</p><p><br></p><p>We broke the kiss and she looked down. “We should get this off. You look like you will suffocate if you wear this any longer. Lay down and let me help you out.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was not in a condition to deny it and lay on my back and relaxed as she crawled between my legs, her breasts laying on my thighs and her face directly over my erection. I could feel her warm breath on my length even with clothes on. She untied the string of my shorts and pulled them down.</p><p><br></p><p>My length sprang up, hitting her in the face, her eyes widening at the action. “Oh my!” She exclaimed before taking a look at me. “This is….bigger than I was expecting, especially the girth.” And then she rubbed her cheeks on it. “Hmm, the smell is nice too.” Finally done with it, she placed a kiss on my tip. </p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh.” I groaned in pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up and slowly tucked her hair behind her ear and kissed the tip again before giving it a small lick.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath at the stimulation.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it just my imagination or was I incredibly sensitive?</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I remembered, I was not this sensitive. Then again, it could be because this was my first sexual encounter in this life and….I haven’t had a release in months….</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts could go any further as a warm feeling enveloped my tip and let out a groan of pleasure and looked at Veena who was staring back at me, directly into my eyes as she slowly enveloped more of my length, all the while her tongue worked on my tip.</p><p><br></p><p>She bobbed her head slowly and increased her speed over time and I felt a rush of pleasure run down my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not like I had no experience….well, at least in my previous life. I have had a few girlfriends in my previous life and had been intimate with them too but this….Veena was far above any of them had been.</p><p><br></p><p>The centuries, perhaps millenia long experience was showing as she worked my shaft, her cheeks vacuuming as she pulled back with a popping sound.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my fist as the pain from my fingernails biting my skin helped me control myself from spilling all my seeds over her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She however wasn’t done yet as she kissed the tip once more before bringing out her tongue and giving my whole length a long lick, going down till she reached my balls. She took one of them into her mouth and sucked on it before leaving it and going to the other one and then alternated between them.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes, enjoying her ministrations. One of my hands inadvertently went to the back of her head and took a hold of her hair. Realising what I was doing, I quickly opened my eyes and looked at her and I saw her smirk.</p><p><br></p><p>She left my balls and took my tip into her mouth again and nodded at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood what she meant and my cock twitched in her mouth. I gripped her hair tighter and pushed her down on my length.</p><p><br></p><p>She went along and slowly I increased the force, pushing her more and more on my cock. It was as if she didn’t have any gag effects at all….or maybe she had trained herself not to gag anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Her drool covered my entire length and the scene of her usually calm and composed face, going down on my length and drooling on me, the sheer sense of domination and lust mixed with the intense pleasure was too much for me to hold back any longer as I finally erupted inside her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands pressed her head down on my length and she didn’t push back either, instead gripping my waist, pulling me further into her throat where I released rope after rope of semen till I collapsed back on our bed once more, breathing heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>I let go of her head and she too pulled back and gulped down everything, some semen dripping slowly from the corner of her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, you were really pent up, weren’t you?” She said as she wiped it with her finger and sucked on the finger before licking her lips while looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene was so erotic that it brought me back to life almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Or rather you are even now.” She completed as she eyed my hardening length.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sorry if I was too rough.” I managed to utter as I regained my senses after the climax.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing I can’t handle, dear. In fact, I enjoy it when my partner takes control more. You shouldn’t apologise. Be more confident. Trust me, women like more confident men.” She said as she stroked my length once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I held her hand. “Let me….do something for you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile bloomed on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why thank you. I won’t lie but I am quite excited myself. It’s been several years since I have had a man.” She said while kissing me in my neck and laying on the bed, her legs spread. I understood her meaning and got between her legs, her violet panties right before my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was her words which made me raise my eyebrows. “Several years? I thought your husband and you were together till recently.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh but we haven’t been intimate with each other for almost a decade. Previously it was to have another child to take on the heirship of the Gremory House after my eldest became the current Lucifer. After the birth of my daughter, eighteen, almost nineteen years ago, the times we had been intimate dwindled a lot as that responsibility was gone from our shoulders. He had his harem and as for me, I was searching for someone I could connect with rather than have a small fling. This would have obviously come after my daughter got married and we revealed the information about us parting ways to everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A decade?!” I exclaimed, making her giggle.</p><p><br></p><p>“A decade without a man….I did have some dalliances with the women of my husband’s harem. We are good friends and have been intimate with each other before so it wasn’t something new to anyone really.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well in that case, I can only give it my all and hope I do not disappoint you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I doubt that.” She encouraged me as she slid her panties to the side and traced her slit to show me her wetness. “I got this wet from just the kiss and sucking you off. I doubt I would last that long. Moreover, this body….seems more sensitive for some reason.” She said rubbing her slit a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>I gulped at the sight and slowly lowered myself between her legs as her musky smell assaulted my nose. Moving her hand, I got a closer look of her pussy.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a small, trimmed bush on top, below which pink lips of flesh opened like the petals of some flower. They were currently glistening with arousal and looked delectable, as if inviting me to eat her up.</p><p><br></p><p>And I did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>I dove directly into her, giving her a soft kiss on her pussy first and then started with a long lick of her slit.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Hhmmm</em>.” She moaned and I continued as her taste assaulted my tongue. Her hand came on top of my head as she caressed my hair, softly drawing circles on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>She tasted….delicious.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this game making this up or did she actually feel and taste like this?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t waste my time in thoughts and continued licking as my fingers searched and found her clit, hidden behind a hood of skin and pinched it slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahhhh!....yes.” Her fingers gripped my hair at the sudden stimulation, not enough to cause pain but fueling my lust even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I licked up to her clit and took it in my mouth and licked it before rolling it between my fingers. Her moans increased more as did her grip on my hair as she pushed me into her crotch more.</p><p><br></p><p>She was even wetter and my finger found her hole and pushed a finger inside.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hot and tight like entering, her slopping wetness being the only reason I was even able to push myself inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Her insides gripped my finger tightly and her folds caressed me as I pulled back my finger, as if refusing to let me go.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Hmm yes</em>, right there. Go on, don’t stop.”</p><p><br></p><p>I followed her instructions and worked my finger into her narrow canal and when it became easier to move, I added one more finger inside. Her moans grew louder.</p><p><br></p><p>I increased the speed of my hands and after just a minute or so, her grip on my hair tightened and she pushed me further into her pussy as a loud, throaty moan erupted from her. Her body arched and jolted as she came directly on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….she’s a squirter….I love it.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stop however and continued my fingering till she was completely done with her orgasm and then looked at her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a glassy look in her eyes, her mouth opened slightly and a look of intense satisfaction on her face. It took her a few moments to recover from her climax and when she did, she looked at me, coming forward and holding my cock and pulling me forward by it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t sit there in a daze. Come in, I don’t think I can hold back any longer. Give yourself to me.” She said as she rubbed my tip on her slit, her eyes closing as she relished in the pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her a peck on her lips before taking control of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>My cock was already wet again, covered in her own liquids and so, when I pushed in, I was able to enter her a bit. Her pussy tried to prevent my entry due to her tightness but neither of us wanted to back away and I pushed more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghhh….soo big….mmph.” She half cried, half moaned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” I asked, worried that she was getting hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t stop.” She almost growled, as her legs wrapped around me, trying to pull me in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, as you wish.” If that's what she wished, then I won’t hold back either.</p><p><br></p><p>I leaned in and took a hold of her waist and pushed in, harder, not stopping this time due to her cries. Her pussy was gripping me like a vice as I inched forward bit by bit before I was completely bottomed inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh….yesss~ I have missed this feeling for so long.” She moaned, her head leaning back as she relished in the feeling of me inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>I let her have her time and get used to my length before pulling back and shoving it in all at once, eliciting another loud moan from her.</p><p><br></p><p>Her hands gripped my hand which were holding her waist tightly, her nails piercing my skin as I began to fuck her with long, hard strokes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm ahhh, yes….just like that. Faster. Go faster.” She spoke between her moans and I obliged.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my hands left her waist and grabbed her breast and rolled her nipples between my thumb and index finger while the other one went to her clit, flicking and teasing it.</p><p><br></p><p>Her body shuddered and her pussy tightened once more as she came for the second time tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>I however wasn’t done and kept on thrusting, slowly increasing my pace.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds of flesh slapping flesh echoed throughout the room as her moans sounded to me like music.</p><p><br></p><p>A few more minutes later, I felt my climax approaching too and gripped her breasts tightly and started pounding into her with reckless abandon.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on, I would remember this and be glad that we couldn’t hurt any other player within the cities and other safe areas or this would have probably seriously hurt her.</p><p><br></p><p>But since this was not the case here, I bottomed out inside her, shooting rope after rope of my semen inside her as she too shuddered, coming for the third time tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>I collapsed on top of her and kissed her neck languidly as she breathed hard, her hands caressing my back as if praising me for my performance tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>“T-that was….amazing.” I breathed out into her ears.</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-yess, yes it was….ah, but I hope you are not done yet. I have a decade-long thirst to quench and you are going to accompany me till the end.” She whispered in my ear.</p><p><br></p><p>The result….I became hard inside her once more.</p><p><br></p><p>My stats were nothing to scoff about.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s what I am talking about.” She smiled before her legs wrapped around my waist and I began moving again.</p><p><br></p><p>I came three more times that night while she came five more times before she let me go. Our entire bed was wet and the entire room smelled of sex.</p><p><br></p><p>It was without a doubt, the best night I have had since entering the game.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next morning and felt a weight on my chest and saw a mop of brown hair in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The next thing which assaulted my senses was the musky smell of the entire room and the memories of the last night flashed in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>We had been going at it until dawn and looking at the window, it seemed as if we were late getting up.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s a good thing today we didn’t have any hunts scheduled as Shiroe was going to collect information about the next bosses.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I should probably get up.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine is still in the other room.</p><p><br></p><p>My moving woke Veena up and she looked up at me groggily. “Hmm, is it morning already?” She asked while getting up and stretching her body.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s probably afternoon.” I replied while looking at her figure again.</p><p><br></p><p>Even after last night’s….events, just the scene of her stretching made my already hard morning wood even harder.</p><p><br></p><p>She also noticed it and chuckled. “Oh my, excited so early in the morning?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you blame me?” I asked with a smile of my own. “I am beside such a stunning woman. It would be odd if I wasn’t like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My my, did you get a Silver Tongue after last night?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I could always show you if you want. You did seem to enjoy my tongue quite a lot last night.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my! As delightful as that sounds, I guess we are already late for our duties. Moreover, I don’t think our guest would appreciate being kept waiting while we indulged in pleasure.”</p><p><br></p><p>A serious look came to my face as I remembered the thing about Elaine.</p><p><br>We wanted to ask her about the information on the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t look so disappointed. We still have tonight. You don’t think I was done with just one night, do you?” She said as she leaned me and kissed me.</p><p><br></p><p>My hand slipped around her and my tongue reached her lips which she opened, inviting me within.</p><p><br></p><p>We separated after a minute or two.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, good morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We cleaned up and got dressed before leaving the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside, Elaine was waiting too.</p><p><br></p><p>She was sober right now and looked slightly tense so she probably remembered what had happened yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning, Elaine.” Veena wished. “My apologies. We were tired last night and slept late today. Please give me half an hour to make myself presentable.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl bowed primly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas, please give her company till then.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and looked at the girl while Veena walked towards the bath.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl also looked at me and hesitated before opening her mouth. “Guild Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Call me Arthas. This is my home. I prefer not to bring my work to my home.” I said, quoting my father.</p><p><br></p><p>Both mother and he made it a point to keep their work outside the home and concentrate on the family, something I was quite glad about.</p><p><br></p><p>She hesitated and nodded and a period of silence fell over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I made anhmm effort to break the silence from my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….Veena tells me that you are a magician, I mean in the real world. Is that true?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a bit interested in her as I didn’t know anything about her apart from the fact that Arthur Pendragon had run away from his home so that he could be with her. It was only from Veena’s words that I found out that she was apparently some big deal in the Magical World too.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened her mouth, hesitating slightly before nodding.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I am new to this as Veena only told me about this recently so I am just a bit curious about everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I was a part of the Golden Dawn Magician Organisation before my services with the Pendragon family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Pendragon Family? The same one with Arthur Pendragon?” I asked, pretending to be surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “That’s amazing. My mother named me after Arthur Pendragon too. Oh, my real name is Arthur Strauss. Mom was always interested in stories of the myths.” I said, trying to break the ice.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not a lie either and somehow my plot seemed to work too.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw a look of interest in her eyes but she was still a bit hesitant.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, I understood why she was like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, by the way, I have slightly muted emotions so if you feel the difference in my words and expressions, I apologise.” I said and a look of realisation appeared on her face.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“No….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“No….no</a>, I am sorry. I didn’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Most people take it as me being too serious or just plain rude so it’s better to clarify things beforehand to spare everyone the awkwardness later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, an odd expression came to her face as she looked at me carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthur Strauss….Strauss….if I am not prying too much, may I ask where you are from? I mean in the real world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Zurich, Switzerland.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a moment. “Are you perhaps related to George Strauss of the Strauss Industries?”</p><p><br></p><p>This took me by surprise and I replied with a nod. “Do you know my dad?”<br><br></p><p>She nodded. “Mr. George and his wife, Mrs. Emilia has been a patron of the Golden Dawn Organisation for years. Before them, it was his father, your grandfather, Mr. Marcus Strauss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” My dad was a magician? And mom too?</p><p><br></p><p>She seemed to realise my confusion and spoke before I could say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Patrons don’t necessarily mean being Magicians themselves. Golden Dawn and many other such organisations have patrons, people who give them donations for various things but mainly protection.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me, protection?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and explained. “Yes, protection. You realise that in the supernatural world, it is very easy for even a normal human magician to hypnotise and take over any industry?”</p><p><br></p><p>I froze at the implications of her words.</p><p><br></p><p>I had never thought about all this before but it did make sense.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, even Devils and Fallen Angels had businesses in the human world so there were obviously other races and supernatural factions with similar businesses in the human world.</p><p><br></p><p>And where there is business, there is competition and fighting. In such cases, anyone from the supernatural side could easily control any rich person and easily drain them completely. They would be able to do nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>She explained further and her words were in accordance with my guesses.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure there are unsaid laws against such things but there is no concrete body to enforce this and again….they are unsaid laws. Nothing is concrete. To prevent such things, most big businesses have contracts with the Supernatural side of the world. They provide them funds for research and in return receive protection from such cases. In many cases, they are also the ones who help the Supernatural factions clear out news of the sightings of the supernatural world if such an incident happens and keep a lid on things so it is a cooperation of mutual benefit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So….”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. While your family has been associated with the Golden Dawn for several generations, there have been no magicians in your family. They have always maintained a strictly business relationship with the Golden Dawn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how do you know about them? I don’t think you would remember the names of everyone who supports Golden Dawn?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously not. I only remember you because I remember George Strauss searching for ways to cure his son’s muted emotions. He wanted to check if there was any supernatural involvement in it and if you were in any kind of danger.” She smiled at me. “You have very good parents.”</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my mouth at the sudden revelations. “I….I do.”</p><p><br></p><p>It really warmed my heart to have such parents in this new life.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….they would have been happy to see my improvement in all this time.” A look of determination came to my eyes. “I guess I just have to complete this game and go out to meet them.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me again and nodded. “Yes. We will complete this game for sure and reunite with our precious people.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time Veena came out of the bath, all changed up.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see you two are getting along well. Good. Since you have already gotten acquainted, we can get to the serious talks once again.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, finally the time has come which many were waiting for.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas bagged the devil milf.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apart from that, I tried to build up the background a bit with the information about Arthas’ parents.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Next chapter, we will see the reactions of everyone to the things going on outside.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

We would need to be more careful in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, it seems like Cid’s show of power lit the fire within Ikki. The guy actually thanked us and on talking further, we found out about the guy’s background.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki Kurogane, the great grandson of Ryoma Kurogane, a legendary Blazer and a Hero in their country. He was born with an F Ranked Blazer and was thus ostracised by his own father and clan.</p><p><br></p><p>They went so far as to force his school not to let him attend any classes so that he fails the exams.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure that the rage on the faces of Hayato-san and others was also mirrored on our faces.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Ainz was angry and he normally didn’t bother with what happens with others.</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure that the oldies group were almost ready to go and give a piece of their minds to his father but were stopped by Ikki who then informed us that the director of his school had changed and the new director was someone who supported him and his dream.</p><p><br></p><p>She had given him a chance to graduate this year under some conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>It was safe to say that everyone in the group was ready to train the crap out of Ikki.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Kisuke-san offered him a chance to train under him and while I had my doubts about the mad scientist….the fact still remained that he had never let me down when I needed him.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki has two months till his new school year starts so he will be training under them till then.</p><p><br></p><p>He also promised us that he will ask about those chains to the director of his school to help us.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru and the rest were the last to leave after we discussed the plans for the trip next week.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, only Sakura and I were left in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>There were dark clouds outside. “Looks like it is going to rain.” I said taking a look at the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura came to my side and looked outside too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wonder if Lavy is done with her work. She didn’t take the umbrella with her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s hope she comes back in time.” I said as we went and sat on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>The TV was airing some shows but none of us were paying any attention to it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry for today, Sakura. I shouldn’t have dragged you into such a situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t do anything wrong. It was just a misunderstanding and you helped me out too. I wasn’t hurt either. I think I could have broken the shackles if I had used all my power so there was no need to worry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….you could?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was just an instinctive feeling. Still, I appreciate you protecting me. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her in a light hug into my side. Suddenly remembering something, I asked. “By the way, what are the abilities of your Earrings?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked to be in thought and summoned her earrings. “I think it allows me to….manipulate the boundary between reality and imaginary to some extent?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s….for example, if an attack is coming towards me….I could make that attack imaginary and remove it completely. Although I don’t think I can use it on other living beings and there are restrictions for the things I can turn into imaginary things, I need to explore them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….absurdly powerful. Congratulations, Sakura-chan. You also look very pretty in those earrings.” I praised and I wasn’t lying either. She did look pretty.</p><p><br></p><p>The earrings were purple in colour and matched with her hair and eye colour and suited her well.</p><p><br></p><p>She gave me a happy smile at the praise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>We enjoyed the peace of the moment as we watched TV.</p><p><br></p><p>It was after an hour or so that the door to the Restaurant was opened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura-chan, Sil-kun, I’m back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome back. Please wash up. I will serve dinner.” Sakura got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me help you out.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, a while later, all three of us were sitting together for our dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia found out about the incident with Sakura and spent the rest of the time doting on her.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled when I looked at their interactions. These two really were like sisters and from what I could see, Sakura enjoyed this attention too.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of it, they seemed to be in a happy mood so I decided to broach the subject of my trip with the boys too.</p><p><br></p><p>“A trip for a week?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You know how August said that my new magic requires me to use it to fight to progress more. And Ainz and Rimuru think I need more combat experience. We were planning to go to Rimuru’s world and hunt there for a week, just us boys.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That does sound like a good idea. Have fun.” Lavinia said while Sakura also gave me a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the Restaurant will obviously be closed for that time so I was wondering if you two want to stay here or at Zeref’s place. I can talk to him if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, we can stay at Alvarez. Grandpa August won’t mind. His Majesty has gone out to talk to his wife who is also suffering from the same curse as him and he will be returning after a month or so. Till then Grandpa August will be taking care of the castle so it won’t be a problem staying there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I didn’t know that. Don’t worry, I will be back in a week at most.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please be careful.” Sakura wished.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, but that means I will not get to sleep with my favourite pillow for a whole week.” Lavinia suddenly said, making my eyes twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not a pillow you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But you are so soft, cool and warm at the same time. It feels nice to hug you when sleeping.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think I will ever understand what goes on in the mind of this girl.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ikki Kurogane -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He waited outside the director’s room as he thought of what had happened yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>Espers.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything was real.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t been able to sleep the entire night as he thought about everything and what it meant for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san told him that he could help him train and increase his magic power….his greatest weakness. The masters of Ryozanpaku offered help to train him in Martial Arts which used a completely different type of energy….Ki or Life Force.</p><p><br></p><p>He, who had been stuck with no path to go forward, always working hard just to go forward by an inch, suddenly had completely different paths open in front of him with no visible ends.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki clenched his hands as a look of determination came to his face.</p><p><br></p><p>He would not miss this opportunity at any cost.</p><p><br></p><p>He was going to give it his all.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he was thinking about all this, a voice came from inside the office.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me.” He said as he opened the door to the office.</p><p><br></p><p>Kurono Shinguuji was a beautiful slender yet curvaceous woman with short dark hair, multiple bangs that covers her forehead with one that reaches her nose and others on the side of her head that covered some of her hair, tied up into a small ponytail in the back, and yellow eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She often had a laid back attitude towards doing things.</p><p><br></p><p>But only a fool would underestimate her.</p><p><br></p><p>The World Clock was a name that was enough to strike fear in many blazers of the world even after her retirement from the frontlines.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside her was another woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite her childlike appearance, Nene Saikyo was the same age as the director and her rival.</p><p><br></p><p>They were both top level blazers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Kurogane-kun, what can I do for you?” She asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” He hesitated a bit. “I wanted to ask something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Recently….well, I encountered someone, another Blazer. He was training and something strange happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? What kind of strange thing are we talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s….well some kind of strange black chains appeared and seemed to be binding them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He observed that the director’s face took on a serious look and even Nene-sensei became serious and sat straight in her seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Explain everything in detail.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki had already thought of a story with the rest of the people at the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yesterday, I was out for my usual run when I saw this guy training with devices which looked like crowbars near the lake. He was training and every time he attacked during training, some kind of chains appeared around him as if restricting him. On asking him what those chains were, he said something confusing like the world trying to stop him and fighting against the world alone. I didn’t understand anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two women looked at each other and then back at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“And this happened near the lake?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did the guy look? What age was he? Give us all the details.” Nene-sensei said. “Don’t miss out on anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, he was wearing a black hooded cloak so I couldn’t see his face but he was slightly shorter than me. From his voice, he seemed young around the same age as me or maybe he just had such a voice but I can’t say for sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And his device?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a pair of crowbars.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Crowbars? Really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am pretty sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I waited there for a while but didn’t see any changes. It’s just that everytime he tried attacking, the chains bound him and seemed to be restraining him somehow. After that I just left the place as it was getting late for dinner.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you for the information, Kurogane-kun. If you see that person anywhere, please inform us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....was he some kind of criminal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No….not that we know of. There was an….incident at the same lake later yesterday night. When we reached there, things seemed normal but on investigation, we found that there was a large blast inside the lake and yet, someone refilled the lake and fixed everything. There was no damage so the person was not declared a criminal but we might be looking at a potential A Ranked Blazer….or someone worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Worse? What exactly is going on, sensei? Who was the guy and what were those chains?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those chains….were exactly what the boy told you.” She explained after letting out a sigh and explaining. “As you know every blazer has a fixed amount of Magic Power which they can’t increase by any training. This also determines the rank of a Blazer and is a very common knowledge taught in the academy.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….that’s not exactly true.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is extremely classified information and the only reason you are even hearing this is because you saw it with your own eyes. Even then I am pushing the lines so keep this just to yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, every person is bound by the world or fate as you call it and their power is decided at birth. Fated as they say. But there are some individuals who do not accept this. They struggle and train beyond anything, fight and drive their minds and bodies beyond their limits to escape from the life fate has ordained them. The chains you saw were the same chains, the chains of fate, the bindings on the power and potential of a person. It only becomes visible when someone has trained their devices to their limits and cannot progress any further. They start straining against the chains, the restrictions the world has put on them. This process is called Awakening or achieving Brute Soul….and the ones who can achieve this are called….Desperados.” Sensei explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Achieving \"Brute Soul\" is when a Blazer overcomes fate and transforms their soul into a person not bound by fate, and so it is called that because it is like having the soul of a beast. A Desperado using the power from undergoing \"Brute Soul\" too much will result in their body changing to match the shape of their changed soul and they will also gain enormous power in exchange for losing their humanity.” Nene-sensei added ominously.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki took a few moments to digest the information. This was quite similar to </p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to be afraid. Most of the top Blazers in the world are all Desperados. Nene herself is one.” Director said and this made him turn towards the other teacher in surprise while she just smiled at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, even your Great Grandfather was one and he was one of the strongest.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened at the new information. Then again, it made sense. His Great Grandfather was someone far beyond the levels of even A Ranked Blazers. Such Magic <a href=\"https://Power….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Power….it</a> was not normal at all. So this is how he had obtained it.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the director. “So….if I become one, a desperado, can I increase my magic power too? Will there be any side effects to such a power?”</p><p><br></p><p>They stared at him for a moment and nodded their heads. “You can increase your power like that but becoming one is not easy. There are very few of them in the world. The number of Desperados in the entire League can be counted with two hands with fingers to spare….that’s how hard it is to become one. Whoever that boy was….he was not normal. In fact, none of the desperados are simple.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded but in his mind, he already knew what he wanted to do next.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like to apply for a leave till the start of the school year.” He said in a determined voice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next morning with a soft feeling on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>On opening my eyes, I saw Lavy hugging me, my face smothered by her breasts. Her legs were wrapped around my body and I could feel her soft breathing on the top of my head.</p><p><br></p><p>As usual she was wearing my shirt, not that it was hiding anything with the buttons unbuttoned.</p><p><br></p><p>She was with Sakura, wasn’t she?</p><p><br></p><p>I was tired yesterday after everything that had happened and went to bed early while the two girls had gone to take a bath. I thought they were going to sleep together.</p><p><br></p><p>Did she slip in later at night or was she sleeping here all the time?</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, who cares.</p><p><br></p><p>I hugged her too and sensing my movements, she hugged me tighter against her breasts and I enjoyed it to the fullest extent.</p><p><br></p><p>If she didn’t mind, why should I?</p><p><br></p><p>I was already over being embarrassed with something like this after the first few times. Now, I just enjoyed myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad we had work to do so I couldn’t indulge myself for much longer.</p><p><br></p><p>My movements woke her up too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhh morning.” She yawned, stretching herself before wrapping a hand around my neck and kissing my cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently that joke about the good night kiss and good morning kiss….stuck with her….and I didn’t mind it one bit.</p><p><br></p><p>I returned the favour to the surprise of the girl and then got up to get ready for the day before she came to her senses.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“So there are no side effects to the process?” I asked Ikki who had come back to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>He had his bags packed, apparently ready to accept Kisuke-san’s and the Ryozanpako Masters training. His school year was starting in two months and he wanted to be ready for the new year when it came.</p><p><br></p><p>The first stop was the Ryozanpaku Dojo as Kisuke-san said he needed some time to prepare the facilities to train him specifically.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki would train with the Ryozanpaku masters till Rimuru, Ainz and I return from our own training trip.</p><p><br></p><p>Today even Cid-kun was back as it was a Sunday and thus a holiday at his Academy. He was already in his Shadow getup.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. The Director said this information was quite classified. The chains we saw were called the Chains of Fate and they bind the potential of the people to what the world permits them. As they say not every person has the same fate. Some people however can break these chains. They are called Desperados and they become completely immune to fate or even fate manipulating devices.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a sip of water before continuing. “Desperados are said to be people who walk a line between their human and demon selves and there are some rumours of people being lost when they try to use their demon selves’ power more and become the demon themselves. Although this part is something that the director told me not to pay attention to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very interesting. It sounds a lot like Hollowfication and Vizards. To be able to enter such a state while still in a human body. How very interesting.” Kisuke-san’s smile was widening at every moment. He then looked at us. “This also clarifies some things about the process. You three were not affected by the chains because you were not humans to begin with. Our initial hypothesis was correct.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head, deciding to ignore the mad scientist and looked at Cid or Shadow as he was in that costume.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, what is the ability of your Device, Shadow-kun?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….my crowbars….open things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s a crowbar. What else would it be used for?” He shrugged. “I have yet to experiment with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, what is the ability of Sakura-chan’s Device?” Kisuke-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It's to manipulate the boundary between reality and imaginary space to some extent.” I went on to explain what she told me and sure enough their faces had just the look I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s insane!” Rimuru exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know. At least now she will be protected properly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” Ainz nodded, not commenting much but I could see that he was also affected.</p><p><br></p><p>The only person who didn’t care was Saitama who was just playing his game.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you are planning to break those chains too?” Hayato-san asked. “Taking your fate into your own hands….how thrilling.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You know, I could always cut those for you.” I offered but he shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Or Touma-kun could touch the chains….I wonder how it would work on Touma-kun.” Kisuke-san said and then went on his own train of thought while the guy in question shivered at the thought and stepped away from the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Silas-san but….this is something I need to do on my own. There are people who do this by their own strengths. If I were to take the easy way out….even if I become the strongest blazer in the world, I wouldn’t be able to face myself in the mirror. I want to do this on my own, with my own two hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>Wow….Rimuru was right.</p><p><br></p><p>He truly is a shounen protagonist.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well spoken. In that case your training will be extra hard. Silas-kun, pack enough food to last him for the week. He is going to need a lot of energy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will see what I can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was already verified by the Ryozanpaku masters that the food in my Restaurant helped increase the speed of training. They had exceptional control of their bodies and they observed the changes in themselves too.</p><p><br></p><p>The most prominent changes however were in Touma who has been eating my Restaurant’s food since he had started training. In just the past few months, the guy had grown two inches and was now stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can try sparring with me when your training is complete. I would like to see how fighting against a Blazer would be.” Shadow said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I would be honoured to.” Ikki said with a bow.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, Shadow-kun. This dress of yours. It’s not cloth, is it? What kind of fabric is it? I can sense it conducting magic?” Ainz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is a slime suit, made from the bodies of slimes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Slimes?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Infusing matter with magic always yields energy loss. However slimes have a high magic conductivity, ninety-nine percent compared to iron's fifteen or Mithril's fifty. Moreover they can be easily moulded depending on the user’s choice.” He raised his hand as a black fork appeared on his hand and the next instant, it changed into a spoon and then into a sword as flexible as a whip. “They are highly suitable for equipment, can repair easily and can rival even artifacts.” He commented.</p><p><br></p><p>We all looked at Rimuru, the one who was the most surprised by the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha-what are you guys looking at?” He stepped back feeling our gazes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have slimes in your world too right?”<br><br></p><p>“And….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I don’t have any suitable armour.” I commented with a smile making him twitch his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He finally let out a sigh and raised a hand as globules of blue jelly-like slimes gathered in front of his hand and fell on the floor. “There. Now, how do we use it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Cid picked up the slime and observed it. “This is some really good stuff. Can you make more of this?” He asked, looking at Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru just shrugged and created several buckets worth of slime. “There you go.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, we observed as he processed the slime into clothes and then used some kind of magic on it as the colour of the suits changed to black.</p><p><br></p><p>The suit swirled around him, replacing his original one and he clenched his fight. “This is far stronger than any slime I have seen. Thank you. I owe you a favour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously. Rimuru is not an ordinary guy either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to owe us anything. We are all friends here Cid….Shadow-kun. And moreover you made us these cool suits.” Rimuru waved his hand denying any favour.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid-kun then went on to explain how to use the slime suit to us and while it did take a lot of practice, it was something which could be learned.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I could do it easily with my Sage skill’s assistance.</p><p><br></p><p>The only one who was the most disappointed was Saitama as he couldn’t use the Slime Suit due to lacking magic power.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. Let’s meet in a week. Train well, Silas-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Hayato-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thanked the guests and bid them farewell and began preparing for the trip.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Take care, you two. I will be back in a week or so at best.” I said two both Sakura and Lavy, as they got ready to go to Zeref’s place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. You should be careful too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please take care of yourself too.” Sakura wished me well as the two left the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch….lucky bastard.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You two haven’t given up on that yet?” I asked with a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“It hasn’t been three months yet.” Rimuru shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get everything for the journey?” Ainz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup, everything for the journey is packed. Tents and materials for making food are all there in the corner.” I pointed towards the load of things I had prepared for the trip.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will put them in my inventory.” He said waving his hand at the stuff as they magically disappeared in his inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn, that’s a useful piece of magic. Sakura can do it too. Maybe I should learn something like this. Carrying everything in backpacks is bothersome.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” Ainz nodded as I opened the door to Rimuru’s world.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru took the lead and welcomed us.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside, the goblins were already ready, having prepared a welcoming ceremony for us. This time however even the dwarves had joined them.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave them a whole Barbeque Pig bought from my Restaurant to party on and some alcohol for the dwarves.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked extremely happy at the sudden arrival of booze and even offered to make equipment for them if I gave them the raw materials.</p><p><br></p><p>A surprising fact was that none of them were scared of Ainz, a bit curious sure but not afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>We found out that there were undead species of beings in this world too and that we might find some of them in this Jura Forest itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess this place was not as simple as it looked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should approach other tribes of Goblins and even other species and take them under your rule.” Ainz suggested Rimuru. “It will not only give you a better workforce to develop this town but also remove the dangers of any attacks from those tribes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….I will think about it.” Rimuru nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave it to us, Rimuru-sama. We can send people to all the goblin tribes in the Jura Forest and invite them to join us. I am sure they will all join us if they know we get named here.” Rigurd, the head of the goblin tribe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….are you sure?” Rimuru asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Completely. Getting named is a great honour for any monster.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? Then send some Goblin Raiders to other tribes. Start from the weaker ones first. Actually, only contact the ones till B Rank and give them the same offer. If they agree, ask them to gather here in a week. If they have any problems, we can discuss it too as long as it doesn’t compromise the lives of our people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Rimuru-sama!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, now that that is done, let’s get to what we came here for.” Ainz said and Rimuru nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Let’s start our adventure.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The adventure consisted of us going in a random straight line, killing any monsters we encountered in the way. I was the one in front.</p><p><br></p><p>If I ever got in a dangerous position, Ainz nuked them with a Tier 9 spell or Rimuru just glomped their bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, my new Devil Slayer Magic was something else.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt amazing everytime I used the magic.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling was….exhilarating.</p><p><br></p><p>I now understood why August said it was the perfect magic for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean while normal Ice Magic was instinctual for me, the Ice Devil Slayer Magic came as easy to me as breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it made sense as it was based on the magic used by demons so it would obviously be easier for me.</p><p><br></p><p>The more I used the power, the more I felt my Demon Seed growing and in turn my Demonic Power increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not all.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part in all this was training my senses and combat skills against completely unknown enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>I was making sure not to use my Chef Skill to avoid making things too easy so that I could train my combat skills and they worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Being able to use precise magic in normal times and in combat were extremely different things.</p><p><br></p><p>The fluidity in combat can only be learned while fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, I could freeze every singular leaf on a tree….individually and defrost them without harming them at normal times but that would be an impossible dream in combat.</p><p><br></p><p>During fights, I was working on instincts basically for the first two days, throwing big attacks and wasting magic power.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only after I got used to combat and got control of my nerves that I could reduce my consumption of my magic power and use my magic more efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>Sage obviously played a huge part in all of this.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we settled down in a camp after five days of adventuring.</p><p><br></p><p>During these past five days alone, my body had grown accustomed to my new power and was growing steadily.</p><p><br></p><p>My Demonic Power had grown and was still growing at a ridiculous pace due to the food we had been eating.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So you can just eat anything and you gain their abilities?\" I asked Rimuru, intrigued.</p><p><br></p><p>If that was true, then I could make him overpowered considering the things I saw in the Shop's list. Provided they had enough money.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember there being the corpse of an animal called Dragon King Derous or something which can shoot a beam strong enough to destroy multiple planets.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umu.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's cheating, you know.\" Ainz commented while picking a piece of monster meat and taking a bite.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I had to evolve from a Slime, you know. From literally the lowest of the mobs. Even the level one goblins are stronger than those. Moreover, look at Sil, he can cut even fate. How is that not cheating?\" Rimuru protested.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I guess you have a point.\" Ainz nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged too. It did make sense.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what’s with you? You are a Devil and you are using Ice Devil Slayer Magic? How does that even work?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just named Ice Devil Slayer Magic as it copies the magic of Ice Devils. All Slayer Magics are named similarly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….so that’s the reason. By the way, I saw you eating Ice and Great Sage analysed that your magic went up after that….what’s the deal with that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Every Slayer can eat the element they wield. The only exception being their own magic. Doing so boosts their magic for a short time and even helps them recover their magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh….that sounds awfully useful. So all you have to do is keep some ice in some inventory and you can recover your magic whenever you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pretty much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What other kinds of Slayer Magic are there?” Ainz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Devil Slayer, Dragon Slayer and God Slayer with the last one being the strongest among the three as it can eat the magic of the other two as well. Coincidentally, Lavinia is learning the Ice God Slayer Magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh….so she can kick your butt anytime, can’t she?” Rimuru smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered someone and smirked. “Nah….I’d win.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh! That’s a big claim. Maybe we should ask Lavinia what she thinks….” Ainz said and even though his skeletal face showed no expressions, I knew he was smirking.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had a smirk on his face too.</p><p><br></p><p>I just shrugged. “Unlike me, she has to learn the God Slayer Magic on her own without any kind of….racial assistance or Skills. It’s hard to get started too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….so, it’s just a matter of time then….” Rimuru shook his head but his smirk was clear for everyone to see.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh….you sound like you speak from experience. Shizuka-san does have her moments. Could it be that….” I asked, smirking.</p><p><br>Ainz knew when to change sides so he turned towards Rimuru too. “Really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“W-whaa….what are you two talking about?” The guy stepped back, being caught off guard at the sudden reversal.</p><p><br></p><p>We bantered with each other and ate our dinner in peace.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Still, this world is so wonderful. I never imagined being able to walk around without a mask, let alone eat natural food ever.\" Ainz commented, shaking his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, his world was depressing.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Human greed has no limits.\" Rimuru said slumping back with a full stomach too while looking at the night sky.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It was the reason why all members of Nazarick were non-humans. We had perhaps lost our faith.\" Ainz shook his head sadly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"But hey, there are good humans too. Saitama is one example.\" Rimuru offered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He is? I thought he was secretly becoming a cyborg?\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>And with that all of us burst into laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>They might make fun of Saitama all the time but I knew that it was to get him to express more emotions. Anger or even irritation was an emotion after all.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama knew of this as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy acted dumb but he was quite smart where it mattered.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a wolf jumped out from under Rimuru’s shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru-sama, sorry to disturb you but there is some urgent matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Did something happen back in the village?” Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. As per your orders, we sent people to other Goblin groups and monster clans with the offer to join our village. We were able to gather twelve Goblin groups with a total of two thousand goblins and they are moving or have already moved near our village. The problem started when we started inviting other monster groups.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru narrowed his eyes. “What kind of problem?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….some people….just laughed at the hobgoblins we sent and insulted our people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did they attack or injure anyone?” He asked with a frosty tone.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf shivered and bowed quickly. “No….none of them were harmed.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that Rimuru’s frosty expression disappeared. “Well, as long as no one is injured, it’s fine. If they don’t want to join us, it’s their decision. I am not going to force anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed with his thought but Ainz just shook his head, although he didn’t interrupt Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz might be a bit extreme at times but he always respects the decision of his friends. Most of all, he is extremely protective of the people he cares about.</p><p><br></p><p>He could be a little cold at times but that was mostly because of the forced emotional balancing due to the system of his world.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he had mellowed down considerably due to meeting and spending time with us.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru wanted to see if he could name him but turns out that he was currently not strong enough to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the reasons we were training so that he could get named and maybe the connection with this world would do something about that emotional balancing thing from his own world?</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what’s the problem?” Ainz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf looked towards him and bowed again.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, these guys were too serious.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, unlike Rimuru, Ainz had a presence of a royal who commanded such respect, especially when he was in his Roleplay Mode.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ainz-sama, in our travels, we learned that an army of orcs was approaching the Jura Forest. Wherever they go, they destroy and eat everything, continuously evolving in the process. They are nearing an ogre village near this area right now.  The Ogres are preparing to fight but they have no chance of winning. When we tried to talk to them, we were just driven out by the ogres but….”</p><p><br></p><p>“But?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But one of them approached us and said that if we can help them, she will convince her father, the leader of the village, to talk to us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, so you talked with the princess of the ogres, huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“How big is this Orc army?” Ainz asked, already in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Above one hundred thousand large. Among them around ten thousand with their leader, the Orc Lord, are approaching the Ogre village which has only around eight hundred ogres.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru looked at us. “It would be a slaughter. What should we do?” He said with some emotion.</p><p><br></p><p>“It could be a slaughter if they are not saved. As dangerous as it sounds, it could be a great chance as well. Monsters respect strength. You can get their allegiance if you save them or at least some kind of alliance.” Ainz said after some thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“You think so?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s worth trying. We will know when we reach there. What about you, Silas?”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “Sounds like a plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"But several thousand, do we even stand a chance?\" He asked and I agreed. Our chances didn't look good.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Their numbers will just act as fodder for my undead.\" Ainz replied proudly. “Worst case, I can open a Gate and we can just leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru looked pensive for a moment and then as if he remembered something, he stood up. \"Okay, let's go then. Ranga, show us the way.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The scene in front of us was straight out of some horror movie.</p><p><br></p><p>Hordes of orcs were surrounding a village of ogres and several of them had died already but they were holding on, desperately. It was clear that they would lose sooner or later.</p><p><br></p><p>I did observe that whenever the orcs ate something, they got stronger and became immune to some attacks which hurt them before.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, there were many stronger orcs in their midst too who took several ogres to hold on. Not to mention, there were two other monsters who were stronger than the orcs, especially the fat clown who gave me a dangerous feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru flew up above the village and shouted out loudly, getting the attention of several of the monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am Rimuru Tempest, leader of the Goblin Village of Jura Forest. I have come here to offer assistance.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The orcs didn't even pay any attention while several ogres just growled.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz on my side, shook his head. \"Rimuru is too kind sometimes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He stepped forwards and raised his staff.</p><p><br></p><p>The temperature of the area fell and a huge wall of ice rose up all around the village. Several hundred orcs were instantly frozen into statues.</p><p><br></p><p>I used this chance and pushed my Demonic Power and made the ice more compact and reshaped the wall to have spikes on the sides of the wall to prevent any reckless charges.</p><p><br></p><p>All the fighting in the area stopped. Ainz lowered his staff and teleported onto a platform on the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru came down from the sky and landed on the wall beside Ainz while I flew there too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This is how you get their attention. Now go and speak.\" Ainz said as he stepped back and came to stand beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn't say anything because he wasn't wrong either.</p><p><br></p><p>He did get their attention.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, both sides had stopped completely.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Now then, as I was saying. I am here to negotiate and stop this war if possible.\" Rimuru proposed. The result…</p><p><br></p><p>\"Geld, new food has arrived. Go on, eat him. Hurry hahahaha.\" The one with a bird-like mask shouted at the largest orc in the group.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked over to that group and saw that there were two masked people. One had a bird-like mask while the other had a clown mask. The clown masked guy was the strongest one according to what I could feel.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, in terms of raw power, it was even stronger than Rimuru, Ainz and even the giant Orc, probably the Orc Lord who was standing in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru turned his attention towards the Ogres. \"It seems they don't have any intention of stopping. Do you require my assistance?\"</p><p><br></p><p>They sent a red haired ogre to the front and he was accompanied by a white haired old guy and a blue haired ogre. Behind him was a pink haired ogre girl, accompanied by a purple haired female.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf beside us spoke again, in a very soft voice. “Rimuru-sama, it was her.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, so the pink haired girl is the princess of the ogres. It does look like she had convinced the redhead, who seemed to be their leader to speak. The guy looked a bit young though.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am the prince of the Ogres. My father just passed away in the war so I am the leader of the group.\" He shouted loudly although I could sense that he was even disgusted at the idea of being the leader due to his father's death. The pain and anger in his voice. \"What do you want in return for your assistance?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….did the leader of the clan pass away?</p><p><br></p><p>\"An Alliance. My village is small and needs as many allies as we can. I want to invite you all to come and stay in the village. I promise all of you a good place to live, food and names along with protection.\" Rimuru offered the ogre.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the entire crowd went haywire when the name part came out. There was disbelief and awe thrown around.</p><p><br></p><p>The red haired ogre swallowed lightly before looking at Rimuru \"If you can provide us with these, we will swear allegiance to you. I give you my word as the new leader of the ogre village.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oi, is it just me or do they not believe that Rimuru can name them?\" I whispered to Ainz.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I get the same feeling. Is this naming stuff supposed to be hard? I thought you only needed to be stronger than them and none of them look like they are stronger than Rimuru.\" Ainz whispered back.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I mean, there must be some type of catch, right? I don't see how such a thing would be easy. I mean, that would be fucking broken, right? Anyone could create an army like that.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umu. I think so too. We need to talk to Rimuru about this. He probably doesn't realise it yet.\" Ainz agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Let’s get this fight over with first.”</p><p><br></p><p>The orcs had started charging towards the wall already.</p><p><br></p><p>My ice spikes were keeping them away but it was only for a few instants.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few died, they tore off the flesh of their own people’s dead bodies and ate and then started breaking down the ice spikes and working on the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>The Heavily Armoured Orcs were coming to the front and those didn’t look like they would be harmed by normal ice spikes either.</p><p><br></p><p>We only had a little more time left before they would crush the ice wall and the fight would restart.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will do something to keep them busy for a while.” Ainz said and raised his staff.</p><p><br></p><p>Several of the fallen orcs were covered by a dark cloud all of a sudden and what came out of them were zombie-like creatures in black armour and holding a large sword and shield.</p><p><br></p><p>They stepped forward to engage the orcs in a melee.</p><p><br></p><p>I too decided to prepare for the fight and broke off a large piece of the ice wall and bit down on it and felt my magic power increase.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what’s the plan?” Ainz asked as he gathered around us.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s why we are so tense.” She said as she slipped into her couch and closed her eyes and let her head fall into her mother’s lap.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! Every person in the whole country? How is something like that even possible?” Her mother asked, surprised as she caressed her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t know. None of us have any idea. We didn’t even know such a thing was possible before this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This kind of power….it’s beyond any Lucifer….even Rizevim might not be able to do such a thing and he is considered an anomaly like Sirzechs and Ajuka. To think there was someone else like this….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. We are lucky that this person hadn’t participated in the Civil War….or joined the Old Satan faction or….” She shivered thinking about the consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>How do you fight someone like that who can selectively clear entire countries of your people without even showing their faces?</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find any clues about him?” Her mother asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Azazel simply refused to speak anything. He didn’t even give us any hints. Heaven is also shaken but they are not speaking anything although from what our spies could tell us, they are also trying to find clues about this mysterious Lucifer. The Church is obviously making noise but none of them have dared to step inside the boundaries of the country since that incident so they are just barking without any bites.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s better if those fanatic fools keep out. They only create a mess whenever they interfere with any matter.” Her mother said, making her nod.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not like she was wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven was less annoying than those people.</p><p><br></p><p>“So no clues?”</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall shook her head. “We can only guess about his personality based on his actions.”<br><br></p><p>“You mean the action of wiping out everyone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it wasn’t without any reason. Apparently, those fools from the Wizards of Oz had been the ones to attack first and they even had the user of Incinerate Anthem with them. Apparently, the Mysterious Lucifer took this personally and….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wiped the entire organisation out.” Her mother completed. “Sigh….those fools. They had to poke the hornet’s nest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, not everything was as bad as we expected.”<br><br></p><p>“Hmm?”<br><br></p><p>“Apparently those people were experimenting on some kids. Whoever this guy was….left those kids unharmed. Unfortunately the kids had no memories due to the experiments, not that Azazel would open his mouth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….that’s indeed surprising. So….he only targeted the organisation who attacked him. In that case I can understand. Any devil would retaliate violently if attacked by a Longinus, especially with one of the Holy Relics. So this guy is not a heartless monster. And seeing as no one even had any idea he even existed for so long, then maybe he isn’t interested in any wars either….that’s a good sign for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall nodded. She too had come to the same conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mother was very good at critical thinking. Well, all members of the Dantalion family were scholars, they just had different kinds of talents.</p><p><br></p><p>Some were researchers, some were businessmen, some were politicians while some were strategists.</p><p><br></p><p>It was her mother who managed the businesses of the Sitri House while her father took care of the political side of things. They were a perfect team.</p><p><br></p><p>Under their leadership, the Sitri House had made great progress, especially in the Medical field.</p><p><br></p><p>Ever since that incident, they had poured everything into expanding and developing the medical technology of the whole devil race….</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall shook her head as she pushed those thoughts aside.</p><p><br></p><p>Both she and Sona had inherited her talents as well.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were talking, her father walked in.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked tired.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she could even see the slight dark circles under his eyes and those were rare….extremely rare considering that he was an Ultimate Class Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damon, you look tired. Is everything alright?” Her mother asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Her father looked at them and then forced his expression into a smile. “Yes. Things have been a bit hectic lately and I had to run around a bit.” He said as he took a seat near them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is anyone causing problems?” She asked with narrowed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>To force someone like her father to such a state, was something happening that she didn’t know about?</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.” Her father waved off.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s about Sona’s engagement, isn’t it?” Her mother asked, making him sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….Lord Glasya-Labolas was not happy with Sona breaking her engagement with Zephyrdor but he did understand her decision. Zephyrdor is somewhat of a unique devil….”</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s a jerk. You don’t have to mince your words, father. It’s good that Sona did what she did. Him becoming the Lord of the Sitri House….I still have nightmares imagining such a situation.” She shivered.</p><p><br></p><p>“That may be, but it still didn’t look good on our part.” His father sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there something else? You have been distracted for around two months now and don’t try denying it.” Her mother said and she looked at him and saw his eyes widening slightly, only for a fraction of a second before he schooled his expression.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father….is everything….alright? If there is something I can help with, I will.” She asked, again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s fine. I will take care of everything.” He reassured her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. But just in case you need any help, you can tell me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled and she felt as if she had seen deep sadness in his eyes at that moment. “Yes….I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, several things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Silas and the team got new devices and Ikki found out more about his world, resolving himself to become stronger.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kisuke is preparing for his experi….Ikki’s training.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Our trio is also on a training trip and have encountered a unique situation.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things will start coming together more in the next chapters as the plot progresses more.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will try bringing some food and cooking based worlds as well.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In fact, I am having fun writing this one and wish to focus more on this for a while so expect more chapters of this in the next month.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br></p>",

The only problem with it was that it’s levelling speed had decreased a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder if there is any way to increase the levelling speed of my Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Talking about Skills, the Man Slayer Class came equipped with a Skill of its own, a skill similar to the Shingen-ryu.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū Style Swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I don’t get active Skills by levelling up the Class but rather by mastering the swordsmanship style.</p><p><br></p><p>The Game Master seems to want the players to actually learn swordsmanship over just bruteforce levelling the class.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it’s not like I had any problems with it. The Skill gave Passive Increases like the Shingen-ryu style too, which made the stat growth of the Man Slayer Class even more absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a T5 Class and yet its stat growth was similar to a T6 Class.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected of a Class obtained for fixing a bug.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū [Level 11/100] [Exp: 110/11000]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū is an ancient kenjutsu developed to allow a single samurai to defeat numerous foes single-handedly.

This left us stuck here so we decided to take care of some important things.</p><p><br></p><p>These last few days everyone has been busy collecting money for the next expedition.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was busy using her new recipes and selling new products and training people to run the guild, Shiroe was helping out the guild members plan for how and where to level up at the fastest speed and even offer advice for people who need to select future classes.</p><p><br></p><p>This left only Star and me.</p><p><br></p><p>We went out hunting together a few times and I found the guy to be quite chill.</p><p><br></p><p>If anything, he was dedicated to the grind. The guy didn’t want to sit back and be the weakest link in our team so he was almost always out hunting.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was the only one free in our team, I decided to assist him. Just the fact that I was in the party with him, not only increased his Exp. Gain by 10% but also increased the Phy. and Mag. Atk. by 10% giving him an extra boost in his levelling spree. Not to mention, I had healing which enabled us to go wild.</p><p><br></p><p>His Apprentice Swordsman Class was levelling at an insane speed due to us regularly hunting down T4 monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes we were joined by Shiroe while Veena stayed and worked on the medicines as crafting also levelled up her Pharmacist Class.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, she was the highest money earner in the group.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, most of our missions were to get ingredients for her to make the Greater Healing Pill as materials needed to make those were not available in Llyne. They were found in the Marshlands and that’s where we mostly hunted.</p><p><br></p><p>It was good practice though as our previous methods of sniping enemies from trees didn’t work anymore as the T4 and even some T3 monsters could easily break down trees or even large boulders given enough time.</p><p><br></p><p>We had to constantly change our strategies to keep up with the enemies. It was a nice experience for our team and even gained me another level.</p><p><br></p><p>And this has been our routine for the past few days. Hunting in the morning, coming back and watching over the guild matters and practising Shingen-ryu or Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū in whatever free time I had.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a towel and wiped off my sweat.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing that happened was the summer.</p><p><br></p><p>This being the mediaeval world, there was no electricity or other such facilities and while that didn’t matter that much in winter as we could still warm ourselves with fire or warm clothes but the summers were absolutely disgusting.</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked around and found that in the bigger cities, they had enchanted stuff to keep the place cool but unfortunately we couldn’t buy such things nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>I just hoped that Sabaody Archipelago has such stuff or we will need to hire enchanters.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, at this point I am just tempted to go there and buy those enchanted goods and maybe we could even sell them here for a much larger profit margin.</p><p><br></p><p>The only relief in this time was the new spell Veena had bought from the Black Market for 70 thousand Gold Coins despite us trying to save money for the auctions, the Ice Wall. We didn’t use it for attack but rather carried the Ice Wall for cooling water and other things.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, when some people saw us carrying the ice, they even asked to buy it for Gold Coins. Obviously we sold it. We needed to recover the money used to buy the Skill Book.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyday for two hours, people lined up to buy Ice from us, every large block for 20 Gold Coins. This was one of the main reasons for her being the highest earners of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the house and Veena was sitting in the living room, working on the next batch of medicines to sell.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, finished with today’s practice?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I got another level up for the skill and decided it was as good a time as any to stop for today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, you shouldn’t overwork yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her words. “Says the one who keeps making medicines from the break of dawn till dusk. I personally think the selling of ice is actually a welcome change as you at least get two hours to rest in between.”</p><p><br></p><p>The reason we were all pushing ourselves so hard was because Veena had been working insanely hard and that actually made her guilty as we couldn’t contribute much to the team.</p><p><br></p><p>So we did the thing we were the best at, level up and get stronger. Ultimately, strength was the most important thing in this world at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s nothing. You should take a bath first. I will finish by then and take a bath myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Cold baths were the best.</p><p><br></p><p>I stepped out of the bath and called out to Veena to enter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you are done. I am done here too.” She said as she kept the instruments back in her inventory and got up, stretching her body.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a thin white gown due to the heat and it was sticking to her body due to sweat, outlining the shape of body clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>As usual, she was not wearing anything inside.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head, pushing the thoughts out of my head in the other direction but I was pretty sure I saw her smirking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….she was in one of those moods once more.</p><p><br></p><p>The game between us has been going around for far too long for me to blush at such a small matter, especially when we slept together every night so I just gave her a normal smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure I saw her smile widen at this, accepting the challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>She just sashayed towards her room while I shook my head at her antics and dried my hair and changed into my shorts.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last few months, my hair has been growing a bit. I guess I will have to get a haircut soon.</p><p><br></p><p>She came out of her room after some time and entered the bath.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew she was going to take some time inside so I decided to take some rest till then.</p><p><br></p><p>While the physical exhaustion could be managed due to my high stats, mental exhaustion was something I had to deal with by myself.</p><p><br></p><p>It was after thirty minutes or so that I heard the door of the bath open and looked in that direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena came out….as usual in her towel. This time however, it was shorter than normal. It was barely covering her breasts and went down to her upper thighs. Half of her ass was sticking out of the towel and this part was exposed more as she walked.</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes widened but I quickly reigned myself in.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not going to lose this game so I gave her a simple smile again and closed my eyes while desperately trying to think of other things.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything again and when she came out, we heated some food we had bought from outside and had dinner in peace and then finally went to bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“So,how was your day today?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Same old. The quest was simple and Star had to collect his new equipment today so we returned early. How was your day?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The same. Shiroe was right. That girl Elaine has talent….I think she….might be someone from the Supernatural side of the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” I was taken aback by the sudden revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>“The way she moved was highly reminiscent of Magicians….actual magicians, not the ones in the game. Her moves were something people only gained from actual combat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure? Did you talk to her?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not yet. I am almost sure that she is from the supernatural side. I will observe her and talk to her after I can get a better read on her character. We are considering her for the team, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, let’s stop talking about work. It’s been more than a week since the last time you guessed what kind of being I was. So, did you find any clues?” She asked me with a smirk.</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes. “You could just tell me and we can get this over with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, where’s the fun in that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Then I will take another guess. You….might be some kind of demonic being, succubus or devil or something.”</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly she giggled at my guess. “Oh my, do you really think so little of me?”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “You were the one who said I shouldn’t believe what I hear until I get a chance to see and judge things for myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s true. Good job on that. So….what makes you think that? Why do you think I am some kind of demonic being and not some angelic being or something?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up at the ceiling. “Well, from the conversations we have had so far, I could tell that you didn’t exactly have a good feeling for angels.”<br><br></p><p>“So? I could be a Fallen Angel. Although corrupted, they do have light too.” She insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>“The last time you told me the story about Faust and Mephisto, you were quite sympathetic towards the devils….almost too sympathetic as if speaking from experience rather than just mere observation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, and?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was the first clue which pushed me towards this line of thought. I guess that’s it. I did say I was guessing, right? So did I get it right?”</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a chuckle. “Well I guess congratulations are in order.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Although you made two guesses, they were quite close so I give it a pass. Succubuses are demons, not exactly devils. Devils are the race created or reincarnated by Lucifer after his rebellion with Lilith. Demons are beings who have existed before that. Asmodeus, Beelzebub and even Mephisto Pheles were demons who were made into devils by Lucifer. Technically, Mephisto Pheles is older than Lucifer himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Beelzebub and Lucifer are different? I thought it was the name of the same person, the one called Satan.” I asked, suddenly taken aback at the statement, as that part struck me more than the whole mess she had suddenly spoken.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. Some people confuse it. Knowledge often changes over time. Your sources must be from the mundane world so it is understandable. There are four Satans in the Underworld, the Lucifer, the Leviathan, the Beelzebub and the Asmodeus. They are also called the four Great Satans.” She spoke and suddenly a memory came to the surface of my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>It couldn’t be….</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything and she continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“After Lucifer rebelled against his father, he fled to the Underworld to escape with Lilith. But he didn’t run away empty handed. Before running away, he had learned the mysteries of creation. So when he reached the Underworld, he used the same knowledge and with the help of Lilith, someone who had eaten the Fruit of Knowledge, created the whole Devil race. Among them, the strongest seventy two Devils were named the seventy two pillars. Apart from them, they created some more devils as personal servants. They were called the Extra Devil Houses.”</p><p><br></p><p>The more she said, the clearer the image became in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>….seriously….not that world.</p><p><br></p><p>“He ruled the Devil race with the other three whom he had formed an alliance with to fight off his father. Together, the four were called the Four Greater Satans and the rulers of the Devil race.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Several thousand years passed by. In that time, several other of his siblings rebelled against his father or they were cast out for the smallest of follies. These people went on to become the Fallen Angels. These beings didn’t forsake their light so they still held corrupted light in their bodies. They formed an organisation called the Grigori and started fighting against both devils and angels and their father, changing the two way fight into a three way free for all. Sure enough, there is only so long that all this resentment can last without blowing up. And when it did, there was War. The biggest war fought in this world….the Great War.”</p><p><br></p><p>While she was saying this, my mind was abuzz with completely different thoughts, the prime of them being….’Please don’t let it be the boob world.’</p><p><br></p><p>“This war lasted for a long time and was the bloodiest war in our world. Many Pillar Houses died along with the Four Satans before the war finally stopped. But that was not the end for the problems of the devil race. The descendants of the four Satans wanted to restart the war while most of the Pillar Houses were done with the hundreds of years of constant fighting and killing and wanted nothing more than to stop this war for good. This divide in opinions exacerbated over time and led to war, the Civil War of the Devil race.”</p><p><br></p><p>….at this point, I was already sure that she was talking about the DxD world.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it was either this or she was also a reincarnator….which was quite improbable. Not impossible as there was already one person, the person who created this game so there could always be more.</p><p><br></p><p>She however didn’t realise my inner conflict and continued on with her story.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Civil War was a very dark period. During these times, we had to fight our own people, live every day in doubt and fear or being backstabbed by the people we called friends or having to kill members of our own family as there were several houses and even people from the same houses who stood on opposite sides of the battlefield. Thankfully, our side had more members and some heroes rose during such difficult times and won us the war, ending the era of terror.”</p><p><br></p><p>She paused and took a deep breath as if remembering something and continued. “It was decided that the position of Satans will not be hereditary from then on and the ones who had contributed the most in the war, the strongest four, were made the new four Great Satans, although they had to break off any connection with their original clans.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just to clarify things, I pushed myself and asked her the question. “What were their names?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs Lucifer, Ajuka Beelzebub, Serafall Leviathan and Falbium Asmodeus.”</p><p><br></p><p>….yeah, no more doubts. It was the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“These four changed the devil race almost completely, making the current devil race very different from what it was previously.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, for starters, trading or consuming souls of humans or other races was banned completely. Secondly, we had lost most of our people in the two wars, putting us behind the Fallen Angels and Angels and they could have attacked and killed us at any time. Devils have a very low fertility rate and an average devil takes hundreds of years to have even one child. This meant it would have taken us thousands of years to get back our initial numbers and to solve this problem, Ajuka Beelzebub invented the Evil Pieces.”</p><p><br></p><p>She then went on to explain everything about the Evil Pieces and the current devil society and the rest of the Supernatural world.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally at the end, when she stopped, I asked something which had been in my mind for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is your name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, I didn’t introduce myself did I. I remember saying I would tell you about myself if you ever guessed my race. Alright then, my name is Venelana Gremory.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck!</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next day with a slight headache.</p><p><br></p><p>The information I gained yesterday was enough to keep me awake the whole night….the fact that I was sleeping with the current Lucifer’s mom also contributed to this fact.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….</p><p><br></p><p>She was Venelana Gremory?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean she did look the part. Brown hair and purple eyes….</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover this was really that stupid boob world….</p><p><br></p><p>Have I been living for the last eighteen years in this boob world without even realising?</p><p><br></p><p>That brought up another thing to mind….just how did some Akihiko Kayaba wannabe manage to trap so many people in this game, including the fucking Lucifer’s mother? There was no way they would just sit back and let such a thing happen….</p><p><br></p><p>What did that even mean?</p><p><br></p><p>I had been too busy with my thoughts to ask Venelana about her thoughts but if this guy had really managed to trap us inside, there was no way things were as simple as they looked.</p><p><br></p><p>Just who was the Game Master and what exactly was this Soul Art Online?</p><p><br></p><p>And how do I react from now on knowing I am in a world which was just an anime in my previous life?</p><p><br></p><p>I just remained there laying on the bed thinking about everything until Veena woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.” She wished as she rubbed her eyes and stretched on the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.” I wished normally.</p><p><br></p><p>First and foremost, there was still a non zero chance that she could also be a reincarnator so I wanted to wait till I had more clues.</p><p><br></p><p>She had said Elaine was probably a magician and she could probably tell me more about the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Either way, there was no way I could tell anyone about me being <a href=\"https://reincarnated….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reincarnated….at</a> least not yet.</p><p><br></p><p>As for how to treat Veena, she hadn’t treated me badly or let me down yet so it would be stupid to treat her differently after the revelation, especially since I more or less knew the story of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>While there was a chance that things could be different from what I knew, there was also an equal chance of it being similar. I needed more information before I could make more decisions.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look tired. Didn’t you sleep properly last night?” She asked me, worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, not really. I was thinking about everything you told me last night.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, are you suddenly afraid of me or something?” She asked me with a smile but I could feel that this question was actually a serious one so I responded to her just as seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t change anything between us. For me, you are the same person you were yesterday, the person who has fought with me, covered my back and supported me in my time of need. You being a devil or any other race doesn’t change this simple fact.”</p><p><br></p><p>Trusting someone with your back in life and death fights go a long way to establish trust.</p><p><br><br></p><p>A smile bloomed on her face at my answer.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued. “I just had some other questions in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was wondering if the Supernatural world is real….and so many people have been trapped inside, was it the work of someone from that side of the world and if so then why hasn’t someone tried to do anything yet? From what you have told me, all the creatures from the mythologies are real and they keep each other in line to prevent the existence of the Supernatural world from spreading among the normal humans….then why….hasn’t anyone done anything even after so long?”</p><p><br></p><p>A frown appeared on her face and then a serious contemplating look took its place. “That, I don’t know. I have some guesses but I don’t have enough information to make exact conclusions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you tell me the guesses?” I asked, trying to get some ideas and maybe I could think of something with my own knowledge of the plot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, remember the part when we were creating our characters and we had to agree to a part about putting your mind, body, heart and soul on the line?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I nodded.”<br><br></p><p>“Well, there is a high chance that they were not mere words.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it could be some kind of magical contract and we voluntarily agreed to it. Such contracts have power. I guess I must be slipping to fall for such an obvious trap.” She added before shaking her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe that’s why the Supernatural side hasn’t done anything or it could cause us to lose our lives. That’s at least one of the reasons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, what reason could someone have for doing something like this?” I asked. And this guy was a reincarnator too.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what the fuck happened that he decided to play Akihiko Kayaba all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….I don’t know. Sometimes, some people are just mad enough to do something like this. The Old Satan factions that I explained about last night are such people but even they wouldn’t be so blatant about it or it would turn the whole world against them. If I am honest, I don’t think they have the guts for such a <a href=\"https://thing….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">thing….at</a> least not all of them.” She added the last part slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, you have no idea about just how crazy those fuckers can be and how much guts they can have. Especially that bastard of Lucifer, Rizevim. That crazy son of a bitch had unsealed the beast of apocalypse and almost caused the world to be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Were we really trapped inside by them?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this reincarnator guy a member of that Khaos Brigade organisation too?</p><p><br></p><p>“Couldn’t they find and well….make him break the contract?” I asked after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “He has the lives of almost twenty million players in  his hands and there are high chances that some of them could be important people just like me, my daughter and her friends. I know for sure that my family and especially my son would have done something already if he could.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You have a son!” I asked, pretending to be surprised. I still had to play the part.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, didn’t I tell you? I have a son, daughter and even an adorable grandson.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You….look very young.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. Supernatural races can live for a long time and maintain their youth for as long as they want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how old are you?” I couldn’t help but ask.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, asking a woman her age is not good manners.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry.” I apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I will give you a hint. My son Sirzechs, is almost five hundred years old and I had him two hundred years after my marriage.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>So at least above seven hundred years….</p><p><br></p><p>And then I suddenly realised something….she had let slip her son’s name.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs? Isn’t that the name of the current Lucifer? Did you name your son after him?”</p><p><br></p><p>She chuckled. “No dear. The current Lucifer is named after my son….or rather, my son <em>is</em> the current Lucifer although technically, he is not associated with any houses, it still doesn’t change our relationship.”</p><p><br></p><p>She laughed when seeing my open mouthed look. “What, surprised?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, what do you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, could it be that the strongest player on the continent is actually scared?” She teased.</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes. “Put yourself in my place and think. I have been sleeping with the mother of the Devil all this time? Not to mention him, your husband would probably blast off my head the moment we get out. How do you think I should feel?”</p><p><br></p><p>She burst out laughing. “Seriously, even after hearing everything, my race, my true identity, the very fact that I was a devil, that is what you are worried about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me but I think I am perfectly sane to worry about such a thing.” I countered.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs, from what I remembered, was someone who cared a lot about his family. I had no idea how he would react if he found out that I was staring at his mother’s half naked ass and even slept with my face buried in her breasts everyday.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silly child. Devils or rather most long lived races, have a very different sense of morality then that of humans. You shouldn’t judge people based on your human way of thinking. What might seem common sense or societal norm for you might be completely reversed for the other races. It’s one of the results of having such a long life to be honest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, for starters, having lovers or even multiple wives is quite normal among devils. Most devils have harems of their own, men more often than women but it is quite normal. After all, the devil race has a very low fertility and we are still trying to get our numbers back up. Do you follow me till this point?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Secondly, there are those people who just fall out of love….or well, they just get bored of each other. It can take a few hundred years to even a few thousand years or even more but after a certain time, they just stop having desires for each other. At that point, they just part ways.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Divorce?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, not always. They just separate and live their own lives. My own mother-in-law has been living on her own for a while now. There are obviously exceptions, people who stick with their partners but they are exceptionally rare.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” And then I thought of something before asking. “You told me about your son but nothing about your daughter?”</p><p><br></p><p>If I knew her age, it would at least give me an idea of where I stood in the timeline.</p><p><br></p><p>Although us being trapped inside would have changed the timeline almost entirely, something was still better than nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered some things about this world but not everything although I knew the deal with Trihexa and then some Alien Gods would come and attack the planet and they would start with Great Red.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that I didn’t know much.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, thinking about my daughter while sleeping with me?….How bold, Arthas.” She smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthur.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My real name is Arthur Strauss.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only fair to share my real name with her after she came forth with her own.</p><p><br></p><p>She paused for a moment and then smiled gently. “Arthur Strauss. Arthas….I see. I get it. It’s a good name. Well, since you have opened up to me, I guess I could tell you about my daughter. My daughter is almost the same age as you. Her name is Rias and she had just started her third year in High School and had her eighteenth birthday when she got this game. It was actually her praising this game so much that made me interested so I decided to try my hand at it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils go to High Schools?” I asked. “Also, five hundred year old son and eighteen year old daughter. You weren’t kidding about the low birth rates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously Devils go to school. Knowledge is power and Devils love power. Normally children are homeschooled in their early years and then sent to schools for Noble children but my daughter wanted to experience life in the human world and thus she joined a school in Japan with some friends of hers. I wonder if she is inside this game too.” She sighed worriedly.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand on hers reassuringly. “If she is, then we will find her.”</p><p><br></p><p>She gave me a light smile. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The topic was becoming sombre so I changed it. “Still, that’s a very low birth rate. One child in a five hundred year period. I can see why everyone would be worried about going extinct.” Another thought came to my mind and I turned towards her. “And what about your husband?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? Why so interested in my husband all of a sudden?” She asked, teasingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’d like to know if I should expect someone to appear outside my house ready to blast my head for sleeping with his wife.” I replied blandly.</p><p><br></p><p>She giggled. “You really don’t understand the ways of devils.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t. That’s why I am asking you. From a human’s perspective, I would never want my wife to be like this with anyone else. And that’s why, I think it would be incredibly cruel of me to do this with someone else’s wife if they feel like me.” I asked seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head and perhaps sensing my seriousness she answered seriously too. “You would really be a great knight, Arthas. I did notice that you have maintained your distance from me from the moment you heard I have a son.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, children are the ones most affected in such cases. Even more so than the couples.” I answered easily.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled and shook her head. “It’s refreshing to see someone keep their calm even in such a situation and think about others first.  As for your answer. I don’t think he would mind. He has a harem of his own that he spends his time with. Some of them are even my friends. We have been together for almost a millenia and before anything, we are best of friends.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked towards the ceiling. “The reason I decided to join this game was because….I was bored. While I am happy with my life, things start to become bland after a certain period of time. When you live for thousands of years, there are very few things you don’t experience. Even relationships change. They become less about….physical satisfaction and more about feelings. That doesn’t mean we don’t need physical satisfaction. Sometimes people just lose their passion for their partners. In such cases, it’s better to part ways rather than lead a monotonous life. Both my husband and I understand this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, you have other partners?” I asked, curious.</p><p><br></p><p>She smirked. “My my, are you asking me if I am available?”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well no. First of all, if I had partners I wouldn’t be in this game.”</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why, but I felt an invisible ‘get a life, otaku’ slap on my face even though it was not her intention there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Second, as you said, children are affected when parents separate. My daughter was supposed to get married this year. Any announcements we made would have been after that settled down.”</p><p><br></p><p>….damn.</p><p><br></p><p>Was there something like that in the novels?</p><p><br></p><p>She seemed in quite a melancholic mood so I let her have some quiet time.</p><p><br></p><p>It was already early morning so we didn’t have much time to laze around.</p><p><br></p><p>We needed to get to work soon.</p><p><br></p><p>The two of us left the room with a much greater understanding of each other.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She packed the new batch of Greater Healing Pills into a pouch and stored it in her inventory and then brought out the next batch of raw materials to work on.</p><p><br></p><p>All the while the memories of this morning’s conversation went through her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole thing had gone better than she had expected. In fact, it had gone too well.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t expected Arthas to take the information about her being a devil so well and not hold prejudice against her.</p><p><br></p><p>She chuckled thinking that the whole time the boy was worried about what her husband and children would think about them sleeping together.</p><p><br></p><p>Honestly, it was adorable to see this side of him.</p><p><br></p><p>She had thought she was losing her edge when she couldn’t make him flustered even after walking out in that towel. He has begun to adapt to her tactics and thus she has raised her game. But in the end, what got him was not that but the knowledge that she was married with two children.</p><p><br></p><p>It did make her verify the choice she had made in trusting him once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Such people were very hard to find in this day and age.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, she was starting to enjoy their time together more with each passing day. Even just the time when she told him stories about the Supernatural world or talked about random topics had become quite special to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She had also noted that he has grown a lot more mature in the past few months.</p><p><br></p><p>War really made people grow fast.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, the conversations of this morning also brought some thoughts she had been suppressing all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>She wondered if her daughter and her peerage members were really inside the game and if so, were they doing well.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from them Grayfia….</p><p><br></p><p>It was Venelana who had called his son’s queen to accompany her to try this game and she was pretty sure that she was trapped somewhere in this vast world.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, knowing Grayfia, she would survive. She was someone who had contended for the position of one of the four Great Satans against Serafall.</p><p><br></p><p>Her experience would allow her to survive this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, Venelana felt guilty for dragging her inside and wished to find them as soon as she could. It was for this reason she was so insistent on expanding the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, a hundred eyes can see more than two.</p><p><br></p><p>When their guild grows, it would be easier to search throughout the world for their traces than just travelling randomly and expecting someone to just appear in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>That kind of luck was hard to come by.</p><p><br></p><p>She was already lucky to encounter Arthas so early in the game and then find Shiroe and Star as new members.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t want to keep relying on this luck.</p><p><br></p><p>The start was a bit shaky but she could see the potential in the guild, especially with the head start they had over the other players.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana was sure that in just a year, she could push the guild to become a big name in the whole country and in three to five years, throughout the whole continent.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not that different from running a territory in the Underworld. She had experience with such things but unlike before this time she would be playing for life and death.</p><p><br></p><p>On the matter of territory, she remembered that Arthas was also given the title of Baron and a territory in Greenfrost.</p><p><br></p><p>Could he manage the territory and collect taxes from it?</p><p><br></p><p>She will have to ask around and find out. Still, if that were the case, then it would open so many paths for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps her teammates didn’t understand but she was keenly aware of what such a title meant.</p><p><br></p><p>Being a noble, even the second lowest rank like a baron, would give them a leverage over other players and a position to negotiate with the NPCs from.</p><p><br></p><p>And if a Baron Rank could be rewarded then so could the higher ranks.</p><p><br></p><p>But the first thing they needed to do anything was….funds.</p><p><br></p><p>And so, Venelana again concentrated on the batch of raw materials and started processing them into new pills.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost after an hour or so that there was a knock on the door of her workshop.</p><p><br></p><p>“May I come in?” The voice of Elaine came from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Velenala kept aside her mortar and pestle and replied. “Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door was opened and the black hair girl entered and bowed professionally.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana had observed the girl and knew that she was trained in etiquette, as a maid perhaps, something which was rarely done in mundane families nowadays.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take a seat, Elaine. I assume you are here with the list of tasks completed by the members of the guild yesterday?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Ma’am. We have been able to complete the order of eighty batches of healing salves for the Knight Academy, five batches of Greater Healing Pills for the City Lord’s Mansion and….”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl went on to list the items and Veena noted that the production orders they had received this week were all completed….with three days remaining. Then again, it was to be expected.</p><p><br></p><p>Their guild was mostly consisting of Production Class Players.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the players who had left back then had been explorers and although all of them did return, they were not able to get any slots in the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say they didn’t have any explorers. They had the other independent top players from the raid join their guild too apart from Gareth’s team.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just that the number of production class players was far more than them. The ratio was almost seventy five to twenty five and that was after recruiting Gareth’s team and Elaine, which was also one of the major reasons for recruiting them.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened the Guild Menu and checked the current status of the Guild.</p><p><br></p><p>20% progress in one week.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate, they might get a level two guild in a month and half at most.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine soon completed her report and presented the file to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She verified the list of quests from the Guild Menu and found that the data matched and nodded towards the girl and praised. “Good work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did we get any more orders?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We did get orders of poisons and antidotes from the Hunter’s Guild and several healing items from the Adventurer’s Guild as well. Although I doubt there would be much demand in the long run if we started flooding the items in the market.” She added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, true. It seems we will need to change our strategy for long term benefits. Perhaps opening a shop for the goods sold by the Fairy Tail Guild….I will have to plan something. We will see what we can do after returning from our trip.” She then looked towards the girl in front of her. “That’s all for today. You are doing an incredible job. Keep it up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You praise me too much Ma’am.” The girl replied politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, which country are you from, Elaine?” She asked. “Do you mind if we talk for a bit? This work gets quite monotonous after a while.” She said looking at her crafting equipment in front of her. “And I don’t get many chances to talk with other ladies around here.” She asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked surprised but nodded nonetheless with a slight smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am from England.” She replied and they began to talk.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, is Elaine your real name?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded. “Yes. My name is Elaine Westcott.”</p><p><br></p><p>This made her raise an eyebrow. “Westcott? That’s quite a famous name. William Wynn Westcott. He was one of the founders of the Hermetic Order of Golden Dawn, wasn’t he? Are you perhaps related to him?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>This made the girl stiffen a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Did I guess it right?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl hesitantly nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. So you must be a magician of Golden Dawn too. That explains your skills as a magician.” She looked at the stiff expression of the girl and smiled. “Don’t worry, dear. Although indirectly, I have been associated with the Golden Dawn Magician Organisation for a long time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, I didn’t think I would meet others here. It’s honestly quite a relief to be able to talk about it with someone else after such a long time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are the Guild Master and others also….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Magicians? No. They don’t know about it. Well, I did tell Arthas recently so he does now but the other two don’t. So take care.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They began talking while she worked on the side. When she was done, they left the guild halls for a break.</p><p><br></p><p>It was evening.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas was out to hunt with Shiroe and Star again, and she was already done with all the materials for the Greater Healing Pill so she was free for today.</p><p><br></p><p>After this morning’s conversations and worrying about her family for the major part of today, Venelana wanted something to soothe her nerves so she invited Elaine to have some girls talk.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way to their home, she picked up some mead. Wine was not available in this place but right now even mead sounded great.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the two of them had some drinks.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl seemed to be under quite a lot of stress too and she agreed to drinking after some persuasion.</p><p><br></p><p>Although Venelana found out that she, just like Grayfia, was a very light drinker.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, are you alone inside the game or do you have any friends from the organisation? If so then we could totally use some new skilled members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I left the Golden Dawn organisation due to some personal problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….that’s a surprise. So, what do you do nowadays?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I work as a….worked as a maid in the Pendragon House.” She said, the last part with a hint of resentment.</p><p><br></p><p>This made Venelana raise her eyebrow. “The Pendragon House? Arthur Pendragon’s house?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” Elaine nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened dear? You don’t seem to be happy. Are they perhaps treating you badly? Although the Pendragon family is strong, the Golden Dawn is nothing to sneeze at. The Pendragon family mostly rests on the laurels of their ancestors while the Golden Dawn is made by the contribution of several geniuses who work hard day and night to upgrade their knowledge and become better. After all this time, even if it’s the current Arthur Pendragon, he would have to answer for treating you badly.” She spoke in a dangerous voice.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact Venelana had met William herself. He was a polite gentleman. After all, her son’s bishop Mcgreggor Mathers was also one of the founder’s of the Hermetic Order of Golden Dawn and while he had  retired from the position after becoming her son’s bishop, he still maintained a very good relationship with the organisation. And if she knew the eccentric magician well, he would never take the mistreatment of his friend’s descendant sitting down even if the other side was the original king of Camelot let alone some no named descendant.</p><p><br></p><p>William himself was offered a position of Bishop by her but he had denied.</p><p><br></p><p>After Mathers became a devil to pursue magic and Woodman passed away, he wanted someone to be there for Golden Dawn and stayed there till his last days.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he did accept the offer of becoming her contract magician. It’s why Venelana was surprised when she heard Elaine’s full name.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. Arthur is not a bad guy.” She hurriedly interrupted, breaking her composure for the first time to such an extent.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl calmed down and continued. “He treats me very well. Even Le Fay treats me like her own sister.” The more she spoke the lower her voice became and Venelana sensed something else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my….don’t tell me….do you have a crush on this Arthur Pendragon?” She smirked, suddenly having found a new target for her teasing.</p><p><br></p><p>And as expected, the girl blushed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it’s not like that. We….we are in a relationship.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just that Uther Pendragon, Arthur’s father, doesn't approve of our relationship as I was just a maid in his house and so….”</p><p><br></p><p>“So? Is he treating you badly?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded her head. “So Arthur left home with his sister to protect me from his wrath.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh! This generation’s Arthur Pendragon seems like someone quite courageous.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously.” The girl replied proudly. “Arthur is a once in a century genius, a natural born Holy Swordsman strong enough to wield and completely master the strongest Holy Sword Caliburn. His talent is compared to his ancestry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh!” Venelana was actually surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t known about this.</p><p><br></p><p>She did know about the strongest holy sword and while not as talked about as the other swords used, it was far actually even stronger than the famed Excalibur blades.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl continued. “Even Le Fay is a genius comparable to her namesake. Even at a very young age, she is capable of doing magic which many High Class Magicians would have problems with. I am sure that in a few years, I won’t have anything else to teach her.

It was time for me to wake up as it is.” I replied as I kept the tray beside her. “Here, have some tea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” She thanked me as she took the cup and took a sip of the tea.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have another doctor’s appointment today, right?” I asked and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you want me to go with you? In that case, I will call school and take a leave.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. You don’t have to do that. Rika-chan is taking me to the hospital.” She refused.</p><p><br></p><p>Rika-san was Sae’s mother and a very close family friend. They were practically family and they have been a huge help to us since Grandma’s health started to deteriorate.</p><p><br></p><p>She even brought us dinner sometimes to help us out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Koji-kun will be coming today so make sure that you don’t miss him.” She reminded me and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, Koji-san will be coming today to collect manuscripts for the next chapter.</p><p><br></p><p>Drawing manga was not an easy task. There were several steps involved.</p><p><br></p><p>First the person has to draw a rough draft called the ‘name’.</p><p><br></p><p>This is then presented to the editor and changes are made. The mangaka then draws a new name and the process is repeated until they agree on the final draft after which he draws the manuscript.</p><p><br></p><p>It was different for me.</p><p><br>Due to my System and my own superhuman stats, I was able to draw at a very fast pace. The speed was increased even further due to the fact that none of my manga ever needs me to draw more than one name.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Koji-san, they would do just as well if they were put as it is for publishing….which was actually the case as they were world famous manga which had already gone through several rounds of editing by the best of the best.</p><p><br></p><p>If I were to draw an original, I am sure it would take many rounds of editing to make the final cut.</p><p><br></p><p>But still, due to all these reasons, I was able to dish out chapters like none other.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san still comes over and checks the manuscripts as a part of his job.</p><p><br></p><p>I am actually lucky that my editor is Koji-san. Any other editor would have gone crazy or had a fight with me due to my crazy style of work.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>My new school wasn’t that exciting and although I did make friends here….we didn’t have the same connection as I had with the idiots of my previous school.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hard to believe but I missed those fools….even that dumbass Kiyotsugu.</p><p><br></p><p>We did keep in touch and I had visited them a few times and they had come to my place during vacations too.</p><p><br></p><p>At least I had Tobi going to school with me.</p><p><br></p><p>At first, I had drowned myself in training.</p><p><br></p><p>After Grandma had started teaching me, I was able to learn a bit more about the true power scaling of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon’s explanations had been more or less true.</p><p><br></p><p>The bottom of the barrel were the non supernatural creatures.</p><p><br></p><p>Above them would be Low Class beings. They could be anything from two or three times stronger than the average human adult to ten or fifteen times stronger than normal humans depending on their powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond the Low Class beings were the Middle Class beings. They were far beyond Low Class beings, able to take down dozens of those by themselves. Most of them also possessed some kind of special powers.</p><p><br></p><p>From what Grandma told me, Rikuo felt like a Mid Class being but that could be due to his human part being dominant during the day. At night, he could get stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>As for High Class beings….they could destroy large hills and small mountains with ease.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s where the level of power started becoming crazy. Peak High Class beings could be crazy powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how many people from the Naruto world could do so?</p><p><br></p><p>At least no one below Kage level and even among those people, only a handful if we exclude the Jinchuriki.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, unlike Kishimoto’s Naruto, the manga given by the System don't have any flaws.</p><p><br></p><p>In this matter, the System has a very strict scaling when it comes to powers too. It has a fixed level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond the High Class was the Ultimate Class. This was the last level which Grandma knew about.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, anyone who was famous in myths was at the very least Ultimate Class <a href=\"https://strong….Yes….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strong….Yes….at</a> the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>This level of power was extremely broad.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically anyone who could destroy a small city could be said to be an Ultimate Class but that was not the end….Even prefecture destroyers or basically anything below Country Destroyers were all called Ultimate Class. So there could be a huge gap between two Ultimate Class people although both of them hold the same title.</p><p><br></p><p>These people were all walking nukes. For example, a decently strong Ultimate Class could wipe out the entire Honshu without a lot of effort.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact was chilling that we lived in a world full of beings who could end such large areas of land on just a mere whim. To compare things, even the strongest of nukes made by humans would just be equal to an attack of an average Ultimate Class being.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this,all this information just made my work harder as I had no idea which range Hagoromo Gitsune or her subordinates belonged to or even Nurarihyon himself. They were as strong or stronger than most tailed beasts. It would be like facing the real Kyubi….well, Hagoromo Gitsune was also a Kyubi apparently but unlike the one in Naruto, she was skilled and could actually fight rather than rampage like a mindless monster. This was true for all youkai, which is what makes them far more dangerous than any tailed beast. And I will be facing her subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>I know Nurarihyon had told me of the level beyond that and that if I wanted to have a decent chance of beating them all by myself, I needed to be at <em>that</em> level.</p><p><br></p><p>The Leader Class.</p><p><br></p><p>Such power….</p><p><br></p><p>It was the thing of myths….the level beyond several weaker Gods. The goal was frightening. No, it was terrifying to even think about it.</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t let this information break me. If anything, I increased my training even more. I threw every waking moment of my time into training.</p><p><br></p><p>Even grandma was worried for a while and she sent me to Shuri-san’s place to take a break….and it was a good idea too.</p><p><br></p><p>That place was quiet and peaceful and helped me relax a lot. Although not everything was peaceful. I still had a hard time forgetting what I had seen one night when I had gotten up to drink water.</p><p><br></p><p>One can never guess a book by its cover.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder dad went for mom. Then again, she did say they had different <a href=\"https://preferences….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">preferences….it</a> was only that day that I understood what she meant. I shivered at the thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Worst case was that I was seen by Akeno that night. Thankfully, I was able to bring her away with me and prevent her from seeing something that would have haunted her dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san came an hour later after I returned home.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the room to find the man very happy. “You look awfully happy, Koji-san. Did something good happen?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Yes, something great happened, Tatsu-kun.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow as I looked at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>He held my shoulders happily. “We got an offer for an anime adaptation for Demon Slayer, Tatsu. Your manga is going to become an anime!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” I was taken aback at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Chief was contacted by one of the biggest production houses with an offer to animate Demon Slayer. They contacted me since you….well no one knew who you are.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went on to explain the entire deal.</p><p><br></p><p>The contract was to be signed by grandma. She was representing me as a guardian because I wasn’t a legal adult yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Mangaka didn’t make much money from animation but then again, money was not an issue for me as I never had any problems with it. What I was interested in was that anime would bring people to read more of my manga and buy more volumes and this will translate to more sales for my Naruto manga too.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon Slayer was very popular, seeing the lack of good manga in this world. I kinda understood why I got this Mangaka System. It wanted me to spread some decent entertainment in this world so that people don’t have to suffer those cringy magical girl shit anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a surprise that it took so long to get an offer for an anime.</p><p><br></p><p>I was wondering how to increase the sales and views of my manga and this fell into my lap. I can finally get the points for several things I was hoping to buy.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed and I was given several details. He asked me about my preferences and requests for the anime if I had any and I requested a few things, mainly like keeping the anime as close to the plot of the manga and all that to avoid problems.</p><p><br></p><p>The manga which the System gave me were usually the perfected versions of the whole with even the movie and extras seamlessly added and plot holes more or less removed. It was almost as if the System was detailing the actual events rather than drawing the story.</p><p><br></p><p>The production house which had given us the offer was quite good.</p><p><br></p><p>They had mainly done gag anime before this but they were quite interested in the Demon Slayer series to try something new.</p><p><br></p><p>I was all for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san had shown me some of their works and the animation quality was quite good although the stories themselves….left a lot to be desired.</p><p><br></p><p>We waited for grandma to return and then she signed the documents for the deal and it was finally decided that I was getting my first manga animated.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Anime takes a long time to make.</p><p><br>A single episode could take anything from two to six months to make including all the work which is put in.</p><p><br></p><p>So any result we get will be obtained much later.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is one thing that we can get earlier.</p><p><br></p><p>The announcement.</p><p><br></p><p>It was announced that the Demon Slayer manga is getting an anime and I saw almost a two times increase in the number of views and sales almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>This increase is expected to reach its peak when the anime is finally released.</p><p><br></p><p>Three months had passed since the day and apart from this my life hadn’t changed much.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still following a similar routine but now there was a difference….I took as much time as I could to spend with grandma.</p><p><br></p><p>Her condition has been getting worse.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t any disease per say as it was her old age, catching up to her. She was mostly on bedrest nowadays.</p><p><br></p><p>Her son and daughter-in-law took leave from work and came regularly to keep her company. He was actually about to quit his job but grandma completely refused so they had to do this.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t bothered by it though. If anything, she looked peaceful. Almost too peaceful.</p><p><br></p><p>“How can you be so calm?” I couldn’t resist and asked her.</p><p><br></p><p>She just smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I already got everything I wanted in my life. I got a loving husband, a caring son and daughter-in-law, such adorable grandchildren. What else would I want?”</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my hands, feeling powerless all over again.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure there were methods to give her a long life by Demonification or some other method but grandma was not the kind of person who would ever accept something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>If anything, it would be an insult to even suggest such a thing for her.</p><p><br></p><p>There was something else that I had in mind and even if it was a desperate wish, I hoped it would work.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand in my pocket and pulled out a vial.</p><p><br></p><p>The red coloured vial was the same as the one I had taken before, the Uzumaki Clan’s bloodline. Uzumaki Clan were known for their great chakra reserves and vitality and long lifespans so much so that Uzushiogakure was known as the ‘Land of Longevity’.</p><p><br></p><p>I hoped that this would bring even slight improvements in her vitality and increase her age by a few years.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the vial in my hand oddly and then at me with a questioning look.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this, Tatsu-kun?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” I paused for a bit and then continued. <a href=\"https://“This….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“This….it</a> will cure you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the vial and smiled. “Did you go somewhere and get some medicine? Silly child, I am not sick. I am afraid age doesn’t have a cure.” She smiled as she brushed my hair.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“This….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“This….it</a> will cure you.” I insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!” She looked at me and then took the vial in her hand and checked it. Her eyes widened as she opened the cork of the vial. “Tatsu-kun….just what in the world is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not something bad, I promise….and it will cure you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She however insisted. “I am not doubting that it will be anything bad. The aura it’s giving off is extremely pure so it would hardly be anything bad. But what is this and where did you get this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I had a story prepared for this already. “....it’s….the blood of a sage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s the blood of a sage. By drinking, you will gain the bloodline of the sage. That’s all I can say. I am sorry. But <a href=\"https://please….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">please….it</a> can help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and then at the vial, her hands shaking lightly. “How?” She finally uttered after a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….cannot say….but I didn’t do anything bad for this. I didn’t hurt anyone, I promise. It’s just….I really cannot say anything more. I am sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>She stared at the vial and then at me and then closed the cork and kept it on the side and hugged me. “I know my grandson will never hurt anyone for such things. You are too kind for something like that. But <a href=\"https://this….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this….it</a> would be wasted on me. I barely have any long to live. I cannot accept this. You should use it on yourself.” She said, trying to return the vial back to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have already used it.” I quickly said. Seeing that she was suspicious, I repeated again. “I did. Promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….then give it to Tobi. He will need it more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can get more for him later.” I insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to, Tatsu-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But why….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have lived my life Tatsu-kun. Now I just want to go to where your grandpa is. He must be lonely all by himself.” She said softly.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a lump in my throat at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled me into a hug and I hugged her back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Life and death are two sides of the same coin, Tatsu-kun. What lives, must also die. This is the rule of the world and the sooner we can accept it, the sooner we can understand the true meaning of life. We all have to make the best of our time and be grateful for the life we are given.” She whispered to me.</p><p><br></p><p>That day, I didn’t train.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about several things.</p><p><br></p><p>She asked me to protect Tobi as he would have a difficult life ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t understand what she meant by that and when I asked her she just smiled and patted my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I did promise her to keep him safe. We also decided to give him the vial with the Uzumaki Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>I spent the next whole month just like this, training only when she was asleep and spending as much time as I could with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Tobio understood the change in the behaviour of everyone and accompanied us for some private family time.</p><p><br></p><p>She told me that I had learned all the basics and I could experiment and learn more by myself or ask Shuri-san. Sometimes however, she instructed me on how to meditate using Buddhist methods to keep my mind calm.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one morning, I went to wake her up and….she was gone.</p><p><br></p><p>She passed away in her sleep with a peaceful smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in her last moments, she looked content.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I stood beside the sobbing Tobio while we watched the fires of grandma’s funeral consume her body.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio’s parents were standing with him while Shuri-san and Akeno stood with me. The latter herself was sobbing at grandma’s passing.</p><p><br></p><p>I did feel sad but I have had a long time to get used to the inevitable and with Grandma’s words, I could get adjusted to it much better than Tobi.</p><p><br></p><p>The funeral was a quiet affair.</p><p><br></p><p>My friends from Ukiyo E came to attend as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio’s parents had returned on that very day and decided to stay for a month.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san offered to let us stay with her but changing schools mid-year was a hassle. In the end, Sae’s parents offered to take care of us.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thankful as I didn’t want Tobi to witness what I had that night.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san was a good person but as she said….we were different people, not to mention, moving away would separate Tobi and Sae too.</p><p><br></p><p>We all returned back home and everything was quiet that day.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow the house seemed to be empty all of a sudden even with all the people inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san and Akeno stayed with us for a few days to help cheer Tobi and me up.</p><p><br></p><p>Things remained down for the next two days when Shuri-san decided to break the dull atmosphere which had spread over the whole place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go out somewhere for a week or so. The more these two stay here, the sadder they will become and the harder it will be for them to let go. A change of scenery will do good for their minds.” She suggested Tobi’s parents.</p><p><br></p><p>They were cousins after all.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them looked in thought and after some time, agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This place will just keep reminding them of Kaa-san. A change of scenery might just be what we need, but where though?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have just the place in mind.” Shuri-san said</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, all of us, even Sae’s family, packed our luggage and were in our cars.</p><p><br></p><p>This was due to the fact that Gin was too big to travel with us on the train.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor guy had been just as sad as Tobi and me on Grandma’s passing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are we going?” I finally asked as we were on the road.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobi’s dad, Shiro-san was driving and I was sitting in the back seat with Shuri-san, Akeno and Gin while Tobi’s mom, Tanya-san was in the front seat. The guy himself was with Sae in their car.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Seto Inland Sea. We are going to the beach.” Shuri-san answered.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….the beach.</p><p><br></p><p>Gin’s ears perked up at the information but he deflated a second later, probably remembering the reason for his sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is your work going on, Tatsu-kun? This vacation won’t be a problem for you, right?” Tanya-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I had already given Koji-san the chapters for the next two months after the funeral as I wanted some quiet time. He understood. He has already reviewed the chapters and can use them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, it’s really surprising no matter how many times I hear about this. Tatsu-kun is such a big mangaka.” Shiro-san said with a smile. I knew he was trying to make small talk to divert my attention from sad thoughts and I appreciated it, especially knowing how much pain the guy must be in himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, Shiro-san, you work in the stock market, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. Are you interested?” He asked, grabbing the chance I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit. I was saving up a lot of money and I was going to get some from the serialisation of ‘Kimetsu no Yaiba’ too, so I was wondering how to invest them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did research and have a few companies in mind from my previous world and those companies existed here too. Although I wasn’t sure how much they would be worth in this world with all the Supernatural being real and all.</p><p><br></p><p>“That's a very good decision.” He replied enthusiastically and the topic was successfully diverted.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the journey was peaceful like that and we reached our destination by the end of the day.</p><p><br></p><p>The Seto Inland Sea area is beautiful. The islands and the view of the sea is breathtaking and the greenery in the area gives it a peaceful feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Gin's eyes light up as he saw the beach in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san led us towards a nearby house and was greeted by an old woman there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Himari-san. It's been so long.” She hugged the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara Shuri-chan, you have become so pretty. Are these your guests?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is Shiro-san, Ageha Obaa-san’s son and his family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard about Ageha. You have my condolences. I am sorry I couldn't make it there due to my poor health.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. We don't mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>She finally turned her attention towards me. “And this is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is Tatsuya-kun. Hiro-kun’s son.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiroshi’s….oh my. Yes, he does look a lot like him. Sigh….he was so young.” The woman called Himari-san sighed and led us in. “Come in. All of you must be tired from your journey. Take some rest and have something to eat.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I looked in the distance to see Tobi and Sae playing with Akeno in the sea. Gin was lazing around in the sand.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone had taken to resting their minds on the beach this past two weeks and the results were evident.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobi was smiling again. Although a large part of that was attributed to Sae’s efforts to cheer him up.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Shiro-san was happier now.</p><p><br></p><p>The place we were staying in was one of the sparsely populated islands in the area. It was a lush piece of green with a large house in between.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the area in the island was owned by Himari-san and her family and thus there were not many people around on our side of the island to disturb our private time.</p><p><br></p><p>We had to take a twenty minute ride by ferry to come to this place.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally Himari-san stayed on the main island as it was closer to the market and all but she used to rent this place for tourists. We had reserved it for half a month.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the last day we were staying here so I decided to take a walk around the island, to my favourite place.</p><p><br></p><p>With that in mind, I got up and started walking.</p><p><br></p><p>“It looks like it might rain. Be careful on your way back, Tatsu-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that I ran towards the forest.</p><p><br></p><p>The place I was going to was a cliff facing the ocean. The wind there was great and it was the best place on this island if someone wanted to be alone for some time.</p><p><br></p><p>I often visited this place this month. I had even memorised the place to recreate it inside my Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>Fifteen minutes or so later, I was already near the cliff and walked towards it when I heard a voice.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Help.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>My Observation spread almost instinctively and it took me just a moment to find the source of the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>It was coming from the cliff. It took me a moment to understand what was going on and the next moment I dashed towards the cliff and looked down.</p><p><br></p><p>There was someone hanging from a branch almost halfway down on the side of the cliff.</p><p><br></p><p>Under the cliff were sharp rocks and a small stretch of land so falling down would have been fatal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait there. Just hold on for a minute. I’ll get something to pull you up.” I called out and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around but there was nothing there which I could use. Normally I could easily jump there and save her but that would also reveal my powers to someone not connected with the Supernatural so I quickly thought of a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Using some points, I quickly bought some ropes from the System Shop and tied an end to the side of the tree.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky was already dark by now and it was thundering.</p><p><br></p><p>I took another rope in my hand and slowly climbed down the cliff. “Just hold on, only a bit more. I will get there in just a moment.” I assured her.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached her and held her while offering her the rope. “Tie this to your waist. I will pull us up.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and quickly began following my orders. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind blew, making us move on the rope.</p><p><br></p><p>My grip on her rope tightened while she hugged me with a shriek.</p><p><br></p><p>Since her face was in the nape of my neck, I surreptitiously used my feet to stabilise us using some chakra to reduce the shaking although not stick completely to the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine.” I reassured her. “I am here.”<br><br></p><p>She slowly pulled back and looked at me and for the first time I took a clear look at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a beautiful girl with waist-length tan hair that had square bangs, light brown eyes. Although the same eyes were currently filled with fear and panic.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not let you go….don’t worry. I will save you, I promise.” I slowly reassured her and slowly but surely, she calmed down and finished completely tying the rope to her waist and I let out a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Now hold tight. I will pull us up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” She hugged me tightly while I started to pull us up.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt something on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, rain?”</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed the girl's shiver and looked up to see a look of horror on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she afraid that we would get blown away again?</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to reassure her again but before I could ask anything, rain came down in torrents on us and I sensed something different.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking towards our legs, I saw something that almost made me release my grip on the rope.</p><p><br></p><p>Is that a fish tail?</p><p><br></p><p>My head snapped towards the girl who was looking extremely panicked right now. She even had tears in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>A mermaid?</p><p><br></p><p>“I….please….” She started to speak, the panic in her voice was evident and that’s what broke me from my daze.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a deep breath. “It’s fine. I promised you that I will save you, didn’t I?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes opened wide and she tried to speak something but I didn’t give her any chance as I started pulling us up.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, we were on top of the cliff but the problem was that she didn’t have legs and I doubted she could walk with her tail.</p><p><br></p><p>“It would be bad if someone found you here like this. Do you have anywhere I can drop you off?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still in a daze but still pointed towards the sea.</p><p><br></p><p>Of fucking course.</p><p><br></p><p>Where else would a mermaid live?</p><p><br></p><p>I still had her in my arms in a princess carry so I decided to carry her to the sea and slowly placed her in the sea.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, the two of us were completely drenched in water.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me one last time and then back towards the sea as she quickly swam away deep under the water.</p><p><br></p><p>Man….this world is seriously full of supernatural beings.</p><p><br></p><p>There were even mermaids.</p><p><br></p><p>What’s next?</p><p><br></p><p>A magical girl?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at myself with a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, how do I explain being drenched?</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t questioned much when I told them that I lost the way and went to the other side in heavy rain.</p><p><br></p><p>The rain lasted for a few more hours and when it stopped, we left the place almost immediately as we were already late in our schedule for our return.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sun Seto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She sat in her room, thinking about the incident that happened last night.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still like a surreal dream for her.</p><p><br></p><p>She had gone to watch the sunset from her favourite spot and slipped and fell from the edge of the cliff. She had been barely able to get a hold on to a branch to avoid falling.</p><p><br></p><p>A direct fall would have no doubt killed her.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when her saviour had come when she was beginning to lose hope.</p><p><br></p><p>White hair, golden eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun hadn’t had any contact with any other boys, let alone humans her age but his presence had helped calm her down. He didn’t leave her even when he saw her tail and kept his promise.</p><p><br></p><p>It was right out of some fairy tail which other mermaids read all the time….only in her case, things were not that simple.</p><p><br></p><p>He had seen her tail.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun knew the rule of the Seto mermaids….if a human saw her tail, they either had to kill the human or….marry them. Failing to do so would result in her own death.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an age-old tradition of the Seto Mermaids.</p><p><br></p><p>When she had reported the incident at home, things had gotten out of control.</p><p><br></p><p>Her father had erupted in rage and launched a wide search for the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>She had directly denied any interference from her father on this event and didn’t tell them anything about her saviour knowing that they would try to do something stupid behind her back.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy had saved her life….she couldn’t let him die for this….even if she had to lose her life. She wouldn’t let him suffer for saving her life. That would be against the honour of all Seto Mermaids.</p><p><br></p><p>She clenched her fist, determined to stick to her decision till the end.</p><p><br></p><p>When she reached the door of her father’s office, she heard a shout outside which made her stop in her place.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean you cannot find anyone with the description on that island!”</p><p><br></p><p>“There were no such people of that description on the island, Sir. We searched everywhere. The best we could find was that they were guests who came to visit the island and returned to Tokyo. We tried to find the question of the people who were hosting them but….”</p><p><br></p><p>“But what?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“The woman who owns the hotel, Himari Kumogawa….she has connections with the Five Principal Clans. Her maiden name was Himari Shinra. We cannot touch her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....the principal clans? Were the guests also from the Principal Clans? If that were so then….”</p><p><br></p><p>“No Sir. They were not connected to the Principal Clans, just an ordinary family. We asked some of the other people on the island and were able to find that one of the kids had the last name Toujou.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. That’s good. Ask Sun about the description of the boy and have a sketch made. Don’t be too obvious or she will know. I will personally go to Tokyo and take care of this matter. No dumb boy will become the cause of my daughter’s death.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sun clenched her fists and walked away from the room’s door slowly towards her mother’s room.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way she would let them harm her saviour.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And you want to save that boy from your father even knowing that you will die if he lives.” Her mother asked her and Sun resolutely nodded her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would most likely have died if not for him. He gave me a new life. I cannot let him die because of it or it would bring shame to all Seto Mermaids.” She answered resolutely with her hands clenched tight.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mother just stared at her and then sighed. “You know things are not that simple. There is no way a parent can see their child die like that and not do anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mother!” She shouted, stunned at her reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be quiet, Sun. First listen to what I am saying.” Her mother scolded and Sun pursed her lips, waiting to listen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know about the alternative solution to this matter?” Her mother asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will have to marry a boy whom you don’t even know. Do you understand how dangerous it can be? What if he is a bad person.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s not!” Sun retorted quickly, making her mother raise an eyebrow. “He saved my life. Even when he saw I was a mermaid, he was surprised but he didn’t let me go. He still saved my life and returned me back to the sea. Such a person….I know he won’t be a bad person.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mother let out a sigh. “What should I do with this girl? Alright….you have five years. In those five years, you need to find the guy and get him to agree to get engaged to you. If you can do that, there will be no problems. That’s the longest I can hold back the higher ups from finding out. You know better than anyone what will happen when they do. Even the Seto Gang cannot go against the laws established by Ryujin-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Masa has informed me that the boy might be in Tokyo. Your father will no doubt go there but there is only so much he can do there as it is the territory of Nurarihyon and the Nura Clan. He will need to take permission to stay there and even then, he cannot remain away from the Seto Inland sea for a long time. I have some friends in the Nura Clan who can arrange for you to stay with them till you find the boy but even you know that it will be a very difficult task. Tokyo is not a small place.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not give up, Mother.” Sun clenched her fist. “I will not disappoint you.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks had passed since we returned from the trip.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a saying, time heals all wounds….perhaps there was some truth to it after all?</p><p><br></p><p>Everything calmed down in the house.</p><p><br></p><p>After some assurances from both Shuri-san and Sae’s mother, both Shiro-san and his wife left for their jobs.</p><p><br></p><p>They did hire a maid for us to help out with the housework.</p><p><br></p><p>I was back to work so Tobi spent most of the day at Sae’s house.</p><p><br></p><p>This gave me plenty of time to focus on my training.</p><p><br></p><p>My spar with Nurarihyon was coming and I had no idea how strong he was or how to beat his Fear.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight was just one week away.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: D</strong></p><p><strong>Body: (D-79)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: (D-31)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: (D-75)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: (E-05)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 18,215,035 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Kaichou wa Maid-sama, One Piece, Naruto</strong></p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: Training Room, Mentor System</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory: Nichirin Blade x 1, Gacha Tickets x 2</strong></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My progress in the last two months hasn’t been great as I was taking more time to spend with my new family.</p><p><br></p><p>Did I regret it?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma had taken me in when I had nowhere to go and Tobi treated me no less than a real brother. I didn’t regret spending my time with them, especially in her last moments.</p><p><br></p><p>Several weapons had been unlocked in the Shop too, like the Kusanagi no Tsurugi but Shanks had suggested that I keep using the Nichirin Blade.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, with enough practice, I could make it into a Black Blade.</p><p><br></p><p>When asked about it in detail, he explained that at some point, the Sword gets used to the Armament Haki of the user and gains the ability to absorb Haki of its own. The Blades at the level of his Griffin and Hawkeye’s Yoru were always in Armament Haki mode.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about it and came to a conclusion that it was similar to how the Shinigami of the Bleach used their Spiritual Powers on their Asauchi to mould the blade with their power.</p><p><br></p><p>Haki was also spiritual power and continuously channelling Haki through a weapon was quite similar to the process too. In that way, it could awaken a kind of spirit inside the sword and thus give it more power than before.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just a theory so I can’t say much about it but Shanks seemed to have liked it and asked me to try to make my Nichirin Blade into a similar Black Blade instead of buying another blade and wasting points.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed with him too.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least came the Devil Fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>I found out that I could eat multiple devil fruits. There were however restrictions though.</p><p><br></p><p>It could only be one of every type, Zoan, Paramecia and Logia.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I had also planned which ones I wanted to buy.</p><p><br></p><p>The good news was that the curse of the Devil Fruit was not effective in this world. It is supposedly a One Piece world specific thing.</p><p><br></p><p>To make the selections, I had talked to Shanks and other mentors of mine and asked them for advice.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, Shanks himself was against eating Devil Fruits but that was partly due to losing the ability to swim and partly due to not wanting to rely on those powers.</p><p><br></p><p>For him, Haki was enough or with his power, he could easily have found any Logia fruit and used it to create an arm of that element, kinda like Aokiji did.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, even he told me that I shouldn’t let go of this as I was facing completely new dangers in my world and beings surpassing the One Piece world….although he planned to push me beyond my abilities with my Haki training before I could eat any Devil Fruit though. Just because I was getting a Devil Fruit didn’t mean he was going to let me slack off here.</p><p><br></p><p>He then went on to explain the abilities and with his help I shortlisted some of the Devil Fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>After this, I asked Itachi, Hiruzen and Tobirama for help.</p><p><br></p><p>They might not know about Devil Fruits but they had extremely great battle sense and could utilise anything to their advantage in battle.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave them all the information about the Devil Fruits and finally chose the three fruits which I wanted to buy.</p><p><br></p><p>The first was the Logia Fruit, the Rumble Rumble Fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>It covered my speed, the natural logia’s immunity to normal physical attacks and gave me an incredible boost in my Observation Haki. While other Logia Fruits were good, none of them had the sheer versatility of the Rumble Rumble Fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>It had temperatures above both the Mago Mago no Mi and Mera Mera no Mi, speeds rivalling the Pika Pika no Mi and destructive power comparable or surpassing any of these and all these was not even mentioning the boost to the users Observation Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the fact that someone like Enel was able to become that strong with this Devil Fruit and only something like Luffy’s hack was able to defeat him and to be honest, even that was because Enel was an idiot and chose to fight Luffy in close quarters combat.</p><p><br></p><p>The fruit was rightfully called an Invincible power in the One Piece world.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, it was literally manipulating one of the fundamental forces of the world. How could it not be strong?</p><p><br></p><p>Choosing the Zoan was harder.</p><p><br></p><p>While there was obviously the best option with the Gomu Gomu no Mi or the Hito Hito no Mi Model: Nika, it had one very obvious <a href=\"https://problem….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">problem….it</a> was just too easy to be discovered.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my greatest requirements for my powers was the fact that they could be hidden from normal people.</p><p><br></p><p>The Nika fruit absolutely failed in that.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone could accidentally pull my cheek or even just pinch me hard or tug my arm and my secret could be out.</p><p><br></p><p>I dreaded thinking about such a situation and always staying alert was not something I wanted to deal with either.</p><p><br></p><p>So, with a great feeling of regret, I decided to give up on the ability.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, I chose the Uo Uo no Mi Model: Seiryu.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, it was Shanks who suggested this and I had laughed at the sheer irony of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, the Devil Fruit provided a great initial boost to my base stats, gave me a way to disguise myself using the Dragon form and Half Dragon form which wouldn’t be as fragile as the Transformation Jutsu either.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, it had fire breath and lightning attacks too. The fruit was really all around the best Zoan.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, Kaido had never really concentrated on developing his Devil Fruit ability. His Devil fruit wasn’t awakened either. Had he done that, Luffy’s fight would have turned out completely differently.</p><p><br></p><p>We did consider other options like Marco’s Phoenix Fruit and even Sengoku’s Buddha Fruit. The former was actually quite good considering it had a great self healing ability and even the power to heal others but I already planned to get the Logia’s attack immunity and such healing abilities could be bought from other places too.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, it wasn’t even close to being compared with Kaido’s Devil Fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>Last came the hardest choice, the Paramecia Devil Fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>This choice took us weeks….literal weeks to collect and analyse all the information we knew about the Devil Fruits and we were still stuck with more than one option to the end. There were just too many great options.</p><p><br></p><p>We had to eliminate them one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>First was the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi, Kuma’s Devil Fruit ability which was ridiculously useful. The only problem was that it made paw pads on the palms of the user….which I couldn’t afford, so it was out.</p><p><br></p><p>Second was the Ope Ope no Mi and while the ability was obviously awesome, it needed someone with great medical knowledge to use. I don’t think I could utilise it to its full capabilities so we gave it up as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Third was the Soul Soul Fruit, an incredibly useful ability but where would I keep the homies? Also, scaring and ripping out life from someone was not exactly my way of doing things.</p><p><br></p><p>Fourth was the Mirror Mirror Fruit which while still strong, had too many restrictions. I couldn’t carry mirrors in a battle.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also some others like the Moa Moa no Mi and the Gasha Gasha no Mi, all of which had one problem or the other.</p><p><br></p><p>We were finally left with two choices, the Zushi Zushi no Mi and the Gura Gura no Mi.</p><p><br></p><p>These two choices were so good that even after all the debates, we couldn’t decide which one to finally use.</p><p><br></p><p>One was one of the fundamental forces of nature, the control over Gravity while the other was the power to rip and tear anything, even air itself, the power which could destroy the world.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end, I made a coin toss to decide which one to choose and the result came to….Gura Gura no Mi.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s how I finally decided on all my Devil Fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>Next was collecting the points for these.</p><p><br></p><p>The Rumble Rumble Fruit cost 50 million points while the Nika Fruit cost 75 millions so my guess was that the other two would be around the same range as the Rumble Rumble Fruit.</p><p><br>At the rate I was going, it was going to take me another year or so to get one. Then again, I had enough time as it would obviously take me around that time, if not a bit more to draw the manga where Whitebeard is introduced and far more for the Seiryu Fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>The manga given by the System included the movies and anime only parts as well so the length of the manga was longer than their original versions so I had to work longer.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, a large part of my time goes to drawing Kaichou wa Maid-sama. I hope to complete it soon so that I can get some other manga.</p><p><br></p><p>I am still looking for a new publishing company to publish my story under a different pen name but I haven’t found anyone yet and one of the main reasons for that is my age.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san had agreed to give me a chance but not everyone would know about me or give me a chance.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to concentrate on the problem of points after the spar with Nurarihyon. Until then I can only concentrate on one thing.</p><p><br></p><p>My concentration was broken by the ringing of the bell.</p><p><br></p><p>Summer holidays had just ended and school had started once more. Life was returning to normal once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Letting out a deep sigh, I got up from my seat and left the classroom.</p><p><br></p><p>Near the gates of the school, Tobi and Sae were waiting for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobi had been admitted to the first year of Middle School this year and we were now going to the same school, something he was very happy with.</p><p><br></p><p>“I need to stop by the market and get some stuff for a school project.” Tobi said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. We can go that way then.” I nodded. “By the way, which club did you join?”</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“Ah….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Ah….it</a> was a close choice. Both the Kendo Club and Dance Club wanted Tobi. Apparently the teacher who oversees the Dance Club was present at the function where Tobi danced last year. She personally came and invited him.” Sae was the one who answered, making me smile and look at the blushing Tobi.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to be so shy. I personally think you would do good at both. There are no rules saying one cannot be a good dancer and swordsman at the same time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right! I told him that too but he joined the Kendo Club instead.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But I just did that Kagura because everyone put my name in without my permission and Nii-san was the one who taught me that. I don’t even know other dance styles. I wouldn’t do that well in the dance club.” Tobi protested and then looked down as he asked. “Did I do wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You would do well in whatever you want to work for. Don’t lose hope. Just do what you want. I will always support your decisions.” I patted his head. “So….I guess we have to up your training. You can’t even do the full Hinokami Kagura on your own and you want to become a swordsman? I will not let my brother be made fun of.” I finished making him go pale.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ehh….more training? No way!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, what should we set our next goal then? You can already run five kilometres so maybe we should set eight kilometres as the next goal and then slowly climb our way to ten kilometres….” I saw hope returning to his eyes before I finished. “in the next few months.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Impossible, that’s absolutely impossible. You are mad, Nii-san.” Tobi shook his head, making me laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, I am pretty sure you can do it, Tobi.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No way!”</p><p><br></p><p>We laughed louder.</p><p><br></p><p>Although I wasn’t joking at all.</p><p><br></p><p>As Grandma had said, I had given him the Uzumaki Bloodline and just to be on the safe side, I was planning to give him a One Piece bloodline too, probably the Monkey D. family or Shanks’ family’s bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>He was more than capable of taking such training quite easily so I planned to slowly increase his training in future.</p><p><br></p><p>With that thought, we walked towards the market talking to each other. </p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of Drawn to Power.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter was a bit heavy but I needed to get it off.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the plus side, Kimetsu no Yaiba is getting an anime made.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tatsuya encountered another Supernatural and got into trouble without even realising.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Seriously, the guy can’t even catch a break.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>With an entire gang of mermaids coming to Tokyo to look for him, what will happen?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Again, we are near Tatsuya’s first spar with Nurarihyon and we get to see the progress he has made.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>PS.

You all need to wait till the Guild level increases or someone quits the guild. Until then we can do nothing.” Shiroe replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know that’s not true. Some of the people in the Guild told us that there were still six slots left. There are only ninety four members in the guild currently. It means you can get six more people in.” Someone argued.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not wrong either.</p><p><br></p><p>Guild Members could see the list of names of the guild members at any point of time. It was part of the Guild chat system. It was simple information in the Guild menu.</p><p><br></p><p>It was easy to find that we had empty slots.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason we kept those was in case we got any team members or found any real life friends of the main team.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the group, I recognised several of them were the same people who were the first ones to leave. In fact, coincidentally, the one questioning Shiroe was the same guy who was asking what advantage we could give them for them to join our guild.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those slots are for private use.” Shiroe replied firmly.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean by private use? So you are just going to leave people out while there are obviously empty slots in the guild?” The guy argued back.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this opportunity to intervene. “Obviously not. That would be foolish.”</p><p><br></p><p>They all turned to look at me and on realising who I was, a smile formed on the guy’s face while Shiroe remained stoic.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave them my best smile and continued. “Not using things when we can….would be incredibly foolish, not to be a waste of resources.”</p><p><br></p><p>“See….that’s what I was saying.” He said looking back at Shiroe. “But some people are just too dumb to understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>It was during these times that I was somewhat grateful for my difficulty to show emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>It took significantly less effort to hide my annoyance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly….so tell me, what do you bring to the table?” I asked, looking at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” The guy was obviously not expecting this.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained. “Not using our resources is obviously foolish….but why should we use them on you?” I asked. “We have hundreds of people lining up to join our guild and will have thousands more in the future so….why should we give you the slot we have reserved for our main team members. What makes you so special? What can you contribute to the guild to warrant that kind of treatment?” I questioned in an even tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean? I want to join the guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….was that too many words for you? You are the same guy who was angry that we wouldn’t babysit anyone and asked us what advantages we could give you all. Then without waiting cursed us and left with your entire group.” I asked, looking at the group behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them turned their eyes away from me, not matching my gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now I am asking you….what advantage can you give us that other members of our guild cannot? In even simple words and pardon my language….who the fuck do you think you are?”</p><p><br></p><p>His mouth opened like a fish but no words came out of it. “I am an archer….” He tried to argue.</p><p><br></p><p>“And so are many others.” I replied, cutting him off immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see his stats.</p><p><br></p><p>T3 Level 6 Apprentice Archer.</p><p><br></p><p>It was decent but nothing to write home about.</p><p><br></p><p>Why the fuck was he even acting so arrogant?</p><p><br></p><p>By now the members of my guild had gathered outside too and all of them were listening to the argument.</p><p><br></p><p>Running my gaze over the crowd who were arguing with Shiroe, I spoke again. “You people seem to be forgetting something very simple here. Fairy Tail is <em>our</em> guild….not a public property. If we say there are no empty slots….there are no empty slots. End of the discussion. Or perhaps do you think you bunch are more special than the ones who lined up here for so long to sign their names up and then queued their names for when the guild expanded?”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the entire crowd become quiet, I finished my speech. “The recruitment of the guild will be carried out as per the rules we have set. The extra slots are a private matter of our guild. Thank you for your time.”</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards Shiroe. “Will you take care of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the crowd settled easily after this.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe and Star had decided that they will be staying in the second floor of the Guild Building till the matters of the guild were settled. This way they can save rent and invest in their equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we left the Guild Hall, it was already too late for us to cook so we ate our dinner at the Inn and left for our respective houses.</p><p><br></p><p>While eating at the Inn, we spotted one of Gareth’s men keeping an eye on us from a distance away. They didn’t approach us however so we didn’t approach them either.</p><p><br></p><p>As usual, we cleaned up and went to bed and it was then that Veena asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….any guesses about my identity?” She asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she really doing this again?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her, slightly wet hair, stunning face and figure and then I remembered her cunning from the evening where she practically ruined Dwain with just some words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….If you were to be a Supernatural being, I would say you would be….a nine tailed fox.” I guessed. “Charming and yet extremely cunning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, that’s quite the praise….but wrong unfortunately.” She laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I was quite sure about this one.” I smiled too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad. You can try again next week.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.” I rolled my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She just giggled at my reaction and hugged me and I allowed myself to fall asleep too.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure that we need to go out this early? It’s still dark outside.” Star said as we left the city through one of the back gates, dressed in black, at 4 in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have to do this to avoid people following us. This will be even more so now that people want to find out our so-called secret of levelling.” Shiroe said, making air quotes.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s better to avoid all the unnecessary drama.” I added.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what of the guild? Who will take care of the guild while we hunt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have asked some of my Herbalist friends from the Guild to keep an eye on things. If they need anything, they can just message us through the Guild Chat.”</p><p><br></p><p>We might have to hire some people to manage the guild when we go off to hunt. Another thing to think about later.</p><p><br></p><p>Managing a guild was not an easy task.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been three days since the Guild was formed and we spent most of the time hammering out the details but there was only so much one could do in three days.</p><p><br></p><p>An organisation needed a lot more time to get established and all of this was delaying our levelling time.</p><p><br></p><p>That was our main priority so we decided to take on some quests and leave for a levelling trip.</p><p><br></p><p>Coincidentally, the Knight’s Academy had issued some missions.</p><p><br></p><p>After the goblin raids, the defence of the province had been at an all time low.</p><p><br></p><p>This has caused many bandits to come out and attack the outskirts of several villages and hide.</p><p><br></p><p>We were given a mission to patrol certain areas and eliminate the bandits if we encountered them.</p><p><br></p><p>The quest was seven days long and at our current pace, we could cover the distance in three days but Shiroe had planned the route for us that would let us hunt in between.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the starting point.” I said as we reached the place to start. “Our job is to go from here to Brightwood Village and then to Redwick Village and then back to Llyne to report. Shiroe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright! We are going to go from this place to here and then cut back to Redwick. Arthas and Veena were originally from Redwick and according to the map we have and the information from him, there are no monsters above T3 in this area….or rather there weren’t. I have marked some places which could be possible bandit hideouts. A common factor between these places is that all these points are by the riverside. We need to be careful though. Bandits will be far more smart than goblins or other animals. We should be expecting traps. I guess we can count on Star to check those out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If things go well, we can get your Ranger quest done by the third day.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the past three days, Shiroe had gone out with Star to see his list of Skills and how to accommodate them in our team’s dynamics during the hunts.</p><p><br></p><p>In doing so, they had obtained the last bit of experience needed for him to get to Level 30. The next thing they did was going to the Black Market and finding a Class suitable for Star and the conditions to get it.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately that Class was T5 and he would need to become a T4 Ranger and T4 Swordsman for it.</p><p><br></p><p>He took the Ranger quest before leaving and we intend to complete it before we head back.</p><p><br></p><p>His quest was to track down a group of smugglers in the forests who have been selling illegal stuff in Llyne.</p><p><br></p><p>After some research we found the place to be between Redwick and Brightwood and that’s the reason we took this quest from the Knight’s Academy among all others of the same kind.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we are seeing how difficult it is to raise the classes at higher levels and it makes me realise how lucky I was that I was getting such great classes from the Traveller Achievements.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how many classes we have to level up to get higher Tier Classes and how much time that would take?</p><p><br></p><p>I need to keep on trying to get the Traveller Achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>I did notice something though.</p><p><br></p><p>Just saying something at random times does not activate the achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>The references have to be said at certain times and in different scenarios. This is what makes it harder to get the achievements so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>And with some more instructions, we proceeded forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Star was a hunter but he was also adept with Swords.</p><p><br></p><p>The Class he was aiming at will let him use both a small crossbow and swords, a perfect fit for his fighting style.</p><p><br></p><p>He was pretty skilled with the bow too. He used a crossbow unlike me.</p><p><br></p><p>It had a shorter range but hit harder.</p><p><br></p><p>All of us felt the decrease in load when he was covering our backs during the hunts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas pull back and heal, I will cover for you.” Shiroe shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I just smiled. I still hadn’t used my new skills yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Raising my sword above my head, I shouted. <em>‘For The Light!’</em></p><p><br></p><p>A flash of light fell on us as our HP went back to the green zone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy fuck!” I heard Shiroe shout.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, it’s Holy Light.” I joked before sending a Focus Strike at the monster in front of me, knocking it back again and taking a look at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe was grumbling but getting to work. Star was just laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena….well, she was checking herself with an amazed look on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arty, you ass. Is this what you were hiding?” Shiroe shrugged as the fight completed.</p><p><br></p><p>“One of them, yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You were really waiting for this, weren’t you? Do you know how much trouble it is to calculate the skill rotation timings? Just tell me about your other Skills already.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I just wanted to see your face.” I laughed.</p><p><br>“You are an ass.” He rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I obviously wouldn’t have done it in a dangerous situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, apart from this, I have a few more skills.” I explained my new Skills to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two Healing Skills. That’s insane. And it’s instant healing too. Until we get a Cleric, we can pull through with this. This, matched with your Dragon Skin Skill, Devotion Aura and the Limitless Skill, if we can get the last two pieces of that Blessed Sun Set, you would become a nigh Unkillable Tank.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Man….that Dwain guy really had no chance.” Star shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>We laughed a bit at it and then went out to hunt again.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Our team located the first bandit hideout on our second day.</p><p><br></p><p>From our scouting, we estimated about thirty three of them. Twenty three T2 and eleven T3 members.</p><p><br></p><p>“There could be more of them inside.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“They could have hostages.” I added.</p><p><br></p><p>“They could have people pretending to be hostages.” Veena warned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It will be harder to determine if the hostages are even hostages as they are all humans. Be careful and don’t get attacked from behind.” Shiroe warned.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensing someone approaching, we looked at the place to see Star coming back.</p><p><br></p><p>He was sent to scout for any other passageways that could lead to the cave.</p><p><br></p><p>“DId you find anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. The entrance at the front is the only entrance it seems. We don’t need to worry about them escaping from other sides.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. We start in an hour when they change the shift of the guards.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the entrance of the cave and at the bandits and a few scenes flashed in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The scenes of the day I met Veena for the first time and killed those players.</p><p><br></p><p>They were <a href=\"https://humans….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">humans….no</a>. They looked like humans. They were just data.</p><p><br></p><p>I was much more used to killing in all this time but we hadn’t hunted any humans before this.</p><p><br></p><p>Was I nervous?</p><p><br></p><p>It would be a lie to say I was completely fine….and yet, I wasn’t as worried as I thought I would be.</p><p><br></p><p>As we were thinking of this, something changed.</p><p><br></p><p>We heard some voices and looked in the direction to see three bandits coming towards the cave.</p><p><br></p><p>They weren’t alone though.</p><p><br></p><p>They were dragging three girls behind them and one of them was a player. A T2 Player, a Scribe to be exact.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only that, the leader of the three was at T4 a Bandit Leader.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at each other and decided to hear their conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a good haul you got there, Randal. Where did you find them?” One of the guards of the cave asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“These three were hunting for herbs in the forest. We were lucky to catch them while returning from our rounds. Look at this skin. They could entertain the boys. You all have worked hard in the raids after all hahahaha.” He said while grabbing one of the girls and forcibly caressing their cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at each other and no more words were needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost immediately, all of us got into position.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out my bow and arrow and both Star and I took aim while Shiroe and Veena prepared their spells as well.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, at the same moment all of us fired.</p><p><br></p><p>Star and I shot the two bandits with the T4 Guy at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Aim Eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The bandits were shocked at the sudden attack. The one whom I had hit actually died on spot as he was just T2 while the one hit by Star fell on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The bandit leader let the girl fall and tried to draw his sword but Shiroe was right behind us and used his new Skill, Thorn Bind Hostage, binding the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl who had fallen scrambled away from the three and that’s where Veena came in and used her Earth Wall spell to provide them some cover and hide them from the bandits. By then, I had put away my Bow and Arrow and drew my sword and shield and ran ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>Star gave me cover fire by using Aim Eyes on another Bandit, one of the guards. Shiroe’s and Veena’s spells came right after and fell on the other two guards.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound would attract the rest of the crowd so we have to finish it soon.</p><p><br></p><p>I directly headed towards the Bandit Leader and used my strongest Skill, Holy Blade, taking down a third of his hit points at once.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack also cut several of the vines of the Thorn Bind Hostage, taking down more of his HP.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t give him any reprieve and followed with another Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Double Slash.</p><p><br></p><p>All the vines binding him were cut and he barely had any HP left and fell down with just one more attack.</p><p><br>Damn.</p><p><br></p><p>The Man Slayer Class was really something against these types of enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have much time to awe at my skills as we were in the middle of a battlefield.</p><p><br></p><p>I went to the downed enemy next and sent two attacks on him and then went behind the Earth Wall and threw a few daggers from my inventory at them girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take this and finish off the one laying down there and hide behind the wall.” I ordered and went to the entrance of the cave.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe had used his Create Mist Skill inside the cave, making it hard for the bandits to see around.</p><p><br></p><p>This made my work easier as I was able to weave between them and attack them without much problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Star on the other hand was like a reaper reaping lives.</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure he was not using any Skills and yet all his attacks were all hitting vital points.</p><p><br></p><p>The Create Mist Skill didn’t interrupt the sight of the user and their teammates which made it an extremely useful Skill for crowd battles and with Shiroe’s brains, it made him a menace to face.</p><p><br></p><p>The weakness of the Skill is that the enemies can just walk out of the area of effect or any Mage with wind magic can blow it away.</p><p><br></p><p>The area is not that big at the earlier levels but for us, it was perfect in this scenario as the cave was already a closed space with a narrow opening and I doubted any of the bandits were able to use any wind magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next twenty five minutes, we fought continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>I personally took down twenty two of the enemies and my health was still in the green zone after using just Holy Light.</p><p><br></p><p>“The area is clear.” I shouted after going inside a bit and not seeing anything.</p><p><br></p><p>It took us 30 more minutes to check the whole place and we found several weapons, gold and other valuables there.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is much more than any normal raids we did so far.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was obvious, wasn’t it that we would get better loot when we take down other human enemies?” Star said while picking up some crossbow bolts we had gathered. “The quality is bad but it’s usable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can always sell these and get better stuff so gather everything.” Shiroe said while gathering even the smallest piece of armour.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls we had saved were given some medicine by Veena and were recovering.</p><p><br></p><p>The player was a girl called Elaine. She was going towards Llyne when she was kidnapped by these bandits along with two other girls and brought here.</p><p><br></p><p>And guessing from what we had heard, they were going to….</p><p><br></p><p>I know I had seen the same done by Goblins in that cave but perhaps it was wishful thinking that I was expecting that such kind of things will not be done to players.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. The bandits on this route have been cleared. You can go ahead safely to Llyne.” I said and the girls agreed after some thought.</p><p><br></p><p>We escorted them to the road towards Llyne.</p><p><br>“If you need any help in Llyne, you can visit the Knight Academy or the Fairy Tail Guild and ask for us. I will inform someone to show you around.” Veena said as she offered the girls some money and then looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood her intentions and sent a Guild Invite to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me in surprise but accepted it nonetheless and bowed to thank me.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that the girl used formal etiquette generally used by those old families. I had visited some of them due to my dad’s business and could recognise this.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, Veena also had similar traits but they were more….imperial than hers. Like she was used to being in a position of power while Elaine was more like she was some kind of attendant.</p><p><br></p><p>As the girls went their own way, the rest of us gathered to go over the battle.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe and Veena had gained one level each while Star was levelling his Apprentice Swordman Class and gained two levels. I….I gained only 20% exp for the current level.</p><p><br></p><p>“This was….quite underwhelming.” Veena finally broke the silence as she started the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Even at the end, I was waiting for some kind of Boss fight but it seems that the Boss was taken down by Arty at the very start. That first attack was insane. Just how much attack do you have?” Star asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have a 50% boost in damage against human and half human species. That’s the trait of the Man Slayer Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“50%! Damn….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still this is beyond my expectations. I was expecting things to be easier but not <em>this</em> easy.” Shiroe said, straightening his glasses.</p><p><br></p><p>“We didn’t even need any consumables for the entire battle.” Veena added.</p><p><br></p><p>“It might be because we suddenly got a large increase in power during the raids. We shouldn’t rush to face anything more until we get used to it.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>We thought about it and his words did have a point. This increased strength could just be something we haven’t gotten used to yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we decided to wait and see till the end of this quest and then decide.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing changed.</p><p><br>We fought for the next three days, even did the Ranger quest for Star and yet, nothing changed.</p><p><br></p><p>The enemies were just too weak.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we were done with the quest, all of us were of the same mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It was too easy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe we should increase the difficulty a bit. Our team can take down T2 and T3 enemies very easily.”<br><br></p><p>“Alright, then it’s decided. We go to more dangerous areas after Star gets his Ranger Class.” I spoke up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sounds good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t see why not.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We returned back to Llyne by the fourth day.</p><p><br></p><p>In this time, I had gained only one level and 70% experience for the next level, Shiroe and Veena had gained three levels while Star was actually the one who benefited the most, being the lowest level.</p><p><br></p><p>He gained eight levels in the Apprentice Swordsman Class.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached Llyne when it was already late at night so we cleaned up and went directly to bed.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, sleeping together had become almost natural to us. In fact, the time we had spent outside these last four days were the days I had difficulty sleeping alone.</p><p><br></p><p>We generally carried tents with us.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had a separate tent while we, the boys, had another tent of our own.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what story are we hearing today?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently, it has become a habit for us.</p><p><br></p><p>She used to tell me stories of the Supernatural world….and she was extremely good with it. So good in fact that I was starting to wonder if her stories were actually real.</p><p><br></p><p>The details in them were so clear and the way she said those were just too realistic.</p><p><br></p><p>“How about the story of Georg Faust and Mephistopheles?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I have heard the short version of that.”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled at my words and started her story and I listened to her intently.</p><p><br></p><p>About an hour later, she came to the end of the story.</p><p><br></p><p>“Unlike what most people believe and what is told in the human version of the story, Faust and Mephisto became very good friends….so much so that the old devil considered him his best friend even and even now watches over his legacy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her emotions as she completed the story, I couldn’t help but ask. “What kind of beings are devils?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, interested in devils, are we?”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, let’s say they are like humans….with wings and magic and all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled at my confused expression. “What, did you believe all devils were bad and all angels are nice?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….that’s what I have been hearing since childhood. It does make an impression.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the ceiling of the house.</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils, just like humans, have different kinds of people. There are bad ones and there are good ones. To unilaterally say that all of them are bad and all angels and their father are good would be a lie. After all, Lucifer himself was an angel….and want to know a fun fact?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” I looked at her curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“People have killed more in the name of God than in the name of the Devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The simple smile she had when she said that was….chilling. Even more so when people realise that her words….might not be false after all.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not saying all devils are good people. No. Some of them are bad, cruel and remorseless but then again, aren’t humans also the same? The supernatural world is the same. It’s not black and white….but shades of grey everywhere. Even this place is the same. I don’t want you to believe my words….but see for yourself. Observe, understand, think and decide for yourself how you feel about everything and what you want to do with everything. This is something that will help you everywhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had some questions for her but when I looked at her and saw the lost look on her face, I didn’t disturb her and just nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t speak much but after some time, she turned towards me and hugged me and I knew that the time for stories was over and she wanted to sleep for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>I was however left with several thoughts of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>Was the Supernatural world real?</p><p><br></p><p>And if so….what was she?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know….but when I thought about it deeply….would it really matter what she was inside the game?</p><p><br></p><p>She was still Veena and that was all that mattered to me.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first person I had trusted in this world and she had never once let me down. I think she deserves at least this much courtesy from my side as well.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Elaine -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She completed the paperwork for the quests submitted by the last guild member for the day and stretched on her chair, thinking how she got here.</p><p><br></p><p>Being separated from Arthur and Kuroka was not something she was expecting as she entered the game.</p><p><br></p><p>This however didn’t break her confidence.</p><p><br></p><p>They had a goal and she was going to do her best to achieve it.</p><p><br></p><p>Ley Fay could be in trouble somewhere and she needed to find her as quickly as she could. Arthur would be doing the same so she couldn’t give up.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, she faced this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Although the more information she collected, the more doubts appeared in her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>They were already quite late….several months even. Was Ley Fay still safe?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this….could this even be called a game anymore?</p><p><br></p><p>This was a whole new world of its own.</p><p><br></p><p>Her time in the Redwick Village had been quite uneventful.</p><p><br></p><p>The animals in the forest around her had provided her with enough experience to level up her Villager Class.</p><p><br></p><p>She had already found out the way to get the Mage class and follow the route, she had taken the Scribe Class next and started working.</p><p><br></p><p>There were however not many jobs for Scribes in Redwick.</p><p><br></p><p>It was even more so due to the bandit attacks which had left the place ransacked and destroyed several shops.</p><p><br></p><p>Although no players had died, several villagers had lost their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>The beginner’s village, the safe zone….wasn’t as safe anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>She asked around to find the solution for her problems and some of the NPCs she had helped had been quite helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>She found out that there would be more chances for her to not only earn money but also level up her class in relative peace in the nearest town, Llyne.</p><p><br></p><p>Not one to wait and waste her time, Elaine had gathered her belongings and bought supplies for the journey and left the town with few other people who were going to Llyne to sell their own products.</p><p><br></p><p>But it seemed as if her luck had decided to betray her at that moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Their group was attacked by bandits.</p><p><br></p><p>They were no match for the leader.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a T4….</p><p><br></p><p>Just how do you even get something like that outside the beginner’s village?</p><p><br></p><p>They had killed the two men in the group and captured the three girls including her.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a deep pit formed inside Elaine’s stomach at the turn of events.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what were they planning to do?</p><p><br></p><p>This game….would it really go in that direction?</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of thoughts ran through her mind as they were dragged through the forest to the hideout of the bandits and that’s where her worst thoughts came to life.</p><p><br></p><p>From their words, she could understand what they were planning as a chill ran down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p>She was not going to take it lying down. She would fight them even if it meant death than face such an ending.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as she was preparing to face them with her life on line and probably intending to die to escape the ending….two arrows shot out of the trees and pierced two of the bandits with the leader. The very next seconds, magical vines shot out from the ground and bound the leader.</p><p><br></p><p>What came next was no less than a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>One man….just one man, a player at that, butchered that T4 Bandit Leader with just a couple of attacks and then proceeded to butcher every one of the bandits outside.</p><p><br></p><p>She had seen such scenes in the real world. In fact, Arthur could do so easily but inside this game….she hadn’t seen anyone this strong yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Her doubts were cleared when she came to Llyne and found the identity of her saviours.</p><p><br></p><p>The guild master of the Fairy Tail Guild, the first Guild established by any player in the game….a T5 Player and perhaps the strongest player in the game right now….Arthas.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow, his misadventure had turned around and become a lucky encounter for her and now she was part of the Fairy Tail guild, working as a bookkeeper for the Guild, a place where she could steadily level up her Scribe Class, stay safe, gain extra experience and even some money for her living without putting herself in any danger.</p><p><br></p><p>This luck….Elaine was determined to not let it go to waste.</p><p><br></p><p>She was going to use this opportunity to succeed in her goals and reunite with Arthur and Ley Fay and get out of this place….together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shiroe -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the people across the table from them.</p><p><br></p><p>The place and scene were the same, even the people were the same as one week ago and yet things had changed completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Last time they had been on the backfoot and yet this time they had the initiative.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wasn’t expecting you to call me, Mr. Gareth.” He said, lying through his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>They were just waiting for this and just like it was predicted, the other side had contacted them in one week.</p><p><br></p><p>Gareth looked a bit miffed but took another look at his teammates before looking at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are here for a trade.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The two pieces of the Blessed Sun Set for three hundred and fifty thousand gold coins.” He said after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Three hundred and fifty thousand was still more than the expected price of the two pieces, even with the set effect.</p><p><br></p><p>However it was not him but Veena who spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however both Shiroe and Arthas had left making deals to Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>She seemed to have experience in these sorts of things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three hundred and fifty thousand is a bit too much for us. I am afraid we cannot go any further than two hundred thousand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh knock it off. Everyone knows you won a buttload of gold from Dwain.” The man replied gruffly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Mr. Dwain was kind enough to give us some funds. Too unfortunate what happened to him. But as you might have heard, we have started a new Guild and all our funds have been invested in the said Guild. We hardly have any funds left for other trades.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always borrow.” He asked and Shiroe had the urge to roll his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>As if any of his team members would ever fall for that trap after seeing what happened to Dwain.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not possible either. We have also taken loans and invested it in the Guild.” She lied with her smile not faltering even one bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then, what’s your budget?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can afford two hundred thousands at best if we push it.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s too low.” Gareth shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>She just shrugged. “Maybe….but we don’t exactly have any urgent need for the two pieces.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” The man was taken aback by the statement from Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>She kept her smile and explained. “I think you are missing the point here. Even without those pieces, our team is by far the strongest team in this town. If anything, we are having difficulty finding stronger enemies here. We are in no hurry to buy the two pieces.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You mean you would just let that 10% bonus on attack and defence go? Don’t bluff in front of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe, what makes you think I am bluffing? To begin with, we were not the ones who initiated this meeting. Why would you think we are dying for the two pieces? I won’t lie that it would be helpful for us but it’s not worth putting ourselves under debt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This price is already a lot lower than before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Than before….maybe. But….that’s not how business works, Mr. Gareth. Business works on supply and demand. Sure you have supply right now, but you have no demand for the items.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gareth narrowed his eyes. “Do you think we cannot sell these items?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh sure you could….but no one would pay you the price you are looking for. I mean sure Dwain and his team could have bought it for the three piece set effect….but now that’s not an option either. If you sell it to anyone else other than us, they won’t get any set effect and you will have to sell it for the price of a normal item, which would be lower than what we are offering. You already know that two hundred thousand is already a good price….the best you can get….so why don’t we cut the games here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We could always use it ourselves.” He threatened.</p><p><br></p><p>She returned a smile in response to his threat. “Obviously but….I don’t think you are that stupid. Would you really let go of a good deal for your pride? If so then I would be mistaken in my assessment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s enough. We have no deal. Two hundred thousand is very low. The lowest we can go is three hundred thousand and six guild slots for all our team members with a guarantee that you will not remove us from the guild.” Gareth offered.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe raised an eyebrow and was about to speak but someone else spoke first.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not possible.” Arthas rejected the offer resolutely. </p><p><br></p><p>“Why? It’s not a bad deal for you. Five places in the guild would just cost you five thousand gold coins and still have more than one year's worth of money from the five of us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas rolled his eyes. “What you are asking for is not just the matter of money. It would imply that whatever you do, we will not have the power to kick you out. This not only gives you the power to implicate us, drag our reputation down the mud at will or even incite discontent in our guild. I am not going to give anyone that kind of power in my guild. If you break the rules, you get kicked. That’s the first and foremost rule of my guild. I will not negotiate on that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are making a hard bargain here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not even in the mood to bargain. It’s you who has called us here for all this.” Arthas replied, unphased.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we have nothing to discuss. This is our final offer.” Gareth got up with his teammates and got ready to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that Veena spoke. “And is that the decision of your whole team?” She asked, looking at the other members of the team, especially the one who had won the helmet.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at her and she continued. “It would seem I was indeed mistaken in my assessment. You are asking for the impossible and in doing so rejecting a great deal offered to you. Do you realise that by doing so, you are not only making a loss yourself but also for your team members? Are your teammates also willing to let go of the deal for your pride alone?”</p><p><br></p><p>His team members looked at her with narrowed eyes while the guy himself glared at her. “What exactly are you insinuating here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I am just saying that at this point of the game, two hundred thousand gold coins is a huge sum which could take you months to earn. It could help equip your entire team with better equipment and allow you to buy consumables which might potentially save your lives. You might not know this but the surrounding areas are infested with bandits now and any of those teams have T4 Bandit Leaders in them. They are different from any goblins. They are cunning and can use any trick to take you down. Are you sure you want to face them with sub-standard equipment? You do know that one Healing Pill or one good piece of armour could be the difference between life and death for people.” She added.</p><p><br></p><p>Gareth’s team members shifted a bit at her words and looked at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“And even if we forget that, what’s to say that another large scale quest might pop up any day. Will you let your team be under equipped because of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Wow….she was really good with her words. Shiroe could see Gareth’s team members, the same people who hadn’t said one word since the meeting started, throwing looks at him.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was about to say something when one of his team members put a hand on his shoulders. “Gareth….we should talk a bit first.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gareth looked at the guy incredulously. “Keith, are you falling for this woman’s….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s discuss things once more, Gareth.” Messer, the guy who won the helmet said.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious Messer?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am….” Messer looked at Shiroe and his team. “Just give us some time.”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena smiled at him and nodded. “Sure. Why not? Take your time.”</p><p><br></p><p>They left the inn for some time and when they returned, they made a counter offer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two hundred and fifty thousand gold coins with slots in the guild for five members of his team.”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena spoke at this time. “Two hundred and twenty thousand and only if you all agree to follow the rules of the Guild. No special treatment will be given to you for all that you haven’t earned but you can rest assured that you won’t be discriminated against either. While we still stand by the point of kicking anyone who breaks the rules of the guild, you will not be kicked without any reason after the trade is completed if that’s what you are worried about.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other and finally nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s how the whole thing went.” Shiroe completed narrating the whole meeting to Star.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, that’s why they are suddenly in the guild now. If I am honest, I didn’t think you would recruit him. You did say to put him in the reserve list after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas sighed. “That was my plan but Veena convinced me otherwise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It would have been a huge waste, you see.” Veena explained. “It is beyond doubt that Gareth and his friends are good players, among the best in this town. A Guild levels up when its members complete quests. Right now, we have mostly production class members and very few of them venture in the fields. This means that they can only do selected types of quests which in turn reduces the speed of our guild levelling up.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took a sip of water and continued. “ We have established the first guild in the game, which means we are ahead of several others. If we want to keep this lead up, we need to have a good speed of levelling the guild level too. For that we need more players who do quests….players like Gareth. Obviously, that doesn’t mean we can allow them to do whatever they want in the guild. I wholly agree with Arthas’ decision of following the rules to the letter. For an organisation to run smoothly, especially in this kind of world, we need a strict set of guidelines and a leadership who will enforce it properly. This is something that cannot be compromised with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed. And it’s not like we had some big grudge with them.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, let’s leave all those topics for later. First things first, did you get any information on where we could hunt monsters suitable for our levels? Things are getting slower.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe rolled his eyes. “If anyone else hears you, they would probably beat you up….or at least try to. You are gaining one level every two days or so on average at T5. That’s already insane.”</p><p><br></p><p>I scratched my head sheepishly while the guy continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I get your point. The areas around Llyne are not as challenging anymore. We need to go further. I did ask around and found three areas.” He brought out a map and spread it on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>“The northern mountains are full of T4 and T5 creatures. If we cross it, we can enter the Elven territories. Currently the Elves have a ceasefire treaty with the Kingdom and do not interfere with each other’s territories so the other side of the Northern Mountains are out. The Southern Marshlands have plenty of animals of high levels but most of them are poisonous and marshlands are hard to fight in so it’s out too till we have more members. Finally, we have the Western Forests. The inner area of the forest has plenty of T4 and T5 animals and if we follow the river, we could even reach the other side of the forest to the city of Lannisport. This is a port city which is also under the Greenfrost territory.”</p><p><br></p><p>And here he looked at us. “From what I have heard, there is an island a little distance from there which has some good stuff for sale once in a while, especially in the black market auctions. It’s not under the jurisdiction of the kingdom and that place is almost independent and even pirates sell their loot there so there is stuff from other kingdoms and continents there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, what’s the name of the place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sabaody Archipelago.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He wouldn’t…?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh who was I kidding? He obviously would.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy made an entire system based on memes….what’s another few references from anime?</p><p><br></p><p>Still that means, I could probably get chances of using some references there and gain more skills.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of stuff are we talking about?” Star asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything. Apparently, that place literally sells anything which money can buy. Weapons, recipes, skill books, medicines, armour….even people of different races. As long as you have money, you can buy anything there. That place is often visited by nobles from different kingdoms especially for the auctions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it looks like you already know where we are going then.” I smiled and looked at others.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am fine with it.” Star shrugged at the suggestion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, I haven’t been to the beach in a long time.” Veena smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, it’s decided then.”</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to go there after collecting some more funds.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, between the four of us, we have around one million and two hundred thousand gold coins but who knows how much things would cost there.</p><p><br></p><p>This did however push our plans to buy another building in Llyne on the side for now.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came the topic of the new members. We still needed some other classes in our team like a healer and a supporter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Healer is the most important and Supporters like Bards are incredibly hard to play. They have little to no attack power at the start so we will probably have to train them by ourselves.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have anyone in mind?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I do.” He nodded. “Remember the girl we saved, Elaine?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, she is training to become a mage. I have seen her play when she asked me for some advice and she has a good sense of conserving her MP in a fight. I think she had the potential to be trained into a good healer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would she though?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will try to talk to her. I have heard a lot of good things about her from Clarissa.” Veena said.</p><p><br></p><p>Clarissa was her friend who takes care of the administrative side of the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She was hired as the Bookkeeper for the guild and is doing the job well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great, then Veena can talk to her and see if she agrees.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then we start our next trip in three days. I don’t want to delay our levelling for long.” I finished.</p><p><br></p><p>Sabaody Archipelago….please don’t there be any World Nobles….or I might just kill someone.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of Soul Art Online.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter was a bit slow.

Believe me, I ….”</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh and my heart sank and then she looked at Lavinia and me. “She sleepwalked into your bed, didn’t she?”</p><p><br></p><p>“….huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She has the habit of sleepwalking into other people’s rooms. She did the same with Brandish and me.” Sakura sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhh, Sakura-chan….good morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t walk around into other people’s rooms, Lavy. Please get dressed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….but I was feeling cold and Sil-kun looked so warm….”</p><p><br></p><p>….don’t talk, please don’t talk.</p><p><br></p><p>You are making the situation worse.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not a good enough reason, Lavy. You should only sleep with the guy you like.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But I like Sil-kun.” She said with a tilt of her head as if stating the obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>Say what….when did that happen?</p><p><br></p><p>Why don’t I know about this?</p><p><br></p><p>However before I could say anything else she continued. “And I like Sakura-chan and Brandish-chan. That’s why I sleep with you all.”</p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I just stared at her, observing her with all my Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Was Lavinia Reni….just that simple of a girl?</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s good….but did you ask Silas-san for permission before getting into his bed? While you might not mind, he could have a problem right?” Sakura explained patiently.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was the younger of the two and yet it looked like she was the older in this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ehh, you don’t like me, Sil-kun?” She looked at me surprised, almost hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback at suddenly being thrown under the bus.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….? It’s not like that….I mean sure….what again?”</p><p><br></p><p>Not sleeping properly last night along with the weirdness of the situation was taking its toll on my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, he said he likes me too.” She smiled brightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura looked at her and let out a sigh. “I see. In that case, get ready. We are having breakfast soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright~”</p><p><br></p><p>“And please dress up properly before leaving the room.” Sakura interrupted before going forward and buttoning her shirt up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sakura-chan. You’re the best.” Lavinia hugged Sakura tightly before looking at me. “Sil-kun, would you like to take a bath together?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I want to bathe alone today.” I replied, controlling the twitching of my lips and inner reluctance about the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I needed time to understand what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, too bad. Next time then.” She waved at me and left the room and I looked at Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to explain anything, Silas-san. Lavy….she….didn’t mean anything bad. She….just had an unusual upbringing.” She continued after a moment of thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah….”</p><p><br></p><p>She then walked towards me. “And I know you won’t ever do anything bad to anyone. I trust you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“….thank you. It’s just that the situation looked too….”</p><p><br></p><p>“It didn’t look that bad, you know. If anything, I would have thought you two got together rather than you doing something bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That….makes far more sense.” I said after a moment of thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should trust yourself more, Silas-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her words and looked down….suddenly realising that I was just in my underwear with an erection. “I….thank you but I need to go to the bath. Excuse me.” I hurriedly left the room, pulling myself out of the awkward situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Although I think I heard a chuckle behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Breakfast was surprisingly normal.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia showed no signs of the morning’s incident and acted as if everything was normal.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few days, I would find out what Sakura had meant. Lavinia really was such a simple minded girl. It turns out that the people of that magician’s group didn’t teach her things which would be considered common sense for normal girls. That woman really just wanted to research her Sacred Gear and nothing more. </p><p><br></p><p>Not to say that she was a fool. She just had a very….different sense of privacy.</p><p><br></p><p>Although apart from this, Lavinia was a very sweet and honest girl who we all loved.</p><p><br></p><p>In those days, she had wandered into my room twice in the middle of the night, wearing my shirt and sleeping by my side quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>After the first few times, especially seeing that even Sakura was not bothered by this, I gave up caring and just got used to it. I mean it’s not like I hated having a cute girl cuddle with me at night.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Ice Devil Slayer Magic?” I asked, looking at the book in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This is the perfect magic for you. The Demon Seed inside you is something produced in the bodies of the users of Devil Slayer Magic over time as they use this magic. It then changes their magic slowly to have a more demonic flavour and when it finally blooms, the user becomes a Devil. But your case is different. You are already a devil so it will most likely just empower you.” August explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” I nodded as I looked at the book. “Should I keep something in mind when learning this magic?”</p><p><br></p><p>In humans, this magic changes the flavour of their magic and due to this, sometimes the personality of the user changes. They become more predisposed to….indulging themselves.” He said after some thought. “Though, that is quite unlikely to happen in your case as your magic is already demonic.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy assured me and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“His Majesty told me that your body was not producing demonic power on its own and that’s why you were dying. Now, your body has far more demonic power but we can always work on improving your reserves. This magic will be the best choice for you to take advantage of your innate qualities. You shouldn’t let this chance go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I’ll learn it.”</p><p><br>Over the next few hours, August explained the magic to me in detail and I got to use some of the spells and surprisingly, the spells came almost naturally to me.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, it was even faster than with Ice Magic. Even without using Sage, I could feel a strange familiarity with the magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this what August meant when he said this magic was perfect for me?</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, this magic is best learned in combat and so we sparred for a while and in all that time, I couldn’t even put  some dust on his cloak.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was seriously a master of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“So how are your magic studies coming along, Silas-kun?” Hayato-san asked me as I finished preparing their orders and sat in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru, Saitama and Ainz were playing games as usual in their own corner. We had renovated one side of the Restaurant so that people could gather there and people coming to the Restaurant don’t start off by seeing Ainz’s face the first thing when they enter the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san was also present and enjoying his usual dangos.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid-kun was sitting with the rest and watched as Touma trained his stances under the guidance of Kensei-san with a few comments from Bang-san, Atomic Samurai and Issac-san on the nearby table.</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing. Learning magic is wonderful. It’s like exploring a completely different world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey Nii-san, show us some cool magic you have learned. Tohru-chan can use some really cool magic too. Which ones can you do?” Naruto asked, jumping excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I don’t think I can do anything close to Tohru’s magic but I will try.” I thought of something and walked to the corner of the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura had put some plants here and often took care of them.</p><p><br></p><p>It made the place look much brighter.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up a flower from the plant and brought it to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“See.” With a slight push on my magic, the entire flower turned to ice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Woah. That’s so cool. It looks like an ice-cream. Can we eat it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, you don’t eat frozen flowers, Naruto.” Miu scolded.</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed at their antics and gave the flower to Naruto to play with.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I did this, I felt another gaze from my side. Looking in the direction, I saw Kanna giving me those cute dragon eyed looks again.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want one too?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>With a chuckle, I picked another flower and did the same, making another flower of ice for Kanna.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here.” I gave the flower to Kanna and patted her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I got my own.” She showed the flower to Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna stared at her flower and suddenly without any warning, she bit off the flower, eating it completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah! She ate it.” Naruto shouted pointing a finger at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna looked smugly at him. “Silly Naruto. If you don’t ask Silas for permission, he won’t be able to deny you.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>That’s not how it works….dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked as if he was enlightened at the words while Miu was still understanding the situation before she could begin her lecture.</p><p><br></p><p>The two kids were already done with the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s smart, Kanna-chan. Wanna play.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>And with that both of them ran out to play on their own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, Kanna!” Miu shouted as she bowed towards me and ran after the two kids quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are getting along quite well. I was worried how she would adapt to living with you all.” I said looking at Hayato.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha Kanna-chan is adorable. I feel like I have another granddaughter now. And yes, they squabble among themselves and when they get tired, they play together. They even play pranks together. I think both of them are getting along quite well. I think Kanna-chan was just missing a friend to play with and Naruto is happy with someone his age to play with too. Normally the kids at his school are good but he cannot tell them about this magic stuff so Kanna came in as a welcome change.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am glad that they are getting along.”</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a month since the attack on the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>A few things had changed since then.</p><p><br></p><p>First, Lavinia decided to leave the place she was working at previously and started working here.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she went there today to meet some Va-kun person who is like a little brother to her as well as formally resign from the organisation.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, after a month-long investigation, there were no more supernatural people in this area.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the details, we would only know that when Lavinia returned with the latest information.</p><p><br></p><p>Third was that our assessment for Jujutsu Sorcery was decided and was set two months later. This was done because many students were scheduled to be promoted and there was a shortage of examiners for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to get some sort of in with the Supernatural world to know more. Until now, the only things I knew were the things I had learned from Tobio’s friends and Lavinia….which was quite basic.</p><p><br></p><p>My world had all the mythicals creatures I had heard about in stories, literally every pantheon ever. The Supernatural beings numbered in millions….even billions in total although most of them live in different dimensions connected to this world.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the Underworld was real.</p><p><br></p><p>Not a surprise considering I was a devil and all.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not all.</p><p><br></p><p>The Underworld was not exactly hell although there were apparently several different hells in this world all watched over by the respective pantheons. The Underworld was instead a place where different races, predominantly Devils and Fallen Angels lived.</p><p><br></p><p>The Devil side was ruled by four Devil Kings, Lucifer, Leviathan, Beelzebub and Asmodeus and had an entire government of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fallen Angel side on the other hand were angels who had fallen from grace. They looked like Angels but with black wings and one could guess their strength from the number of wings they had. The higher the number of wings, the stronger they are.</p><p><br></p><p>They are ruled by an organisation called the Grigori.</p><p><br></p><p>The Angels led by their Father, Devils and the fallen Angels fought in a three way war called the Great War and they have been in a state of cold war since then….that said, their relationship is….complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the reasons I kept my identity a secret from everyone as they could target me if they knew there was a devil in this area.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was working with the Magician Organisation called the Grauzaberer under Mephisto Pheles, the same one from the stories and she was sent to work with the people of Grigori against a common enemy of sorts.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizards of Oz were originally magicians of Grauzaberer who separated from them and created another magician organisation of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>Their terrorist activities led both the sides to cooperate and hunt them together.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t get to see their full power as Ainz and Zeref took care of them quite early but apparently that woman was quite strong. She could have easily burned down the whole town and yet she was nothing compared to the actual monsters out there.</p><p><br></p><p>It all sounded like the plot of some manga or light novel to be honest but hey….I was a devil….what else could I say?</p><p><br></p><p>“You know, you will have to encounter them one day. From what Lavinia said, Devils apparently live for thousands of years and none have died from ageing yet. The chances of you not encountering anyone from the Supernatural side….is nigh impossible.” Rimuru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, the best you can do is train and prepare.” Ainz added. “We need to schedule the training trip soon. What about your schedules? Can’t you find one week in between?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be free starting next week.” Rimuru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, by the way, how did your date go?” I asked, looking at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure I saw a blush on his face. “That….yeah, it was good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….just that? Give us the details man.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing much. We just went on a long drive. Shizuka-san is a very good driver. Then we had dinner. The year-end vacations are coming to an end soon so she will have to prepare for the new students starting next week.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about you Saitama?” I asked the last guy who had been quiet from the start.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ughh, I need to study.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is also a theory exam for the Hero Association entrance. It determines my rank too. I need to study for it for the exam in three months. Bang-san provided me with the books for them. You guys can go ahead with the trip.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked like he had sucked a lemon.</p><p><br></p><p>I patted his shoulder. “Are you sure? We can always go when all of us are free.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah. You need this more now. I think you three should go first. I will join next time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Saitama is not wrong, Silas. You need to get some real combat training. You should free some time in your schedule and come with us. We will be hunting in the Jura Forest. There are plenty of dangerous monsters there. We could get some serious training done there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I will. Sakura could stay with Lavinia at Zeref’s place and continue their studies. And August did tell me that I would need to learn my new magic in combat so hunting in the wild could help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great! Then the three of us can go on our hunting trip next week.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will take care of things on my side too.” Ainz nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“It's decided then. Now….” Rimuru turned towards me. “What's the deal with you and the new girl?”</p><p><br></p><p>All three of them suddenly turned towards me and looked at me intently. The light in Ainz's eyes turning brighter at the sudden topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh come on. Don't give me that act. You two are acting all chummy with each other. What's the deal? Are you cheating on Sakura-chan?” Rimuru asked and Ainz nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“The hell are you talking about? There is nothing of that sort going on between Sakura and me. As for Lavinia….it’s….well, it’s complicated.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Complicated?”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and explained the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lucky bastard!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Screw you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama just stared at me without any comment and then looked back at his console.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi you two. Aren’t you going out with Shizuka-san? And don’t you have an army of Maids and Guardians fawning over you? Why are you suddenly getting pissed at me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? What does that have to do anything? This is our right. You got a new girlfriend and your old girlfriend doesn’t mind. Isn’t that a harem? You are becoming one of those harem protagonist bastards. Obviously we will be jealou….pissed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right.” Ainz nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not like that. At least I don’t think it’s like that….maybe. Honestly, even I am confused with the mixed signals.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, I don’t think the signals could be any clearer. Those two girls like you….lucky bastard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. Even my own extensive experience tells me the same.” Ainz nodded sagely.</p><p><br></p><p>“What experience? Where did you even get the experience from?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously from Manga, Novels and Visual Novels.” He answered unabashed. “This situation is a classic harem novel plot. There is absolutely no doubt.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>It’s useless arguing about this with these guys.</p><p><br></p><p>My rescue arrived in the form of a new customer.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a young man of average height with spiky black hair and grey eyes. He was wearing a track suit of sorts. Maybe he was out for a run.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh, was there a Restaurant here yesterday?” He spoke to himself looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and went to the kitchen while Tohru took his order.</p><p><br></p><p>“An order of Chicken Ramen and Salad.” Sakura gave me the order and I got down to work.</p><p><br></p><p>The new guy was talking to the people of the Restaurant in the meantime.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I could hear, the guy’s name was Ikki Kurogane and he was a student of the Hagun Academy in Tokyo.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, no idea what place that was so he was obviously from a different world. Another version of Japan.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was talking to the Martial Arts masters when I took the orders out and he looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Shop owner, are you really from a different world? Can this place really connect between different worlds?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Depends. If we are not from the same world, then yes I am from a different world. Why don't you tell me something about your world so that I can take a guess. Oh, start with your name. My name is Silas Evans, by the way.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"My name is Ikki Kurogane. I am from Hagun Academy for Mage-Knights in Tokyo. Nice to meet you, Mr. Silas.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. Yes, we are not from the same world, Ikki. First, this shop is in Kyoto and second, I haven't heard of any Hagun Academy or Mage-Knights in my world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What? Kyoto? Really?\" The boy asked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you know of the Parallel World Theory? We are from two different worlds with similar places.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Parallel Worlds huh. That’s an interesting way to look at it.” Kisuke-san came up and said. “Quite possible too, seeing that there are so many similarities between several of our worlds.” he then looked at Ikki and spoke. “So, can you tell me something about your world?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, yes.\" He then went on to explain about his world, Blazers, Devices, Mage-Knights and the bullshit surrounding the world.</p><p><br></p><p>“This Mage Knight Academy thing sounds a bit like Cid-kun’s Dark Knight Academy, right.” I said as we looked at Cid-kun who was suddenly caught off guard at my comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“In structure, yes but we don’t have anything like devices. There are artefacts though but they are extremely rare and I cannot imagine every student in the Academy owning one personally.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, Devices are not exactly something we can buy. They are weapons which a Blazer can manifest from their souls, the crystallisation of Magic Power which can be used in battle. It varies between user to user and can be anything from Holy Swords, Demonic Swords, Bows, Knives or even different types of tools.” Ikki explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Manifestation of souls, you say.” Kisuke-san asked and I could see the mad scientist look in his eyes. “You said you were a student of the Mage Knight Academy. If so then you must be a Blazer too, right? If I am not being too invasive, can we see your device?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I don’t see why not.” He held his hand in front of him and made a motion of drawing a sword and shouted. “Come forth, Intetsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>A flash of light appeared from his hand and transformed into a black sword, a raven black Katana with a rectangular tsuba.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s so cool!” Rimuru said as he looked at the sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Cid looked at the sword in interest.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san looked up and down at the katana with interest. “How interesting. It is indeed very similar to a Zanpakutō and yet it’s different. It's more of something between a Fullbring and a Zanpakutō.” He then suddenly looked at Ikki. “Does it have some kind of special ability unique to itself or some upgraded form? Sorry if I am being too intrusive. It's just that I haven't seen something so interesting in a long time. My name is Kisuke Urahara, just a humble candy shop owner.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, he was totally in his scientist mode.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you….well, yes. Every Device has a unique ability of its own. They are ranked from A to F with F being the lowest and A being the highest. As for another form, the Device is the manifestation of the user’s souls, their ideals and convictions. In very rare cases, it is possible that the Device can change its shape when the user undergoes an extreme change in beliefs and spirit but such cases are only read about in books. I have personally never seen or heard of anyone being able to do so with my own eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Conviction based hmm. That’s new. Understandable and yet different. By the way, what is the ability of your Device?” Kisuke-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Intetsu can raise my physical stats by two times.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s amazing. If I had double my physical stats, I could totally beat your rank, old man.” Atomic Samurai said to Bang-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hohohoho I think I still have some life in my old bones to hold my own.” Bang-san laughed and then looked at Ikki. “You don’t seem to be happy, Ikki-kun. Are you perhaps dissatisfied with your device’s ability?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki shook his head. “My ability….it’s not that special among other blazers. My Intetsu is Ranked F.”</p><p><br>“Eh? F Rank? Surely that can’t be true. Doubling someone’s physical abilities is broken, ya know.” Atomic Samurai asked , surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Normal Blazers can reinforce their bodies five to six times using just their Magic Power. Intetsu’s ability….it’s considered almost useless. I don’t have enough Magic Power either so I can’t use it in conjugation with reinforcement either.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"But you can increase your power by training, can't you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No.\" He shook his head. \"Blazers cannot increase the amount of magic power they are born with. They are limited by their souls.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>A period of silence descended over the place but he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>\"But I will overcome it. I will become a Mage Knight and prove them wrong.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow.” Rimuru whispered by my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Talk about a shounen protagonist speech.” Ainz whispered back.</p><p><br></p><p>“He even matches the weak to strong archetype.” Cid-kun said, joining in the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. Even got that pretty boy look.” I added, making all three of them look at me. “What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Like you are one to talk, you damn harem protagonist.” Rimuru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn straight.” Ainz confirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You guys are not going to let it go are you?” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“No way. At least not for a <a href=\"https://month….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">month….no</a> two months because of two girls.” Ainz added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah….make that three months. There is Tohru-chan too. Who knows what this guy is planning.” Rimuru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“....” I ignored them. They would calm down in a while.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Che, who needs magic power? You can always train your body and swordsmanship. You already got enough for your Device. Train hard and show everyone.\" The samurai guy with Bang clicked his tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. The Almighty has given us the greatest gift in this body of ours. We should be grateful to him and devote ourselves to training it to the best of our capabilities as a show of respect to him and Martial Arts.” Issac-san added too.</p><p><br></p><p>Shigure patted his shoulder. \"Learn Ki. Martial Arts is strong. I can teach.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes Ikki-san. I cannot use any Esper powers or magic either because my body just erases every supernatural power. But martial arts is really good. I have become much stronger than before. Also, you should eat the salad from the restaurant. It increases the rate of training by several times.\" Touma added his two cents to support the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You can do what?!\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yeah. He needs to put on his gloves at all times because of this.\" Kensei-san confirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Know what? Show me your swordsmanship. If you are good enough, I can give you some pointers as well.\" Atomic Samurai spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>We were looking at all this from the side when I suddenly had an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Rimuru and spoke. \"Rimuru. This Device thing, maybe… Do you think we can get some for ourselves?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. It might be possible if we go to that world. I would need to analyse the process once more.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>We can actually analyse the process. In fact, I can probably use my Chef Ability too.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki probably heard our conversation and spoke. “Umm, Shop Owner. Not everyone can awaken Devices. You need to have magic power, enough to awaken your device.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We all looked at the guy who seemed genuinely worried about it and we smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's fine. I might just have enough magic power for it.\" I raised my hand and water swirled in my palm before freezing in the shape of a katana similar to Intetsu. \"We only need your permission in case this is something harmful for your world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No no. It's not harmful.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, it’s decided.” Kisuke-san clapped his hand in excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>He was probably the most excited of all people here….not to say others weren’t. Hell, even Cid-kun looked intrigued.</p><p><br></p><p>So we all waited for him to finish his Ramen as the others finished their food and we all walked into what looked like modern Japan.</p><p><br></p><p>We were in an alleyway.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking around the place, the differences were apparent. This was similar and yet quite different from Tokyo in our world. This place seemed….more modern.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san made some handsigns and  chanted something as I sensed a barrier around the place. “There, no one will notice anything amiss here as long as there is no big commotion.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s quite thoughtful of you, Kisuke. Leave the rest to me.” Rimuru looked at Ikki and spoke. “Can you summon your sword….device once more.” He then looked at me. “Help me out here. Connect your Sage with my Great Sage and use your Chef’s ability so that we can share the data on the analysis. It will just make the process faster.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and activated Chef as I felt an intrusion in my head and accepted it rather than resisting it.</p><p><br></p><p>A voice was heard in my head.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Connection to Extra Skill: Sage has been established.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Information Sharing initiated.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>This must be Rimuru’s Great Sage.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, that’s so cool.</p><p><br></p><p>It sounds like a futuristic AI in one’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ready.” On Rimuru’s signal, Ikki began.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come forth, Intetsu.” He said as he clutched the air in front of him, making a flash of light which slowly transformed into his sword, Intetsu.</p><p><br></p><p>My Chef analysed the whole process in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>His Device was attached to his soul. In fact, a part of his soul manifested outside and it became the core for his magical power to gather around and form the….shell or rather the physical body of Intetsu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get that?” I asked, looking at Rimuru who nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.” He opened his palm and a flash of light lit up on his hand, turning into a blue coloured sword. He swung it and it changed into a whip and struck the ground and with a slight pull, it returned to its original shape and came back to his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s convenient. What can it do, shapeshift?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s called Mimic. It can not only change its shape but also eat things and gain their properties over time.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked pleased with the sword’s ability and sheathed it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s get one for you all.”</p><p><br></p><p>Since Great Sage was connected to me, I was the first one after Rimuru to use the process.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, under the guidance of Great Sage, I felt a strand of my Soul Power move. This power concentrated around my hand as my Magic Power moved next, twirling around the strand, creating the body for the weapon. The light around my palm increased more as the figure of the Device was finally revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It kinda suits Silas-kun the best.” Bang-san commented.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the two knives in my hand. They were a pair of kitchen knives. One Icy Blue while the other with a completely white blade with a black handle.</p><p><br></p><p>The names of the Devices came to my mind almost instinctively.</p><p><br></p><p>Blue Fang and Black Thorn.</p><p><br></p><p>The first one controlled water and ice while the other one had the same power as my Chef Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>With this I could probably use my Chef Skill with my Innate Cursed Technique.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Rimuru, I could do so with practice and experience with my Skill too but I haven’t had a chance to practise using the Chef. One of the most important reasons for it was the fact that it required enormous amounts of Magical Power and was not something I could use at will.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were broken by Ainz’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Must have something to do with his size.” The guy said to Rimuru and Saitama as the two laughed among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>These two have been a bit too much today.</p><p><br></p><p>“At least I have one.” I replied, making them quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru recovered from the comment first. “Alright, who’s next?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz went next and got a….bone staff.</p><p><br></p><p>Talk about original.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should try too, Sakura.” On my encouragement, she went ahead and her Device turned unexpectedly into a pair of earrings.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened next was not something we were expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of our eyes, black chains emerged from the air and bound around Sakura and almost at the same time, her magic power started falling down.</p><p><br></p><p>Was someone attacking us?</p><p><br></p><p>Almost on an instinct, I grabbed my Black Thorn and used Chef at full power and slashed at the black chains.</p><p><br></p><p>The chains shattered almost instantly as Sakura fell into my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” I asked and she nodded slowly at my question.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at Rimuru. “Okay, what in the world was that?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru looked tense as well but tried to explain nonetheless. “I think those Chains were a sort of a limiter forced on people by the world. Maybe that's the reason why people of this world cannot raise their power beyond a certain level? Let's go inside and talk about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>We did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I did when I went inside was check on Sakura's condition to see if she was unhurt.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately there was no harm to her body or soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san checked and verified it.</p><p><br></p><p>Only after that did I let her go.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was talking to Ikki in the meantime. “Do you have any idea on what those chains were, Kurogane-kun?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The poor guy himself looked confused about the whole debacle and shook his head in denial.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure there is nothing wrong with her?” I asked Kisuke-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing from what I could say but then again, I cannot say much from the lack of information. That was quite interesting though. I wonder why the chains only appeared on Sakura-chan and not you three. Could it be because of your unusual heritage?” Kisuke-san asked. “Could it be that the chains only bind humans? Too bad we don't have any more test subjects.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Perhaps it would need humans with Magic Power to go through the process for there to be any chance of something like that happening.” Ainz said. “But getting volunteers for it is hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don't think there is any need for any volunteers. We can't see Kurogane-kun’s chains either. It's better to not risk those.” Rimuru said. “If anything, we are lucky that Silas is the living cheat that he is to salvage the situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, a voice came from behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn't mind giving it a try.”</p><p><br></p><p>We looked back to see a familiar figure in black hooded overcoat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cid-kun!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am Shadow, he who lurks in the shadows to hunt the shadows.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….he’s in his roleplay mode again.</p><p><br></p><p>I was told by Ainz that some people like to do this. Even Ainz did it, especially when among his subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>“....Shadow-kun, it’s not safe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When you stare at the face of the abyss all day, death becomes just another world to you. Do not worry, I will be fine.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ainz -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Damn….that line was cool.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid’s commitment to roleplay was quite admirable.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Silas who was still undecided.</p><p><br></p><p>His friend was really soft sometimes….not to say he was a coward.</p><p><br></p><p>The move he made to cut Sakura’s chains was almost instinctive, without even realising it himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was right.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a damn harem protagonist saving girls and expanding his harem….</p><p><br></p><p>But he was their friend and for Ainz….that’s all that mattered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let him try, Silas. If anything goes wrong, you can always cut those chains away. Worst case, I can bring out something to fix any lasting problems.” He offered.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas once more looked at Cid. “Are you sure you want to do it? You can always ignore Kisuke-san when he gets into his mad scientist mode.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara ara, you hurt my feelings, Silas-kun.” The man brought out a fan from somewhere and waved at his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shackles of the world….I have always wondered how it would feel to go up against the world all by myself. This is pretty close.” Cid replied, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, sure….go ahead.”</p><p><br></p><p>They walked out once more and this time Kisuke looked at Ikki.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kurogane-kun, do you have some area where some disturbance will not cause any problem for people? We can obviously fix things up before leaving.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was probably feeling guilty for Sakura’s situation and agreed quickly….although there was no need for him to feel guilty about anything. If anything, he had warned them in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz used a spell to change the way he looked and they walked to a place almost thirty minutes away from the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>It was on the bank of what looked like a small artificial lake of sorts with no signs of civilization anywhere near.</p><p><br></p><p>“This place is always empty. Sometimes high ranking Blazers fight here and it rarely causes any problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. In that case, let’s get ready.” Kisuke started putting on barriers all around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>He did the same and so did Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Silas threw some barriers around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“This should be good.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke set up some investigative spells and they were all ready.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, Silas. Get ready. We interfere when Ci….I mean Shadow asks. I am starting.” Rimuru did and just as before two flashes of light lit up Cid’s hands, slowly taking the form of two….are those….</p><p><br></p><p>“Crowbars?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I knew it. These are definitely weapons with the best potential.” Cid said as he spun the crowbars all around himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he was doing so, the black chains appeared again, tying him up.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t resist but actually offered himself, spreading his arms wide.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!” Kisuke commented as he observed the process. “This is interesting. These shackles are on the person’s whole being, not something between the world and the person. It kinda reminds me of the Chain of Fate. Breaking free of it brings one face to face with their inner demons, breaking the barrier between a soul and a hollow. Interesting. If my theory is even remotely close, maybe I could help you train and increase your power, Kurogane-kun.” He said looking at the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh obviously. I am more than certain I know the reason why your or the magic power of Blazers don’t increase naturally or through training and even the way to bypass it. Alright, I am done collecting the data, Shadow-kun. You are free to do what you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow looked at them and then spoke. “You all should take some distance. I am going to get serious here. A hundred metres should be enough.” He said as he walked on the water to the middle of the lake.</p><p><br></p><p>“He can walk on Water!” Ikki-asked. “That’s amazing.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the middle of the lake, Cid stood and looked up and spread his arms and his magic power began to increase as the chains appeared once more.</p><p><br></p><p>At one point, the increase in his magic power stopped but he didn’t stop. Instead, a large sphere of light spread out from him.</p><p><br></p><p>Through the eavesdropping spell, they could hear the words he was saying.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Am….”</p><p><br></p><p>“....<em>Atomic</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>A pillar of magical energy rose up from his body and into the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>It was no less than any full power Tenth Tier Spell.</p><p><br></p><p>Amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy shit! Did he just nuke the chains?” Rimuru commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“My my, that’s indeed something isn't it.” Kisuke tugged his hat down. “I doubt the barriers are going to be of any use now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards the last two members and Silas, while surprised, was not stunned. It seems that Zeref’s training was working for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki was another story altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was looking at the scene with jaw hanging open. His surprise however didn’t last for long as it changed into a look of determination.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, that’s a shounen protagonist right there.</p><p><br></p><p>When the explosion subsided, a wave of Magic Power flowed over them before disappearing completely and from the blast zone, Cid walked out.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole lake had been evaporated in that attack.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will fix this.” Silas said as he went forward and brought out his new Device and swung his knife.</p><p><br></p><p>Water appeared in the air, swirling in the middle of the lake and within seconds, the entire lake was full again.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he looked a bit drained, that was an impressive piece of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas did say he was good with Ice and Water Magic. Maybe he should propose some exchange of knowledge with Zeref. The magic of that world was quite good too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think we should leave this area as soon as we can. The authorities will be coming here very soon.” Rimuru said.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and opened a Gate to the place where they had left the Restaurant and walked in as others followed.</p><p><br></p><p>This was certainly a surprising day.</p><p><br></p><p>At least they had new weapons and a way to get some good equipment for their subordinates quite easily.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Lavinia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you don’t need any help, Lavinia?” Azazel asked her once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I am perfectly fine. I am just tired and need some time away from everything.” She replied, sticking to her decision.</p><p><br></p><p>The incident with the Wizards of Oz and the Utsusemi Organisation changed things for her.</p><p><br></p><p>The <a href=\"https://Restaurant….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Restaurant….it</a> was the place which changed her life. It was truly a magical place and not just because of its ability to connect to different worlds. No. It was because of the people who came there.</p><p><br></p><p>While she wasn't treated badly in the Restaurant, the opposite actually. She was treated with care and they not only saved her life but even helped to heal her back to full health. She wasn’t lying when she said she didn’t mind Silas’ actions of making her sign the contract.</p><p><br></p><p>The time there gave her time to think about her life and she realised that she had been living a lie for the last several years.</p><p><br></p><p>What was she even going to do now that the entire goal of her life was gone?<br><br></p><p>Glenda was alive. She was just using her to study her Sacred Gear and she wanted nothing to do with her, enough to pull all that act. Not that she would want to go back after finding out that she was with the people who had experimented on the kids….and that too using the data collected from her Sacred Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>She could go and try to stop them….but what then?</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia realised that she was tired. She was just tired of all this and she just wanted some time for herself now.</p><p><br></p><p>The invitation from Mr. August was just the opportunity she needed….to be away from all this so she took it in a heartbeat and she wasn’t disappointed.</p><p><br></p><p>And she wasn’t disappointed in the least.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last month, she had gotten a father figure in August, sisters in Brandish, Dimaria and Sakura-chan, Tohru-chan and Sil-kun had become good friends to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She liked learning magic with them and going around the streets of Vistarion with everyone or working in Sil-kun’s Restaurant and meeting different types of people. Naruto-kun, Kanna-chan, Miu-chan, everyone in the Restaurant made her feel like a family she had forgotten about for a long time. It made her truly feel happy.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why she decided to embrace this life permanently.</p><p><br></p><p>She had come here to officially resign from the job. Grauzaberer was quite far away but Azazel was her temporary boss so he could deal with the things.</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard about the thing with Glenda. If it’s any consolation, all traces of the Wizards of the Oz and the Utsusemi Organisation are gone from this country. Everything from the executives to the rats….all gone. They cannot harm you anymore.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire country?</p><p><br></p><p>She did hear that Zeref-san had used some kind of super magic to take them out but she didn’t know all the details of the spell. She will have to ask August-sensei later.</p><p><br></p><p>For now she continued the conversation. “Hmm….it’s fine. I have had time to think and I am better now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel looked like he was hesitating a bit but asked nonetheless. “You are not forced…?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for asking but believe me….being forced is not something I have to worry about.” She smiled as she remembered Sil-kun’s reaction when he was apologising to her for making her sign the contract.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason he was even doing so was to keep Sakura-chan from any danger. Seriously, sometimes Sil-kun was too kind for his own good. But then again, that’s what made him….him.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel raised an eyebrow at her comment so she changed the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“The reason I am quitting is because I have taken an apprenticeship under a teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?” Azazel asked, surprised at the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is a human who likes his privacy, to remain away from this world so I cannot disclose his address to anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s his name? He must be something if you talk so highly about him. I must have heard of him somewhere maybe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I seriously doubt it. Even I was only able to meet him by some chance and was invited due to some mutual friends. Anyways, I am enjoying my time learning magic in peace there and I want to keep it that way.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at her for a few moments and then nodded although she could tell that he was hesitating somewhat. “Alright. If that’s what you wish. Just remember that our doors are always open for you. If you want anything, you can come to us. You will always have friends in Grigori.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Azazel.” She nodded. “Can I meet Va-kun one last time before leaving?”</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled at her request. “Obviously. He must be in the academy with the rest of your friends. By the way, Tobio and the rest have decided to join us and train after that encounter. They are also studying in the Nephilim Academy. You can meet them there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I am glad to see that they are doing fine. Tobi-kun seemed very afraid last time and was injured….although he was healed too….” She suddenly stopped realising what she was talking about to not give away any more information.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully Azazel didn’t poke the topic either when she ignored his raised eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Meeting with Va-kun and the rest was fun. He seemed to be doing better and was getting along with the new students. He will be fine.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you really have to go?” Va-kun asked, sad.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. But you know what, I will come to visit sometimes….if you’d like.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph….who would like that?” he pouted and she hugged him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was such a tsundere sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, she waved them goodbye and left towards the Restaurant once more.</p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant.’</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Several things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>First Silas got a taste of Lavinia’s common sense and by the end of it got himself a cute girl to cuddle at nights.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I know many people want to know what Sakura is thinking.

They will bet the Boots of the Blessed Sun and a sum of Gold Coins for our Shield of the Blessed Sun in the first round. If they win, they will bet both the pieces for the Armour and the Bottom and finally, if we wish to continue, they will bet the Boots again for the Sword.” Shiroe explained the deal.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow. “They are extremely confident, aren’t they?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It was the first term. We had to agree to fight all the battles in case they win and we cannot back down. They must have some kind of trump card which they know we can’t <a href=\"https://beat….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">beat….at</a> least in such a short amount of time. I asked around a few of my contracts and there is news that Dwain solo’ed a T4 monster in the Raid. We don’t know the exact method he used but this information was verified by several people who were on the same wall as his team.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Skill of some type then. You wouldn’t lose, would you, Arty?” Star asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, I’d win.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+8 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+16% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Reverse Cursed Technique</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reverse Cursed Technique[Level 1/100]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Heals all physical negative buffs from the user and 20% of the User’s Health.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cooldown: 2 hours.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Even with my self-control, I couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>They took my laugh as a sign of confidence which looking at the current skill, I did have.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe still looked a bit worried so I reassured him a bit. “I haven’t told you about the Skills I got from the level ups, did I?”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was thinking of keeping it as a surprise for the hunts. Anyways, don’t worry. I got this one.” I patted his shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>By that time, everyone had gathered.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked in the corner of the field and saw Gareth and his team.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Veena had returned after talking to her friends.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked towards Kenneth who was ready with his team of Knights with Dwain and his team already on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth’s face looked completely emotionless as he stood judge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Both sides, present the terms of your duel and the stakes.”</p><p><br></p><p>We did.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena went over the contract once more before we agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many gold coins will be paid along with the boots as a stake for the Shield?” She questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, fifty thousand Gold Coins should be good?” The guy smiled at Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. Even if we go by the standard rates, fifty thousand is too low. At the very least, it should be one hundred and fifty thousand gold coins for a fair stake. If you don’t agree, we can compare the prices with the blacksmiths and verify.”</p><p><br></p><p>A slight frown appeared on his face but he quickly covered it under a fake smile and raised his hand in surrender.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, fine you win. Actually, how about I use two hundred thousand and you go on a date with me if I win?” He winked.</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes at the guy and Shiroe and Star looked offended too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Dwain, you are talking out of line.” Shiroe</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, please. I am talking to the lady here. She would have company with men her own age rather than the kids in your team. It’s her own choice after all. Why are you getting all pissed off?” He scoffed at Shiroe’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena however just smiled. “Men my age? Where? All I see in your team are insolent children.”</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned but she continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“But you know what, I will accept your terms if you make it five hundred thousand gold coins.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Veena, you don’t have to….” I tried to speak but she looked at me with a smile. This smile however felt unlike her previous smiles.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, are you saying you will lose, Arthas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then it doesn’t matter, does it. If he wants to take me on a date, this is the least they can do. Obviously, if they are broke then it’s not my problem.” She looked at the guy challengingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“That is a bit costly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, your team, the so-called Blood Knights are broke. You know what? there is a place nearby where you could borrow the money. There is a shop nearby which offers loans….with some interest, obviously. Nothing much, just five percent.”</p><p><br></p><p>His frown increased.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, borrowing money also requires resolve and guts. Money one can get slowly, the other two….not everyone can have them.”</p><p><br></p><p>The three of us looked as she continued to rip the idiot’s team apart with words.</p><p><br></p><p>His frown had been replaced by an angry look and he forced a smile on his face. “Oh, I wasn’t aware that I could borrow the money. In that case, give me thirty minutes. I will arrange for the amount. Let’s confirm the stakes by then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it Arthas.” Veena said without any change in expressions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked, one last time.</p><p><br></p><p>She just looked at me and smiled. “I trust you.”</p><p><br></p><p>With a sigh, we confirmed the stakes with Kenneth and the other team went to get the money while we separated into a different corner.</p><p><br></p><p>“You all look upset.” Veena asked as we took seats in an empty corner of the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t like this.” I said directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am with Arty on this. That asshole was too much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He crossed the line.” Shiroe added too, slightly angry which was rare for him. I had very rarely seen him angry.</p><p><br></p><p>In return Veena just laughed. “You children need to learn so much about deals. Sigh, let me explain.” We looked up at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“While you people were going around doing your own research, I was looking for information about laws and how they are carried out. Turns out that several laws are similar to the outside world. Now, how does it matter in this case? Well you see, there is a thing called The contra proferentem.” I looked around and all three of us were confused. </p><p><br></p><p>“It is a legal doctrine that states that if a contract term is ambiguous, it should be interpreted against the party who drafted or introduced the term. This rule favours the party who did not draft the contract, as they are not responsible for the ambiguity. This rule is applied when the parties have equal bargaining power and are represented by counsel. Now, tell me who was the one who added the five hundred thousand for a date to the contract?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Dwain.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. Now, can anyone clear for me exactly what a date means? For some people, meeting over tea and leaving can constitute a date and for someone else, simply walk down the road and guess who gets to decide this ambiguous situation in the contract?” She smiled. “If Dwain is ready to pay three hundred and fifty thousand for a walk down the market with me, and that too after defeating Arthas, don’t you think it’s a fair deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“He just got swindled, didn’t he?” Star asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not yet, dear. But he must be in the process of getting swindled.” She smiled. “While it’s true that the shop I referred to him loans high amounts of money. It charges five percent interest….per week.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Language.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So now, Arty just has to go and beat him up just as we had planned….only he will suffer more this time around?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that those who are not able to pay off their debts often get sold into slavery. In this aspect, this world is just like the mediaeval ages.”</p><p><br></p><p>….Holy crap.</p><p><br></p><p>I was right.</p><p><br></p><p>That smile was dangerous. She was really pissed off at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, Shiroe told me about the Skills of Apprentice Archers which he had bought from some of his friends. Nothing too much, just the basic knowledge of the skills.</p><p><br></p><p>After around thirty minutes, the guy returned with his team. Some of them looked unsatisfied but didn’t say anything against the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have all the funds.” He handed the money to Kenneth who checked the bag and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we will commence the match.” He confirmed, leading us towards the field.</p><p><br></p><p>“As one of you is an archer, they will be provided with a place to cover for himself. It will be a raised platform and you will start the fight at a distance of one  hundred and fifty metres. The first one to give up or get their health in the red zone will be considered the loser regardless of any complaints anyone has. No potions or healing items are allowed in the duel. Any doubts?”</p><p><br></p><p>“None Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Get in your positions. Match begins on my signal.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shiroe -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They took their place on the stands and looked at the match.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked around and saw the rest of the players filling up the stands too.</p><p><br></p><p>“You think Arty would be fine?” Star asked. “I mean sure he was confident and all but….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Arthas is not the type to talk nonsense….especially in this kind of situation. If he said he will be fine, he will surely be fine. I am just thinking of the skill which he said he unlocked.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Skill?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Arthas….has a Unique Class which he got as an achievement. The Skills of that Class were one of the reasons for our astronomical scores in the World Quest. I wonder what Skills he unlocked during the raids.”</p><p><br></p><p>They concentrated on the field where both Arthas and Dwain had taken two sides of the field.</p><p><br></p><p>The field was more or less clear so there would be no place for Arthas to hide. He will have to dodge the Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that Apprentice Archer’s had a skill at higher levels, Aim. It took four seconds to prepare but it makes their next shot, undodgeable unless the target has some other type of skill to counter it. The strongest part of this Skill was that it could also be used with other skills. Obviously there were several restrictions on this skill. It could only be used with Archer Skills and no instant death or one hit skills will work with it. The accuracy also fell down when the level difference between the targets was a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas would need to reach the guy before four seconds or he would be open to any one skill of that guy.</p><p><br></p><p>No….probably less than 5 seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your partner is going to lose, Shiroe. That Dwain has him exactly where he needs him.” A voice came from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked to the side and saw Gareth and his team coming towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>“That remains to be seen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not a matter of chance. I might not like that bastard but there is no doubt about his skill. I have seen him soloing a T4 Monster with my own eyes. Even if your teammate is a Knight, he might not stand a chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh you saw that fight?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It looked so easy. That monster wasn’t able to do anything to anyone from the moment Dwain hit him. Even Dwain’s teammates fighting right beside it were unhurt while he engaged the monster from over the walls. As long as your teammate gets hit by one of his attacks, he falls in a trap and it’s all over. The guy could kite him till the end of the day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So he inflicts some kind of status effect on the other side.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That bastard got some kind of skill from one of his quests and without any items allowed, your teammate wouldn’t be able to throw it off. He would just be a fish on the chopping board. In a matchup like this, against a melee class, Dwain is almost invincible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Look, it’s starting.” they heard someone say and looked at the field.</p><p><br></p><p>They did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas was standing on the other side of the field.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth drew his sword and swung.</p><p><br></p><p>“Begin!”</p><p><br></p><p>With the word, Arthas rushed straight ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, Dwain was aiming but not firing.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone with a good eyesight could see a skill being invoked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy crap, the boy’s fast.” Someone commented as Arthas three fourths of the field in less than four seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad, he isn’t fast enough.” Gareth commented while Shiroe concentrated on Arthas.</p><p><br></p><p>Dwain looked like he finished his skill as the arrow on his bow took a dark tinge.</p><p><br></p><p>He shot the arrow and it headed directly towards Arthas.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas however didn’t dodge. He….just slapped the arrow away with his off hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible!” Gareth exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Dwain looked stunned and flumbled nocking his arrow. It took him over two seconds to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>By then Arthas had already been on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Dwain fired another arrow but Arthas just gripped it with his left hand and crushed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas however surprised everyone as he sheathed his blade instead and picked Dwain up by his face….and banged his head through the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe shivered a bit at the cruelty.</p><p><br></p><p>What came next weren’t attacks with a sword or any weapons but just raw punches, straight to Dwain’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas sat on his chest and rained a flurry of punches on the man’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>His cries could be heard throughout the duelling grounds and it was only stopped by the shout of Kenneth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Match. The winner is Arthas!”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The entire field was silent.</p><p><br></p><p>No one expected the duel to be….this anticlimactic.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas stepped back and started walking out of the field. Dwain also got a chance to stand up and as soon as he did, he pointed a finger at Arthas and began shouting accusations of cheating.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly went into the ground to meet Arthas.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am telling you this bastard cheated somehow!” Dwain shouted at the Knights who were taking him to the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>“There has been no cheating. The entire duel was monitored by Knights of the Kingdom. Accusing Arthas of cheating would also be accusing the judgement of the Knights incharge of judging the whole duel so I suggest that you choose your words carefully.” Kenneth warned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuck you! You are all in the same team. This bastard is also a Knight like you people. You all must have fixed the match.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth looked at the guy with a stone-like face. “Are you accusing the Knights of the Kingdom of fraudry?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn right, I am. Everyone saw how none of my attacks affected him. Not even his HP went down a bit and all his attacks….his barehanded attacks were hitting me more than sword attacks from other players. He is cheating for sure and you bastards are covering up for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Knight! Take this fool away for insulting the dignity of the Knights of Llyne. He shall remain in prison for one year.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe didn’t expect the Knights to immediately get on work as they dragged the guy away.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth then turned towards the rest. “Arthas used a Skill to nullify the damage a moment from when Dwain launched the attack. The Skill lasted over four seconds in which he had already disarmed his opponent and never gave him another chance to attack.” He looked at Arthas who gave him a nod.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for the details of the Skill, I do not know. I cannot and will not force anyone to reveal their skills against their will. Skills are a very personal matter and unless the other party is a criminal, he cannot be forced to reveal his skills. I hope you all will keep this in mind as doing so is a criminal offence.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe reached Arthas by then. “Really? You got an Invulnerability Skill?”</p><p><br></p><p>“One of the Skills, yes.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“You <a href=\"https://ass….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ass….no</a> wonder you weren’t worried about him from the start.” He punched Arthas’ shoulder jokingly. “You have got to tell me the details later. I need to add them to my plans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn it, I was planning to scare you during a hunt.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“No joking during hunts. Not even for these. Someone can get hurt.” He scolded.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas just smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe had noticed that Arthas was showing more emotions and the more he did, the more he noticed that his friend had a mischievous side to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, let’s collect the reward. We still need to hold the meeting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” They walked towards the Knights while Star and Veena came there too.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was quite brutal….exactly what that bastard needed.” Star laughed. “Well done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, about that….I wasn’t sure if he would survive hits from my sword due to the difference between our stats so I used fists instead.” Arthas said, scratching his head.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth handed over the items and gold coins to Arthas and left.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should go and address the crowd before they get any rowdier.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe took charge of the crowd at this moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I stepped back to the rest of my team while Shiroe went and gathered the crowd in one place.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was one heck of a trump card you were hiding.” Star fistbumped me.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena didn’t say anything. She was just smiling and waited till Star was done after which he came forward and gave me a light hug. “I knew you could do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. We need to address the people. They have already waited more than they had to. Let’s not make them wait anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>We gathered behind Shiroe who was talking to the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry for the delay. As you all already saw, there had been a situation we needed to address first. Now, I know you all have questions about the World Quest so let me give everyone a basic outline of what happened in the whole quest from our point of view.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe then went on to explain how we had been the first party to get a T4 Ranked player, me.</p><p><br></p><p>This was easily verifiable as many people had seen me going into the Knight’s Academy back then. It was when some people had started stalking us so there were already rumours around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that quest, we rescued some hostages from the Goblins and Arthas became the first player from this town to become a Knight….however, that wasn’t the only thing that happened. During the quest, he unlocked another Class. A Unique Class was unlocked due to some kind of achievement. This Class is called Goblin Slayer and is also a T4 Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>Murmurs ran through the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>We had discussed and decided to reveal the Class and some of the Skills of this Class to assuage the other players.</p><p><br></p><p>“I won’t disclose all the Skills or even the Stats of the Class as it is Arthas’ personal information but I will tell you all about two of his Skill, which he has allowed me to. These two Skills were also the ones which played the most important role in our scores being so high.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The first Skill is called ‘Fated Enemy’. This Skill allows him 50% more damage against Goblins….even in the damage of usable items. This means, he can increase the damage of attacks, even traps against them, if he just touches them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, there is a skill like that? That’s broken.” Star commented softly to us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just wait for the second one.” I replied and he looked forward towards Shiroe.</p><p><br></p><p>“The second Skill is called ‘Sweet Revenge’. This Skill gives him 25% more experience when killing Goblins…..even with traps. Yes, that was one of the reasons behind our insane scores. Arthas’ Unique Class was tailor made for this occasion.” He gave them some time to grasp the situation for themselves then continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Apart from this, the hostages we had saved and Arthas’ connection to the Knight's Academy gave us a chance to get an audience with the City Lord. There we explained our plans to protect three of the gates with minimal soldiers. It wasn't easy as Arthas had to put his life on line. Had we failed….he would have been executed by the City Lord. Thankfully, despite facing up against several thousand goblins, we were still able to defend the three gates with our well placed traps and plans. This was a result of several factors coming together. While we are sure that even without these factors, we could have scored in the top three due to our levels and Skills, our scores might not have been this high then.” He finished.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked around the people and several people looked like they wanted to ask questions.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe pointed towards one of them. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You said Arthas was a T4 over a week or so before this whole raid. How did he level up so fast?”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe looked at me and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“When this whole….game started and everyone locked themselves inside their own houses….I was out there, hunting <a href=\"https://alone….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">alone….in</a> the middle of the forests. I stayed inside entire weeks and camped on trees to kill as many animals as I could. You all on the other hand started hunting at best a week after that bit most of you at least two weeks later when you all ran out of money and even then you were only hunting on the outskirts of the village. This involved hundreds of players jumping on a single rabbit or piglet and then waiting for them to respawn. I totally avoided such problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>People were listening intently at my words so I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I met my teammate, Veena. As some of you might know, she was a Herbalist. She started helping me with baits and different types of poisons, further increasing the speed of our levelling. By the time I left the beginner's village, I had already completed the task to become a T3 and we have been hunting here since then.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy who had asked me the question. “It's not like I magically became the highest level player around. I have been continuously risking my life for it. So if you are expecting some kind of shortcut method….I will have to disappoint you. Any more questions?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you share the information about different class trees?” Someone asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Those types of information are sold for money and we had to use lots of gold to buy them too. Sorry, but we are not running a charity for anyone.” I directly denied.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several complaints raised due to this but no one came out and said anything overtly so we didn’t care either.</p><p><br></p><p>Some morons think they are owed everything, even things which others have worked and risked their lives for.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s better to ignore such idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything else?” Shiroe asked out.</p><p><br></p><p>“What strategies do you use while hunting?” Someone from the group asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe thought for a moment and answered. “We use baits and large scale traps to hunt a large number of enemies at a time. I won’t be telling anyone the details as they are the personal secrets of our teams although I will give everyone a piece of advice….several things which work in the outside world….also work here. Make of that what you will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just that….that tells us nothing.” Someone complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me clarify something first….We are not here to babysit anyone. This is all the help you will get from us. You people are not our team members. We don’t owe anyone anything so don’t expect anything more from us.” Shiroe clarified in a loud voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that the stick was out, Veena took charge. “No need to get so down. While it is true that we are not going to babysit anyone….there is indeed something we can do for some people.” She hung the carrot in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the people latched onto her words immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was looking at her as she explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am pretty sure all of you have seen the Global Announcements of the first player made guild formed yesterday.” She asked and many nodded. “As of now, we are looking to invite ninety players to the Fairy Tail Guild.” She announced and the crowd burst into a cacophony of noise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you the people who made the first guild?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is Fairy Tail?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How can we make a Guild?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you people do to get the Guild?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Marry me, Miss Veena.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Several comments flew around the place and these were the only few I was able to pick out….although I wasn’t able to find who said the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>She let them clamour around for several minutes until they quietened down.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will answer the questions one by one. First, yes. It was our team who established the Fairy Tail Guild, the first player-made Guild in this game.” She finished and let them grasp the words.</p><p><br></p><p>She continued after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“The conditions to establish a Guild are very difficult. There has to be one player of T6 or above to act as a Guild Leader. ”</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the conditions brought forward a barrage of new questions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have a T6 Player among yourselves?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How high are your levels?”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised a hand and the crowd calmed down after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are obviously some exceptions to these rules although they are stringent. First, you need to have at least a T5 Player as the Guild Master. Second, they have to have a house or property to act as a Guild Base and third they have to need an official permission from the City Lord and the country to establish a guild. This is the hardest part as generally people have to make some huge contribution towards the country to be allowed this….or just pay one million gold coins and get the Guild Order. We were lucky to get the last requirement completed with the reward from the country and form our guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you all have a T5 Player?” Someone asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. As of yesterday….Arthas has become the first T5 Player in this city.”</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, I was the first T5 Player on this continent but we had decided to keep the information about my target a secret between us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why should we join your guild? You all said that you weren’t here to babysit? What advantages would we get to ally ourselves with you?” Someone shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that this guy was Dwain’s team member and was currently standing near Gareth’s team.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously now….these fools are still trying to cause trouble?</p><p><br></p><p>But sometimes the crowd just needs one voice to rally behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Several people were already dissatisfied with our explanations. Some were angry, some were plain jealous. Those people started making noise.</p><p><br></p><p>We were however making a note of these people in the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>This was something Veena had suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>Playing the good cop and the bad cop.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t want to bring troublesome people in our guild unless it profited us in some way or the other. To separate these people, we had Shiroe play the rude guy and then Veena would come in with the Guild invitations but wouldn’t tell them the information about Perks.</p><p><br></p><p>The annoying ones would no doubt make noise and try to cause trouble and we just need to identify them and keep them in mind when recruiting the members of the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>And boy, was the plan working.</p><p><br></p><p>Several people were causing trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>I even saw Gareth and his team trying to fan the flames from the side along with the remaining members of Dwain’s team.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad we need those two armour pieces so we cannot push them aside right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, those who do not intend to join us….can leave. Anyways, since we only have a small number of members, we are collecting a small fee. One thousand Gold Coins for registration and five hundred Gold Coins every month after that.” Shiroe continued.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was probably the biggest hit yet. Over half the crowd went away. Some even hurled cuss words at us.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them had gathered with Gareth’s team while several others formed teams of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>It was fine.</p><p><br></p><p>There were still more than enough players left who were still discussing among themselves and once in a while, sneaking a few looks at us.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of these people were friends of Shiroe and Veena as well as the people we had sold our stuff to during the World Quest. They had stayed back despite the unpleasant looking deal and hadn't made any trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>I can work with these kinds of people.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, seeing that no more people were leaving, Veena spoke once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, there is a reason we are charging these prices.” She spoke with a smile, attracting the attention of several people.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that they were paying attention, she continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Guilds have several features which only the members of the guild can enjoy. One of these features is something many people might know….Guild Chat. A very convenient means of chatting with other friends even when away. You don’t need to be in any parties to do so. I am sure you all understand the importance of this Skill.”</p><p><br></p><p>Some people were faltering so she continued.</p><p><br>“But this is just one of the features of the Guild. The best part of being in the Guild is….Blessings or as players call it, Perks.” She smiled. “You get perks for being a member of a Guild. These Perks vary greatly from one another and can be selected by the Guild Master of the Guild. With each level the Guild gains, it gets Perk Points which can be assigned by the Guild Master to any Perks of their choosing.”</p><p><br></p><p>She gave them time to understand as well as let them shimmer in their curiosity before adding more details. “These perks can be anything, from Reduction in Price when buying items from NPCs to Increase in Gold Drops to Increase in Production Speed of Crafting or even something like our Guild has….Increase in Experience Gain when in a Party with other Guild Members.” She dropped the bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You have heard it right. The members of our Guild will gain a 10% increase in Experience Gain when in party with any other members of the Guild. I am sure, five hundred Gold Coins per month….is not too big a price for that….wouldn’t you all agree?”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a moment of quiet before the players jumped to pay the money.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, don’t make any ruckus. Please line up properly. The chaos will only delay the process and harm you.” She chided the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>By this time, Shiroe and I had already prepared two registers to note down the people coming in to join.</p><p><br></p><p>In thirty minutes, we had over eighty members. There were still around thirty more people in line and more people were arriving bit by bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Star, stop the line and call the next ten people in and note the names of the last twenty people. When the Guild levels up, they will be given the first slots. Till then, we cannot take any more members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena too went ahead and talked to the people in line, explaining the situation. Some were a bit annoyed but they understood.</p><p><br></p><p>We had already offered them the chance. It was them who waited till the bait of the perks were thrown. We had already told them there were limited seats and we would only be recruiting ninety people.</p><p><br></p><p>We could technically get six more people but we had decided to keep some extra seats in hand for potential team members or friends we might meet in this game.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we were done writing everything down, the crowd had started to gather there again.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who had just left were now starting to gather back, no doubt after hearing about the Guild Perks.</p><p><br></p><p>“10% experience is quite a good bait.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Quite? No no, it’s an amazing bait. I bet they will be hounding us outside the Guild to get in for days.” Star said as he looked at the gathering crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, look at that. The idiots who had followed Gareth are returning too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s going to get annoying. Let’s bring the members inside.” Shiroe suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I agreed, directly speaking in the Guild Chat. “Everyone, get inside the Guild Halls. We will be holding the first ever Guild Meeting of the Fairy Tail Guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>They all looked surprised at the sudden message but then turned towards me as I waved them to follow us.</p><p><br></p><p>We went inside the Guild Halls and closed the door outside, not that it was necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>Guild Halls was a property where only members of the Guild could enter.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if the others wanted to enter, they couldn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a place only for the members of the Guild with the only exceptions being the NPCs and during sieges of the town when the town is not a safe zone but in those cases, everything is a fair game.</p><p><br></p><p>They gathered on the ground floor and I took the first floor to have a clear look at them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome everyone….to the Fairy Tail Guild.” I addressed the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>It was already decided that I was going to address the Guild Members as the Guild Master.</p><p><br></p><p>“Most of you might already know me but for those who don’t, I am Arthas, your Guild Master.” Some people listened while some clapped.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you all are already aware, we are an extremely new Guild and as such we only have a basic outline of rules for the Guild. You can check them on the wall in front of you.”  The rules were put there by Shiroe and me.</p><p><br></p><p>Calligraphy was a really useful Skill for these types of things.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you all might know, no organisation can stand without a set of rules. These are the basic rules of the Guild and we might add some in the future. We expect everyone to follow these. In case of violations, they will be investigated and first they will be given a warning. If they violate the rules again, they will be kicked out from the Guild. Does anyone have any questions?”</p><p><br></p><p>No one said anything. I looked at my team and then continued. “If anyone has any doubts, you can talk to Shiroe, Veena or me. In time, we will add a ranking system and give roles to different Guild Members accordingly.”</p><p><br></p><p>Star was also a new member so he denied any administrative positions.</p><p><br>“Regarding the Guild Halls, the ground floor is for everyone. We plan to make the first floor for labs for production based players and the second floor will be for administrative purposes. Please don’t make it a place to skip out on your Inn expenses. There might not be enough room for everyone.” I added.</p><p><br></p><p>This part was reminded to me by Shiroe as he knew how many players were still staying in the Inn and would most likely put up a sleeping bag anywhere to save up on that cost.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe we can buy some properties nearby for the Guild Members to stay. A dorm of some kind.” Veena suggested. “We do have the funds for it, courtesy of Mr. Dwain.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of us, Shiroe, Star and me shivered as we saw that smile of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….will ask around for that.” Shiroe nodded at the idea, a bit hesitant.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when everyone looked settled, I spoke once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our Guild is new and you all are the first members of the Guild. I sincerely hope that we can work together and make Fairy Tail the best guild in this whole game. We will make it so that when people talk about Fairy Tail, they don’t just remember the first guild established by a player but rather the best Guild there is in the game. Will you all lend me a hand?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah!” The crowd cheered loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next two hours, everyone went around checking the guild hall.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, we took a seat in one of the second floor rooms and looked outside the Guild windows and saw many people waiting outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do we do with them?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What can we do with them? The slots in our Guild are already taken and we have already accepted money from everyone. The best we can do is reserve seats for them when the Guild Level increases.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it would be better to collect some money from them as a reservation charge. It will help us sieve out people who are just here to make trouble.” Veena suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that sounds good. At this point, I am sure many would agree. Just keep an eye out for the troublemakers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Even Gareth’s team is there.” Star pointed out towards one of the corners. “Are you going to call him for a trade?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah….let him stand there for an hour more. He will be the one to offer us the deal…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. Now you are learning.” Veena nodded proudly. “We have the initiative now. Let them be the one to propose the trade from their side or we come on as desperate and they can use it to increase the price. Just make sure their names are registered in the Reserve List but they don’t get recruited to the guild. Their names just stay at the bottom of the list.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it.”</p><p><br></p><p>And we did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost the time for our dinner and I was even tempted to sneak away just to see his face the next day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Akeno Himejima -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Yay! I levelled up. I am now a Cleric. Onee-chan can make all your pains go away with her magic touch~”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled as she watched Marielle dance around happily. </p><p>Marielle was a tall, slender, and voluptuous girl. She had long, wavy green coloured hair, hazel-coloured eyes and an ever present smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She was around six years or so older than Akeno and had just passed out of her university.</p><p><br></p><p>Marielle always had the way of making people laugh with her personality.</p><p><br></p><p>It was probably this personality of hers which attracted Akeno to her in the first place after she got separated from her friends and trapped in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite her happy go lucky behaviour, Marielle was an extremely caring and kind person who actually wanted to do good for the people.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, while they hadn’t seen anyone below twelve years of age in this game yet, probably due to the warnings by the game company, there were children who were just that old and completely scared out of their mind when they were caught in this whole mess.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the less known fact that these kids had a Passive Skill called Puberty which gave them 20% more experience gains till the age of fourteen. For this reason many of them chose production classes and levelled up faster than most adults.</p><p><br></p><p>But this was not enough as many people paid very less for their services, far lesser than they would for other adults.</p><p><br></p><p>It was so bad in some cases that it became difficult for the kids to even earn enough to feed themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Marielle purposely took quests which took her to the beginner villages and brought these children to their town so that they could be kept in the orphanages and their team often distributed food for these kids.</p><p><br></p><p>She then went on to establish an organisation where these kids could work and not be exploited.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, this organisation has twenty three kids from all eight villages around their town and they finally had a place to grow stably.</p><p><br></p><p>One would think that they would lag behind other teams due to all their extra activities?</p><p><br></p><p>Well they would be wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>They were by no means weaker than any team in the city.</p><p><br></p><p>They made up for the lost time by putting in more effort when levelling. Their team often hunted for extra hours to make up for the time they spent helping others and their dedication soon reached other people too who began donating and helping out the kids as well.</p><p><br></p><p>And all this was started by one person’s thoughtful effort.</p><p><br></p><p>For this alone, Akeno respected the captain of her team a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oho. Would that include the pain in my heart too?” Naotsugu asked with a hand over his heart in mock pain.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, Nao-kun. Are you in pain? What happened? Did you get rejected by another girl?” She smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….the pain just increased. Akeno-chan, you are really ruthless.” He pretended to fall.</p><p><br></p><p>Marielle on the other hand kneeled beside his fallen form and actually checked him. “Hah, you can always come to me, you know. So, what would it take to heal your broken heart? A hug, a kiss or….so-me-th-in-g more~”</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Naotsugu became red with her teasing and backed away quickly, laughing awkwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>Quite an irony that their main tank, the self proclaimed ‘warrior of panties’, was weak on the defensive….or at least weak to Marielle’s attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pervert.” Their fourth member whispered on her side, glaring at the fallen man.</p><p><br></p><p>Akatsuki was an adorable girl who reminded Akeno too much of Koneko. Even her height and age were the same as her adorable kouhai, as was her intolerance for anything remotely perverted and being called short.</p><p><br></p><p>Their team had been formed by coincidence.</p><p><br></p><p>She had encountered Marielle in the beginner’s village from where they journeyed to the nearby town together.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way they had met Akatsuki who was fighting off some wild animals by herself and assisted the girl, earning another team member and finally they had met Naotsugu in the town.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Naotsugu and Marielle had some mutual friends in the previous games they had played and despite his usual behaviour, he is apparently a very good person and an incredible player too so Marielle recruited him.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t disappoint them either as he was like a wall, taking all the damage and yet remained firm.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that he, being an open pervert, was always on the receiving end of Akatsuki’s beatings. Not that he took any offence to it.</p><p><br>If anything, he was proud of it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you be less of a pervert for just one day, pervert?” Akatsuki sniped at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha every guy is a pervert at heart, Akatsuki-chan. If they are not open perverts, they are closet perverts. You should be more wary of the second kind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p><br></p><p>And there they went at it again.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it was this bickering and playful banter that kept her mind off more painful things like their current situation and the worries of how the rest of her peerage members were….if they were even….</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>She shouldn’t let these thoughts take root in her mind and disrupt her resolve.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno was going to become stronger and find all her family members in this game….and bring them all out of this alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias, Koneko, Gasper….just wait.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthur Pendragon -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sent the final slash at the monster, finally killing the boar that he had been fighting all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>As the monster fell, he looked at his sword with worry.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is not going to last long. I need to get back to the village to restock and get another sword.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>The game was turning out to be completely different than he had imagined.</p><p><br></p><p>He had imagined a place where everyone would be continuously fighting against each other for the whims of the Game Master and while it was still the same….he wasn’t expecting it to be this….game–like.</p><p><br></p><p>Levels, Equipment, Classes, <a href=\"https://Skills….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Skills….it</a> was totally like the rpg games which he had played during his childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, even with all the game-like factors, sometimes Arthur couldn’t help but feel as if this place was a completely new world. It just felt….too real.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether it be the NPCs or animals in the forest, the way they reacted was just too real for Arthur to consider this as something else.</p><p><br></p><p>He stored the animals in his inventory and checked the area before slowly tracing his way back.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur’s journey in this world in the last two weeks hadn't been very easy either.</p><p><br></p><p>The village was mostly full of casual players who were content with doing basic quests and hunting easier prey, not going out to risk their lives against stronger foes.</p><p><br></p><p>This meant that all easier quests around the village were always taken and he had to risk his life on harder quests to level up.</p><p><br></p><p>His experience did carry him through the beginner’s period but not everything was so simple.</p><p><br></p><p>When some people noticed that he was levelling up quicker, they started pestering him for ‘Protection Charges’ and what not, basically a way to extort money out of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur knew that he was no match for these thugs who were quite a bit above his level so he bore with them for a few days before planning a way around them.</p><p><br></p><p>He lured them with the promise of a false treasure which he had encountered on a quest and led them to the den of a mutated animal in the forest.</p><p><br></p><p>Those people were obviously no match for the vicious T3 and were almost wiped out but not before severely weakening the animal.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur also got a strike in and that gained him a new T2 Job, Militia and several levels of the Class too.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, he was going back to the village after staying inside for three days.</p><p><br></p><p>He planned to restock and then leave for the nearest town to check for better places to hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>As he trekked his way back to the village, his thoughts went to Ley Fay and Eliane.</p><p><br></p><p>How were they?</p><p><br></p><p>Where even in the world were they?</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t even been aware of the random spawn of the players and that put a heavy damper on his plans to rescue his sister. Now even Eliane was stranded somewhere in this world, who knows how and all he could do was hope that they would be well.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>He needed to get stronger and he needed to get stronger faster to find his family in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered if Kuroka was having a better time than him in her search for her sister in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’ is up.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The duel is over and as expected, Arthas trashes the opponent with ease.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Veena, as expected of the devil, dragged the guy into debt for his misconduct against her.

The lock on the door was open already but the place was covered in dust although several things were broken inside. There was however one corner which was relatively cleaner suggesting someone might have been living there for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess someone tried to break in to search for something but didn’t find anything and left after destroying the furniture and after that someone else without any place to live started living there.</p><p><br></p><p>I always carried any valuables on my body in my trunk hanging from my neck.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I had much to call myself in this place either way.</p><p><br></p><p>Still….this place gave me home for several years so I pulled out my wand and quickly cast a few Cleaning Charms and Reparos to fix the furniture, quickly making the place habitable again.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and lay down on my bed, the bed posts creaking under my weight as I looked at the ceiling of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>….the room seemed smaller….</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was me who had become bigger.</p><p><br></p><p>I lay there, remembering everything that had happened since I had gained my memories in this world, several years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>I was now in a better position….a position which many would only dream about but not reach no matter how much they try. I guess this can be called success.</p><p><br></p><p>And perhaps it was this very success which was making me lax.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s incidents brought back all the memories that had been fading from my mind due to the comfortable sailing I had been having in the last year or so. This <a href=\"https://place….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">place….it</a> reminded me what I have been through….and how I have reached where I am now.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a lesson that I should not be lax due to my current success and always remember my roots.</p><p><br></p><p>An hour or so later, I got up and decided to do what I had come here for.</p><p><br></p><p>Pulling my cloak over me, I walked through the familiar streets. The place hadn’t changed at all in over a year. Then again, it hadn’t when I was living here for those four years either.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess long lived races changed slowly too.</p><p><br></p><p>Very slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes later, I was in front of the familiar shop. The lights were still on and the sound of hammering could be heard from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and entered the shop, the bell over the door ringing as I entered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shop’s closed. Come tomorrow.” Came the bored familiar voice of Dave.</p><p><br></p><p>The man himself didn't even turn back.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m back.” I shouted back.</p><p><br></p><p>The hammering sound stopped and he turned back, his eyes wide as he looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>He stared at me for a few moments and then turned back to hammering the piece of metal in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still alive I see. I thought you kicked the bucket or something….wasting all my training.”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile came to my face. “As if it would be that easy to take me down.” I walked behind the counter, slowly placing the bag I had bought with me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, where did you get stuck all this time?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….got a job.” I answered as I picked up the hammer from the side and sat on my usual place, breaking the caracide with practised ease.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see that you haven’t forgotten things. Good. Always remember your lowest point, even when you reach your highest. It will keep your mind in balance.” The old man said nonchalantly, going back to his work.</p><p><br></p><p>We worked like that for an hour and I noticed that I didn’t feel any strain in my muscles like I used to do when I started it. In fact, I had gotten several times more work done compared to the last time I had done this.</p><p><br></p><p>I was putting the physical training on the back burner to focus more on magic and alchemy for my Ultimate Class Ranking. Not to say that I was weak or anything. Even with just my physique alone, I would easily rival a High Class being, especially after the reinforcement from the Demon God’s Manifestation: Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the old man put out the flames in the furnace and got up, going to the back of the shop to get cleaned.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued the work of breaking the caracide ores to last him through the next week.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I heard him returning and got up, bringing out my wand and with a simple flick of the wand, cleaned the place.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed there were some broken furniture and parts of the shop, they got fixed with the next flick of the wand.</p><p><br></p><p>I had learned other branches of magic from the wizarding world too and my favourite one after Transfiguration was Charms.</p><p><br></p><p>Few colouring charms and the faded colour of the place was back to the original.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, tone down the colour a bit. It hurts my eyes.” The man said as he sat down on his chair. “Yes, this one feels better. That’s one nifty magic you learned there, brat. Just don’t go around teaching that to everyone or my shop will be closed.”</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes. There was already magic which could fix things in the Devil's own magic system. It was one of the basic skills taught to Middle Class Devils nowadays so that they can fix their own messes in the Human World.</p><p><br></p><p>Keeping the supernatural side secret is the one thing which everyone follows ardently.</p><p><br></p><p>Not even the craziest ones try to go against it or they would be hunted down by the entire Supernatural <a href=\"https://world….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">world….no</a> exceptions.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, I knew that Rizevim would try to do that by actually releasing Trihexa on the human world….and that showed how the entire world would come together to prevent it.</p><p><br></p><p>I put my wand back and went back to the table to take my bag. Opening the bag, I brought out two bottles of wine and placed them on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>He picked up one of them and looked at it with a raised eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“This stuff is not cheap, brat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know. I don’t think Mephisto Pheles would serve cheap wine to Diehauser Belial and Rudiger Rosenkreutz.” I commented as I brought out a glass and put it in front of him, ignoring his open mouthed reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked these up from the party thrown for my promotion for the old man, remembering the old man’s liking for wine.</p><p><br></p><p>After almost a minute, he spoke again. “You didn’t steal it, did you?” He asked, worried for the first time since I have known him.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “Don’t worry. All of this is paid for.” I replied as I poured the guy a glass of wine.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me and then at the glass a few times before taking a smell of the wine and then a small sip, letting out a satisfied hum. “Now, that’s the stuff.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and looked at him drinking the whole glass before pouring another one for him.</p><p><br></p><p>When I tried to pour the third one, he stopped me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t use up all the good stuff all in a day, brat. I don’t want to get used to this wine. It would make my usual drink taste like ash.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to worry about using anything up. There is more from where this came and no one would mind me taking another one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, I guess you got picked up by good people then. I have seen devils get killed on smaller things than taking wine from their master’s collection.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you are misunderstanding something.” I interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“While it’s true that I am working for others, I have no master.” I finished. “We only have a contractual relationship.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stared at me. <a href=\"https://“So….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“So….in</a> the test period to see if you are worth recruiting? If so then you shouldn’t have brought this. It wouldn’t look good on your profile. I know that Belial used to check the loyalties of their people in more ways than one.” He said, looking into the wall as if remembering something.</p><p><br></p><p>I chuckled and shook my head. “Don’t worry about it. It wouldn’t cause me any problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well if you say so. Anyways, looks like you had quite an adventure over the last year.”</p><p><br></p><p>I recalled the events which had happened this past year and agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, you could say that. Many things happened over this year. Some good, some bad….I met some people, saw some old faces.” A slight frown came to my face as I remembered the events of the party. “Adventure is one word we could use.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t tell him the details however.</p><p><br></p><p>Dave was never the one to ask either. He trusted me on the information I provided him.</p><p><br></p><p>If I didn’t tell him something, he never probed either.</p><p><br></p><p>While it was true that I have become stronger in the past year or so, I was nowhere near the level where my name alone can ascertain his safety.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the best protection I can offer to him is anonymity.</p><p><br></p><p>It protects him from my enemies who would try to harm him due to his connection to me and gives him plausible deniability in case things went south and I had to flee somewhere and things are tracked back.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have offered him money but I knew the old man would feel offended if I did such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about several things over the night.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, a girl, you say?” He asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I could tell that he was already drunk.</p><p><br></p><p>That stuff <em>was</em> strong. It was something made by Tannin’s dragons using special fruits grown by him and aged for centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>“She has a very….unique personality.” Lavy really did have a unique personality. “Unique but very refreshing personality.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you finally got a girl, eh. Good for you, brat. Good for you.” He raised me a glass.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am fourteen.” I deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? What’s up with that? Back in my day….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shush shush shush….please let’s not talk about that. Seriously, Matsu was like this too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, she’s….well she is someone I met afterwards and she now stays and works for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh hoh, two girls. Working quite fast, I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know the old man had this side to him too….or was this because he was seriously drunk today.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for one more hour and by the end of it, he was slurring so I carried him back to his room, behind the shop and closed the shop.</p><p><br></p><p>He was already asleep so I left him a note on the table by his bed along with one of my summoning contracts so that he could summon me if anything happened and he needed my help for anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I set one of my teleportation points for Shambala there and left the place.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to go back today so I went to my room in the town to take a nap.</p><p><br></p><p>There however something surprising was awaiting me.</p><p><br></p><p>There were lights coming from under the door of my room.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone was inside.</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes as I pulled out my wand, ready to check out what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>A simple flick of my wand opened the lock on the door and I kicked the door down to reveal the scene inside.</p><p><br></p><p>There were two people, two girls. One older and one younger.</p><p><br></p><p>The older one almost immediately jumped in front of the younger one who looked scared and dropped her food from the sudden shock of the door being kicked open.</p><p><br></p><p>The most eye-catching things about those two however were the two extra pairs of ears on top of their head and one tail on their back.</p><p><br></p><p>Nekomata.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked closer at them and noticed several details.</p><p><br></p><p>The older one had black hair while the younger one had white hair and both of them had golden eyes, which were staring at me with fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Two names flashed in my mind looking at their forms but I dismissed them quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way that was going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean what are the chances of that happening?</p><p><br></p><p>Me coming back and meeting those two amongst several million people in the Underworld…?</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I asked out first. “Who are you people?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you nya?” The older one asked carefully, with a bit of aggression in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the owner of this place.”</p><p><br></p><p>Which was not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>I actually owned this place.</p><p><br></p><p>The Underworld didn’t have a lack of cheap homes, especially in such outskirts and down trodden places.</p><p><br></p><p>I actually bought this place the first thing when I got enough funds. Dave was the one who did the talking though.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw their faces pale.</p><p><br></p><p>“This place was abandoned. We….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I was out for a long time. The whole place was cleaned if you didn’t realise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“B-b-but, they said we could live here. They even took money.” She complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“They?”</p><p><br></p><p>“T-t-the Demonic Fang hunter group. They said the house belonged to them.” She complained, gaining more courage as she spoke more.</p><p><br></p><p>My Legilimency confirmed that they were not lying.</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Demonic Fang….” Those were the people I briefly hunted in the pits with.</p><p><br></p><p>Did those bastards claim their right over my property?</p><p><br></p><p>“Who told you this and who took money from you?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it was the vice captain.”</p><p><br></p><p>That guy huh….</p><p><br></p><p>I had a brief memory of that guy….and it wasn’t good.</p><p><br></p><p>He was the one who cut my shares down even when I hunted more, stating some sort of protection charge or whatever.</p><p><br></p><p>Later, the other members of the group told me that he did that to everyone and drank off of that money and the only reason no one could tell anything to him was because of his connection to the backers of the Demonic Fang group, the Amy Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>He was also involved in some other shady businesses….</p><p><br></p><p>“What are your names?” I asked, looking at the two girls as I took a seat on my couch and let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m Kuroka and she is my sister, Shirone.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>By now, I was already used to this.</p><p><br></p><p>I was even of the opinion that that damn potion might have become a permanent due to drinking too much of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike human wizards, the demonic power in my body neutralised the poisonous effect of the frequent drinking of that potion.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the fact that I had gulped that potion when I had taken the Demon’s Extract so it actually fusing with my blood is actually not out of the question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I have some news for you two. First, you two were scammed by that fat pig. This house belongs to me and while it’s true that I was the member of the Demonic Fang, I wasn’t a permanent member and I haven’t hunted with them for over a year. By their policies, I must have been kicked out of that group one month after I left this place. Still, it doesn't change the fact that this house belongs to me and me alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka, who was about to say something, shut her mouth at my last words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Second, did you meet someone else from the group or just that pig?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just him. He said he would allow me to hunt in the pits as a part of the group and that he would directly talk to the captain to get me into the best team. Until then I had to avoid the rest of them so that others don’t complain if I am suddenly added to the best team. He then took money from me and sent us here saying that he would contact us. We only left today to hunt for something to eat.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I massaged my head, my mind quickly understanding the implications of their words.</p><p><br></p><p>That fat pig….I knew the type of job he did on the side.</p><p><br></p><p>Smuggling and trafficking people of other races or some pillar devils who would pay a high price for them.</p><p><br></p><p>He however didn’t target any devils, not out of the kindness of his heart but rather because they won’t fetch a good price in the market. That was also the reason why I joined them despite the rumours….well, that and their lowest casualty rates during their hunts in pits.</p><p><br></p><p>These two….probably caught his eyes and were stuck here.</p><p><br></p><p>I just explained the situation to them. It’s better to come out clear in these kinds of things.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, Kuroka’s face paled while Shirone….she didn’t understand what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>It was honestly painful to watch the look of betrayal in Kuroka’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>It reminded me of my own face a few years back.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, I was lucky to have the memories of my previous life and then to meet Dave who took me in soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>These two….they didn’t have any such privilege and were facing what I could have faced….actually, something much worse.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked as the look in her eyes changed to that of suspicion. “Why should I believe you?” She asked. “You could be trying to send us away so that you could get a place instead of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Me….trying to trick you….to get a place in a mid level hunting group?” I looked at them weirdly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I am very strong. You on the other hand don’t look that strong. What’s with that pink hair anyway.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s strawberry blonde!” I retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>She was taken aback at my retort but lashed back. “Like I care. You could be trying to remove competition by sending me awa….”</p><p><br></p><p>Her words weren’t finished as everything around her froze with a spike of ice a few inches from her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I snapped my fingers and the ice disappeared but the girl was terrified now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me, I have no reason to trick <em>anyone</em> to join that team. Oh, and you are not my <a href=\"https://competition….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">competition….at</a> least not as you are now. You shouldn’t jump to conclusions like that. Didn’t Fujimai teach you anything…?” I suddenly realised what I said.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected the two girls froze and looked at me with wide eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….knew Okaa-sama?”</p><p><br></p><p>I winced, quickly thinking of ways to solve this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“I met her once or twice. I recalled the names Kuroka and Shirone and honestly, there is very little chance of that being a coincidence here. Two Nekoshou siblings, named exactly the same, with the same coloured hair and eyes….” I slowly weaved the lies and they looked more or less convinced and I let out a sigh. “Anyways, you people should leave this place.” I put a hand in my pocket and brought out a few golden Liliums and threw them on the bed. “Here’s some money if you need it. Trust me, I wouldn’t bother if I hadn’t been helped by her once.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka looked at me and then at the coins, slowly taking them.</p><p><br></p><p>“You two can stay here for the night but leave in the morning when I leave. This place is not safe for you two.”</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t sure about bringing them with me as they knew about my real appearance and I didn’t trust them enough. I was not a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka nodded and I flicked my wand transfigured one of the tables into another bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You two can sleep there.” I told them before removing my cloak and laying on the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Today had been mentally exhausting for me and I really didn’t have the power nor the mood to deal with any of this right now but not before using some security charms around my bed and some across the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Laying on the bed alone, I closed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow the bed which used to feel small before, was now feeling unusually empty now.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I was really used to having Lavy and Matsu sleeping with me.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, my sleep was broken by the banging on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuroka. Kuroka, are you in there?” I heard the rough voice of a guy from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards the girl being addressed and saw her looking at the door in fear, while holding her sister close against her chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a finger on my lips, signalling them to be quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>One night of sleep….was it really so hard to ask for?</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly thinking of a plan, I flicked my wand, transfiguring a small compartment under the floor and signalled them to hide there.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka quickly nodded and dragged her sister down and I transfigured the compartment to hide them and opened the door myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside was the guy I remembered from a year ago. He was still as fat as before.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t even understand how he could be fat, especially with the limited transformation abilities which devils possessed.</p><p><br></p><p>Like it was literally as easy as continuously wanting to not be ugly and you be handsome as models.</p><p><br></p><p>It just showed that the guy didn’t even give a damn about his appearance or rather, he was too lazy to give a damn.</p><p><br></p><p>“Haa….who are you?” He shouted, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Even from this distance, I could smell the scent of alcohol from his breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the one who lives here.” I answered stoically. “The owner of the place.” I added, looking at the confusion on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>He stepped back for a moment, looked at the house and then looked inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“You liar. This house belongs to the Demonic Fang Hunter Group.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bullshit. While I did work for the Demonic Fang group, I left around a year ago and I owed them nothing. This place is still mine. I have the papers too.” I replied back, raising my voice as I did.</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes as he looked at me. “You are that brat who left without saying anything eh….”</p><p><br></p><p>“There were no rules for temporary members to inform anyone to leave the group.” I replied not backing down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Meh….not my problem. Where are the two girls, those nekomata?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What nekomata?” I pretended not to understand his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two girls, one black haired and one white haired with cat like ears. Where are they? They were supposed to stay here.” He questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>I feigned a look of confusion. “I haven’t seen anyone since I moved in and I have been here for over two days. Took me a while to replace all the furniture and clean the place. I didn’t see anyone come here.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face morphed into an even uglier and more demonic form.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those two….animals! They ran away. Damn it. I had such a good deal with the Naberius. Ahhhhhh!” He smashed the side of my wall, throwing a large chunk of the wall aside.</p><p><br></p><p>The Naberius.</p><p><br></p><p>So, he was really involved with those bastards. If so then this whole thing is far bigger than I can afford to piss off without attracting any attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….what are you doing?” I shouted, pretending to panic a bit, getting away a little from the door. I checked around to see if anyone else was outside.</p><p><br></p><p>There were none.</p><p><br></p><p>My privacy charms were not noticed but me moving back attracted the attention of the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“You! It was your fault.” He grabbed my shirt, raising me in the air. “Do you know how expensive those two bitches were? They were Nekoshou….an extremely rare breed of Nekomata. If I could have sold those two, I could have lived decades with the money I earned from the deal. And now because of you, they are gone. Because of you!”</p><p><br></p><p>He tried pressing my neck and I could feel that he was <a href=\"https://strong….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strong….at</a> least middle class level.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad the man was too intoxicated to notice that it did nothing to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I flicked my wrist, the wand in my sleeve coming out. “Imperio.”</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that I had to use more demonic power to force the spell than normal. Was it because he was stronger than my previous targets or was it because of his demonic power? Because there is no way I can see this guy as having the willpower to overpower the spell any day.</p><p><br></p><p>I know for once that High Class Devil children, both from pillar families and extra demons, get lessons to resist basic mind control as well as mind magic to wipe out memories and charm other people in the human world.</p><p><br></p><p>This gets harder as the other side has knowledge of magic but if someone doesn’t know the correct methods, even someone with Satan Class reserves could fall prey to basic hypnosis.</p><p><br></p><p>But did my Imperio work similarly or this fat pig have some formal training?</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it made sense that he would have some degree of mental defences if he was dabbling in such businesses.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me down.” I ordered and he let go of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I straightened my shirt, repaired it with another charm and then looked at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you and who else is with you here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am Magarath Belius, the vice leader of the Demonic Fang group. I am here alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>Good. I fixed the wall he had shattered and made him kneel a distance away from me, conjuring some chains and tying him up, casting an Unbreakable Charm on the chains.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you working for and will they find you here if they searched?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am dealing with the Naberius House, providing them with people from different species. They are conducting some experiments on them. No. I kept this place a secret so that they didn’t steal those two girls by themselves.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and controlled myself and asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many people have you sent here before this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This was the first time. The two girls were very expensive. I knew this place belonged to a kid who had gone missing and hadn’t shown up in the town for over a year, probably died somewhere and so I hid them here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Does anyone else know about your connection to this place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Will anyone try to find you in this place?” I asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and opened the place where Kuroka and Shirone were hiding.</p><p><br></p><p>“You both heard it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The younger one was confused but scared while the older one was angrily looking at the pig.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have three options. Come with me. I will drop you at some other place from where you can go anywhere you like. Second, I could arrange for someone to take you to the Nura Clan, the Eastern Youkai faction of Japan. He knew your mother and might have a place for you two to grow. Third, you can leave on your own now but I doubt it would be safe. The Naberius are a well to do house and if they are searching for people of other species then you might be in danger if you stay anywhere near here. Choose.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just stared at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….we….the Nura Clan. Please take us to the Eastern Youkai faction.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Okay. Wait here for me for a few minutes. I will be back.” I nodded at them and turned towards the fat pig.</p><p><br></p><p>Using the Dimensional Formation Shambala, I teleported us to one of the spots I had kept the mark in. This place was in the forests near the pits for just this kind of thing. Reaching there, I checked the area and found no one around and got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my hand to his face and my Demonic Power flared, freezing him completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Then with a wave of my wand, I transfigured him into a marble and crushed it and banished the marble all over the place before teleporting away from there.</p><p><br></p><p>When I reached back, the two sisters were huddled together.</p><p><br></p><p>I flicked my wand, erasing all traces of us being there and looked at the two girls. “Come. Make sure you don’t let go of my hands. And most importantly, completely forget whatever happened here today.” I ordered and they nodded seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>With them holding my hand tightly, I teleported away using Shambala.</p><p><br></p><p>I appeared near the building where C.C stayed and entered the place with the two girls.</p><p><br></p><p>Telling the two to wait downstairs, I walked up to where C.C’s office was.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I opened the door to her office, I had a gun pointed at my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you and what are you doing here?” The green haired witch looked at me with narrowed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when I remembered, I hadn’t shown her my real face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the one who made the deal with you Miss C.C. This is what I look like. I guess Matsu has told you about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>A look of realisation came to her face but she didn’t let down her gun. “Prove it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“The last person you bestowed the Geass to was Lelouch Vi Britannia.”</p><p><br></p><p>She lowered the gun with that statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have pink hair.” She said looking at my hair with a look of awe.</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes twitched. “It’s strawberry blonde.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. It’s pink. Pink is cute.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I have two kids with me. Let them stay here for a while. I will pick them up in my disguise in a little while.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked confused but nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>We went down together and I introduced them to C.C as a friend.</p><p><br></p><p>“She will arrange for a way for you to get to the Nura Clan soon. If you need anything, you can ask her.” I patted Shirone’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka bowed deeply. “Thank you. I will repay this favour to you one day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t mind. Just stay safe and grow stronger. You want to protect your sister, don’t you? Then train and become stronger. The world is very dangerous and when everything is gone, you only have your own power to rely on. You are lucky that you have a family member like her. Cherish her and look out for each other. Stay safe.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went outside and changed into my Ace disguise and teleported back to the mansion where I lived.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace! You are back.” Lavy’s voice greeted me the first thing as I appeared in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that she was in the process of changing into my shirt. Hasn’t she gone to sleep yet?”</p><p><br></p><p>Matsu’s room’s door opened almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace.” She came rushing in too. “Are you….umm alright now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am fine. You all haven’t gone to bed yet? It’s four am in the morning?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, we have a holiday today and Lavy was worried about you….I was worried too so we just stayed up watching some movies with each other. We were just about to go to bed when you came back. So, how was your trip? Did you get what you were looking for?” She asked as she helped me out of my cloak and I sat down on the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. There were, however, some surprises.” I explained the situation to them in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….you saved two girls who were about to be kidnapped and sold to others?” Matsu asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “More or less, yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those people were bad. You did the right thing.” Lavy added with a nod of her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, the thing is, they know my real face.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The one with the pink hair.” Lavy asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“....it’s strawberry blonde.” I protested with a sigh</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, it’s pink alright. I actually like it too. You look like an adorable cotton candy that I just want to gobble up.” Matsu giggled perversely.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways….” I took control of the situation before they double teamed me into their pace. “They don’t know who I am or what my name is so don’t accidentally tell them, alright. Here, I will just be the Magician Ace and no one else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good, then I will bring the two sisters tomorrow. For now, I want to take a nap.” I said as I laid down on the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other and joined me on either side of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm….this was much better.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Saelena -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The meeting was finished as all of them finalised all the aspects of the competition, setting up rules for the competition and different rounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka expected the first competition to get participants in the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands and only two hundred of them would be offered seats.</p><p><br></p><p>It was becoming evident to them, just how much of a loophole they had ignored all these years.</p><p><br></p><p>They obviously had to think of several rounds to the competition to reduce the number of competition.</p><p><br></p><p>Her plans were to sell tickets for the whole competition and use the collected money to open up places to educate the Low Class Devils and give them better opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>There were no schools or even places where Low Class Devils could learn anything. The few privately owned businesses who provided such services were too costly for normal Low Class Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>While they couldn’t give out more seats to people at this point, they could always provide them with better opportunities at their current ranks.</p><p><br></p><p>And if everything went as they had planned then they could probably increase the number of references offered every competition too or decrease the gap between each Recommendation Games from Ten Years to something less….maybe four years like the Olympics at first.</p><p><br></p><p>All this work had kept them awake for the last few weeks but when she thought about the result of all this, she felt a smile on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“To think all this came out due to a kid playing around with bugs….” Falbium complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe, it was better than playing with Dragons. The youngest Ultimate Class Magician in history. That name has already spread like fire through all the pillar houses. Even my father was asking me about it. Too bad we didn’t have any ongoing contracts with High Class Magicians from Grauzaberer recently so we were not invited to the party.” Serafall laughed. “Any news from that side yet?” She asked, looking at Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>Saelena looked at him too.</p><p><br></p><p>While it might not look like it, Ajuka was probably the most excited one about the whole sentence/apprenticeship thing.</p><p><br></p><p>If she knew him even a bit then he would already have all the details about the kid in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Today is the party to celebrate him becoming an Ultimate Class. I think McGreggor Mathers has gone there too along with several of the top Rating Games players.” He replied, looking at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She shrugged. “I haven’t talked to McGreggor for a while. I was busy with all this work.” She wasn’t even lying. She had been working overtime.</p><p><br></p><p>She in turn looked at Grayfia who nodded and connected to her bishop and got the gist of the party.</p><p><br></p><p>Invitations from Rating Game players and other magician organisations and an altercation with Bedeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the kid was always fiery. I can see him snapping at the douchebag.” Serafall said.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as they were talking, the communication magic circle in front of them lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka projected the call on the screen in front of them and to their surprise, it was Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>“Talk of the devil.” Serafall joked as the man appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good evening all of you. I didn’t expect to catch all of you together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good evening to you too, Lord Mephisto. I thought you would be busy with the party.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, the party ended. Ace may be an Ultimate Class but he was still a kid. He has to keep his sleep schedules.” The man laughed at his own joke.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled at his joke.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Ajuka. “I am here to ask about the schedule of his <em>apprenticeship</em>. Due to his new status, I have to make changes in all my classes and it would be a great help if you could tell me about what your schedules would be like.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka looked in thought for a moment and shrugged casually. “Weekends would be fine although he would have to serve an entire sixty days so thirty weeks starting this weekend. If he does extra days, he can complete them early but if he misses weeks, he will have to work more weeks. I will however not permit anything more than a year to complete this. It is a punishment no matter how it sounds. ” He completed his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“That sounds just fine. You don’t have to worry about him. The kid is extremely professional at work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s kinda difficult to believe, especially hearing that he had an altercation with Bedeze Abaddon just a few hours ago.” Falbium said, waking up briefly from his nap.</p><p><br></p><p>A wince appeared on Mephisto’s face followed by a look of slight anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Whatever Bedeze got was what he deserved. If anything, I am quite proud of Ace for being able to hold back that much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? Wasn’t it just because of Bedeze something bad about his apprentice?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That fool was insulting the daughter of Baraqiel and my pawn Shuri Himejima. Both the mother and daughter are quite close to Ace and consider him their saviour. The thing with Bedeze though….that was not that simple….sigh. You will get the boy at the weekend anyways, You will know then. Just spare me. I don’t want to give away the information and break our deal.” Mephisto shook his head and waved off the whole topic looking like he really wanted nothing to do with it anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>She raised an eyebrow at his cryptic words but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka and him negotiated some dates and he cut off the call leaving them to their work.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up late in the morning, feeling refreshed.</p><p><br></p><p>The two girls were still sleeping, holding me in a stranglehold from both sides which would have suffocated normal people. Not that it mattered with my physique.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t disturb their sleep and slowly slipped out of the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I was ready, the two woke up too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Go-ood Morning.” Lavy greeted as she stretched.</p><p><br></p><p>Matsu cleaned her glasses and did the same in a sleepy tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Morning. I will leave early today. Have some work to do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, are you going to bring the sisters?” Matsu asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I need to talk to Mephisto too. I guess there will be some changes for my class schedule with my new rank.”</p><p><br></p><p>On the way out, I went and met Shuri and Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>They were already awake and had already prepared breakfast.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you are back already. Lavy told me that you went out yesterday and would return later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I came back at four in the morning. Those two were watching movies all night and slept very late. They will be out in a while.” I said as I got down to eat my food.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about usual stuff today but I could see that both the mother and daughter were a bit more….loving than before.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t to say they were faking it before but they felt much closer today.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it because of what happened yesterday?</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be bringing some guests today. They might have to stay here for a few days. I hope you won’t mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, there won't be any problems. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I left the place and appeared at my office building where C.C lived.</p><p><br></p><p>Walking inside without knocking the door, I found a strange scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Pizza boxes all over the place while all three girls were lazing around on the couches and watching TV.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, do you eat Pizza, three times a day?” I asked as I cleaned the whole thing with a snap of a finger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Five times.” The green haired girl replied without any shame.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know, you don’t have your code anymore. If you eat that much you will become….” I dodged the pizza box thrown at my face before I could complete my sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>“I exercise enough.” She said curtly and I didn’t pursue the topic any further.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, these two are the people whom you want to send to the Nura Clan?” I asked, looking at the two girls.</p><p><br></p><p>She just looked at me blandly. “Yes. It was a request from an idiot.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will see what I can do. It might take a few days though. Come with me, you two.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at C.C and me alternatively.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should go with him. He might look scary but he won’t do anything to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>My lips twitched a bit at the girl’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka stared at me, staring at me closely and narrowed her eyes a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Any problems, little miss?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head and then turned to C.C and thanked her.</p><p><br></p><p>Shirone however hugged the green haired girl who caressed her head, especially her ears, making her purr. I even saw a smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, looks like the two of them get along quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, she has always had a penchant towards cute things and these two girls, especially Shirone, looked extremely adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>I took them and left for the mansion where we were staying.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, Kuroka just kept staring at me suspiciously, so much so that I couldn’t help but ask. “Is there something on my face? What are you staring at?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! N-no. It’s nothing.” She stuttered a bit and quieted down.</p><p><br></p><p>The mansion was nearby as Matsu still couldn’t teleport and neither could C.C and they needed somewhere close to work.</p><p><br></p><p>I directly took them to Shuri’s place as I could hear Lavy and Matsu’s voices coming from there.</p><p><br></p><p>They were probably having breakfast….although it was time for lunch by now.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace-kun. And these two are your guests, I presume.” Shuri, who was currently serving food to the two girls, looked at me and asked. “Oh my, what adorable guests. Ace-kun is really great with girls. What are your names, children?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The elder one is Kuroka and the younger is Shirone.” I introduced the two girls. “They will be staying with us for a while till I can find a way for them to get to the Eastern Youkai Faction in Japan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Nura Clan? I see. So these two are a part of the Nura Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, not really. Their late mother had acquaintances in the Nura Clan. These two were apparently lost in the Underworld and were about to be trafficked by some foul people. They were saved by….a friend of a friend who brought them here. I was contracted to get them there.” I told them the excuse I had made last night.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw a sad look come to Shuri’s eyes as she looked at the two girls and then at Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I could understand her thinking too. If it hadn’t been for our sudden visit, Akeno could have been in a similar situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you two like to have breakfast?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….we….we ate an hour ago.” Kuroka answered while Shirone just looked at the food, a slight drool on the side of her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You all had pizza. That’s not good for your health. Seriously, all that girl has for food is pizza and then gets angry when I say she will get fat. Get something to eat here. I will go and talk to Mephisto and see if I can arrange something to get you to the Nura Clan soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fat….you didn’t call C-chan, fat did you? That’s horrible, Ace.” Matsu said as she looked at me in horror.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the other girls did the same while Shuri just shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t….call her fat. I said she would get fat if all she eats is pizza, three or as she accepted, five times a day. That’s not healthy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t say such things to girls, Ace-kun. They will hate you for it.” Shuri chided.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, Shirone had already taken a seat beside Lavy who was caressing her ears while the girl purred in delight.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….will keep that in mind. Anyways, I need to go for now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take care.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“The Eastern Youkai faction? I don’t have any dealings with them but if it’s just delivering someone there, then it might not be hard. Still, two Nekoshous you say. They would be great Peerage members. You could take those two in if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those two have had a hard life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I am sure you won’t treat them badly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think staying with some other youkai their age will be the best for their development. Nekoshou are extremely talented in Senjutsu and Youjutsu. While I could teach them magic, I doubt I could provide them with the ideal environment for their best growth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That I can agree with. Very well, I will see what I can do. It might take some time though as I don’t have any direct connection with the youkai factions. Actually, Azazel might lend a hand here.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded at his suggestion. I did know that Azazel had dealings with the most number of factions among anyone from the Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils didn’t have the best of the reputations and surprisingly, neither did Angels or the Church as they had encroached on the lands of other factions and done a lot of damage to them back when their father was alive….and long lived races don’t forget so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>In turn, the Fallen Angels who left their father’s side and even fought against him as well as the Devils, were welcomed by other factions more easily.</p><p><br></p><p>“On the other hand, your <em>apprenticeship</em> will be starting in one week. I hope you are ready for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What will be the schedule?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was decided that you would have to work there for two months but I negotiated as you couldn’t just disappear from the classes after becoming an Ultimate Class. Moreover, someone of your level has many other duties such as attending conferences and meetings. We agreed to let you serve the sixty days over a period of the next year. Every weekend, you can stay there and work and return. If there are official holidays here, you can work those out and end the sentence earlier too. This was the best I could get. Most of it was due to you becoming the youngest Ultimate Class though. Use it well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I guess it really was the best I could get.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are welcome. By the way, find some time to give me a list of your free days. I need to arrange for your visit to the Golden Dawn for lectures.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then off you go. I need to prepare the documents for new students. Do you see all the work you have landed me with?” He said while pointing towards the pile of paperwork on his desk.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not that you dislike it?” I rolled my eyes, already used to his antics.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, on the contrary, I enjoy it more than I thought I would. Just imagining the time I would have when I brag to those bastards’ faces….So leave me alone to have some fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“See you then.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ace in the Hole’</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Few things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ace met with Dave again and encountered two stray catgirls and rescued them</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter didn’t have any deals.

Just my luck.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You still have experience with the class which they will never be able to get by using the Class Card.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess. So….what do we do with the extra three?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep them for others who can become core members of the Team. I think Mage might be a requirement for many higher level classes like Magic Knight or something.” I replied and looked at them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sounds reasonable. It will give us some flexibility in the team too. Anything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that I looked at the other rewards.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Title: The First Guild Master</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Effect: +20 CHA, +2% Experience Gain to your Guild Members as long as you are the Guild Master.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>That’s actually a very good gift.</p><p><br></p><p>“I got a title and two more Perk Points.” I explained the effects of the Title and Shiroe wrote it down too.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s very good for a title and the Guild Perk Points are always good to have. As for what to invest in, we need something which our Guild will need to attract people first. Since we are planning to focus on exploring, we should use the Power of Friendship, Hard Bargain and Adventurer's Luck.” He said, and then after some more thought added, “Just in case, get Power of Friendship first and see if we can get something else for Level 2 of that Skill. Before that add us to the guild first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I did as he said and light flashed around me.</p><p><br></p><p>Power of Friendship Level 1 was active.</p><p><br></p><p>Just below it a few more things appeared though.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Power of Friendship Level 2: +10% Increase in Experience Gain when in a party with your Guild Member</strong></p><p><strong>Cost: 2 Perk Points</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that another perk appeared.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Friends with Benefits: +5% Gold Coin Drops when in Party with another Guild Member</strong></p><p><strong>Cost: 1 Perk Point.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Another perk appeared along with level 2 of the Power of Friendship Perk.” I said while Shiroe and Veena were checking the rest of the Guild Options.</p><p><br></p><p>“So it’s in the form of a Perk Tree. I just looked at the Guild System and our Guild is at Level 1 and we need experience to Level up the Guild. We need to figure out how we get the experience for Guild Levels. If we get more perk points, we can discuss how to spend those. For now, Power of Friendship Level 2 sounds better. 10% Experience boost is massive at this stage, especially for the lower level players.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then.” I added the last 2 Guild Perk Points to the Power of Friendship and got it to level 2.</p><p><br></p><p>My added experience gains were insane at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, 10% more gains. That’s awesome. This is the first time I have seen something which gives Experience gains” Shiroe cheered as he checked the Guild Menu.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly felt guilty for hiding my other bonuses.</p><p><br></p><p>With the rate my titles and other effects were piling up, they would very soon see the difference. With my increased experience, I have been able to keep up the same pace as the rest of them even when I am one Tier higher than them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not just that. There would come a time when someone from other Villages who also got this title meets us and if they disclose the information, I would lose the trust of my teammates for keeping such a secret from them.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, Shooting Star might have one too since he was so fast and from another village. It was actually a surprise that someone got to Tier 2 before Shiroe in his village and hadn’t revealed the title.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to come out with this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something the matter, Arthas?” Veena asked, looking at me in worry.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….This is not the first Experience Gain buff I have seen.” I said finally.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Are there more?” Shiroe asked, quite curious.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is another title….or rather a series of titles which can give similar effects.” I started.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, which one?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I got it when I became the first Player to get Tier 2 Player from my village. It gave a +10% Increase in Experience Gain.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….I didn’t know there was a title like that. I guess I wasn’t the first person to get Tier 2 in my village then. What’s the title called?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It….well it’s called ‘One in Hundred’.” I answered, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, that’s a bummer. I missed that.” He sighed and then looked at me. “Anything else? Wait, you said a series of titles.” He completed with realisation hitting him.</p><p><br></p><p>I scratched my cheeks awkwardly. “Yeah. The title upgraded to ‘One in a thousand’, ‘One in ten thousand’ and ‘One in a million’ when I gained T3, T4 and just now the T5 Job first in my Town, Prefecture and Country. With each upgrade, the Experience Gain was increased by ten percent.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....40%. You have 40%, no wait, 52% more experience gain! That’s hax dude. No wonder, you could keep up with our levelling speed even at your level. I honestly thought you were some kind of special NPC for a while or that it might be due to the Class you were using.” And he went on and on.</p><p><br></p><p>….actually I had 66% extra Experience gain right now but The Traveller was where I drew the line.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way I could explain that to them in a normal way.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s awesome!” He exclaimed at the end of his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“....you guys are not angry?” I asked, surprised at their lack of mistrust.</p><p><br></p><p>“Angry? Why?” The man asked, confused while Veena just chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess Arthas here was feeling guilty for keeping the fact from us all this time.” Veena explained as she looked at me. “You don’t need to worry about us. That title….we never had any chance of getting that. If it hadn't been for you, it would have taken me far longer to get to the level I am now. I would have been Tier 1 while you were Tier 3. Shiroe didn’t have any chance either as the title of the Prefecture Level was already obtained by you and we have been hunting together since then and his levelling speed has only increased.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is right. I mean I would have been angry if you had hidden something which could have been shared from everyone to yourself alone. That would have been different. But this….well, we never had any chance at it so no reason to get angry. Although, do tell us such things from now on or I would be depressed about sucking at the game if I can’t keep up.” Shirone added too.</p><p><br></p><p>“....thanks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great, now that that’s done. What else do we need to check? Hmm, let’s see. There is a limit to Guild members and it increases with Guild Level. Currently we have a limit of one hundred members and with fifteen Guild Levels, we can get more later on. You two should use the Class Cards by the way and see if you can unlock any other Classes.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and Veena picked up the Class Card too, using it herself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>T4 Class: Mage Unlocked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>T5 Class: Magic Knight Unlocked</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As expected, there was another option for Knight.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic Knight was below Holy Knight I guess.</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed more things and explored the Guild option. I saw that the location we were currently in was set as our Guild Hall so I guess we <em>could</em> rent the place.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of it, we were quite late and decided to part ways.</p><p><br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, I was dragged to the bedroom by Veena. This being the third day, I was more used to the situation and handled myself quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>As I lay there, in the bed with her, I recalled something and spoke up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Veena.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That thing you said about not trusting another person in the forest over a human. Does it apply to us as well?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my! Has that been worrying you? Is that why you were feeling guilty and came out clean with your title and its effects?” She giggled.</p><p><br></p><p>“No….not really. I could just never….bring the subject up.” I finished.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because we were not that close back then. I can understand your reason perfectly well. I can see people trying to kill you to remove you from the way so that they could gain the titles for themselves. Revealing something like that takes a certain amount of trust between people. As for my words….I meant the general behaviour of people. I won’t lie and say that I trusted you from the first time I met you. I might be good at reading people but I don’t give out my trust so easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And has that changed now?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled at my question. “For our first month, I always kept enough poison with me to take down a dozen people for protection in case something….bad happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly felt a severe chill run down my spine and looked at her with wide open eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>First month….and that was when she was teasing me with views of her in a towel….</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at my expression and put a hand on my head. “And now you are sleeping with me in the same bed. Does that give you your answer?”</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to say anything but couldn’t find words.</p><p><br></p><p>She spoke again, breaking the silence between us. “Since we are talking about secrets, let me tell you something else.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and by now she knew my ‘go on’ look enough to continue.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you know about our world, Arthas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Our world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Our world. And I do not mean the one inside this….game. Our own world.” Seeing my confused look she continued. “Our world is….not as simple as you see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is a huge world outside of what people….normal people know of.” She continued and then turned on her back to look at the ceiling.</p><p><br></p><p>“You mean the Underworld, gangs and all that?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Underworld, yes. Gangs and….all <a href=\"https://that….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that….no</a>. The ones I mean is the Supernatural. Gods and Dragons, Angels and Devils, monsters from the myths….the stories you might have heard as a kid….are mostly true.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I am a reincarnator and the Game Master was almost one hundred percent another reincarnator but apart from that I hadn’t noticed anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure, they can be hidden but the chances of that are too low.</p><p><br></p><p>Is this her new way to pull a prank on me? She always ups her game when I stop giving her reactions she expects.</p><p><br></p><p>I just rolled my eyes and smiled. “I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t look like you believe me.” She smiled looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “I mean, would you if you were in my place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, point. And I don’t have anything as evidence to show you either so it will be hard to make you believe. Anyways, just treat this as me opening up about my own secret. Then, where was I, ah yes. Supernatural is real and I am one of them. Can you guess what?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her mischievous smile and decided to play her game. “Do I have any options?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep guessing then. When you guess what I am, I will tell you more about myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and shook my head. “Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, are you not afraid that I could be something dangerous like a monster or a demon?”</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes. “You don’t need to be a monster to be dangerous. You are plenty dangerous by yourself.” I added with a laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, you have such a silver tongue.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But then again, why even disclose something like that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The same reason as you. A show of trust.”</p><p><br></p><p>I got the rest of her unsaid words. ‘So that if one day I find out about her from an outside source, we don’t just break apart.’</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are welcome. Now come here, I want my favourite pillow “</p><p><br></p><p>With that she pulled me to her and hugged me.</p><p><br></p><p>I too was tired from all the stuff that happened today and decided to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Supernatural <a href=\"https://world….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">world….it</a> might be true or it might be a prank. Anyways, it was outside this game and none of my concern for now.</p><p><br></p><p>I had enough on my plate to worry about. I didn’t need more. I mean just imagine I tire myself out and </p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched as the boy slept peacefully.</p><p><br></p><p>Revealing information about herself was a risky move on her part, especially considering that inside this place, she didn’t have her power or identity to cover up for her. It was one of the reasons she was far more careful than she would normally be.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the past few months, she had come to trust Arthas and Shiroe quite a bit but she had been alive for over a thousand years and had seen trusted people turn on one another at the turn of a hat. Right now, she was not in a position where she could take any chances.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason she only left him with this much information was because she was banking on him not knowing about the Supernatural and giving him time to think about things will help him make his own assumptions, something that he is comfortable with and probably acclimate to the idea of her being a non human.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, she can see his reaction to other races and his thoughts about them and decide how to proceed from there. Although, she hoped he would be more understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>She had come to like the boy quite a bit in these months and would hate to see their relationship suffer due to her identity. It was why she took the initiative to tell him about it on her own lest he finds out about it later on from someone else in which case saving their relationship would be extremely hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils didn’t have a good reputation….and for a good reason. Although it was far better now than it was when she was younger, it still wasn’t anything stellar.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, when she saw him breathing peacefully like this, she could help but think that he would be more understanding than normal people.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas has shown himself to be far more mature than regular people as well as very accommodating in his world views.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s all our collection from the raid. Our members have all taken spots within the top ten which is beyond any of our expectations when this whole thing began.” Henreitta said as she put her skill book on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked around her, at the faces of her team members and recalled how far they had come since the starting of the game….or could they even call it a game anymore?….</p><p><br></p><p>She blamed herself everyday for dragging her peerage members into this mess and making them risk their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>The revelation of being trapped inside the game had devastated her, especially when she realised that their lives were in real danger.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only thing that drove her to action was the wish to find her Peerage members and try to make things right.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, she put her all into this game.</p><p><br></p><p>Working tirelessly, to gain just one more level and increase her strength to aid her in her search for her friends.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe due to luck, she was able to reunite with Koneko in the nearby town but she didn’t know about the others.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno and Gasper….how must they be doing?</p><p><br></p><p>Were they okay?</p><p><br></p><p>Were they hurt in the raid?</p><p><br></p><p>Over time, she had found some other people who had been in a similar situation as her.</p><p><br></p><p>Some new while some extremely surprising and together they grouped up, trying to cover each other’s back.</p><p><br></p><p>The blonde woman in front of her was Umeko Miyanozaka or as she is known in the game….Henrietta.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a twenty four years old accountant from Japan. She had entered the game with the rest of her friends from her guild in another game called the Elder Tales to build their guild here….and this happened.</p><p><br></p><p>In game, she is a bard. Apparently, she had experience playing this class in her previous game and she was actually really good at it.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias had to agree that their success in the raid was greatly due to her skills which boosted their stats and helped them get an edge in the battle.</p><p><br></p><p>The second member was another girl and an unexpected surprise at that.</p><p><br></p><p>Le Fay Pendragon or the Fairy Magician as she was called in game was an unexpected addition to their team.</p><p><br></p><p>Her name was something quite well known even among supernatural circles. The young princess of the Pendragon family as an up and coming Magician and a once in a century genius of Magic with talents rivalling her namesake.</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard that she and her brother had run away from their family due to some disagreement and there were more than a few houses who wanted to recruit them but no one was able to find any signs of them anywhere, not to mention the chance of starting a war with the Pendragon family and the Church if they did. For this reason, this news was only known to select few people at the heads of the houses.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason she even knew about them was due to Mathers bringing up the news.</p><p><br></p><p>He was after all one of the founders of Golden Dawn and still kept in touch with the organisation so getting such news was easy for him. She had heard the news when he was reporting to her brother.</p><p><br></p><p>She had met the girl in the beginner's village and the two had been together since then and she wouldn’t lie but she had grown quite fond of the girl too.</p><p><br></p><p>She had obviously asked her about why they ran away and what they were doing while hiding and the things she found….was beyond shocking….not just for her but also for Koneko.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t gone mad.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth about what exactly happened back then had completely shaken her rook, and it had taken them lots of effort to bring her out of her shock. Koneko did eventually pull herself back together with the goal of finishing this game and go out to see her sister again to apologise to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias totally supported her in this decision of hers. In fact, she was going to ask her brother to have the case investigated once more and clear Kuroka’s name.</p><p><br></p><p>Le Fay was a mage in the game and quite good at it too. Koneko on the other hand became a Brawler and then a Martial Artist just like her real life self. She was the main tank of the team.</p><p><br></p><p>The last member of their team was someone who stood out the most in their team.</p><p><br></p><p>Chief or Nyanta was someone whom Henrietta brought to the team. She recognised him from her previous game, although he supposedly looked very different in this one.</p><p><br></p><p>Chief was an old man in his forties who had a very calm presence and was a great chef. He was always calm and collected and was hardly surprised by anything. The man was truly a gentleman even when he was fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>He was an Apprentice Swordsman who was going to become a T4 Swordsman any day now. Not to mention the fact that he was the most experienced player in their team.</p><p><br></p><p>And lastly was her, a Mage and the leader of the team.</p><p><br></p><p>Their team was quite balanced and all they needed was a good healer and now, with their performance in the World Quest, perhaps she could get someone good to fill up the healer’s position.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>One step at a time. They would become stronger and she would find her peerage members and bring them out of this game.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that it would have helped a lot if she could communicate with them even for a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Game didn’t even allow them to speak with each other if they weren’t in a party or guild apparently….but from what she had found out, that was a long way off.</p><p><br></p><p>She had just reached the T4 Mage Class even after risking her life in the raid. As far as she knew, making a guild required a minimum of T5 which was months if not a year away. She doubted anyone else was going to be making any guilds anytime soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, a message appeared in front of her eyes, making her eyes widen in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“The First Player Guild in the world of Arcana has been established.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“The Fairy Tail Guild has been established.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shiroe -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Five hundred thousand gold coins is just robbery!” Shiroe complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, you asked me for a price and I gave you one.” Gareth shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Even something with these stats will not cost more than two hundred and fifty thousand gold coins.”</p><p><br></p><p>“For others maybe….but you lot have four other pieces of the set, don’t you. With these two you would have six, only one piece below the total seven pieces with that juicy set effect. That alone makes it worth double the gold coins.” Gareth smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s true that we have four pieces but the piece you have will only give us the five piece stat effects. Even then, it would not be worth the price. At this point, you people are just trying to blackmail.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think you realise how business works, kid. Supply and demand. A bottle of water might be free in one place and cost a thousand dollars in others. You need the items. We don’t need to sell them. We hold the advantage in the negotiation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, if you don’t buy it at this price, you lose out the effects of that seven piece set effect but if we don’t sell it, we would still have the above average pieces of armour while also dragging down our biggest competition in the town.” The guy beside him, Messer, smiled arrogantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>As discussed yesterday, they had gone out to search for Gareth and Dwain, the first thing in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>The seven piece effect was too much for them to give up.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had decided to stay back at home and try out the new recipes. The Greater Healing Pill and the Miasma Pill were going to be a great help for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>So it was just him and Arthas. On the way here, they met Star right outside the Inn and he joined them as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding them was not hard either. Shiroe already knew their usual resting place.</p><p><br></p><p>But as he had thought, the other party was being stubborn.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, I am not so heartless. We can always reduce the price if you offer any of those Skill Books you know.” Gareth continued with a smile. “How about four hundred thousand and two Skill Books.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. So you have no intention of trading honestly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey hey, it’s not like we don’t have any intention of trading. You people just don’t want a fair price. We will not sell our hard earned loot for lower prices.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to say something more but felt a hand on his shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let it be, Shiroe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?” He asked. He already had another idea in mind to bring them in line.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Arthas nodded and then turned towards the other party. “Thank you for giving us your precious time. Too bad we can’t agree to your prices. Our final price is two hundred and fifty thousand gold coins. We do not have a budget above this. If you can’t agree to that, then we will depart.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s too low. I did offer them to you cheaper if you added some Skill Books. You lot have a bunch of them after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That is not possible. I apologise for wasting your time.” Arthas replied, politely and got up. “Let’s go, Shiroe. We have to prepare for the evening’s event.” He then turned back towards them. “Oh, please come to the meeting.” Arthas smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Shiroe wasn’t into guys or anything but Arthas was damn handsome and had a smile which would have made girls in his college swoon. This was a fact.</p><p><br></p><p>But right now, Arthas’ smile was not giving Shiroe any such friendly feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>They got up and walked out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that was something. But I agree with Arty here. Those guys were being a bit too high handed. Too bad we can’t get that seven set effect. +10% attack….sigh.” Star was shaking his head.</p><p><br></p><p>He did the same when he heard Artha’ voice. “Don’t worry. They will trade us those two items for two hundred and fifty thousand gold coins.” He said, while they walked towards the Knight Academy.</p><p><br></p><p>“They won’t. Two hundred and fifty thousand would be too little. I was expecting three hundred and fifty. Worst case, we would have to trade some accessories or information but….” Star shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“They will trade the two items for two hundred and fifty thousand….or less.” Shiroe confirmed. “You’re planning to use that aren’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>And a smile lit his face. “Yeah, I was planning to use it too. At least for the next six months, if nothing unexpected happens, we would be the only ones having a monopoly on it. They would <em>have</em> to if they don’t want to get left behind by others.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh, now I am interested. Where are you both getting that confidence from?” Star asked and even he looked at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That reminds me.” Arthas quickly opened his menu and Star paused, his eyes widening.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, seriously? It was you guys?” The guy replied as he accepted the option and Shiroe got the message of a new member joining the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>“Look at the perks.” Arthas added.</p><p><br></p><p>Star whistled and then laughed. “Yeah, that would do it. I would like to see them running back if they want this. So, where are we going now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To our guild hall. When that is over, we will find Dwain’s team and see if they wish to sell us the boots for a fair price.”</p><p><br></p><p>They reached the Knight Academy and Arthas collected the keys of the Mansion and one of the people showed him the way to the mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just a few minutes away from the Knight Academy.</p><p><br></p><p>“This area is quite good. However, we will need furniture and some remodelling to make this place into a suitable Guild Hall.” He said looking at the place.</p><p><br></p><p>The mansion was big but mostly empty. There were three floors and several rooms with a big hall on the lowest floor of the building. It was ideal for the Guild hall.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will take a lot of gold to get the place up to the mark.” He commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can always collect some fees from people who wish to join the Guild. I mean, they <em>will</em> get benefits too and we have limited slots.” Arthas offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, normally I would be against such methods but in this case, it does make sense. We are all given equal chances in the Game. You three worked for this with your own hands and for them just walking in and enjoying the same advantages without paying anything would be unfair to you three. On that note,” Star brought out a pouch with coins. “Here’s my share.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to….” Shiroe tried to deny.</p><p><br></p><p>“That wouldn’t be fair to others.” The guy insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas accepted the money with a nod.</p><p><br></p><p>“Any idea how much we are going to charge?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the average income for a T3 Player in a month?” Arthas asked in return.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe thought for a moment before coming to a number. “Around twelve thousand Gold Coins. It’s different for different players. Production Classes could have more but they have to pay for raw materials too so their income is reduced if they don’t collect the raw materials themselves.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then one thousand gold coins.” Arthas replied before thinking of something and adding, “As a registration fee with five hundred gold coins every month.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe thought of the numbers in his head and they did seem fine. “We are in a way cutting away a tenth of their work when levelling and with other perks, even the gold they spend will be recovered. Yes. This seems good for now. Did Veena-san agree with the price?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was the one who suggested the idea but she didn’t know the average income of T3 Class people. I would hardly call our team….average.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yeah….I can see that.” Shiroe laughed. It was true that their team was anything but average. Especially Arthas and Veena who had been anomalies from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, they explored the mansion and Shiroe made a note of things they would need for the Guild after which they tried searching for Dwain but didn’t get anything and decided to return.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was your trip?” Veena asked as she prepared some lemonade for the three of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“No deal. They were asking for too much.” Shiroe explained the situation to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You made the right decision. If you had agreed to their demands, they would have probably made some more outrageous demands. It’s not good to show weakness at the negotiation table. As Arthas said, they will come to us on their own.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We still have a few hours till the meeting time. In that time, how about we decide what rules we need to have for our Guild?” She asked suddenly, making them aware of something they all had overlooked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rules….yes. We do need those.” He agreed. “Nothing too strict but still something to keep everyone in line.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next two hours, Veena-san drafted some basic rules.</p><p><br></p><p>They were the basics of basics like no fighting between guild members.</p><p><br></p><p>In case of any alterations, they would go to a third member who could mediate the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Over time when they had more members, they could assign ranks like Officers, Veterans and Admins to the senior Guild Members who could look over these matters.</p><p><br></p><p>Another rule was about not using the Guild Name for personal matters or for illegal stuff and if found doing such a thing, they will be kicked out of the guild immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Threatening people with the Guild’s name is not allowed either. They could use it for self defence but not for coercion.</p><p><br></p><p>Harassing anyone based on gender, religion, race, colour or sexuality was strictly prohibited. Anyone found doing such a thing will be permanently banned from the Guild.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, they ate their lunch and it was time for the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We sat back and looked at the people gathering in the park.</p><p><br></p><p>There was still an hour till the meeting and there were already around one hundred players gathered in the park with more arriving one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many players are even in this town?” I couldn’t help but ask.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, there were approximately four hundred or so players per village and this town has eight villages connected to it so it would have access to around three thousand players….assuming some of them have been….eliminated already. We needed to be around T2 to get here so I guess even at worst, we would have over one thousand players here after all this time.” Shiroe completed, after some thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s quite a lot of players.” Star whistled.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s quite a bit less when you consider that there are approximately twenty million players in the game….or at least there were when it started.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>We still didn’t know how many players were alive in the game.</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking, Shiroe paused.</p><p><br></p><p>We followed his gaze to see the one we had been looking for all this time, Dwain and his party members.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe and I looked at each other and nodded as we got up at the same time. Veena saw us getting up and followed as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Those guys were also approaching us, probably intending to talk about something.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dwain.” Shiroe took the lead to greet the leader of the other group.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shiroe.” The guy nodded as he took a look at all of us, his gaze staying on Veena a few moments more than others.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone with lower stats would have missed it but my stats were just far higher than his.</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure Veena noticed this too.</p><p><br></p><p>“We still have an hour or so before the meeting. Let’s go somewhere with a bit more privacy.” Shiroe offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, we are fine talking here. I already have an idea what this is about and I don’t see the need to go anywhere else in particular to discuss this.” The guy waved off the suggestion.</p><p><br></p><p>His voice was heard by several players and attracted the attention of many people.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe was actually taken aback by his words but collected himself almost instantly. “I see. Very well, we can discuss the matters here. We would like to trade the boots which Dolphin Puncher got in the World Quest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, straight to the point. I like it. But sorry, I will have to refuse.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe frowned lightly. “Is there really nothing we can trade for it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not that there is nothing you cannot trade for it but more like we want the set too. Our party lacks the attack and wishes to get the seven piece effect of the set too.” He smiled. “But we know you will not part with it and it doesn’t seem like Gareth is up for it either. So, how about I propose a bet?” He asked, his smile broadening.</p><p><br></p><p>“A bet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, a bet, The one who wins the bet gets the pieces of the other side.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That won’t work. We have the main pieces and four of them while you just have the boots.” Shiroe shook his head directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, just hear me out first.” The man interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that Shiroe was listening, he continued. “We both bet one piece of the equipment and fight. A duel if you will. The winner takes both. That said, you have to agree to play us till the end if we win the first match. Obviously, I agree that the gap in the stats of the individual pieces are different too so we will add one hundred thousand gold coins from our side if our piece is of lower value. How about it sounds fair, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at each other.</p><p><br></p><p>The deal was good.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, it was too good.</p><p><br></p><p>There had to be some catch.</p><p><br></p><p>“How do we guarantee that the deal will be kept if we win?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, trust issues are understandable. Fortunately, we can ask someone from the Knight Academy for an official duel with the stakes. They can be an impartial judge. If you don’t believe me, you could always ask for yourself.” The man added.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe looked at me and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>If it was just a duel, I could think of something.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy and he was a Level 28 Novice Archer. By that measure, he was actually very high level….compared to other players. In fact, even Gareth was just a level 26 Martial Artist so this guy must be skilled as well.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, many were looking at the discussion and I noticed that the more people gathered, the more pleased he was.</p><p><br></p><p>What was his game?</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, give us a moment to discuss the matter between ourselves.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Just make it fast. There are too many people waiting here. We wouldn’t want them to keep on waiting.” He smiled, pleased.</p><p><br></p><p>A distance away from their group, Shiroe spoke first. “Something is wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, that guy doesn’t give me good vibes.” Star added.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “The deal is too good for us. They must know that I am at least a T4 Knight and yet they want to fight me. They must have some sort of trump card to be so sure about their victory.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe they have some sort of equipment or skill which can work on you.” Veena suggested. “Or maybe they just want to kite you from a distance. The site of the battle was not mentioned. Add a wall or tower as the place he starts from and things will be difficult….or rather would be difficult if you were a T4 Knight.” Shiroe added.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed. “But….what do they get out of it? Do they think the same strategy will work every time?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fame.” It was Veena who answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They get the fame of defeating the so-called ‘Strongest Player’ in town. If you remember this person, he was also the one who used his newly obtained magical weapon to make a show in front of the whole audience, probably to attract the crowd to join him. Unfortunately for him, we came in and broke the whole show and he got nothing.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>The memories of his making that show with his bow flashed before my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have just talked with some of my friends from the Alchemist’s Guild and they told me about the views of the players about our position in the Rankings. Any ideas what they might be?” She asked with a slight smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“They think we got lucky?” Shiroe came to the conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. Most of them think we got lucky because we picked up the quest which alerted the City Lord of the Goblin raid and while that is not totally incorrect, they believe that as individual players our skill must not be that far apart from others. So for someone like Dwain, if he were to defeat Arthas, the so-called ‘Strongest’, he will not only prove that and stop our momentum, he will also steal our reputation to establish his own team. Quite a smart move.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously….they were putting that much thought into it?</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, what she was suggesting made sense.</p><p><br></p><p>She continued, “In fact, if I had to take a guess, I would say that you people couldn’t find him the entire day because he was probably spreading the rumours about our raid being a one time lucky shot and was waiting for this moment to challenge us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, it’s their loss. I think you should accept the challenge. I doubt there is much they could do against you. If anything they would surely pull back if they realised your true level.” Shiroe suggested after some thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Turning their whole story on their heads would be a great way to remove the rumours and establish your name.” Veena suggested too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Good. Shiroe, you go and accept the challenge on my behalf. Just wait till I return to sign any contracts. They might be trying to win this through some loopholes. I will go and find out about the duel and middleman thing from the Knights.” I told them and Star and I headed towards the Knight Academy while Veena went to her friends from the Alchemist’s Guild.</p><p><br></p><p>I directly went inside the Knight Academy and asked for Kenneth at the reception.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that my reputation has increased due to the awards from the City Lord as the receptionist was very quick with her side of things and I got an audience with Kenneth in minutes while Star waited at the reception since unauthorised people and non members were not allowed inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas, what brings you here? Are there any problems with the mansion you got as a reward?” He asked as I entered the office of the man. There were several other senior knights with him there, some of them were people I had recognised from the raid.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, nothing of that sort. The mansion was beyond anything I was expecting. I was only doing something I should have done as a Knight in service of Llyne.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>As I had learned very well so far, the NPCs in this game were more or less like real players and these ones were the same too.</p><p><br></p><p>Talking to them like this appeals to their knightly spirit and the result was evident as I saw smiles on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take a seat. Tell me, what can I do for you?” He asked as I took a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just wanted to enquire about something and if possible, ask for a favour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wished to know what are the terms and conditions for official duels, the ones with stakes and how Knights of the City preside over them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Official duels? Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>What he explained over the next twenty minutes was basically that players cannot die inside the safe zones like the towns and villages. This rule was carried out even in duels. That’s why the duel was stopped when the player’s hp went to the red zone.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the stakes, if it’s items, the Knights keep the items in their possession until the duel is completed and then offer it to the winner. If it’s something which cannot be moved or more abstract things, they enforce the contract within the city. If any party refuses to comply, they would be treated as a criminal.</p><p><br></p><p>The Knights saw to the fairness of the battle. The duels took place within the Knight Academy grounds….a place I hadn’t been to yet, something I intended to rectify very soon though.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what’s the matter? Are you planning to challenge someone to a duel?” He asked after he finished his explanations.</p><p><br></p><p>“More like someone else is planning to challenge me.” I explained the situation to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t think someone would be foolish to challenge you or your teammates. It might have been brief but I saw you fight during the goblin siege. I don’t think there are any players who could match your strength among other <a href=\"https://players….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">players….at</a> least according to the ones I have met. So, the one who challenged you is Dwain, you say? The one who won the fifth place?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The very same.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I didn’t think he would be foolish enough to not recognise the difference in your levels, especially after your performance.”</p><p><br></p><p>I chuckled. “Apparently, there is a rumour going around that I was only lucky to encounter the trails of the goblins and that I was also awarded points for the people who fought under me. If they fought in one on one, in a fair duel, I wouldn’t emerge victorious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are they doubting the judgement of the City Lord and Lord Marquis?” He asked, a tone of danger in his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite his easy going attitude, this guy was a Shield Knight. A T5 Shield Knight. Apart from me, there are no players in this city who stand any chance against him.</p><p><br></p><p>“People always try to find faults in others so as to justify their own lack of effort and talent, sometimes even going so far as to delude themselves. To some extent, I can understand their point of views too. They didn’t see me in action so they might have their own doubts.” I shrugged. “This just gives me a chance to show them what I am truly capable of and shut their mouths once and for all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well said. Very well, I will preside over this duel myself. When are you planning to fight?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, right after I go out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. The sooner such nonsense is snuffed out, the better.” He then turned towards the rest of the people. “Let’s go men. We have a duel to oversee.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir!”</p><p><br></p><p>With things set up on this side, we headed out.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to kick some asses and spread the name of the Fairy Tail guild.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> <a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></strong></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally complete.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter took a lot out of me.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Global Announcement.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Now people all over the game know the Fairy Tail guild.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas flexing without even intending to.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We also saw some bonding and increase in trust between Venelana and Arthas as she reveals some parts about herself.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I wrote a pov from Rias to show how things were on their side.

It took me a few seconds to organise them and I couldn’t help but click my tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shadow Clone overdid it.</p><p><br></p><p>I had only told him to beat up a few youkai and he went and set their headquarters on fire….sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see several ways this could end badly.</p><p><br></p><p>That said….those youkai were not that strong….or at least not all of them were strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Their leader, the one who my Shadow Clone called nerd and rightfully so, his name was Tamazuki, according to their conversation. He….was strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Or rather he was strong with that sword.</p><p><br></p><p>What even was that sword?</p><p><br></p><p>It felt as if it was alive on its own.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, it was becoming stronger the more he killed with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, he himself was not that much of a big deal.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason my Shadow Clone was struggling was because it would have gotten destroyed with a single good hit so it had to prevent getting hit in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder what they will do now that my Shadow Clone went and caused so much trouble. Moreover, does Rikuo know about that sword?</p><p><br></p><p>Several thoughts were going through my head and I couldn’t meditate so I decided to go and train for a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned Shanks to continue our training.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, I was trying to awaken my Conqueror’s Haki….but I just couldn’t no matter what I did.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s understandable, you know.” Shanks shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The reason you cannot awaken the Conqueror’s Haki is because you haven’t felt that strong of an urge yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him confused and he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are countless people in the world who have the King’s Haki but never awaken it even when they pass away. To awaken it, you have to crave for it. You need stimulation to your emotions. You have to be desperate. You have to feel it. The reason you don’t….is because you are never desperate. You never fight your enemies head on. You send your Clones while you are sitting safely in the confines of your house. You could fight your whole life like that and you wouldn’t awaken the King’s Haki….even if you become the strongest being in this world. After all, all users of the King’s Haki are those who fight in the frontlines.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about this and indeed, I didn’t fight people head on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Real fights are different. No matter how much experience your clones can send you, they cannot replicate the actual fight. You need to be there to feel it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Will that allow me to awaken my Conqueror’s Haki?”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, it wasn’t an issue of strength as I could feel the power just a tiny bit away from me. It was as if I could reach and touch it but no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t reach there.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto and One Piece fighting styles were completely different.</p><p><br></p><p>One was based on deception while the other was based completely on head on fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>“That I don’t know. But what I know for sure is that you won’t be able to awaken it through your current method.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks was right.</p><p><br></p><p>If I wanted to awaken the Conqueror’s Haki, I couldn’t keep on avoiding fighting like this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I understand. I will go out and fight more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? With only that much strength? Are you looking to get kicked by another old man?” He made faces at me while saying this and I rolled my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>We trained and left the room directly the next morning and directly went to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rikuo Nura -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“How is he?” He asked as he looked at the unconscious guy laying in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Shouei was the son of Lord Hihi and a half youkai. He had grown impatient in the last few days and had gone ahead to fight the Shikoku Youkai on his own….to their headquarters. Thankfully, he was spotted by some of the younger ones who informed Aotabo and Shouei was saved at the correct time</p><p><br></p><p>“Mostly fine. He wasn’t injured much. The Shikoku youkai seemed to be in chaos and couldn’t react quickly when Shouei reached there and I was able to bring him out almost immediately.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Chaos?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It looked as if the place had been attacked. I wasn’t able to see much but the entire floor had a massive scorch mark and there was even molten metal visible in some places.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Attack and scorch marks everywhere?” He narrowed his eyes. “Could it be….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Did you say something, Master?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. No it was nothing. By the way, did you guys see someone there? I mean the attacker?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. It was already all over by the time we got there. In fact, I even found Sodemogi-sama, one of the seven phantom travellers, the officer of the Shikoku youkai laying half dead on the side of the building. He looked like he had fallen from the top of the building, barely alive because his fall was cushioned from getting hit on some wires in between. Kurotabo is keeping an eye on him and trying to interrogate him about more information.” Aotabo reported.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsurara, take care of Shouei. Aotabo, bring me to the captive.” He ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>He was brought to the guy who had been treated by Zen and was conscious now. He was being interrogated by Kurotabo and Zen but had kept his mouth shut despite the injuries.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master.” Kurotabo and Zen greeted him as soon as he entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he say anything?” He asked and they shook their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehahaha did you think that sending a single man to attack us would scare us off? Tamazuki will take revenge on everyone. He will capture that guy and torture him till be breaks.” the captive youkai laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shouei went there on his own and has already been recovered.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shouei….is that the human’s real name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Human? Who are you talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The one in the black hood.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow! Did he go and attack your headquarters?”</p><p><br></p><p>That foolish guy….did he intend to take on all of them on his own?</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is he? What did you all do?” He asked but the youkai just laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is getting annoying.” He turned back to talk to Aotabo when the youkai suddenly jumped towards him to grab his sleeve and he attacked back almost reflexively.</p><p><br></p><p>Aotabo and Kurotabo did the same and the attacking youkai, making a pincushion out of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heheahaha you all are going to die. Tamazuki is the chosen one….” The guy laughed and with that, he disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>At that time, someone informed him that Gozumaru and Mezomaru had gone to investigate the Shikoku Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>….those two idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….What a pain. Kurotabo, Aotabo….gather everyone. This mess has gone on for far too long. We are ending this today.” He ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>The words of Shadow coming back to his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. The longer this goes on the more people will get affected. It’s best to end this mess soon.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>By the time I woke up, it was afternoon.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks’ words had made me realise how much I was hesitating and so I was planning to go out and fight on my own today.</p><p><br></p><p>And with this in mind, as soon as the clock struck midnight, I snuck out of the house and changed into Shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>This night was different from all the previous ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Tonight, I could feel the aura of youkai all over the town. In fact, it was so dense that even normal people were feeling a strange aura all around. And the worst part about it was <a href=\"https://that….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that….it</a> was not the peaceful kind of youkai aura.</p><p><br></p><p>I raced towards the area with the most concentration of youkai aura and observed the scene from a high building. Down below, I saw scores of youkai facing each other.</p><p><br></p><p>They were basically in two groups. One group was from Rikuo’s clan and the other was of the idiots I had beaten up yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>Did they get too impatient and start a war today?</p><p><br></p><p>I waited there and watched.</p><p><br></p><p>The nerd looked like he was putting on a show.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have been waiting for you, Rikuo Nura. You have the eyes of a challenger who doesn’t know his own limits. However, all that is going to change now. Now behold, the power of Tamazuki!” He stood on a high platform and spread his arms as he shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaves danced around him and his form slowly changed into the one he had taken when fighting against me.</p><p><br></p><p>His minions went wild at the transformation and cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously! What is this? Some kind of stage show?” I whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>I had come here for a serious fight and this guy was doing a circus show with his minions.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this the reason behind all the destruction he had caused- wanting attention?</p><p><br></p><p>I was seriously annoyed by the show so I decided to teach him a lesson.</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to jump down so I slowly made some handsigns.</p><p><br></p><p>“Genjutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very basic genjutsu which interfered with the sense of distance and balance of a person.</p><p><br></p><p>And just as he jumped, I also made my move.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the guy landed on his face….the entire crowd went silent and without any wait, I too landed on top of him, one of my feet on his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yo nerd~ dressed up for halloween today?”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy pushed back at my head and looked at me mechanically. “You!” He waved his sword at me so I jumped back quickly. “You were dead!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….not really. I am still alive, you know. Ah, I understand. Did you leave your glasses back at home to look cool? That’s no good, ya know.”</p><p><br></p><p>He swung his sword again and I jumped back towards Rikuo’s group. “Sup.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked at me boredly. “Did you go and attack their headquarters yesterday?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….technically not correct. I didn’t go there. His minion carried me.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“So you were kidnapped?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not….technically correct either. He was under an illusion which I had put on him. So….I made him carry me there. I mean, scouring the whole town for their headquarters was a bit of a pain and he was practically offering to help me out so why deny?”</p><p><br></p><p>He just scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, that nerd’s sword is weird. When I was fighting with him, he killed one of his subordinates with it and the aura on the blade increased. The same happened twice later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He killed his subordinates?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, don’t you notice some missing faces.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo’s face took on a serious look and he looked at the nerd who had gotten up by now and was fuming in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, are you going to fight them? I kinda wanted to try my hands on that guy today. I couldn’t fight freely yesterday as that would have crushed the entire building.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid that I will have to disappoint you today. I offered you a turn yesterday. Today is my turn.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “I really wanted that fight. Say, how about this, if you win this, I want a promise to spar with me when all this is over, on the other hand, if you are in danger….I will intervene.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not get any chances to intervene….that said, you are always welcome to challenge me.” He replied back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, that’s a deal.” I agreed and started to walk away.</p><p><br></p><p>“Catch him. Don’t let him get away.” The nerd shouted and several youkai ran towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo’s subordinates were about to interfere but I shook my head towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>My first real fight….I wasn’t about to let anyone intervene.</p><p><br></p><p>I drew my sword and breathed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun Breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t even turn on the Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>The movements of these youkai seemed slow as I looked at them. My senses were catching all their actions and even the ones who were supposedly invisible were clearly visible to my aura sensing.</p><p><br></p><p>I kicked the ground and began. Sun Breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>First Form: Dance.</p><p><br></p><p>Second Form: Clear Blue Sky</p><p><br></p><p>Third Form: Raging Sun</p><p><br></p><p>Fourth Form: Burning Bones, Summer Sun</p><p><br></p><p>Fifth Form: Raging Sun</p><p><br></p><p>….one by one, all the forms of the Sun Breathing flowed as I danced between the incoming group and as I did so, I could feel everything in far more detail than what Shadow Clones were transmitting.</p><p><br></p><p>The sensation of my blade cutting through them, the smell of their blood, the resistance against my blade, the sounds of their cries and the wind from their attacks….all those sensations were something I had felt for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this how an actual fight was like?</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I woke from my trance, I realised that the entire crowd of youkai who had attacked me were all gone.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at the rest who stepped back in fright so I looked back at Rikuo once again and used Shunshin to get away from the place, taking a seat on one of the buildings to see the fight from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>With my disappearance, the enemy group seemed to have gotten their breath back and began to roar in all directions.</p><p><br></p><p>….did these idiots think I ran away?</p><p><br></p><p>The nerd also seemed to have regained his courage and ordered as he walked forward, his blade unsheathed. “In the name of the eighty eight demons of Shikoku, I will now take your life and your fear as I had promised I would.” He raised his blade towards Rikuo.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you done talking, Tanuki?” Rikuo smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>Was that nerd a tanuki youkai?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly one of the youkai on the nerd's side ran forward with a spear in his hand. “The glory will be mine!” He was heading straight for Rikuo.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>One of Rikuo’s subordinates was about to make a move but he stopped him. “I got this.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, he narrowed his eyes as his aura flared. The youkai paused and began to stagger as he stepped back slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>Is this fear?</p><p><br></p><p>Using aura to suppress others….is this how they use fear?</p><p><br></p><p>I got comfortable and turned my Sharingan on.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps, I could learn a lot more if I sat back and observed the fight this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Both sides charged at each other and engaged the other side in a fight, however, suddenly, Rikuo began to walk forward….alone.</p><p><br></p><p>What is he thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>Tsurara Oikawa ran after him to support him but paused…</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a moment to realise why. None of the youkai were actually going at <a href=\"https://him….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">him….no</a>, none of them were even able to see him.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the same trick Nurarihyon had used against me.</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon’s Fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the nerd realised this and looked around urgently.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you all doing? The enemy commander has already gone past you. Why are you all not attacking?” He shouted but they couldn’t find Rikuo no matter how they looked.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo had reached the nerd by then and unsheathed his blade, swinging at him. He blocked with his sword.</p><p><br></p><p>The aura of all the youkai had completely shrouded the whole place and was affecting the people around the city.</p><p><br></p><p>Just across the building, I could see people getting in accidents, or looking this way and then backing away.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight got heated up between that group and suddenly I spotted the masked subordinate of the nerd flying above Rikuo and the nerd and attacked Rikuo with black feathers.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember that my Shadow Clone had blown away all those attacks so I didn’t know what those feathers could do.</p><p><br></p><p>This confusion was gone soon.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed Rikuo’s eyes had turned black and the nerd attacked him, easily going through his defence.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, so those feathers took away eyesight.</p><p><br></p><p>I still hadn’t gotten started on Observation Haki. Actually, the only reason I was even near awakening the Conqueror’s Haki was because I bought it.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued and Rikuo looked to be on the backfoot for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>It reminded me of the situation I had against Nurarihyon and the training Tobirama had put me through to handle situations like this.</p><p><br></p><p>“He looks just like you, although you did struggle better.” I suddenly heard a voice from behind me and reflexively swung by sword to attack, only for the blade to meet another.</p><p><br></p><p>I relaxed when I saw the person behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon. It was no wonder I couldn’t feel him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you here to join the war?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….not really. I have passed on the mantle to Rikuo. It’s his fight now. The fights of children is not something I would interfere with.” He said as he sat beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked forward to the scene of fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>“You, on the other hand, left a very nasty surprise for me last time. Don’t you know old people like me can get shocked from sudden fireworks? I almost got a heart attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>As if you would get a heart attack from something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….you need to compensate me. Five, no eight plates of Kofuku Manju the next time you visit.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the old man with a deadpan.</p><p><br></p><p>On the battlefield, Oikawa came to Rikuo’s rescue and while she too got hit by the same feathers, the girl had frozen her own eye and resisted getting blinded by the feathers.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….a unique method.” I whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Little Tsurara is indeed creative. She is going to become a wonderful youkai in the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That crow youkai is annoying. Thankfully, I never let her attacks hit me when we fought.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you fought her?” Nurarihyon asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. There were eight of them including the nerd.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The nerd?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The guy with the sword. He looks like a total nerd in his human form and has a tendency to show off a bit too much. That said, he has been nothing but a disappointment in the fight so far. In my fight with his team yesterday, he would have been dead meat if not for that sword.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Devil’s blade….sigh. I never expected that abomination to be released to the world again.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly is that sword? From what I have seen, it gets stronger anytime the nerd kills someone with it. In our fight, he killed two of his officers with it to match me at half my strength. Today too, he was boasting about killing Rikuo and taking his fear for himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It does exactly that. Youkai are beings born from the fear of humans. The Devil’s blade is a weapon which steals this very thing and grows in power.”</p><p><br></p><p>And soon I saw an example of this.</p><p><br></p><p>The nerd was obviously overwhelmed by Rikuo when he got his eyesight back so he started to kill his own people.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch….that brat has gone too far.” Nurarihyon clicked his tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you going to stop him?” I asked. I wasn’t even related to those youkai and yet I was getting angry at the actions of the fucking nerd.</p><p><br></p><p>He however shook his head. “No. All of those people had chosen to follow him. Whatever fate befalls them is of their own choosing. If they do however come into the refuge of the Nura Clan….” He paused. “However, that will not be the case.”</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, the nerd went rampaging through his own people. The more he killed, the larger the aura on the blade became, until flesh started to grow on the blade and bone-like spikes appeared on it.</p><p><br></p><p>With his power up completed, he finally faced Rikuo.</p><p><br></p><p>“That thing doesn’t even look like a sword anymore.” I commented but Nurarihyon didn’t say anything and just kept looking at the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I noticed something.</p><p><br></p><p>That dog youkai, one of the officers of the nerd and the one who had healed from my attack, was heading in a certain direction.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked in that direction and saw Kana and Yura standing there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be right back.” I got up and raced in that direction and right in front of the two girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kana, get behind me.” Yura shouted as she saw the dog youkai jumping towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>I drew my sword.</p><p><br></p><p>It could heal, so….I just have to cut him till he can’t.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun Breathing: Thirteenth Form.</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate form of Sun Breathing made by Yoriichi Tsugikuni to cut down Muzan Kibutsuji.</p><p><br></p><p>The move basically consisted of all the previous twelve forms done continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>I might not have the demon slayer mark like Yoriichi but the physique of the Monkey D. Family more than made up for it. In fact, it went far beyond even Yoriichi’s abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>The dog howled in pain.</p><p><br></p><p>In just a single round, it was chopped into pieces and retreated quickly but I noticed that several parts of its body hadn’t regenerated.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at the girls. “Go back home. Today it’s dangerous to roam around at night.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are….Shadow.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t reply and used Shunshin to get away from there.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was awfully kind of you.” Nurarihyon said as soon as I arrived back.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t reply and Nurarihyon looked behind towards the sky. I followed his gaze and saw a strange scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Three crow-like youkai, tengu perhaps, were carrying a giant youkai who looked like a tanuki.</p><p><br></p><p>They landed in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Supreme Commander, who is he?” A little crow asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just someone who wants to challenge strong youkai. He is offering Kofuku Manju for the right to challenge me hahahaha. Can you imagine the steal?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br>The larger one however looked at the scene below where the fight had heated up.</p><p><br></p><p>The nerd had stabbed even the dog youkai and the blade now had tentacles.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what kind of pervert made that blade?</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me go and put a stop to this.” the giant youkai said as he wanted to go ahead but Nurarihyon stopped him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let the kids fight it out. If you stop him now, he will just keep on blaming you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But he is using the Devil’s Blade. He could kill your grandson.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I trust Rikuo. He will not be defeated so easily by borrowed power. Keep watching.”</p><p><br></p><p>We did just that and while doing so, I found out that the giant was actually the nerd’s father.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously….</p><p><br></p><p>The reason the nerd had been doing all this was because he despised his father for losing in a fight against humans in which his night parade was destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the guy, his father had lost the face and future of the Shikoku youkai so he went ahead and stole the very weapon which had been used by the humans to kill the armies of his father….the so-called Devil’s Blade.</p><p><br></p><p>After that he had gone ahead and collected a group of followers using the blade’s power to boost his own and was now targeting the Nura Clan….</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, the giant tanuki, Inugamigyobu….was a pretty decent guy. He had retired after his loss and was actually planning to live peacefully. The guy was even worried about his son and had begged to come here and was still….literally begging Nurarihyon to spare the life of his son.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy was doing so much for his son and that bastard….that ungrateful bastard….</p><p><br></p><p>The entire story reminded me of some unpleasant things.</p><p><br></p><p>I quietly looked at the fight and Rikuo seemed to have gotten better at his technique and was able to counter him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go, Rikuo doesn’t look like he will stop that easily.” Nurarihyon said as he disappeared from his place.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Nurarihyon -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He jumped down the building to reach Rikuo and stop the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him, the boy, Shadow, didn’t make any moves.</p><p><br></p><p>He had noticed the boy getting very quiet at Inugamigyobo’s story</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon still didn’t know what the deal with the kid was except for the fact that he wanted revenge from the former Kyoto youkai. But right now, he doesn't have any time to think about those things.</p><p><br></p><p>He reached Rikuo and blocked his sword as he was about to cut down Tanuki’s brat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Supreme Commander.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Phew, just on time.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked towards the direction where Karasu Tengu and his sons were carrying Inugamigyobo down towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough Tamazuki. You have spilled too much blood already. It’s time to stop this madness.” The old tanuki shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the defeated brat who was shivering and reached for the blade. </p><p><br></p><p>“I see. These sacrifices were not enough. Only when I stand atop the corpse of my weakling of a father will the Devil’s Blade finally unleash its true power!” With that said, he jumped towards the old tanuki.</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon and the rest were about to make a move but suddenly a wave of power passed over everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>The weaker youkai started falling unconscious one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>The Devil’s Blade in Tamazuki’s hand fell down as he lost control of his body and in between him and his father….Shadow had arrived.<br><br></p><p>This time however, Nurarihyon could sense the rage </p><p><br></p><p>The boy kicked Tamazuki in the air, making him crash through the building’s roof and then several floors below.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….ungrateful mongrel! You have a father, a loving father who has raised you for so long, who is willing to go so far for you, even beg in front of others to have your crimes forgiven, something….something many people wish and pray for but they never get the opportunity to experience and you….you want to kill that person for what….power? Name? You fucking….” The boy shook in anger, clenching his blade, barely controlling himself from losing control and slicing off the brat’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow….” Rikuo went forward and even Inugamigyobo went forward.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked at both of them in frustration and stomped the ground in rage before turning back and leaving quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon watched the kid’s back as several thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….kids these days….so troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I entered the Training Room, frustrated and incredibly angry.</p><p><br></p><p>That spoiled fucking brat….</p><p><br></p><p>He killed all his friends</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to go back home and worry Gin.</p><p><br></p><p>I directly summoned Shanks today.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you are back brat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Train me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have awakened the Conqueror’s Haki….train me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh! You did….now what exactly did you encounter?” He sat down on a rock and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I remained quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….that kind of awakening eh? Alright. Let’s get to your training.” He got up and got ready without any more words.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him a bit surprised that he didn’t push or tease me and then decided to accept his consideration.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Three months had passed since that day.</p><p><br></p><p>I had more or less stopped going out searching for any youkai and completely went back to training in the Training Room and drawing manga.</p><p><br></p><p>Today I came to school for the year end exam results.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh wow. You are at the top of our year, Tatsuya. That’s awesome.” Jiro cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Tatsuya is really studious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe we should start studying more instead of chasing after youkai too.” Saori said, making the rest of the group blanch together.</p><p><br></p><p>They hadn’t done badly but none of them were in the top….except Kiyotsugu, who was ranked twelfth in our whole year. That guy….how does it get all that time?</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm guys.” I called out to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Ikuse. Do you want to celebrate coming at the top of the class with a youkai adventure?” Kiyotsugu cheered.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“….no</a>.” I deadpanned before bringing up the next topic. “I wanted to inform you all about something?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it?” Rikuo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am….changing schools!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” All of them exclaimed together.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at them sadly. They might be a group of dumb kids but they did treat me very well and had become good friends with me….so it did feel kinda bad to spring this on them.</p><p><br></p><p>“My grandma has been sick lately and my kid brother is alone there with her. She is quite old so I was thinking of moving back to take care of her.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t wrong either.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma was really old and she was just sick.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….but you wanted to study in a school with a good art program, right? What about your dream of becoming a mangaka?” Jiro asked, worried.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “I will do that when I am in High School while taking extra classes of arts. We do have one near our home. Don’t worry guys. I will keep in touch and come visit on the weekends when I can.” I promised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then you have to do that. In fact, we could go and visit you there too. It would be better than one of those dangerous youkai adventures.” Saori said.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo also patted my shoulder. “If you ever need anything, you can contact me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Same here!” Kiyotsugu cheered loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>For the rest of the day, we spent time in the clubhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>The day when I was moving, they all actually accompanied me back home to drop me off and had even prepared goodbye gifts for me.</p><p><br></p><p>As for me, I gave them signed posters of Naruto and Demon Slayer made by Rohan Kishibe….which I had received from an uncle of mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san had taken that fall.</p><p><br></p><p>They had stayed at my home, even met Tobi and Sae before leaving at night in Kiyotsugu’s car.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus….after an entire year of chaos, I was back at home.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s it. And this is how you create a warding spell.” Grandma praised me when I had completed setting up the spell.</p><p><br></p><p>What this spell does is, creates a barrier which wards off non magicals in a certain barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very basic but extremely necessary spell used by almost all supernaturals of this world. In fact, it was more or less an unsaid rule that we had to do this before fighting or doing any supernatural activities.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will stop our lessons here today. Have you memorised the chants I had given you first?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we will practise the next spell tomorrow.” Grandma replied as she got up from the floor and sat down on the couch. “You are progressing at a very fast speed. I think you might have talent for this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“If this continues, I might be able to teach you most of the basics in just six months. After that you can study on your own and learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks grandma.” I replied as I sat beside her</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s there to thank me about, silly boy?” She hugged me and I returned the hug.</p><p><br></p><p>Keeping this secret and training was becoming stressful for me as I had to keep lying to everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with just grandma knowing about this was like some kind of weight had lifted up from my shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, Grandma supported my decision to keep all this a secret.</p><p><br></p><p>Since I had returned, she had started to personally teach me the Buddhist Style of Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>They mainly consisted of chanting verses and burning incense to invoke the spell.</p><p><br></p><p>It was mostly of the defensive, sealing and purifying branches of magic. Offensive spells were very rare in this and even those were especially designed against malevolent forces.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, I didn’t need those either way.</p><p><br></p><p>All I wanted to do was learn more about the general magical situation of this world so that I am not caught with my proverbial pants down in a situation like Nurarihyon.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another benefit of this training which was the increase in my Magic Stats which have started to rise at a faster pace.</p><p><br></p><p>I learned information about other supernatural factions in this world. While Grandma was more or less retired, Supernatural factions rarely changed so quickly. Most of them consisted of beings who lived for centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, what I learned in these lessons made me understand or at least have a bare idea of how deep the waters of this world truly were.</p><p><br></p><p>Gods….Nurarihyon had said that lower Gods were all Ultimate Class which means higher Gods were even stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the other beings who were just as strong.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head to not let my thoughts wander.</p><p><br></p><p>We ended our training and I went out to get ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow was my birthday.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a party tonight but Shuri-san and Akeno were going to arrive soon to help prepare for tonight’s party.</p><p><br></p><p>They arrived an hour later.</p><p><br></p><p>“Happy Birthday, Onii-chan.” Akeno greeted me happily as soon as I opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Akeno.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san greeted me as well and came inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow Onii-chan, is that a dog?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. He’s Gin. Gin, say hello.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Woof!”</p><p><br></p><p>“So cute.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara ara, he’s so well behaved. Such a good boy.” Shuri-san patted his head and the guy enjoyed the treatment every bit.</p><p><br></p><p>He was especially friendly with girls but had a habit of scaring Tobi sometimes….just because Tobi was easy to scare. By now even Tobi knew this so it didn’t work much.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shuri, Akeno-chan, you are both here.” Grandma came out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oba-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>The family got together and today Shuri-san took me outside with Akeno, Tobi and Sae.</p><p><br></p><p>We had planned a trip to the amusement park for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we had returned, it was already late in the evening and even when outside the building, I sensed a familiar aura at my home.</p><p><br></p><p>On opening the door, a loud cheer greeted me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Happy Birthday!”</p><p><br></p><p>My friends from school had all come here for my birthday.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo, Jiro, Kana, Yura, Kiyotsugu, Natsumi, Saori and even Tsurara were there.</p><p><br></p><p>I soon found out that they were invited by Tobi who got their numbers from my diary and Grandma had contacted Koji-san and he along with Sae’s parents helped out in preparing for the whole party.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was chatting together happily.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, this is the brother you often talked about. And I didn’t know you had a little sister, Ikuse.” Kiyotsugu asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shuri-san was a friend of my father.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was?” Yura asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He passed away a few years ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! I am sorry, I didn’t know.” I waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara ara, so many pretty girls among your friends Tatsu-kun. So, whom do you like among them?” Shuri-san threw a bomb I didn’t want to touch at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls all had different reactions and I just smiled. “They are all my friends, nothing more Shuri-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….just friends? You are too slow Tatsu-kun. Hiro-kun was such a heartbreaker when he was young. Even Tobi has someone like Sae-chan. You should take more initiative.” She teased, making the guy choke on his drink.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I am not that famous.” I laughed it off.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not true, you know. You are quite famous in our entire year. In fact there are girls in other classes who talk about you too.” Saori commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, especially the students in the art club.” Natsumi chimed in suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile Kana and Tsurara were throwing Rikuo some looks while Yura was looking lost.</p><p><br></p><p>They soon introduced themselves and I realised something I had missed the entire time.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way Shuri-san was going to miss Tsurara’s youkai aura and Rikuo but thankfully, she didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, last time Grandma had been in the hospital and had missed them so no one knew about Rikuo and Tsurara.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keikain? Isn’t that the name of the famous Onmyoji family from near Kyoto?” Koji-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am Yura Keikain, an Onmyoji in training.”</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san threw me a look but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s wonderful. You must be especially talented for Hidemoto-sama to allow you to leave Kyoto.” Shuri-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know my grandfather?” She asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ufufufufu I have met him a few times.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still I didn’t think Tatsu-kun would be friends with a Keikain. After all, Hiroshi-kun was ufufufuf….” She giggled leaving everyone confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed Rikuo and Tsurara sweating in the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Did Tatsuya’s father know….” Yura began to ask but before she could ask anything else though, Grandma came in with a cake and the topic was successfully stalled.</p><p><br></p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the party went pretty well.</p><p><br></p><p>Yura gave me several talismans to protect my home.</p><p><br></p><p>Kiyotsugu gave me an entire compendium of youkai information.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo, surprisingly, gave me a bokken. He had seen the Shinnai we had for Tobi the last time he had come here and decided to give me one.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the party was a nice change of pace from my usual days which were full of training.</p><p><br></p><p>After they were all gone and Akeno and Tobio had gone to bed, both too tired from all the fun they had had, I was called to Grandma’s room.</p><p><br></p><p>There, Shuri-san was waiting with Grandma.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take a seat, Tatsu.” Grandma said and I did.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have made some good friends, Tatsuya-kun.” Shuri-san began.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. They can be a rowdy bunch but they are quite well meaning.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I take it that you have noticed the….speciality of two of them?” Grandma asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t look down. I am not here to scold you about making friends with people you like.” Grandma said and I looked at her surprised. Even Shuri-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“The world is not black and white, Tatsuya. Just like there are good and bad humans, there can be good and bad youkai. In fact, many youkai are benevolent and are worshipped by people. They go on to become land gods in many local shrines. If anything, you should not be so narrow-minded to put them all in the same category.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Grandma.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what do you know of your friends?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, Rikuo….I think he’s the grandson of <a href=\"https://Nurarihyon….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nurarihyon….at</a> least I think so.”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave them several reasons while cleanly keeping my antics as Shadow out of the story.</p><p><br></p><p>“....and his mother had said that it was very rare for human visitors at their home and Tsurara called him Young Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“That was quite smart of you. Yes, the Nura Clan is indeed the Clan of Nurarihyon, the leader of the Eastern Youkai. He is not someone with a violent temperament and keeps his people under control. I just wanted to make sure that you knew about their identities.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you have decided to learn more about magic. Welcome to the Supernatural World, Tatsu-kun.” Shuri-san said before pulling out a bag from under the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the same bag she had brought with her when she came here.</p><p><br></p><p>“These are some books belonging to Hiroshi-kun and your mother. She was a magician in the Golden Dawn Magician Organisation. She has had a very difficult life. She grew up with her adopted sister in an orphanage in Italy after her parents passed away due to some kind of illness. Fortunately, she had very good talent as a magician and was taken in by a magician of Golden Dawn who trained her as an apprentice. She worked as a magician to put her sister through education. In fact, even Hiroshi used to send money for her sister after she passed away till he received news that she got married. There is also the key to the bank locker where most of their….magical belongings were left. I was able to get those from the Kushihashi Clan at a later date since they belonged only to Hiroshi and not to the Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took the bag and bowed and thanked her.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to thank me silly boy. If you ever need anything, just be sure to call me. As for your secret, don’t worry. It will remain a secret with me.” She brushed my hair lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She sat there and showed me some books about Onmyojutsu and then retired for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>I took everything back to my room and stored them in my inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>I will go to the bank and check the locker.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san and Akeno left for their home the next day and I got into training earnestly.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I swung my sword and Shanks dodged to the side with casual ease and I felt the pressure on my body increase as he pushed his Conqueror’s Haki to a higher level.</p><p><br></p><p>In the moment it took me to adjust myself to the changed pressure, I felt a massive sense of danger and dodged to the side, barely missing the attack which tore apart the entire ground and the mountain behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously….this guy really doesn’t hold back</p><p><br></p><p>“You’re getting a hang of Observation and Armament although your Conqueror’s Haki still needs work.”</p><p><br></p><p>I breathed heavily as the fight ended.</p><p><br></p><p>“That said, today’s fight was….passable.” He smiled….which soon turned into a smirk. “Just kidding.”</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes, already expecting his answer.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been eight months since my birthday and I had drowned myself in training during this period. I could even sustain two shadow clones for longer periods of time which let me practise Fuinjutsu and learn about magic.</p><p><br></p><p>According to grandma, I was at the age where my magic grew the fastest and I should utilise this time properly.</p><p><br></p><p>My stats had changed completely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: D</strong></p><p><strong>Body:(D-72)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind:(D-12)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit:(D-68)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic:(F-92)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 12,701,032 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Demon Slayer, One Piece, Naruto</strong></p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: Training Room, Mentor System</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory: Nichirin Blade x 1, Gacha Tickets x 2</strong></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Apart from my magic stat, which was actually quite good for someone my age, my other stats were all D Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Body and Spirit being in D Rank was insane. My chakra reserves had become insane. Itachi compared it to Tailed Beasts and the best part was that it was still increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder what would happen if I could get the Asura’s Chakra or the chakra of the tailed beasts themselves?<br><br></p><p>Unfortunately those things haven’t appeared in the Shop yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day, my System Upgrade Quest was going to be completed and my System was going to become C Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last eight months, the sales of the manga volumes had increased quite a lot and I was nearly at my goal today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Upgrade Quest Completed: I was me</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Became famous in the Manga World</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sell 2.5 million copies of your manga. (2,499,972/2,500,000)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: C Rank System Update, Gacha Ticket x 3 </strong></p><p><br></p><p>An hour or so later, the counter reached the mark and the System was finally at the C Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly checked the Gacha Tickets. Three of them. Adding the previous two made it five.</p><p><br></p><p>These were the things I was waiting for all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Earning Gacha Tickets was a massive pain in the ass for me.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing I was waiting for all this time was finally here too.</p><p><br></p><p>Time Dilation feature of the training room.</p><p><br></p><p>For 5,000 points a day, instead of 1,000, I could alter the flow of time to make two days pass inside the Training Room instead of just one.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was that my physical age would be locked during this so I wouldn’t exactly age at twice the speed when inside.</p><p><br></p><p>This had come at just the right time as I was getting cornered with all the different types of training.</p><p><br></p><p>My Spar with Nurarihyon was in two more months and I wanted to be prepared for it.</p><p><br></p><p>First things first, I decided to Roll the Gacha. It would decide the direction of my future training.</p><p><br></p><p> I took out the three tickets from my inventory and activated them.</p><p><br></p><p>A wheel spun in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>It stopped after a while and pointed towards….Crayon Shinchan….</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, I couldn’t get good stuff at all times.</p><p><br></p><p>The next spin stopped after a while and the name which appeared was….Slam Dunk.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Alright, don’t be a disappointment, don’t be a bad roll this time.</p><p><br></p><p>I spun the wheel again and the one which appeared this time was….Shokugeki no Soma.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Shit.</p><p><br></p><p>No good rolls.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the last two tickets in my hand and two open slots.</p><p><br></p><p>At least give me one good manga.</p><p><br></p><p>The next name to appear was….Kimi ni Todoke.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Fifth time’s the charm.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and rolled the last Gacha.</p><p><br></p><p>Wheel began to slow down and finally stopped at….Kaichou wa Maid-Sama!</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….</p><p><br></p><p>No mangas with good abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down for the next thirty minutes and planned what to do next.</p><p><br></p><p>The next Gacha Tickets would be available only when I get B Rank which is quite a while away or….complete another series.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto and One Piece would take too long to complete so I had to complete one from the other ones I have.</p><p><br></p><p>I searched for the one with the lowest number of chapters and decided to choose Kaichou wa Maid-Sama! as the next manga.</p><p><br></p><p>It had eighty five chapters and if I worked on it along with Naruto and One Piece, I could probably get it done in the next year or so.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it was understandable. There were hundreds and thousands of manga. I was actually extremely lucky to have gotten both Naruto and One Piece in my first roll.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a high chance that I could have gotten old and received no shounen manga with superpowers and magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto and the One Piece world still had lots for me to draw and explore so I wasn’t worried yet.</p><p><br></p><p>I was just hoping for a manga with magic in it because that’s the only thing these two lacked. It could help me grow my Magic Stat too.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….we can’t win it all.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, I had to concentrate on the things I had rather than those I didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the list of newly unlocked abilities and items in the shop and found several cool things, the most anticipated among them being….Mangekyo Sharingan and Devil Fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still a bit iffy about the Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>My Training Room could probably heal the damage to the eyes but I didn't want to risk everything on a possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I needed to buy the abilities of the Mangekyo Sharingan separately.</p><p><br></p><p>Which means, not only did I have to buy the upgrade, I also needed to spend more for the abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, this was the case with other Bloodlines as well as the Uchiha Bloodline hadn’t granted me a Sharingan and the Uzumaki Bloodline didn’t grant me their abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Those abilities had to be bought separately.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t bought Mind’s Eye of Kagura so that I can work on my Observation Haki more.</p><p><br></p><p>Although the Adamantine Sealing Chains are still good. Not to mention the Wood Style of the Senju Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t even gotten started with it and I had Hashirama available as a teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>Wood Style wasn’t ranked as C Rank but as D, probably because it depended on the user more.</p><p><br></p><p>Yamato and Danzo could use Wood Style too but they sucked. They were nothing compared to Hashirama.</p><p><br></p><p>It was because Hashirama Senju was different. He had insane Chakra reserves and vitality, something which I had too due to my own bloodlines.</p><p><br></p><p>I am still undecided on the Mangekyo Sharingan abilities and don’t know if I can buy more than two of them.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be awesome if I could but I wouldn’t bet on it.</p><p><br></p><p>And before anything, I will have to get the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan update to not harm my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least, Sage Mode.</p><p><br></p><p>This ability was something I was unsure what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>It did appear on the list but this was something I could learn from others too. Should I waste my points on something which I can learn?</p><p><br></p><p>From what Grandma has told me, this world has Senjutsu users and Sages too although there was a huge difference between the two.</p><p><br></p><p>A Sage was a master of Senjutsu and not something normal Senjutsu users could compare to.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma didn’t know much about them but from what I have heard, supposedly, Sun Wukong, the monkey from the Journey to the West was real and he was a genuine Sage and a Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>With every fact I find out, I realise just how broken this world is and to get a sense of security in this broken world, I need to become stronger and I would need my System to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>The Training Room and Mentor System takes a lot of points to use so saving up the points is difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that I have to work on that alternate identity sooner than I thought or it would become difficult to buy higher level things in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything checked, I came out of the Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>It was already late at night but I wasn’t feeling sleepy because today, Grandma had visited the bank where my parents had a locker with their personal belongings and brought some of those for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the bag and brought out something I had been thinking about since I saw it.</p><p><br></p><p>My mother’s diary.</p><p><br></p><p>On the hardbound cover, engraved in golden ink was her name….Aria Argento.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Drawn to Power’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Several things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Nurarihyon’s first arc is over.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tatsuya had some of his old wounds scratched by the nerd’s act.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good thing it helped him awaken his Conqueror’s Haki.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>He is slowly expanding his repertoire of skills.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will concentrate on some slice of life and manga related stuff for the next chapter maybe while keeping his training in the background or things get repetitive.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Some new characters will be introduced and we will get to see how ‘Rohan Kishibe’ has affected the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Oh yeah and Tatsuya’s mother’s name was revealed.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I wonder what can of worms that will open.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

Miss Lavinia, could you please watch over her for a second.” I said as I went upstairs to get the first aid kit.</p><p><br></p><p>When I came down, I saw the girl in Lavinia’s lap who was cooing at her and preventing her from crying.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if she was a dragon, I guess she was still a child.</p><p><br></p><p>When I tried to help her though, she wiped her nose with a handkerchief given by Lavinia and looked back at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So are you going to break up with Tohru-sama now?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“How about we talk about this when Tohru comes back. I am sure she can clear the misunderstanding. Till then, how about we get you something to eat? By the time you are done, Tohru will be back too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not be swayed by your words. I….”</p><p><br></p><p>Grrr~~</p><p><br></p><p>Her stomach growled, making me chuckle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will go and make something for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I pat the girl’s head and went back to the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>I got some noodles and some Cherry Cake which I kept for Tohru to reward her for her good work.</p><p><br></p><p>The cake was made from Dragon Cherries which is apparently well liked by dragons. At least Tohru liked the cake.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you ran away from home?” I heard as soon as I reached the tables.</p><p><br></p><p>The little girl stiffened at the question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh you poor girl. You didn’t get hurt on the way, did you? No wonder you were so hungry.” She was hugging the girl while cooing to her.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the two in wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia….was quite good with kids.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, she was even smiling.</p><p><br></p><p>The poor girl had been through a lot and deserved some happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed the plates in front of the two girls. “Here, have something to eat.”</p><p><br></p><p>Won’t lie, it was quite adorable to watch the girl look at the cake and then back at me, her empty stomach fighting with her supposed dislike for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Drool flowed from the corner of her mouth as she looked at the cake and she was going forward before suddenly stopping and pulling back and shaking her head. Then she took another sniff of cake and then shook her head again.</p><p><br></p><p>This funny scene continued until the door to the restaurant opened and a loud shout announced their presence to everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are back, Boss!” Tohru’s voice broke the situation as the girl peeked from her seat to look at the two.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the two dragon girls eating in peace.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna Kamui, the white haired child….was apparently not a child.</p><p><br></p><p>She was over nine <em>thousand</em> years old.</p><p><br></p><p>After Tohru cleared the misunderstanding, she didn’t hesitate gulping down the food. Seeing her eat, Tohru drooled too and joined her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come back with me, Tohru-sama.” The girl asked with puppy….baby dragon eyes? I am not even sure what it was but it worked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can’t.” Tohru refused solemnly.</p><p><br></p><p>“But why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have to repay Boss and Naruto-kun for helping me out and giving me food. Also….the food here is so good~”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>So you are just a glutton. Although maybe I should take it as a compliment?</p><p><br></p><p>The girl snapped in my direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“So it’s you! You have seduced Tohru-sama with your….your demonic charms and your….delicious food. I will fight you.” She jumped on me.</p><p><br></p><p>This time she didn’t fall but her punches….they were slow.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, I kinda figured out that she was either not strong or not at full strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the girl throw punches at me that wouldn’t hurt a stuffed toy, I picked her up in my hands and raised her to my eye level.</p><p><br></p><p>“You asked Tohru to go back with you, right?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” She nodded resolutely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! But Boss, what about my job here? And the food….” The other dragon girl shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t mind the last part of the sentence and concentrated on the girl glaring at me at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“But….where will you go? You have run away from home as it is. Do you even have a place to stay?” I pointed out, making the girl freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Kanna, you ran away?”</p><p><br></p><p>With Tohru on her case, I placed the girl back in her seat with a smile and let handle it.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at them one last time before going back to the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the opening time and I needed to prepare everything for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>As usual Cid came in first and a while later Naruto and Miu entered the Restaurant for their bento too.</p><p><br></p><p>I came out just in time to see Naruto and Kanna arguing with each other….or rather Kanna wanting him to give up on Tohru.</p><p><br></p><p>The funnier part was her trying to do so while eating her cake.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked like an adorable squirrel rather than a fearsome dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately Miu intervened and proposed to ask her grandfather to allow Kanna to live with them as Tohru did.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how Hayato-san would handle a baby dragon living at his place.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, knowing the guy, he would probably be happy about the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I prepared their bentos and handed it over to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Miu and Naruto were getting late for school so they went ahead, leaving Kanna with Tohru.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid had some time till his school started so he stayed back for some breakfast but left soon after for his school.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru, Saitama and Ainz came in a while later.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas, udon for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll have some ramen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Same for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The three sat down at the table that was more or less reserved for them in the corner of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you are awake.” Ainz said, looking at Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>To her credit, she didn’t seem the least bit bothered by his bony face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I am. Thank you for your help.” She bowed towards and thanked them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, don’t worry about it. We were just helping out a friend.” The guy waved it off but knowing him all this time, I knew that he was just embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, you are waiting here for the contract, huh?” Rimuru asked and then looked at me. “I seriously thought you would just let her go.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“I probably would have if I was alone here but Sakura also stays with me and if something happened to her because someone came sniffing….” I was still wary of the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>Gods and Devils….yeah, I wondered what would happen if someone really came for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to worry. I understand and appreciate your concerns. If anything your methods are comparatively tame since the supernatural world generally wipes out the memories of the normal people to hide themselves….and for a good reason.” The girl replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry again. If there is something I can do to make this up to you, I will try my best.” I offered to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have already saved my life. That’s a lot more than I can pay for.”</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to offer her help but she refused so I finally gave up.</p><p><br></p><p>Around an hour or so Zeref and Irene-san appeared. They were followed by another old man who looked like a classic wizard from some fantasy world….which was actually not that far away from his actual identity.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref introduced him as August, one of his most trusted people.</p><p><br></p><p>The man thanked me for curing Zeref.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should say that to Touma-kun. He was the one who did it.” I waved it off. “Come, would you like to eat something?”</p><p><br></p><p>The one who replied was Irene-san who was actually quite enthusiastic about the food.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I had noticed that she was a bit too happy when eating the last day.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, when did the girl wake up?” She asked after finishing her plate.</p><p><br></p><p>“This morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any problems with your health?” She asked, looking at Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I am completely fine. Thank you very much for assisting me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman waved her off as I placed another one of her orders in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess you are waiting for the contract.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Lavinia and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I have already prepared the contact. All you need to do is sign it and drop a drop of blood there. Here you go.” She brought out a scroll and handed it to Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl did as instructed without any resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally done with everything, she sat down with them as Irene-san was interested in the magic of other worlds and they talked about different things.</p><p><br></p><p>I too moved away to give them some space and cook the orders.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So you guys had a sparring session. And the last guy tried to feed you a finger to take over your body. Is it just me or your life is weird?” He said, looking at Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>“Says the slime who rules over the village of goblins.” Silas retorted, rolling his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Touché.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened then?” Ainz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ughh….I apparently ate the soul”</p><p><br></p><p>“Digested maybe, not ate. That would imply you did it by your violation.” He interrupted, knowing the complex feelings Silas had about his newly discovered heritage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….that, I guess. I did feel a bit stronger after that happened.” Silas continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….makes sense in an odd sort of way.” Ainz nodded. “Still, you were quite careless, Sil. Maybe you need to train your awareness a bit. Who knows what kind of magic you might encounter with your Restaurant opening in so many other worlds. It never hurts to have some training.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, he’s not wrong.” Saitama added. “Just make sure your hair is taken care of.” He said, caressing his bald head with a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi! Stop laughing.” Saitama scolded, making everyone laugh even harder while the guy pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“How about this, the four of us can go on a training journey in my world?” He proposed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, a training trip sounds good. Like power levelling and stuff, right?” Ainz agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I will have to pass. I have decided to register as a pro hero on Bang-san’s advice.” Saitama sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to postpone our plans for later.</p><p> </p><p>“By the way, did you get the things I asked for?” Ainz suddenly whispered to Silas, the red light in his eye sockets looking round to see if anyone was looking at them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….those. Yeah, Sakura and Tohru went shopping today and got everything. One moment, let me ask her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“H-hmm. Alright. Take your time.” Ainz went back to his fake royal persona and he chuckled at the guy’s roleplay.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were talking, Silas went upstairs and came down with two bags and placed them on the table. “Here you guys go.”</p><p><br></p><p>They quickly opened the bags to reveal the treasure in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Woah….these are the classic gameboy advance. In my world they stopped making these over a century or so ago. I remember seeing one at a gaming museum when I was a kid.” Ainz said as he carefully picked up the device between his bony fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at the man in wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>Over a century….gaming museum.</p><p><br></p><p>“I asked them to buy the latest ones in the market.” Silas rubbed his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“And they are. Let’s see the games. Ohh, Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow and is that Legend of Zelda and Mario? Man, it’s been a while since I have played these.” He picked up the games with a nostalgic look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how about it, we pick one each and then battle each other later.” Ainz offered, picking Pokemon Red.</p><p><br></p><p>“Loser pays for the tabs that day.” Saitama replied as he quickly picked up Pokemon Yellow.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are on.” He picked up Pokemon Blue.</p><p><br></p><p>“….Aren’t you guys busy or something?” Silas looked at them blankly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, I need to grind some levels. The gym is the rock type one and Charmander sucks in those situations.” He waved it off, already on his character selection screen.</p><p><br></p><p>“My free food is at stake here, Sil. By the way, can I get some more udon.” Saitama replied, switching on his own console.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were playing, the door to the Restaurant opened. He didn’t pay attention to the person who entered the place….until he heard Sil’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome Shizuka-san. What would you like to eat today?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru’s hands froze as he looked up slowly to see the same woman from all that time ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Ainz and Saitama paused and looked up at him and then her.</p><p><br></p><p>She too noticed their gazes and looked at them and paused at Ainz’s form, staring for a while. “That’s a cool Halloween costume.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes then went over at him. “Haven’t seen you around. Are you new here?” She then threw Saitama a look. “Finally snagged yourself a girlfriend, I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I held the urge to laugh at the look on Rimuru’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka-san was never soft in her comments….even when she was sober.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a regular at the Restaurant and had been away for a while because she was out of town.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….Rimuru here is not Saitama’s girlfriend.” I offered, all the while pinching my hand to not burst out in a laugh. “Also….he is a guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Get out!” She exclaimed and looked at me incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing my unchanging expression, she asked again. “Seriously!”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and she turned towards Rimuru. “Wow, aren’t you cute? And I thought Totsuka Saika was a trap.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ouch.</p><p><br></p><p>She slumped down in the seat beside them. “I bet girls will be all over you, aren’t they cute?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s single.” I threw in, earning a glare from Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“Eh….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Eh….no</a> way.” She looked at him. “I don’t see why. You are cute. Maybe be more assertive. Hell, I would have gone out with you. At least I wouldn’t have been stood up like the last time by that bastard Satoru.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I finally couldn't take it anymore and burst out in laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas, you bastard. Let’s take it outside if you are a man!” He stood up, angrily.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Ainz and Saitama joined me.</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________x______________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>After calming down, I explained the situation to Shizuka-san and it took her two hours and three bottles of beer to finally get on level with the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, you….are Mikami. That same guy….” She asked, once more looking at Rimuru in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am sorry for not showing up that day. I was….you know….dead and all that.”</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to give the two some space and I went to check on Zeref and others to see if they needed anything.</p><p><br></p><p>And there, something else was going on entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will be going with them?” I asked Lavinia, surprised at the sudden turn of events.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “I don’t really have much in that world and maybe a new place will help me come to terms with things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, you all should visit too. It would be a good opportunity for you to learn magic.” Zeref offered. “It will also give you all some time away till this whole incident calms down.” He added, making me consider the option.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been people sniffing around the place since that day.</p><p><br></p><p>I was able to stay safe only due to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Sakura and Tohru went shopping in Hayato-san’s world to avoid the whole mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Our training trip was postponed either way so I need some place to chill out and I cannot stay inside my Restaurant all month.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Sakura and she didn’t mind so I agreed too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I guess that sounds good.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was finally decided that we would go visit Zeref’s world and. My shop will be open in the mornings as Lavinia said that the Supernatural side of things are more active during the nights so I can more or less avoid them in the mornings.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then allow me to host you all at my place.” Zeref smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t need to pack much as the shop was near Zeref’s place so we could return back at any time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She placed the reports back on the table and looked incredulously at Azazel. “This is a joke, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man stared back at her. “As much as I would like that to be true, it’s not. I am sure your people can verify the news just as well as mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But how is something like that even possible? To….selectively kill just the members of one organisation throughout the entire country.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two organisations.” Azazel interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Even worse. We have no records of anyone from that family having this kind of power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are no records of <em>anyone</em> from any of the Three Factions….or the entire world having this kind of power.” Azazel countered. “And yet, it happened. The facts are in front of us. We just have to accept it.” He finished before picking up his drink and finishing it in one go.</p><p><br></p><p>She did the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“My theory is that the Wizards of Oz and the Utsusemi Agency encountered him and had some kind of altercation. One of their members, Augusta, the second generation Witch of the East, was the current host of Incinerate Anthem. The guy must have felt danger and decided to go all out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And wiped out everyone, from the footmen to Ultimate Class top officials?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Whoever it was, did leave the kids unharmed. Not something any member of that Clan would have done and yet there it is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There were witnesses? Do they know what happened?” She quickly asked about the new information.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. They were the kids who were kidnapped by the Utsusemi Agency. The kids had been experimented on and are still in a comatose situation. They were under control during the fight so I doubt that they would have any recollection of what transpired there that night. But just the fact that none of them were killed and even safely placed in a park, is not the behaviour of a normal Lucifer. Whoever this person is, he is not a bloodthirsty murderer.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was….better than nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you at least tell us where the kids were found? Or if you have any idea about the location of the new Lucifer?”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel looked at her strangely without any words.</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I said ‘No’. I don’t want anything to do with the new guy and I don’t want to risk the ire of that guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face blanched. “We are not looking for him to fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. But do you think I will take the risk? You know what this guy can do. Not to mention there is no guarantee that he is there. He could have easily moved on.”</p><p><br></p><p>She tried asking a few more times but Azazel was adamant so she didn’t push it.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding the place shouldn’t be hard but even she was unsure if she wanted to poke the hornet’s nest.</p><p><br></p><p>She would have to discuss this with the other three.</p><p><br></p><p>Just thinking about what could happen if someone like that decided to join the Old Satan Faction, made her dread.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“This is….amazing.” I whispered as I looked at the scene in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>And indeed it was.</p><p><br></p><p>The vast castle in front of me was something right out of fantasy movies and the lines of guards kneeling as we passed by them was awe inspiring.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I had heard that Zeref was an Emperor but the guy was so humble and all, it never felt anything like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, watching all this, it was striking me suddenly that this harmless looking guy….was really an Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the capital city of the Alvarez Empire, Vistarion and this is the Vistarion Castle, the place where Emperor Spriggan lives.” August, the old man with Zeref explained as we walked through the streets.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside me, Sakura and Lavinia were looking at the palace curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was more composed but I did see the surprise in Lavinia’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“This really is a different world.” She whispered but I was pretty sure that everyone around us had heard.</p><p><br></p><p>We were led inside the castle and Zeref commanded. “August, show them their rooms and when they are rested, take them to the library and lend them any help they need with their magic.”<br><br></p><p>“Yes, your majesty.”</p><p><br></p><p>August led us to our rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked in awe as even a single room was the size of my whole Restaurant here.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you all require anything, command the servants outside the door. They will take care of all your needs. When you feel like it, ask any of them to send me a message and I will take you to the library and we can check what kind of magic you all are compatible with. We can proceed from there.” August respectfully bowed and left us to our rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>All our rooms were near each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura’s room was on my left and Lavinia’s room was in front of mine and there were five servants standing beside the doors.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, talk about over the top.</p><p><br></p><p>We had already eaten when leaving the Restaurant so there was no need for food that said, all of us were tired from the day’s work so we went off to take some rest.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow.” The word came out of my mouth as soon as I saw the library.</p><p><br></p><p>Even just by eyesight, the library was no smaller than a soccer field with shelves four times taller than me, all filled with books.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t even imagine the number of books in this place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are all these magic books?” I asked, looking at the place in awe.</p><p><br></p><p>“Most. There are also books on other subjects, history, geography, mythology and so on. We have a copy of almost every book available on the continent as well as a large part of the ones from the other continents. Although, magic books consist of more than 70 percent of the total collection.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how would we even find what kind of magic would suit us?” I asked, looking at the old man.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled and led us to a large table with many chairs around it. There were already two girls sitting there.</p><p><br></p><p>One was a little green haired girl and the other was a blonde one.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them were looking at us with curiosity in their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“These are my students, Brandish μ and Dimaria Yesta.” He introduced before motioning for us to take a seat and when we did, he explained further. “First we need to learn about the basics of magic and how it works in our world. We can proceed from there.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Magic is the physical embodiment of the spirit. When the physical spirit of an organism connects with the spiritual flow of nature, the spirit forms Magic as a product of the connection. Though Magic goes beyond reason, it is still born of reason and it takes an enormous amount of concentration and mental ability to use it. One's Magical Powers are also tied to one's life force.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded as I took in his words. </p><p><br></p><p>“One's strength of feelings plays an important part in one's ability to properly use Magic. The key to Magic begins with a heart that has faith, similar to religion, healing and fortune telling, only those with faith can perceive it. Having faith in the existence of Magic, their own power and faith that they live alongside nature, are the ones who can use Magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In this world, Magic is classified into two types, Caster Magic and Holder Magic. Caster Magic is primarily Magic that is expelled from the body while Holder Magic is Magic that requires a Mage to use an external source such as a Magic Items to do Magic. It usually requires the use of a Mage’s Magic Power, though there are some exceptions such as Items that are powered by Lacrima.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw that Sakura was taking notes while he said everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Within these two divisions, there are several subdivisions. Ancient Magic, Lost Magic, Magical Items, etc. Ancient Magic is the magic used in the Ancient Times and Lost Magic are Ancient Magics which were erased or were lost in history due to the danger they possessed to their wielders and the high difficulty to learn them. Every mage has an affinity to certain types of magic. We will check your affinity with certain elements and see which ones you are suited to learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we learn any magic without having an affinity with them?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. However they will progress much slower than the ones you have affinity with. Although there are many types of magic without any kind of affinity, they are quite hard to learn. We are going to start with something easier to let you get a hang of the magic.” He answered as he brought the device in front of us. </p><p><br></p><p>“This is a device that Miss Irene has Enchanted with her Magic. It has several spells of different elements grafted into it. When the user puts their magic inside, it activates the spells to a different degree depending on the compatibility of the user with the specific element. With this we can know which element you have an affinity with.”</p><p><br></p><p>He started the device and turned it towards us. “Please put your hand on the crystal ball and inject your magic slowly.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could take the initiative first, Sakura stood up.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and she nodded towards me before putting her hand on the crystal.</p><p><br></p><p>Three bars increased to the top. One black, one silver and the last white and there was another bar with Blue Colour which increased quite a bit. Other bars had much slower reactions.</p><p><br></p><p>August saw this too. “Hmm, Curses, Space and Non-Elemental and a High Water Affinity too. That’s quite good. In fact, it’s extremely rare to see someone with elemental affinities this high. Alright, next.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went up next. With a deep breath, I injected some of my magic in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The device lit up again.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver, Blue, Icy Blue, Black and White.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, Space, Water, Ice, Curses and Non-Elemental and all are top class although Ice and Water seem to be the best even among these. That’s honestly the best result I have seen in all my time. Alright, Miss Lavinia, if you would.”</p><p><br></p><p>The last girl nodded and placed her hand on the crystal.</p><p><br></p><p>Icy Blue, Red and White, although the white one was lower than the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ice, Fire and Non-Elemental. This is interesting. Having an affinity with opposite elements is very rare, almost unseen. It is especially so when the affinities are so high.” He grabbed his chin as he looked at the device. “Very well, let’s start with simple things then.” He waved his hand and several books flew from the shelves and landed in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, August explained several magics to us which we could use.</p><p><br></p><p>“So I can learn all the types of magic I have an affinity for?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be true. In fact with your affinities, you will probably be able to master several of them although I would advise against that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s better to be a master of one type of magic and novice of a thousand.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, the Bruce Lee thing, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?” The man looked confused so I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“There was a great martial artist called Bruce Lee. He once said ‘I fear not the man who has practised 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practised one kick 10,000 times.’”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s an interesting phrase and a very true one at that but that’s not the only reason. There are other factors as well. You see untrained magic doesn’t generally have a flavour. As one trains one specific type of magic, their magic gains the flavour and properties of that specific magic and their aura undergoes subtle changes. Over time, these changes become more prominent and affect their magic, further increasing their power.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone listened as the man explained everything patiently.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s why it’s rare for people to see someone using Fire and Ice magics and be great in both of them. It’s because their magic takes on the properties of one element and decreases the power of the other magic. To avoid this, people generally practise magics which have closer affinities with each other like Water and Ice or Fire and Lightning. On the other hand, practising Non Elemental Magic completely bypasses this problem”</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at Lavinia and August understood what we were saying. “You don’t have to worry. Her case is a bit different. She will not face the same problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>I selected the simple Ice Magic. According to August this was the best route for me as this magic as my magic already had an icy feel to it. This magic had other variants which could be raised to a very high level.</p><p><br></p><p>At the highest levels, someone could freeze even abstract things like emotions, free will and even other magic itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie, that sounded so fucking cool.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura on the other hand wanted to learn Space Magic and Lavinia wanted to work with her Fire Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus started our stay in the Alvarez Empire Castle.</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________x______________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I controlled my mana and shaped the magic and watched in fascination as the flowers on the tree all froze, leaving everything else unharmed.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been two weeks since we had started learning magic and soon after, I discovered that I was apparently extremely talented with Ice and Water Magic. August, Irene and Zeref’s words, not mine.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess my Skills from Rimuru’s world had something to do with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then, I have started to focus more on control.</p><p><br></p><p>The lessons provided by Irene and August certainly helped with it.</p><p><br></p><p>“No matter how many times I see this, I am amazed. Your control over the element is really amazing.” Irene sighed. “Next, defrost the flowers and freeze the leaves.” She commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and concentrated once more.</p><p><br></p><p>This was harder as if I directly removed the ice, the flowers would crumble and her order was to defrost the ice, not break it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sage ran as things slowed in front of me and my magic flowed to my command, slipping from the Ice as I changed the element to water and with another thought, covered the leaves with my power. It was much harder as there were too many of the leaves and I had to keep the branches from freezing.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after a minute or so later, the leaves were covered and I used my Ice Magic to freeze them.</p><p><br></p><p>She went ahead and checked the leaves, plucking some of them out and checked if they were frozen completely or not. After several minutes, she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Now defrost this. I like the flowers in my garden and I don’t want the plants to die so be careful.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I controlled the corner of my lips from twitching.</p><p><br></p><p>In these two weeks, I had come to know them better.</p><p><br></p><p>Miss Irene….she was not a bad person. She just behaved like one more often than not to keep up a charade. She was more of someone playing the bad cop than an actual bad person.</p><p><br></p><p>It would not be obvious to people who didn’t know her closely and sometimes not even them but I had observed that her actions were contradictory. That said, I wouldn’t doubt it for a moment that she was dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>The longer we stayed here, the more we learned about the whole Empire and the people whom I have been treating so casually till now.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref was the Emperor of the Alvarez Empire….which was the only empire on the entire continent.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy had single handedly made an empire from scratch and ruled it with an iron fist. That was not to say he was disliked by the people.</p><p><br></p><p>On the contrary, the public here loved him and his subordinates, the Spriggan 12.</p><p><br></p><p>They were a group of top mages who assisted Zeref’s rule over the Empire. August and Irene were a part of this group.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of them had the power to bring down countries.</p><p><br></p><p>That meant that Irene could literally bring down a country by herself. Not that it was that much of a surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>From Tohru’s words, I knew that she was a dragon too. This much….was understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only her, August, that old man was an utter hax.</p><p><br></p><p>His Copy Magic was one of the most broken things I had ever seen and I was someone who could cut through fate.</p><p><br></p><p>After my training, I was given a break so I went back to the library.</p><p><br></p><p>I was trying to learn the language of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, apparently I could speak all languages but couldn’t read or write them and I didn’t want to let go of so many books. This led to me taking lessons on the language of this world along with Brandish and Dimaria by August.</p><p><br></p><p>“And so she turned it tiny. His face was so funny when he looked at the cart hahahaha.” I heard the giggles of Dimaria.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was making fun of me.” The other voice complained, trying to justify herself. This was Brandish.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s no good, Brandish-chan. You shouldn’t do that to other people.” A third voice, the one I recognised as Lavinia’s, reprimanded the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the room to see the two younger girls sitting on either side of Lavinia and talking to her. Sakura was sitting beside them and watching them with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Brandish and Dimaria were both young, around ten or eleven and there were no other kids that age in this place.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, that wouldn’t be true. There was Invel but he was still sixteen and mostly outside. The only reason I even knew about him was because he was also an ice mage and came to see me when he heard about me.</p><p><br></p><p>This led the two girls to latch on to Lavinia who had a very friendly, albeit airheaded personality and this made her a hit with others.</p><p><br></p><p>In just two weeks, they were like sisters. </p><p><br></p><p>In fact, it was not just these two, even Sakura was getting close to Lavinia and they got along quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>I was very happy about this as Sakura didn’t easily open up with others. Normally, she only talked with me and Tohru in the Restaurant and sometimes with Miu when she came but. This was not good for her as she was literally shutting herself down.</p><p><br></p><p>But Lavinia’s personality had won her over in this time. Maybe it was due to their pasts or just the chemistry between the two, they were becoming the best of friends in a very short time. And it was not just Sakura who was improving, even Lavinia was far more cheerful than she was that day. She always smiled and played or chatted with them when she had free time.</p><p><br></p><p>August had offered her an apprenticeship and she had accepted it under the persistent begging of Brandish and Dimaria.</p><p><br></p><p>They noticed me and turned towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas!” The two kids looked at me and cheered up.</p><p><br></p><p>They got to know me better when they visited my Restaurant with Lavinia and ate my cooking. They have been my fan since then and have constantly pestered me to cook for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Only August’s strict words stopped them but that didn’t reduce their enthusiasm.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked and sat beside Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you finish your training?” Sakura asked as she summoned a towel and handed it to me which I took with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Requip Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the Space Type ability Sakura had started with. She didn’t want to learn it for fighting purposes but rather to work as a waitress in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, with this, she could carry many orders easily.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at the girl's reply and nodded. </p><p><br></p><p>According to August, this magic was very good for someone to start with Space Magic as it helped them sense space properly. As she progresses more, she can learn other types of space magic too.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I wanted to learn Space Magic as well, as I too had an affinity for it and Requip was quite convenient, I could get more or less an inventory of sorts if I learned it.</p><p><br></p><p>As for learning Advanced Magic, I was going to go forward with Ice Magic while Sakura wanted to try some non elemental ones to see if she could learn something new.</p><p><br></p><p>Irene told me that there was a Magic called the God Slayer Magic in their archives and that it could be suitable for Lavinia. They had both Ice and Fire Elements and they would be a perfect fit for her since she now had two Sacred Gears capable of killing Gods attached to her soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah. Apparently, when I defeated that woman, her Sacred Gear was left inside her body and attached itself to her soul.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the reason for her unusual dual affinities and why she could use both to a high degree without suffering any disadvantages.</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie, I wanted to learn Ice God Slayer Magic too but as it turns out, the Demon Seed which Zeref had planted inside me made me more compatible with the Ice Devil Slayer Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>A Devil Slayer Devil….as odd that sounded, it was the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps that was due to the unusual name of the magic. While the Devil Slayer Magic was highly effective against Devils and Demonic Beings, it was in essence the magic used by Demons.</p><p><br></p><p>Humans had copied the magic and used it against them.</p><p><br></p><p>This however was not easy to do as the more someone uses the Devil Slayer Magic, the more they are affected by it. With prolonged use, a Devil Seed is born inside them and keeps getting empowered until it blooms.</p><p><br></p><p>When that happens, the human turns into a demon themselves. This more often than not leads to personality changes.</p><p><br></p><p>So in essence, you become the being you hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>The same was the case with Dragon Slayer Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, Irene-san was once a human too and was actually the person who invented Dragon Slayer Magic and was the first user of that magic.</p><p><br></p><p>She unfortunately didn’t know the effects of this power and by the time she realised it, it was too late. She had become a dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>That was however not the case with me as I was already a devil, so all it did was empower me.</p><p><br></p><p>I had also wondered if the God Slayer Magic would make someone a God but August had denied it.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, Gods were above even Dragons and becoming a God was not that easy.</p><p><br></p><p>The last two weeks have been an amazing experience for us and if I was honest, this was the kind of magic I was expecting when I started learning Jujutsu, especially learning it with other friends like this.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things before August came and began our lessons.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was awakened in the middle of the night when I felt someone by my side. I was pretty sure I was sleeping alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I froze when I felt a breath on my back and soon after, there was movement and an arm fell on my chest and a leg wrapped around my waist.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned back almost mechanically and saw the view became clearer.</p><p><br></p><p>Blonde hair came to view first and finally I saw the one sleeping by my side, Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>….why was she here?</p><p><br></p><p>When exactly did she get here?</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to move but the movement only made her snuggle closer to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I felt warm on my side and looking below, I saw white.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind blanked for a moment and I stopped moving.</p><p><br></p><p>What the hell was she wearing….or not wearing? A closer look gave me the answer. Was that my shirt? Why was she wearing my shirt? But most of all, what was she doing in my bed?</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I knew, she wasn’t someone of bad character and neither had she given me any indication that she was into me or something, so why did she suddenly jump in my bed?</p><p><br></p><p>I took some deep breaths and finally decided to do something about the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook her lightly to wake her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavinia, Lavinia….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Silas-kun?” She asked with a sleepy voice and half open eyes. “What are you doing in my bed?” She asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Your bed? This is my bed!” I replied, trying to not make a scene and wake others up. It really didn’t look good for any of the two of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Why is your bed in my room?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“It isn’t. This is my room….and before you ask me, that is my shirt.” I said pointing towards the unbuttoned shirt she was wearing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” She was really not into it.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you get here?” I asked, trying to make some sense of everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” She put a finger on her cheek and made a thinking pose. “Think I got up to go to the restroom….then I was feeling cold so I wore the shirt hanging there and came and slept. It was warm here.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Just that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” She nodded resolutely and her grip on my body increased. “You feel warm and cool at the same time. It feels nice.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked blankly at the girl. “That’s it?</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Why, you don’t like snuggling?”</p><p><br></p><p>It really couldn’t be just that, right?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she interested in me….she hadn't shown any intentions like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she pulling a prank on me?</p><p><br></p><p>Are people watching?</p><p><br></p><p>Several thoughts came to my mind and I’ll be honest, the last one was looking the most reasonable.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, let’s see how far you can go for the prank then.</p><p><br></p><p>So I put up my best smile and faced her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I like snuggles alright. Normally when I get snuggles at night, I get a good night kiss before that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. I didn’t know that.” She answered and then before I could say anything, she leaned in and kissed my cheek. “There you go.” She smiled sincerely.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to find a reply but couldn’t and she snuggled into my side and closed her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>After fifteen minutes or so, her breathing became even and she had fallen asleep once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this really a prank?</p><p><br></p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Jiraiya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean you cannot find him?” He shouted as he banged the table, looking at the man he called sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>In the shadows the Anbu shifted but a light shake from Sabutobi-sensei made them stop.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have searched every corner of the village, sent out search teams all over the Land of Fire but there are no indications of him even leaving the village. Even his scent just disappeared from one place in the middle of the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have anyone you doubt? Give me the names. I will make them talk.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think I cannot do that, Jiraiya?” The man raised his voice and he sensed that the old man was already very unhappy with his own lack of results. The man finally sighed. “Things are not that simple. The village is in a very dangerous position right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this about the Uchiha?” He asked and the old man just massaged his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Uchiha are indeed agitated but they are not behind this. Things have calmed down a bit since I have put Danzo under arrest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Could it be Danzo?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man didn’t answer and just stared at the wall behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Old man, if this is really Danzo then he has crossed the line. You have to do something about him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t know if it’s Danzo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But you doubt him, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man kept quiet and spoke after a few seconds. “Don’t worry. If it’s Danzo, I will personally rip his other arm off if I have to. He is not getting out of Anbu watch till Naruto is back. If that means he dies of old age in that room….so be it.”</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time Jiraiya felt a chill from his words.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man was really mad at the old bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>They talked about several things before the old man finally broached the subject. “I have a mission for you, Jiraiya.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Find Tsunade and bring her back to the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the old man blankly.</p><p><br></p><p>“She won’t come back, sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then drag her back. This is an order from the Hokage. She will either return or be declared rogue.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya’s eyes widened and he found his mouth open slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have all lost people close to us and yet we are here….dealing with everything. I have allowed her a very long break. I think it’s time that she dealt with her issues. If I have to force her to do so, then so be it. Consider it the last lesson from me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He shut his mouth and nodded seeing the resolute look on the old man’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will also keep an eye and ear open for any news of Naruto.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>As Jiraiya left, he couldn’t help but notice that the old man….seemed to have aged a lot since the last time he saw him.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So many things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kanna Kamui has arrived at the Restaurant.

That was not to say I wasn’t embarrassed at the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>To further increase my embarrassment, I felt my lower head become harder at the sight in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Scolding myself inwardly at my thought for the woman who was trying to help me out in such a time, I shook my head and slowly tried to calm down.</p><p><br></p><p>She was holding me tightly and any kind of movements would have awakened her and I didn’t want her to see me in this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday had been stressful for everyone and I didn’t want to wake up so soon. So I decided to lay down for a while too.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost an hour later, she shook slightly and I looked in her direction to see her awaken.</p><p><br></p><p>Her grip on me became lighter and I took the opportunity to move away….although a small part of me could feel the reluctance when I did so.</p><p><br></p><p>Me leaving the bed finally woke her up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas. Did you wake up?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, alright. Give me a few minutes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Take your time. I just wanted some water.” I replied before taking one last look at her and leaving the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure I heard a chuckle.</p><p><br></p><p>She was really trying to get a rise out of me….as usual.</p><p><br></p><p>In all this time, I had figured out that she liked getting me flustered.</p><p><br></p><p>It was usually when she wore a towel when she came out of the bath.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t bothered by this as it was her way of showing her closeness and trust.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, today was a big day for us.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, we were going to get rewarded for the whole World Mission.</p><p><br></p><p>The quest had been updated after the fight ended yesterday but it was still not completed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>World Quest - 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Beginning of the End</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A great danger is opening its eyes as chaos has started to spread all over the continent.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brace up and fight against the approaching darkness for a chance to survive.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective: 1.

Defend the gates after the start of the war.(Completed)</strong></p><p><strong>Objective 4: Attend the Award Ceremony.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Award Ceremony was going to be held in the afternoon today so we still had a few hours left.</p><p><br></p><p>I went and got refreshed and took a bath before Veena was up.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I came out, she was already dressed and preparing for breakfast and Shiroe was there too.</p><p><br></p><p>We sat down together for breakfast and discussed our future plans.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….you were followed by people when you came here?” I asked Shiroe who nodded as he took a bite of his pancakes.</p><p><br></p><p>“This was to be expected as we stood out too much in the World Mission. People were bound to notice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not worried about them noticing us. What I am worried about is what they would do about it.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….do you mean try to discover our so-called secret?” I asked and he nodded again.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have no idea how persistent people can be. Even in my gaming days, we were hounded by people who wanted to know how we cleared such high level raids.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Any suggestions on what we should do?” I asked. </p><p><br></p><p>“To be honest, I am not good with these things. Kanami was the one who took care of the people and did most of the talking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So no ideas?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….it’s not like there are no ideas….I just don’t know how effective they will be.” He confessed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s hear it. Maybe it will give us some hint on what to do.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can….give them what they want?” He said finally.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, from what I am imagining, most of them will want to know how we did what we did….so we just disclose the information. We don’t need to give them anything personal but the information about the quest is something we can relay as it doesn’t have any use anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow at his suggestion and he explained further.</p><p><br></p><p>“The only reason we could even do so many things was because you saved that girl in the Knight Class Advancement Quest. Without it, we probably wouldn’t have been able to do anything and have to fight normally like other people. In a way, it was a factor of luck. Then again, it could be a unique case due to us being the first team who cleared that quest which would mean we were just faster than everyone else.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded understanding his reasoning.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for how we hunt….well, it’s not as if they are some insane game breaking cheat methods. The only reason we could do so is because of our personal skill levels, teamwork and focused grinding to level up. Even if they knew, they would probably not be able to replicate it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not like no one is going to figure out that using Chili Powder on monsters works as well. People are already using baits and other items made by Herbalists. We were just the first to use them and that gave us an advantage and our lead over everyone else.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think Shiroe’s suggestions are quite good.” Veena spoke for the first time in the discussion and we looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing us focused on her, she elaborated further. “Tell me what we were discussing the day before yesterday?”</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered and answered. “About how to make a guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. We can use this information as an attraction for people to join our side.” She said and it was actually a good plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s right.” Shiroe nodded. “I can imagine many players, at least the lower level ones, would totally gather around us for such things. Remember, even basic information and class advancement information were up for sale.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s not all.” Veena continued. “Remember our situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“In the game, trapped, fighting for a chance to get out….that situation.” She rolled her eyes, making me blush. “Anyways, our main goal is to get out of this game by beating it….and the more players….the better chance we have to do so. I think giving other people this basic information and ways to hunt more efficiently….we are enabling the lower level players to level up quickly and thus increase the chance of us beating the game.”</p><p><br></p><p>That….makes a lot of sense.</p><p><br></p><p>Till now, I had been considering myself alone but as we know….it’s almost impossible to beat an MMO alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially this one, where we weren’t exactly competing against one another but rather the game itself.</p><p><br></p><p>The more players who are higher level, the more access we will have to stronger people and the more the chance to clear the game.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, we can spread the news after we make our guild and use it to attract people as Shiroe said.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah….about making a guild.” Shiroe suddenly spoke and we looked at the man. “Apparently it’s not that easy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? Don’t we have to just sign up our names with the City Lord?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I used the time yesterday to talk with some of the high level Knights and find out more information. We can form official teams by just registering at the Adventurer's Guild but to make a guild, we need several other things. I was confusing the two earlier.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then he went on to bring a piece of pen and paper and make a list.</p><p><br></p><p>“One member in the Sixth Tier or higher as the Guild Leader.”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that already but there were other ways too. I had read the information the first time I had visited the Hunter’s Lodge. While I didn’t read the Guild part further, I knew there were other guilds too.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough Shiroe continued. “Good thing there are other ways to get past that but the conditions become stringent.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We would need to satisfy several other conditions. First, we would need someone to be at least a Fifth Tier. We can soon get that covered with you.” He ticked off the first one.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I just needed to get two more levels for the Fifth Tier so it can be done.</p><p><br></p><p>“Second, we need a property, possibly a house or building as the official base of the Guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>That….will be hard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we rent it?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, there were no mentions of having a permanent address so I guess rented places will work too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s doable.”</p><p><br></p><p>We did have enough to rent a house for two years or so even before the whole raid and that amount has only increased during the raid due to all the drops and whole trade we did of the healing items.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lastly, we need official permission from the City Lord and the country to establish a guild. This is the hardest part as generally people have to make some huge contribution towards the country to be allowed this….or just pay one million gold coins and get the Guild Order.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How much?!” I asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah….I was shocked too. I guess they want people to make contributions towards the country rather than just pay their way into making guilds. It will probably be some quest or something.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still trying to comprehend the concept of one million gold coins.</p><p><br></p><p>Fucking hell, that would take us years….</p><p><br></p><p>“But hey, there are apparently several benefits of having guilds too. The guy couldn’t tell me everything in detail but guilds can be upgraded by levels too. Bronze, Silver, Gold Ranked Guilds. Each of them supposedly grants some form of <em>blessing</em> as he called it, to the Guild Members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Blessing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess it must be some kind of bonus stats or buffs or something….” Shiroe shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>How much and what kind of buffs are we talking about?” I asked, suddenly interested.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe shook his head. “No idea. But it doesn’t exactly matter, does it. Any kind of extra and free buff will attract people to join our guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And not many people will be able to make guilds so it will be hard for anyone to compete with us.” Veena added.</p><p><br></p><p>“True. That means, next up we have to put the hunt for a Guild Order on the list of things to do. I said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. But even then, we can always try to socialise with other people and try to form an unofficial guild of sorts.” Veena said and we agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed some more things before it was time to go to the Town Square to attend the Award Ceremony.</p><p><br></p><p>There were already many people gathered in the place and our entry gathered a lot of attention.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people looked at us and some were whispering among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Looks like things are developing just as you expected.” I said to Veena who looked completely unbothered at all the attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t pay attention to them, dear.” She replied, nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>She must be in a position where she has to deal with the normal public more often.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from the other players, we received the nods from many Knights as well.</p><p><br></p><p>We gathered at the head of the crowd, near the Knights and the stage where the City Lord would give his speech.</p><p><br></p><p>A while later, the countdown came to zero and the City Lord appeared on the stage with another person whom I recognised as the Holy Knight we had seen yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dear Citizens, I am very happy to inform you that the deadly threat to our home, Llyne….has finally been taken care of. We have finally destroyed all the goblin settlements in the surrounding areas of Llyne.” He shouted, letting everyone digest the information. “....And for that….I cannot thank you enough.” He finished.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my citizens, this entire endeavour would have been fruitless without your assistance. Without all of you, we probably wouldn’t have lasted a single hour against the attacking forces, let alone stop them long enough for the Knight Brigade to arrive and end the threat once and for all. For this….I am and will be eternally grateful to all of you. Give yourselves a big round of applause.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd cheered loudly at his speech and he let everyone settle before continuing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now coming back to other matters. As promised, your assistance in our moment of grave danger will not be forgotten. Everyone will be rewarded for their help according to their contribution. Everyone’s contribution has been recorded by our Knights and they can collect their rewards from our Knights. That said, the top ten contributors are going to get rewarded by us personally. The one presenting the awards will be the Commander of the twentieth Legion of Knights under the Emperor, Holy Knight, Marquis Lord Conrad Black.” He turned towards the other man and bowed slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd applauded.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in question himself looked at the crowd and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Just on cue, Kenneth came forward giving him a piece of parchment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, before I start calling on the brave warriors, I would like to clarify some things. Those who were working in parties, will have their points calculated according to their contribution in damaging the Goblins.”</p><p><br></p><p>That explains a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas.” I heard Shiroe whisper to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Change your class to Knight before the announcements. Maybe it could help us get some quests or something from the Conrad guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.” I did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>On the stage, the City Lord started announcing the names of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>“In tenth place with three hundred and fifteen points is….Shooting for Milfs. Please come up and collect your rewards.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was a long silence in the entire Town Square.</p><p><br></p><p>It lasted for a few seconds before it was broken by a small chuckle which then increased and spread around as if it was a virus and covered the entire Town Square in almost an instant.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t get it. What is so funny about it?” Veena asked me, looking confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes. There she goes with her teasing again.</p><p><br></p><p>….or at least I thought so at the start.</p><p><br></p><p>Her expression didn’t change for a while and I realised that she actually….really didn’t understand what the name meant.</p><p><br></p><p>Very hesitantly I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“The name or rather the word Milf stands for….Mother’s I’d like to….well….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....oh.” The look of realisation dawned in her eyes and she giggled too. “Oh my, that <em>is</em> funny. But then again, why would someone use such a name for themselves?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They were probably using this account to get a feel for the game then make another account. It’s quite normal for people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Although there are some people who do this just for fun or to troll….” Looking at her confusion at the word, Shiroe added. “Troll is someone who takes pleasure in causing drama by arguing with people without wanting or accepting anyone's response. People can have a weird sense of humour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That they do.”</p><p><br></p><p>We looked as a brown haired guy with glasses slowly walked up the stage. His face was red from the reaction of the crowd but he still received the reward.</p><p><br></p><p>The Holy Knight brought out a bow for the guy and presented it to the guy. “This is an Elven Bow made by the Woodelves of the Fairy Forest. I thank you for your contribution. You are a brave warrior, Shooting for Milfs. May you receive success in your endeavours.” The man completed solemnly.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd erupted in another burst of laughter while the guy looked like he wanted the ground to open up and swallow him whole just so he could escape from the whole mess.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at Veena and saw that she was actually having fun with the whole thing instead of being offended and I sighed a breath of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor guy quickly climbed down the stage and ran off somewhere, probably to hide.</p><p><br></p><p>The City Lord, unaware of what just happened and the real reason for people laughing, continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“In ninth place with four hundred and nineteen points is Dolphin Puncher.”</p><p><br></p><p>The next guy was actually a close combat fighter. I knew Gareth was a Martial Artist, a brawler to be exact but I hadn’t seen him yet so it was a surprise to see one here first. He looked like a middle aged man with black hair and the same coloured eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He got a pair of boots and left the stage to go stand in one corner.</p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of my eyes, I saw three people going to talk to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe followed my gaze and looked at the people and filled me in. “That guy is Dwain’s Party member.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>This is actually a good place to scout out potential members for any group.</p><p><br></p><p>The City Lord however didn’t give them any time and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“In eighth place with four hundred and thirty five points is….oh my, how do I spell this….” The man paused before taking a deep breath and forced himself to spell the name. “XxX_VoidSamurai_XxX.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had a sabre on his side and walked up the stage and collected his prize.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked quite happy at the reward and bowed before leaving the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Should we?” I asked Shiroe.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. We should wait till the names are all announced. Talking to them after we get a better place will be more advantageous in a negotiation.” Veena said as she looked at the guy too.</p><p><br></p><p>We nodded and looked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one people came forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Seventh Place was a guy called Messer. From the looks of it. He was an archer too.</p><p><br></p><p>He got a plate mail helmet.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, I needed a good helmet.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe saw me eying the helmet and said. “He’s in Gareth’s team so I doubt he would trade it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, there are a lot of Archers in the group.” Veena commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. They could most likely snipe as many enemies as they could from the safety of the walls. This type of raid gives an excellent advantage to any ranged attackers like archers.” Shiroe replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“In sixth place is Gareth with five hundred and eighty five points.”</p><p><br></p><p>A bulky man with a slightly balding head walked up. He was wearing a light leather armour and the rest of his gear were above the rest too.</p><p><br></p><p>He was given a pair of Gauntlets.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy equipped it instantly and waved at the crowd before climbing down the stairs.</p><p><br></p><p>Several people gathered around him and the crowd looked at him too.</p><p><br></p><p>“In fifth place with seven hundred and eighteen points is Dwain.”</p><p><br></p><p>A blonde guy who looked like he would be in his thirties walked up the stairs. He had a confident smirk on his face. In fact, the female players were actually more excited. The guy also seemed to revel in their attention. He waved to the crowd with a smile before bowing to the Holy Knight to receive his reward.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was rewarded with a magic bow. He smiled as he looked at the bow.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess he was reading the effects of the bow.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking satisfied with whatever he read, he went another step and nocked an arrow in and fired it in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>The arrow changed into a streak of flame and tore through the air.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh….</p><p><br></p><p>The guy thanked the Holy Knight once more and came down the stage and to his group before he was surrounded by many people.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s the enthusiasm. Now, in fourth place with one thousand and eleven points is….Shooting Star.”</p><p><br></p><p>Murmurs ran through the crowd as a guy in what looked to be a cow-boy hat, waked up the stage. He had a bow on his back and a sword on his side.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Shiroe. “Know him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe shook his head. “No. I haven’t even heard of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at the guy and saw that he was a young guy around my age. He had black hair and blue eyes and was extremely calm even in the face of all the stares and murmurs.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not what attracted my attention.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing that attracted my attention was his level.</p><p><br></p><p>“Level 29 Hunter.” I said and Shiroe took another look at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously?!” Shiroe looked at the guy again. “That’s amazing. He has to be the highest level player apart from our team in this town.” He exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy probably sensed my stare and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Our eyes met and he smiled at us before going towards the Holy Knight and collecting his reward.</p><p><br></p><p>He got a crossbow, and a….Skill Book.</p><p><br></p><p>Many eyes were attracted to that Skill Book but the guy didn’t care as he walked down the stairs and went to another corner and stood there with his back to the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>Before the crowd could bother them, the City Lord’s voice stopped them.</p><p><br></p><p>“And now, we come to the last three people. The three people who changed the entire course of the war with their wit and courage. These three people not only faced the Goblin Hordes but also led people and defended their gates with less than tenth of the force used by other gates. I cannot find words good enough to praise them. Without them, I doubt we could have won this war as comfortably as we did. So without any further ado, let me call them to receive their honour. In third place with thirty nine thousand points is….Veena.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a sudden outburst at information as the crowd went wild.</p><p><br></p><p>I could hear the exclamations of thirty nine thousand and that’s impossible, ring through the entire place. There were even claims of us cheating.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah….tell that to the Game Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Shooting Star guy was looking at us with stunned eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at Veena and gave her a nod and she took the lead to go to the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, most of the people didn’t know her name and they stared at our group in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena went up to the stage and received her reward. The Holy Knight said something to her which we couldn’t hear.</p><p><br></p><p>She was given a plate mail armour armour bottom, two pieces of papers, a book which I assume was a Skill Book and a ring.</p><p><br></p><p>She curtsied to the Holy Knight and walked down to us with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Next up, in second place with fifty seven thousand points is….Shiroe.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe gave me a fist bump before walking forward.</p><p><br></p><p>The Holy Knight talked to him too and gifted him with three Skill Books, a necklace and a robe.</p><p><br></p><p>While this was happening, Kenneth came to me from the side and informed me about few things</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, everyone was looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>There was almost no doubt in anyone’s mind that the last person had to be me.</p><p><br>And sure enough, the City Lord continued. “And finally, I am especially happy to announce this name as the person. He is not only the one who brought the plan to protect the three gates to me but put his life as a bet to allow him the chance to do so. A member of Llyne’s own Knight Academy, with one hundred and fifteen thousand points is….Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>The npcs clapped with all their might while the Knights drew their sword and presented me with a salute while I walked up the stage to receive my reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Players on the other hand….they were quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess one hundred and fifteen thousand points was just that absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>On the stage, I was faced with the Holy Knight.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Kenneth had instructed me how to greet the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>I kneeled on one knee, with my sword placed beside me on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The man drew his sword and placed it on my shoulders one after another just like I had seen royalty knighting people. Then again, this guy was a Marquis too so maybe this was just that.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of this, I heard the voice say. “Rise.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up and stood to my feet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Knight Arthas. You and your group were the ones who investigated the disappearance of our scout party and alerted us to the brewing chaos among the goblins. Without this, we would have been caught off guard and countless lives would have been lost.” He said in a noble voice, loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the crowd from the corner of my eyes and saw many of their eyes widen in realisation but didn’t pay attention to them as the man continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not only that, when you found out about the danger to the town, you stepped up once again and with your team, did the impossible and stopped around five thousand goblins across three gates with barely any forces and even took down one of their commanders in the process. This Commander, Gurthak, the Cruel, was wanted throughout the province and had a reward on his head. Your bravery and quick wit has saved the life of every citizen of this town. For this….you will be rewarded. I, Conrad Black, Lord of Greenfrost, by the right vested in me by His Majesty, the King, present you with a piece of land in Greenfrost as well as the rank of a Baron. May your blade cut down the enemies of the Kingdom and your shield become an invincible wall to protect the peace of the Kingdom.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that he presented me two scrolls for the said deeds.</p><p><br></p><p>Woah.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a moment to realise what had just happened.</p><p><br></p><p>He then handed me several things.</p><p><br></p><p>An armour, a sword, shield, three Skill Books and finally a scroll of some kind tied with a Red Ribbon.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could check what they were, the City Lord stepped forward so I stored them in my inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>“From the town of Llyne and the Knight Academy, you are awarded a mansion in the residential area to congratulate you for your achievement.” He added while presenting me with the deeds to the house too.</p><p><br></p><p>I bowed to him too and then I stepped down before walking towards Veena and Shiroe.</p><p><br></p><p>“And with that, the Award Ceremony for the day is finished. I urge the rest to collect their due rewards from the stand outside the Knight Academy based on your achievement points. Thank you all for helping us again. Have a good day.”</p><p><br></p><p>With his last words, the quest was updated once more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>World Quest - 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Beginning of the End</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A great danger is opening its eyes as chaos has started to spread all over the continent.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brace up and fight against the approaching darkness for a chance to survive.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective: 1.

Is it an illegal class?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have enough time to check the rewards as I had to step down from the stage. I will have to do it at the end of the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, as soon as the City Lord and the Marquis left, the crowd went wild.</p><p><br></p><p>We were surrounded with questions.</p><p><br></p><p>How did you get such a high score?</p><p><br></p><p>What level are you?</p><p><br></p><p>How did you level up?</p><p><br>Did you find any loopholes or glitches?</p><p><br></p><p>Where do you people hunt?</p><p><br></p><p>What are your skills?</p><p><br></p><p>Did you get some new classes?</p><p><br></p><p>Do you have any unique items or skills?</p><p><br></p><p>What colour are your panties?</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t find the one who asked the last question or I would have broken his nose.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason we could even understand everything was because of our high stats.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t used to these situations but I had enough experience with people to not be overwhelmed.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe on the other hand looked troubled.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who was the most comfortable was Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>She took the lead and addressed all of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you all have questions and we are willing to answer some of those questions as long as they are not personal. This….however is not the way to ask questions. So, let’s all take a step back. Right now many people have to collect their quest rewards and take care of things. If we do any meetings now, we wouldn’t be able to address everyone at once and it will just prolong the problem, so, we can gather in the park outside the Knight’s tomorrow evening and address everyone’s questions once and for all. I hope everyone will understand this and cooperate.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were some grumblings but people did settle for the words when the Knights came in to clear the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>I personally think most of them wanted to get their rewards.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were leaving, I looked at the place where that Shooting Star guy was standing previously.</p><p><br></p><p>He was still there and looking at us.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe sensed my gaze and questioned me. “Are you planning to recruit him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If possible. I want to see if we can work together. He is a ranged fighter and we might need one to reduce the pressure on you. And if we get along, we can discuss the recruitment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sounds like a good idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was still talking to some of her friends who had helped us make the products before the raid so we just informed her before approaching the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, my name is Shiroe and this is my friend Arthas.” Shiroe was the one who greeted the guy and I gave him a nod.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. I know. Well, it’s kinda hard to miss that after all that has happened today.” He smirked, offering his hand for a handshake.</p><p><br></p><p>We shook hands. To be honest, till now, he seemed to be quite friendly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Could we have a bit of your time?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I was getting hungry anyways. Let’s go and grab something to eat. We can talk over food.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That sounds like a great idea. We just need to get our third member.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The beautiful Lady, right? Sure, I’ll wait.”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena joined us after some time and half an hour later, we found ourselves in the inn, talking over apple pie.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, you have been hunting all alone, all this time?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. Other people were just too slow and I didn’t want them to drag me down. I guess they were too busy being scared of being trapped in this game to do anything about it and I wasn’t going to wait there on my ass and do nothing. By the time everyone woke up from their daze, I was already too far ahead of them. Joining any team would have dragged me down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, that sounds awfully similar to someone I know.” Veena laughed as she threw me a look.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe merely laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you were hunting solo too?” The guy looked interested and turned towards me to ask.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I wanted to get ahead to avoid being crowded in the hunting grounds.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think anyone was crazy enough to go to the middle of the forest to hunt in the first week of the game. Being crowded was the last thing you had to worry about. Although I might not mind another one of those adventures.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The middle of the forest? Seriously? I only got there after three weeks. I generally camped around the forest area and hunted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So that’s why we didn’t spot you in the town earlier.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, that was due to the Hunter’s Quest. It was a pain in the ass to hunt a Mutated Panther.” He shook his head. “All the planning and preparations and the several tries took me two weeks to finally shoot that cat down. Slowed me down a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That quest is annoying. Especially since there are generally other followers beside the mutated animal.” I remembered my own hunt. “I was lucky to meet Veena back then or I would have been the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you are a hunter too? I didn’t realise that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I got it in the starting village as other jobs were not easily available.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It annoyed me to no end when I learned that I could have passed the test much more easily if I had come here instead.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait what?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“The quest requirements are different here than in the first village. It’s much easier.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what. Did I fucking waste two weeks of my time for nothing? Damn….that sucks.” He grumbled as he shoved his apple pie down his throat, eating with a huff.</p><p><br></p><p>“This game is too elaborate. Information is power….quite literally. We can save a lot of time if we have the correct information and waste weeks if we don’t. No wonder they charge so much for information in the Black Market.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Black Market? There’s a Black Market?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Star….do you mind if I call you that?” I asked, not trying to go completely on a tangent once again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, who would mind being called a star. Certainly not me.” He smirked and I rolled my eyes and couldn’t help but smile. It <em>was</em> funny.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will call you that. Would you like to work with us” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Straight to the point, eh. Good, I like that. Going round and round is not my thing either.” He took the final bite of his apple pie and drank his mead before facing me. “So, I assume that you are trying to recruit me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. If I have to trust my back to people in a fight, I would like them to be competent and not drag me down.”</p><p><br></p><p>He laughed when his words returned back to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, why me? Why not someone like the baldy or that casanova wannabe from before?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me, who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Number five and six. Sorry, don’t remember their names.” He waved his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“They already have their own teams and I doubt they will join us. Not to mention, combining two teams together will be harder and can mess up our coordination.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….yeah, that makes sense. They did look like they were trying to show off a bit too much. Probably trying to recruit. Let’s see….well what the hell, I’m in. You people seem decent. As for the trial period, I understand. In fact, if you guys are not good, I wouldn’t want to drag my feet for you either and if I am the weaker one, well, I deserve to be trashed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, we are in agreement then.” We shook our hands. We discussed when and where to meet early in the morning tomorrow for the hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a while about other tropics and found out that he mostly stayed in camps and only came to the town to restock. Moreover, he wasn’t using the baits and other products that Herbalists made.</p><p><br></p><p>If he did, I doubted he would have been so far behind me. If anything, there was a good chance that he might have been in the lead.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, my levelling speed had only increased after teaming up with Veena and Shiroe and we could take more difficult quests which he couldn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>He was mainly just grinding on mobs to level up while we were coupling them with quests.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess he didn’t know much about the MMOs and the only reason he played this was because he wanted to check the game out because he had heard a lot of good things about the game.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was quite frank and outspoken and I found this attitude to be quite refreshing as Shiroe was much more conserved.</p><p><br></p><p>We departed our own ways and Shiroe followed us to our home to discuss about the rewards. On the way, I had spotted several people staring at us and some even trying to follow us and see where we lived.</p><p><br></p><p>I ignored them as we were probably going to move to the mansion either way and they would find out about it soon enough too.</p><p><br></p><p>There was just no escaping all this attention.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting inside, I locked the door behind us and gathered around the table.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still evening and we had gotten our dinner packed so there would be no cooking today.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wasn’t that tiring?” Shiroe said as she finally slumped in his chair.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was certainly a new and quite novel experience.” Veena giggled.</p><p><br></p><p>“It….wasn’t bad per say but I could do with less of a crowd.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what did we all get?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>We brought everything out of the inventory and placed them on the table, gathering all our rewards from the quest.</p><p><br></p><p>There were seven Skill Books, several equipment and accessories, two pieces of papers which turned out to be the recipe for two new medicines for Veena and finally the Guild Order. </p><p><br></p><p>I even added the Exp Card inside the pile which was only possible since the rewards were not announced.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this….really the Guild Order?” Shiroe asked in surprise as he held up the item and checked it carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would think so….with the item description and all. Personally I think they wanted the one in lead to make Guilds so they offered this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Or it could be because of us breaking the exam.” He replied. “Perhaps you didn’t realise that even the fourth place, the one who was almost Tier 4 was only able to get slightly over one thousand points. Maybe we got rewards based on the points we scored.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that’s a valid theory. Still, it’s better to assume that we will be encountering more guilds soon.” Veena concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the items next.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Blessed Armour of the Sun(Blessed Sun Set)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Physical Defence: +220</strong></p><p><strong>Magical Defence: +220</strong></p><p><strong>HP: +5,500</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>3 Piece Set Effect: +3% HP and MP Regen under the Sun</strong></p><p><strong>5 Piece Set Effect: +8% Magic Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>7 Piece Set Effect: Blessing of the Sun Buff is applied to all party members. Increases the attack and defence by 10%(20% against creatures of the Dark)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Requires Level 100 to equip.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Wow.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the other pieces.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Blessed Sword of the Sun(Blessed Sun Set)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Physical Attack: +500</strong></p><p><strong>Magical Attack: +500</strong></p><p><strong>MP: +1500</strong></p><p><strong>Requires Level 100 to equip.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Blessed Shield of the Sun(Blessed Sun Set)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Physical Defence: +150</strong></p><p><strong>Magical Defence: +150</strong></p><p><strong>HP: +2000</strong></p><p><strong>Requires Level 100 to equip.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Blessed Bottom Piece of the Sun(Blessed Sun Set)</strong></p><p><strong>Physical Defence: +200</strong></p><p><strong>Magical Defence: +20</strong></p><p><strong>HP: +3,500</strong></p><p><strong>Requires Level 100 to equip.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>All of them were Blessed Sun Set.</p><p><br></p><p>But there were supposedly seven pieces in the set.</p><p><br></p><p>The robes and staff were independent weapons so maybe this was just one set.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe was the next person to check it and came to the same conclusion as me.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think are the last three pieces of the set?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably the gauntlet, the boots and the helmet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, I thought that too. We were given the rewards by the Holy Knight, it would make sense if we got equipment for knights. This set is for Heavy Armour users so you will be the only one qualified. We just need to get the last three pieces. One is with Dwain’s team and two with Gareth. I will try to talk to them and see if we can trade them for something. Even one piece will help us get the five piece effect and help us out a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to talk to them tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, we moved to the two accessories.</p><p><br></p><p>The necklace and the ring.</p><p><br></p><p>The necklace gave a boost to MP Regen so it went to Shiroe. The ring on the other hand, prevented the user from being spied on by Observe type skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I was given the ring as I was the highest level in the group.</p><p><br></p><p>Till now, people only thought I was a Knight and a level 2 Knight at that because I had made it a point to hide my Goblin Slayer Class in front of others so apart from my team, no one knew that I was not a T4 Player but almost a T5.</p><p><br></p><p>It was our trump card.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena’s Skill Book was <em>Double Refining</em>. It gave her a 5% chance to produce twice the products than she could normally using the same raw materials.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite broken in itself. Imagine using it on some higher ranked products and getting double products. That would be a huge profit.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe’s Skill Books were all for the Mage Class.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Create Mist</em>, a Skill which creates a fog for the enemies but the user and his team members can see through the fog. It could be very useful in battles.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Earth Wall</em> was as the name suggested. It created a wall for defence.</p><p><br></p><p>It would help us avoid the situations where we had to make the makeshift walls from the corpses of monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>The last Skill was <em>Thorn Bind Hostage</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>It bound a target with vines made of energy. Each time one of the vine was cut, it damaged the enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>If the vines were not cut within 30 seconds, the skill will be dispelled and cause no damage to the enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>While bound, the attack speed of the enemy is reduced by 70%.</p><p><br></p><p>The number of vines and the damage from each vine being cut increased with the level of the skill.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to say that it was a beast of a skill and Shiroe was <em>really</em> good at using these.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the recipes, they were for two pills, the Greater Healing Pill and the Miasma Repelling Pill.</p><p><br></p><p>The Greater Healing Pill was the best pill available in the town and even then there were rarely any stocks in the shops. None of the players knew how to make it….or atleast none knew till now.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Miasma Repelling Pill….they did just that, repelled Miasma.</p><p><br></p><p>In the world, there were some areas where the magic of the world was corrupted and turned into miasma.</p><p><br></p><p>These places were generally dens of monsters and people rarely went to these areas.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the main reasons for this was the Miasma itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Even breathing in the area could cause people to get status effects and lose HP over time. Most of them hallucinated in the fog.</p><p><br></p><p>This made it nigh impossible to hunt in these areas unless they had specific equipment or items to use here.</p><p><br></p><p>One of these items was the Miasma Repelling Pill. It gave the user immunity from Miasma’s effects for two hours.</p><p><br></p><p>It might not look like much but it was a massive help and probably the only way to take any quests in the miasma affected areas of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had learned of this while reading some of the books she got from the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>There were miasma affected areas in the mountains too so maybe we could go there sometimes and check the place out.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally came the Exp Card.</p><p><br></p><p>“One hundred thousand experience points! That’s a week’s work.” Shiroe exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“With this, you can probably become a Tier 5 right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I currently need around ninety thousand five hundred points.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Use it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Use it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shouldn’t Veena or you use it to close in the difference between our levels?” I wasn’t so keen on using it because I already had an exp buff with the Traveller Title.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. You are the main fighter of the group. It would be good if you had higher levels. If you fall, all of us will crash.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s not wrong, Arthas. You should use it. Not to mention, with that you will be Tier 5 and can use the Guild Order right away. Then we can attract people to our guild at tomorrow’s meeting.” Veena added too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you guys sure?” I asked once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup, absolutely sure. Now, get on with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. If you say so.”</p><p><br></p><p>I changed my class to Goblin Slayer and picked up the card before crushing it in my hand.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Level 40 Goblin Slayer.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The loss of nine thousand five hundred exp points pained me but I pushed the thoughts away and looked at the T5 Classes available to me.</p><p><br></p><p>The only one on top of the list was….Man Slayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess the ring came at the right time to help me avoid suspicion.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything set, I selected the Class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Man Slayer Level 1.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations on being the first one from your Continent to advance to a 5th Tier Class.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Title Gained</strong></p><p><strong>One Among One Hundred Thousand</strong></p><p><strong>+40% increased Exp Gain.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep doing your best, Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the experience gain bonus with satisfaction. Add this with the boost from the Traveller Title and I had well over 50% exp gain.</p><p><br></p><p>“You got a new Class?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” I nodded while checking the skills.</p><p><br></p><p>This Class was similar to the Goblin Slayer Class in a way that it gave Skills and Buffs when I fought against Humans and Demihuman Species like Beastmen and Elves.</p><p><br></p><p>It even had the Fated Enemy(Human) and Sweet Revenge(Human) Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>The Class was absolutely broken but then again, it was supposedly the reward for fixing a glitch. I doubted there would be any more of those.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few minutes, I explained the skills to Veena and Shiroe and the guy noted everything down.</p><p><br></p><p>“This can help us against bandits and other such enemies, not to mention against other races. It’s a great class to have.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And other players.” Veena added, making us turn towards her. She smiled at us. “If I am trapped in a jungle with an animal and another person, I would be more wary of the latter. Animals can be predictable. People, not so much.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe let out an uncomfortable chuckle at the reminder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, too much depressing stuff. Let’s see what that Guild Order does.” Shiroe said excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at the guy and laughed. He really became like a kid when things came to game matters.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up the Guild Order and the option to use it came to my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Use.</p><p><br></p><p>Pick a name for the Guild.</p><p><br></p><p>Fairy Tail.</p><p><br></p><p>I put in the Guild name and confirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of Soul Art Online.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas and the team got the rewards from the raid and blew everyone’s mind.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>They have also scouted another member for the team who is another canon character.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Our team is finally in the open and even starting a guild.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What troubles will come for them next?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In the next chapter, we will see some other characters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will just give some glimpses of other characters and how they are doing, maybe make it an interlude chapter of sorts.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

is trying to copy the Unique Skill: Apostle.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Process Successful.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the list of Skills Leviathan had collected and had to actively control myself from staring.</p><p><br></p><p>This skill is really broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I had another massive list which I got when I copied Rimuru’s Beelzebuth and got the Food Chain ability to get Skills of my subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it wasn’t even half of today’s haul.</p><p><br></p><p>Three of the Fourteen Original Ultimate Skills and two of the Sin Series Unique Skills, not to mention Ramiris’ Small World Skill which she used to create her Dungeons.</p><p><br></p><p>The only problem was me staying there actively controlling the Dungeon which was something I couldn’t do. Maybe Vritra could stay there and provide it with magicules? But we already had a Labyrinth in this country.</p><p><br></p><p>I will ask and see if Rimuru wants a Labyrinth in Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, today’s Skill copying had helped me in another thing and that was reducing the time needed for reconstructing the memories of Veldanava.</p><p><br></p><p>Originally, a good part of the memories involved the knowledge about creating the fourteen Angelic Skills which Veldanava owned, so the more of these Skills I copied, the less Sol had to reconstruct.</p><p><br></p><p>This was also true for Small World which I had just copied from Ramiris as it was a Skill which she had Inherited from Veldanava himself and the Magicule Breeder Reactor which I had copied from Milim which was Veldanava’s original Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, I have only five of the fourteen Angelic Skills. I have to think of a way to copy the rest if I don’t want to be stuck with twelve years of time to reconstruct all his memories.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to recall who else had the Skills off the top of my head, I could remember Leon, Rudra, Velzard, Velgrynd, Granbell, Tatsuya Kondo and the angels probably and all of them were dangerous names to go after.</p><p><br></p><p>I doubted any of them would sit with me and play a game or something….actually, maybe Granbell would….perhaps Leon if I were to add Chloe to the mix….</p><p><br></p><p>‘Vritra, do you think Velzard would agree to a game with us?’ I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>‘That….I don’t know. I don’t know much about her.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Fair point.’</p><p><br></p><p>I watched as the rest played monopoly.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole atmosphere was peaceful.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I heard Rimuru’s voice in my head. ‘Sal, I met Kagali and she has confirmed the information about Yuuki. We have enough proof to send him to hell and his reputation through mud.’</p><p><br></p><p>She went on to tell me about the things she had discovered like his connection with the Underworld, his hand in the illegal slave trade and the summoning of otherworlders, his connection with Clayman and his hand in actually pushing the attack of the Falmuth Kingdom and the misinformation of the Holy Ruberious Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuuki Kagurazaka was a complicated character. In fact, he was the only character in this world I wasn’t exactly sure what to think about.</p><p><br></p><p>All other characters had more or less similar characters in both the web and light novel as well as the anime.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuuki was the only exception.</p><p><br></p><p>In the web novel version, he was the main antagonist of the series, a cruel and sadistic bastard who viewed everyone as a pawn.</p><p><br></p><p>In the light novel however, he was someone with actually good motives, someone who actually wanted peace in the world and it was just his actions which led to chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>The first one had to go but if in the off chance it was the second one, I….wasn’t sure if I wanted to kill him.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for this reason that I was keeping an eye on him since the first time I met him.</p><p><br></p><p>With every bad action of his, my counter went towards the first option and now with Rimuru’s information about Kagali’s confession, I was more or less sure that this guy was the evil manipulator version.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what I was going to do next….won’t be something I would regret.</p><p><br></p><p>After the game was over, I asked Aletia to take them all to their rooms as we proceeded to go to the dungeons.</p><p><br></p><p>On the gates of the ninety ninth floor, Cleria, Irisviel and Hinata were guarding the gates while Hinata nodded towards Luminous.</p><p><br></p><p>The former two bowed towards us and opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, behind the bars was a single black haired figure.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuuki Kagurazaka.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me, that same disarming and condescending smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, that’s some interesting company you have with you, Salvatore-kun. And here I thought accompanying Demon Lords was supposedly a crime, right Hinata-san? I wonder if that doesn’t apply for working under them? Then again, from what I have heard, Rimuru-san is also a Demon Lord and you two are quite close. So then, how is it that only I am being persecuted?” He asked, with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will hold your tongue, you vile wretch.” Luminous almost growled from beside me. “Your crimes are things you know better than anyone else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and what crime are we talking about here? I am a bit short on memory. Please enlighten me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I just summoned the bugs he had planted in me and threw it to him. “This….never exactly took hold.”</p><p><br></p><p>To my satisfaction, I saw his eyes widen a bit and he took a quick glance at Hinata.</p><p><br></p><p>“Apart from this, Kagali has already confessed all your deeds. By the end of the week, the entire continent will know about everything you have done. Currently my people are searching and dismantling Cerberus. Oh, and Damrada, the Prime Minister of the Eastern Empire….yeah, he’s not saving you here. Neither is Mariabell Rosso. Did I miss someone?” I asked, staring him back into his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>His mouth opened slightly and then his shoulders sagged slightly. “So, what will it be now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you already know that.” I answered.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have anything to say?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish I had killed you the first time I met you….both you and that Rimuru Tempest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Very well then Goodbye Yuuki Kagurazaka.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Luminous. “All yours.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, I left the jail cell and created a barrier around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>And boy did Luminous not play around.</p><p><br></p><p>She directly used Disintegration….a dozen times.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently the fact that the guy had not only bugged Hinata but also endangered Chloe’s life pissed her off more than I had thought.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning to use Beelzebuth on him but….well, that’s not possible now.</p><p><br></p><p>We came out of the room after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what are we going to do about him now?” Hinata asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….I want to keep his demise a secret for now.” I said after a bit of thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous looked at me with a raised eyebrow so I explained the situation with Mariabel.</p><p><br></p><p>“She tried to control you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “They are planning to attack us and try to free Yuuki or kill him in the process. If they succeed, they will blame me for the lack of security and try to defame me. If they lose, they will deny any involvement and try to push me to the position of the head of the Free Guild and then control me to be their puppet instead of Yuuki. Seriously, that woman is too overconfident.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Children can be overconfident.” Luminous said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Child?” I asked. “She’s no child. She is a reincarnation, the reincarnation of her own Grandmother, the wife of Granbell Rosso, an old hag in the body of a kid if anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her? Seriously?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Anyways, I plan to let them attack and catch them red handed as well as make an example of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we spread the news and information discovered by Rimuru and spread the narrative that Yuuki Kagurazaka died a while ago. It was someone else using his body to carry out all those deeds.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ena doesn’t understand why we need to do all that. We could always just come out clean and tell everyone what he was doing.” The girl said, annoyed at the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at her and Luminous was the one who explained. “Doing this would serve many purposes. First, it will preserve the dignity of the persona Yuuki Kagurazaka had created in front of others as well as the dignity of the Free Guild which he had created. He might have been a scum but the Free Guild is an essential organisation on which many countries depend. Not to mention, they are the main people who fight Guy Crimson’s Daemons on the frontline at all times. If it falls apart, it would create too much chaos in the continent and give our enemies a chance to bank on the chaos and invade. We cannot have that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Second, if Yuuki is implicated directly, some people might even doubt me and Hinata due to our association with him. It’s a long shot but I don’t want to give people any excuse.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, Hinata said. “Thirdly, I doubt people would just take our word for it. Especially if we try to take over the Free Guild after that. Most of them will just assume that Holy Empire Ruberious and Camelot assassinated Yuuki to take over the Free Guild. It would be a taint on our images as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….so complicated. This is why Ena doesn’t like politics.” The girl shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>I chuckled. “Neither do I, Ena. Neither do I.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few things and decided to keep up the act.</p><p><br></p><p>Hinata will be guarding the place where Rin is disguised as Yuuki and is currently being guarded by Masaomi and Shiro to keep up the pretence.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with everyone satisfied, we went back to our rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous will stay here for a few more days before leaving with Hinata.</p><p><br></p><p>Ena on the other hand will stay here with us and cooperate with the team we are making to invent a way back to our home worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, we had some diplomatic talks.</p><p><br></p><p>Holy Empire Ruberious has an alliance with Camelot and will be recognising Monster Nation Tempest as an official organisation too, joining the alliance between Camelot. Tempest, Dwargo, Sorcerer Nation of Sarion, Kingdom of Bulmund. It will be a trade as well as defence alliance to defend against any attacks from the Eastern Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>We are planning to increase the size of this alliance by contacting other countries.</p><p><br></p><p>It was decided that Aletia will be the ambassador from Camelot to the Holy Empire of Ruberious as per Luminous’ request.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, she had requested Chloe but that was not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>The lady had just glared at me as if it was my fault that Chloe was just ten years old.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what are you planning to do after this?” Hinata asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just want this whole drama with Yuuki to be over so that I can concentrate on rebuilding my kingdom.” I sighed. “The people are….scared. Many are struggling. The army is mainly dependent on the Free Guild members. A quarter of the population are members of the Free Guild. I don’t like my people being so reliant on a third party. Especially when I know that the Eastern Empire is eying us covetously all the time.”</p><p><br></p><p>The only good thing is that the nation is very rich but even that is not secure as it mainly relied on the tolls from the trade routes which are unavailable now.</p><p><br></p><p>I have some capital but I need to come up with some other methods of increasing my income. </p><p><br></p><p>So much work.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep working. I know you will do well.” She reassured in a surprising show of compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Thank you, Hinata.”</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous narrowed her eyes at our interaction and coughed. “We will retire for today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Inform me if you need anything.” I nodded and Aletia led them back.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I reached my room and lay on my bed and Vritra manifested on top of me, straddling my waist.</p><p><br></p><p>She was in black lace lingerie unlike her usual black dress.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow and she just smirked and grinded herself on me, getting me hard in an instant..</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I have waited enough for my turn.” She said as she traced my hard length with her slit.</p><p><br></p><p>She was hot.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know if it was just her or if dragons were hotter than normal but her core was smouldering hot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aye, so I am going to be eaten by a dragon!” I exclaimed mockingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you are going to enjoy every moment of it.” She smirked before leaning in for a kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>I was quite comfortable with this after the last few days of constant physical closeness and accepted her kiss easily.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands were on her thighs and slipped slowly towards her ass. She really did have a nice ass.</p><p><br></p><p>I blame Rimuru for corrupting me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enjoying yourself?” She pulled herself and whispered in my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s make it a bit more pleasurable.” She winked and snapped her finger as a spark of black flames fell on me and burned my clothes without affecting any of the furniture.</p><p><br></p><p>She had extremely good control of the power and I had far too much resistance to be injured by such attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if we are talking about making things more exciting, then….” I held her panties between my fingers and pulled at them, easily tearing them in two right at her slit. Her glistening lips came directly in contact with my length, sending a pleasurable jolt through my body.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oho, that’s quite bold of you.” She said with a smirk. “I didn’t think you had it in you. Then again, it is understandable. You are part dragon after all.” She added as she caressed my hair.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this opportunity to rip off the hook of her bra, freeing her perky breasts for my eyes. Her pink nubs were already erect with excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>Without waiting for another second I latched on her breast while my hand played with the other one.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh~” She moaned as she gripped my hair and pushed me harder into her breast.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her excitement, I took a playful bite of her nipple making her moan even harder as her hips moved faster, making my shaft wet with her own wetness.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute or two later, she was ready so she placed her hands on my shoulder and slightly lifted her waist and looked at me. I positioned myself at her entrance and met her eyes and she descended, slowly enveloping my entire length inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmahhhh yesss.” She moaned seductively as she bottomed and sat down on my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>I combed her hair with my fingers before gripping them hard and pulled her in for a kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>She responded enthusiastically as she began rocking her hips and riding me.</p><p><br></p><p>We started slow but Vritra was even more aggressive than Rimuru and soon enough I had to use Uriel to prevent the whole place from crashing down.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slipped down to her delectable ass, taking a hold of it as I started thrusting from below in earnest.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds of flesh slapping and moaning echoed throughout the room as she danced on my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>It suddenly struck me….these movements….they seemed familiar somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>“You noticed?” She smirked. “I saw them in your memories. The collection is in the hidden folder on your laptop.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Good job!” I gave her a thumbs up making her giggle as she jumped in for another kiss, to explore each other's mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked her up and stood, while still thrusting from below.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t stop kissing me either as I carried her towards our bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching there, I stopped and she looked at me with narrowed eyes, miffed at me stopping.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s try something else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Get down, put your hands on the bed and bend over.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened as she understood what I was asking and then a lewd smile bloomed on her face as she followed her orders, showing off her ass.</p><p><br></p><p>And by Veldanava, she had a perfect ass.</p><p><br></p><p>‘I told you.’ Rimuru’s voice sounded in my head and I rolled my eyes. Of course she was watching.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t get distracted as I positioned myself at her entrance and took a hold of her waist and thrusted my entire length into her at once.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm ahhhh.” She gripped the bed sheets tightly and raised her ass more.</p><p><br></p><p>I relished the feelings of her soft folds caressing my length as my grip on her waist increased. I began pounding her.</p><p><br></p><p>She took a minute to adjust to my new speed and reciprocated by pushing her ass towards me, matching all my thrusts.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the grip of her hair and pulled her back, capturing her lips while my hips kept up the thrust.</p><p><br></p><p>This much was nothing for a True Dragon like her. In fact, True Dragons couldn’t die. Even Conceptual Deaths didn’t stick. They were just that absurdly resilient.</p><p><br></p><p>So a bit of rough sex only served to increase the excitement between us and not exactly hurt us.</p><p><br></p><p>At one point, her fingers punctured the bed and she tore off the wood with her bare hands.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to remember to enchant all the furniture later.</p><p><br></p><p>She lost her grip on the bed and crashed face first onto it but I didn’t stop my pounding.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only around fifteen minutes or so later when I felt my climax approaching that I increased my speed and finished inside her with a few more thrusts.</p><p><br></p><p>She groaned and tightened around me as her body quivered in pleasure, reaching climax at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>I lay on her back, slowly removed her hair and kissed her neck.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly she turned at an extremely fast speed and gripped me in a hug, capturing my lips as her legs locked around my waist.</p><p><br></p><p>Her hands went down and grabbed my length. I hadn’t gone soft with just one release and she positioned me at her entrance once more and pulled me in with her legs as a sly smile appeared on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“I hope you are not stopping after just one round, dearest?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I am not even close.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s what I would expect from my darlinggggg.” She ended her sentence in a moan as I thrust inside her once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Seven more rounds later, the two of us lay on the broken and battered bed. The cushions were all ripped off and feathers flew across the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Vritra lay on my chest, breathing peacefully as she closed her eyes, relishing in the afterglow of intercourse.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a virgin just a week ago and now I have two lovers. First a Demon Lord and now a True Dragon….life is strange at times.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next day to find Rimuru curled up beside me and Vritra on my other side. She had jumped in some time in the night and decided to sleep with us.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t anything new. She normally teleported to my room at night to sleep with us. On the other hand, Veldora stayed back at Tempest to protect it in case of any danger.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning, we got ready for our respective jobs and teleported to our destinations.</p><p><br></p><p>Our busy days had just begun.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had shared the Small World Skill which I had copied from Ramiris and decided to make her own version of the Dungeon in Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the day was spent in looking over the matters of the Kingdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of the top officials and ministers of the kingdom were corrupt bastards.</p><p><br></p><p>The Falmuth Kingdom was wealthy although most of it came from providing a safe route to Dwargo, the Dwarven Nation and collecting tolls.</p><p><br></p><p>They had become too reliant on this money and could even use heavy handed methods to prevent trade of important items to smaller kingdoms like Blumund. For example, they had prevented the trade of High Quality Potions through their Kingdom and forced everyone to buy second hand potions sold by them at a much higher price.</p><p><br></p><p>This had forced smaller kingdoms to either use the more dangerous route through the Jura Forest or produce locally made potions which were of much lower quality.</p><p><br></p><p>Again, this was not the only area where they messed up.</p><p><br></p><p>Their biggest fuck up was regarding the security of the kingdom.</p><p><br></p><p>“Minister of Finance, tell me your reasons for decreasing the funds for the Frontier Protection forces in the Migam Frontier territories?” I looked at the files containing the reports and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“S-s-sir, due to the disappearance of Storm Dragon Veldora the threat of the monsters from Jura Forest had been reduced….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Reduced sure but it wasn’t eliminated. Then why did you completely stop funding the territory?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing no reply from the man, I had the urge to massage my head.</p><p><br></p><p>But this was not the full problem either.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Earl Migam, the one who ruled over the territory bordering Jura Forest. It was normally his duty to protect the kingdom from the monsters coming from the Forest and even when his funds were cut, he was still getting a <em>major</em> part of the Kingdom’s funds to do this.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, he had become too complacent due to the time of peace. He had even embezzled a lot of the funds of the country for his own spendings and pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, no monsters above C Rank came out of the Forest and they were easily managed due to the main branch of Free Guild of the country being in the province.</p><p><br></p><p>The adventurers hunted the monsters and sold their harvest for money, keeping the territory safe but….that was not a solution.</p><p><br></p><p>Adventurers weren’t duty bound to protect the Kingdom. They were just there to earn money.</p><p><br></p><p>In case of real trouble, they would be the first ones to leave the place and run.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure there was the agreement between the Free Guild and the Kingdom which allowed the Kingdom to use 10% of the total Adventurers in the branch of the country to defend against <a href=\"https://attacks….but….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attacks….but….it</a> had the same problem.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want my Kingdom to be reliant on any third party for all its protection but my own armies were almost non-existent after the massacre in Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>My recruitment spree has started refilling our numbers but training them and getting them ready for combat is going to take some time.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, the Earl wasn’t completely incompetent. When he realised the danger from the monsters was increasing, he hired the people from the Free Guild by putting up many quests for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, he was the same guy who supported Youm and even made a new force, the Frontier Protection Forces from the convicts in his territory by offering them a chance at freedom. He didn’t let them go without any security though. The man put them under the Contract Spell and gave the key to one of his trusted Magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad that Youm was charismatic enough to get the loyalty of the magician and became the head of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>At least, the guy stood against the decision of attacking Tempest and helped my ascension as the new King.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a good thing that Rimuru had full control of the Jura Forest now and the attacks from monsters had become quite less. Not to mention they often helped adventurers in clearing the monsters on the outskirts of the Kingdom so our need for soldiers in those parts had decreased a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next eight hours, I discussed several things regarding the policies of the Kingdom and taxation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Kingdom was transitioning towards Agriculture as its main source of income. This was done mainly with the help of the Dryads who had come to the Kingdom to accompany Ramiris.</p><p><br></p><p>They were highly adept in Spirit Magic and could boost the growth of plants as well. It was just that they normally didn’t appear in areas with humans because they were considered monsters by some and in many places they were enslaved. Not to mention, their own desire to live close to nature and thus in forests.</p><p><br></p><p>I had taken care of this by declaring them a protected species in Camelot. Anyone found hunting or smuggling them will be given a life sentence. To make the environment more comfortable for them, several orchards were ordered to be made in many places for them to live in.</p><p><br></p><p>Fruits, especially grapes were to be grown and later wine will be made from them while the Dryads themselves will be hailed as protectors and Land Gods of the place where they will be worshipped and treated with respect.</p><p><br></p><p>I had talked with Treyni, the leader of the Dryads about this and she had agreed to give this method a try.</p><p><br></p><p>She even sent her own sister Tyra to take over the whole project.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I listed down several modern methods of farming which I could remember for them to use.</p><p><br></p><p>While not as useful as magic, they can still be immensely useful when growing products.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Sol, can we do something about the variety of seeds?’ I wanted to get HYV of Seeds as they can significantly boost the total produce of the farmers.</p><p><br></p><p>‘It is possible to modify the existing seeds as well as create completely new products using the Creation part of my Skill.’</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, yes. Sol was made from Astarte by consuming Raphael.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Great. I will ask the people to collect every variety of seed they can.’</p><p><br></p><p>That’s one less problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Next up, I issued an order for a new team to be made of individuals possessing Appraisal Type Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru has been working on creating the Gift Skill and is now able to Gift Extra Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>My plan is to send them for various investigations to the different parts of the Kingdom to discover resources as well as check out the quality of things produced.</p><p><br></p><p>We will then allocate resources to harvest resources and improve the quality of the things.</p><p><br></p><p>The Kingdom has a small mountain range in the south western part near its border with Ingrassia.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been some mines in this area but they are hard to find so I hope to discover those here.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time the meeting was over, I was completely exhausted….mentally.</p><p><br></p><p>All I wanted to do was take some time to relax but it seems that I was not going to get that today.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Youm rushing towards me and I could see the reason for his rush walking right behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>Leon Cromwell….what is he doing here?</p><p><br></p><p>The blonde guy directly walked up to me and spoke, giving me my answer. “Where is Chloe?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….so that’s why.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how he found out?</p><p><br></p><p>“She must be in her class at this time. There is still around fifteen minutes left for her classes to be over. Would you like to come with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man didn’t say anything and I took it as a yes and walked towards the place where my students stayed.</p><p><br></p><p>On our way, he finally asked something which I was expecting. “How did you know?”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew what he meant. He was asking me how I knew about Chloe and his relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….don’t know. As Vritra had said in that meeting, I have memories of this world and many others, of past….and possible futures. I just know some things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why didn’t you….” He was speaking when I interrupted him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bring her to you?” I asked. “Well, there are several reasons. First was for Shizu-sensei but I guess Rimuru has already told you about that.” He didn’t comment but I could see some anger in his eyes. I didn’t mind him and continued. “The second was to punish you for spreading that damned ritual everywhere. Do you have any idea how many people were dragged out of their homes because of your foolishness? How many children were endangered or just died due to being summoned at a young age? Trust me, if you weren’t related to Chloe….I would have killed you. I wonder if you realise that if you had not spread the ritual….she wouldn’t have been summoned from your side when she was young. In a way….you, Leon Cromwell, yourself were responsible for losing her.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy remained stoic but this time there was some shame in his eyes so I decided to kick him when he was down.</p><p><br></p><p>“And in doing so, you had put her in danger of dying from an excess of magicules in her body.”</p><p><br></p><p>His expression paled a bit at the information and I had enough of talking him down. It’s better to let him stew in his own guilt.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we were done, we reached the classes where the kids studied.</p><p><br></p><p>There were six children in the room being taught by Cleria about language and etiquette. Cleria was apparently from one of the noble families in the Underworld and was perfect for this job.</p><p><br></p><p>Five of my original students and the last one was Edgar….Falmuth.</p><p><br></p><p>Edgar was the son of the previous king, the fool who attacked Tempest and faced the consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was completely different from his fool of a father and uncle.</p><p><br></p><p>He was just eleven years old and was extremely responsible and genuinely cared for the citizens of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll be honest, I was planning to groom him as a successor for when I found a way back home but the guy had no interest in the throne. He himself felt responsible for the foolishness of his father and the damage it had caused to the country and now he wanted nothing else than to learn under me to become someone who can be a pillar of support for the country.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I had not removed his title as the prince and let him join the same class as my students. They were all of the same age and got along surprisingly well.</p><p><br></p><p>Edgar was actually quite a straight laced kid who was well trained in noble etiquette. This often got him to be teased by the other guys in the group.</p><p><br></p><p>I had him make a contract with spirits and to everyone’s surprise, he was able to get the approval of an Elemental Lord of Light which meant he was eligible for the Hero’s egg like Kenya.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to this, I put him under Shiro for training to get him on the same level as my other students.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we reached there, the class was already over and to none of my surprise, there were two more people waiting right outside the class.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous stared at Leon and then me with a questioning gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>It always surprised me how much she could speak with that glare of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, Leon just stared at her without any care.</p><p><br></p><p>But before they could say anything else, the students came out and both the demon lords focused their attention to the ones coming out.</p><p><br></p><p>Leon walked straight from my side and directly towards Chloe without waiting for anyone but to his surprise, another figure got in front of him, greeting Chloe happily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Chloe”</p><p><br></p><p>“Chloe.”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile came to my lips as I stayed back to watch the drama while preparing to intervene if they got violent.</p><p><br></p><p>I just wish I had some popcorn at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Right.’ Vritra said from my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Leon looked at her with dead eyes but then looked at Chloe and kneeled to face her.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe stared at him, a look of confusion on her face but before she could say anything, he pulled her in a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous was like a frozen sculpture.</p><p><br></p><p>If looks could kill, Leon would have died. Actually, if she was sure that her attack could have killed him without harming Chloe in his arms, Leon would have died regardless.</p><p><br></p><p>When he separated, Luminous almost growled out. “What do you think you are doing, Leon Cromwell?”</p><p><br></p><p>Leon just looked at her with his usual stoic face. “Nothing you should concern yourself with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“None of my….” Her eyes narrowed as her power sparked around her. “How dare you!”</p><p><br></p><p>Leon narrowed his eyes and stood up, facing her as his power rose. “Do you have any problems with that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously I have….how dare you hug my Chl….” Her words were cut off by the one she was least expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe herself came to the front, looking at Leon with a look of realisation. “Leo….is that really you?”</p><p><br></p><p>Leon’s power was dispersed almost instantly and he looked back at her, with caring eyes and nodded. “I’m sor….”</p><p><br></p><p>His words were cut off as Chloe jumped into him and hugged him too.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous just looked at the scene with a wide open mouth while I smiled at their reunion. She must have seen my smile as she glared at me questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously girl, what’s with all the glaring?</p><p><br></p><p>Why do you automatically assume that everything is my fault?</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I had had enough of seeing the girl frustrated and since Chloe already recognised him, I wasn’t going to push him any further so I decided to give the Demon Lord an explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is Leon Cromwell, Chloe’s childhood friend. He and Chloe came to this world at the same time and soon after Chloe was summoned….to a different timeline. Since then poor Leon has been trying everything he can to find her. Isn’t it nice to see them reunited after such a long time.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was taken aback at the story. Even Hinata was astonished and looked at me as if I had grown a second head. Luminous was the one who collected herself the fastest and then she narrowed her eyes again.</p><p><br></p><p>‘You knew it!’</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, a Thought Communication skill.</p><p><br></p><p>I just smiled at her. ‘Yes. And I assume you didn’t.’ I smirked at her becoming even more enraged.</p><p><br></p><p>We mutually decided to keep our banter for later and I looked at Leon.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess you guys need some time to catch up. Coincidentally it’s time for lunch and the kids are all hungry. Let’s talk about all this over some food.”</p><p><br></p><p>They agreed and we moved to one of the guest rooms for lunch.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Over dinner, we got to listen to some of their background.</p><p><br></p><p>Leon was the son of a lord in his world while Chloe’s father was a retainer of his father. They had been close since childhood as there were not many children near him and he has always treated her like his own little sister and has always been extremely overprotective of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I never thought that the Platinum Saber would have such a side to him.” Dino whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right. He’s a tsundere personified.” Said Rimuru who had arrived after finding out about Leon’s arrival.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I always knew Leon-chan was a good boy.” Ramiris said proudly as she flew all around him but the guy was too concentrated on Chloe to bother about him.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I knew he was very annoyed by her over-excitable personality.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go, Chloe.” Leon finally said as we finished eating our lunch.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go to El Dorado. It’s my kingdom, my home. You will stay with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe looked like she was already expecting this and she looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her. “I will support whatever decision you make, Chloe.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at everyone and then turned back at Leon.</p><p><br></p><p>I could feel the tension in the air as everyone watched the two of them, especially Luminous.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the kids were also watching the two from the side, unsure about what they should say.</p><p><br></p><p>“No.” She finally said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” Leon looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to stay here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What? But why?” He asked, aggressively.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to stay with Teacher.” She looked at me, making the two pissed off demon lords turn towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>I just smiled at the girl. “Sure. You can stay here as long as you want.” I patted her head, making their glares even sharper.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. He did something, didn’t he? He must have used his words to trick you….” He gritted through his teeth as his power started surging.</p><p><br></p><p>My subordinates got tensed at the hostility and even Hinata was about to pull out her sword.</p><p><br></p><p>To my surprise, even Dino’s posture was slightly defensive as if preparing to defend.</p><p><br></p><p>“I knew it.” Luminous whispered. The fuck lady. What did you know?</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, who are you calling a fraud!” I exclaimed. “I don’t have a habit of tricking my students.”</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe just glared back at him. “No one tricked me. I just want to stay here with everyone. That’s it.” She said with a pout.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. If Chloe-chan wants to stay here, she will stay here. You cannot take her away.” Kenya got up, facing Leon.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, she is a part of our class, our friend. We will not let you take her away.” Alice got up too.</p><p><br></p><p>Following her the rest of the students were glaring back at the True Hero turned Demon Lord in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked at them and finally at Chloe and for the first time, the look of frustration was visible on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to help the guy out. If I remember correctly, he summoned Shizue-sensei when she was about to die and in doing so actually saved her life.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Sigh</em>….for just that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Leon….please let her stay here. She has friends in this place and can learn with them. I promise I will protect her with my life if I have to. You can always come here and meet her here and we could visit you sometimes. Actually, how about this, I propose an alliance between Camelot and El Dorado and we can have frequent visits even when business is involved. We already have an alliance with several nations including the Sorcerer Nation of Sarion.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me, still pissed and this time Chloe came in front of me and glared at the man. “Leo….don’t be mean to Teacher.” She scolded, making the man turn the other way.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally after a few more words, we decided to go to another room to decide further.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the day, Leon decided to join an alliance with us too.</p><p><br></p><p>I think Sylvia was about to invite him but he directly joined us removing the need of a middle man.</p><p><br></p><p>El Dorado was on an island in the southwest of the continent and there was a massive volcano on the island which was caused due to a fight between Velgrynd and Veldora. It erupts often and fills the land with its ashes, making the soil unfit for cultivation.</p><p><br></p><p>On the plus side, the land was rich in minerals and most of its people were miners.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the country was so rich that the entire city had buildings whose walls were covered in gold.</p><p><br></p><p>Sarion was the only country it traded with, providing them with different metals and minerals for food and other products.</p><p><br></p><p>I could imagine several good uses for it in my kingdom as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the meeting which could have turned into a three-way battle between the two Demon Lords and a True Hero turned into a meeting to establish a peaceful alliance instead.</p><p><br></p><p>A win in my books if there ever was one.</p><p><br></p><p>Leon decided that he would stay here for another week and finalise the agreement before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>We all knew that he was only staying here because of Chloe though.</p><p><br></p><p>On another note, he decided to acknowledge the Monster Nation of Tempest as a formal country, giving Rimuru another note of approval. At this point, no one could deny that the Monster Nation of Tempest was a genuine country.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sylvia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She walked to the place assigned by King Salvatore for their meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>She recognised the halls. They looked exactly like the Dwelling of Spirits. Surely another creation of the Queen of Spirit, Lady Ramiris.</p><p><br></p><p>She had really moved here like the rumours said. Then again, it was understandable. Knowing who the person ruling the country might be.</p><p><br></p><p>Even she was taken aback when she had felt that aura after such a long time. She had only gone there because she heard the news of her sister-in-law’s survival and wanted to meet her after a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>What she was not expecting was to feel <em>his</em> presence from the King. It was one of the main reasons why she had even considered entertaining his outlandish claims about <em>having memories</em>. If it had been someone else, she would have scoffed at their claim but him….with him in the mix….anything was possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on, she investigated and found out several things about him.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dragonoid who had a True Dragon in his soul, a completely new True Dragon as well as the one who defeated the Chaos Dragon and purified it. Not to mention, Veldora being so well behaved in his presence….she doubted there were many people who could get the Storm Dragon to behave like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there was the presence of Dino and the other two Angels of the Origin who were hanging on to his words as if gospel, giving more credibility to her thought.</p><p><br></p><p>He himself didn’t seem to remember his identity but from the signs she could see, he was regaining his memories gradually.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, his presence seemed to run the world, attracting all kinds of beings of power and influence around him, effortlessly.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in case, she investigated his claims and sure enough, all his words came true.</p><p><br></p><p>He had helped her solve a huge crime against her people and even provided her hope to reunite with her beloved.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind her, Elmensia, Kagali, Sara and Erald walked with <a href=\"https://Sarion….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sarion….no</a>, he was Laplace right now, following them due to Kagali’s orders.</p><p><br></p><p>It pained her to see her beloved husband in that form.</p><p><br></p><p>A Deathman, a twisted form of his former majesty, reduced to a puppet, a clown for someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when she looked at the one behind them who was being brought by Milim Nava herself that her eyes narrowed.</p><p><br></p><p>Jahil….the one responsible for everything.</p><p><br></p><p>They had been able to identify that he was indeed inside the Deathman Footman’s body but they had been incapable of separating them. It was then that Sara suggested that they should seek the help of Lord Vel….King Salvatore.</p><p><br></p><p>She agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>If there was someone who could do such a thing, it would probably be him.</p><p><br></p><p>As they reached the gates, one of the Chosen Hero under him, Masaomi, if she remembered his name correctly, bowed and opened the door behind him, guiding them inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the place, there were several people already waiting for them.</p><p><br></p><p>At the head of the seat sat the King himself with Demon Lord Rimuru sitting on his right. Dino, Garasha and Pico sat on one side and Luminous, Leon and Gazel sat on the other side. Their subordinates stood behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome. I am glad that your operation was a success.” He greeted them.</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed respectfully towards him. “I sincerely thank you for your assistance, your majesty. I cannot imagine what we would have done without your help in this matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, no need to be so formal. You were all suffering and I could help so I did. Isn’t that what any decent person should do?” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes softened at his words. “Yes….yes, it certainly is.”</p><p><br></p><p>And yet she doubted there were any people who would do so nowadays without any second thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked at the two Deathmen behind her and then at Kagali and finally at her again. “Do they know?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the three and then back at the King and nodded. “Yes. Both Laplace and Footman have decided to voluntarily go through the process. Kagali doesn’t mind either. She just requests the safety of the two and wishes to be present at the scene. I too request you to spare Footman’s life. He had nothing to do with all those crimes.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and stood up. “Trust me, I do not enjoy taking lives. I will try my best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that he got up and went towards Milil, pulling her into a hug. “Are you alright?” He whispered but it was enough for the ears of everyone to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded, still angry but Sylvia could see that her anger had melted a lot at the question. “Please….help me get him out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked towards Footman and then at Demon Lord. “Rimuru, help me out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! What should I do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just assist me and prevent anything from escaping. I will be concentrating on separating the souls so just keep an eye on the barriers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.” Demon Lord Rimuru got up and walked beside him. They joined hands and then something happened which made her stare in dumbfounded surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Barriers rose around Footman, hundreds of barriers of different kinds.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimate Skill: Uriel, Lord of Vows.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not it. The barriers were further modified with spells</p><p><br></p><p>Magic circles rose, hundreds, thousands of magic circles or several different attributes, each with different affects.</p><p><br></p><p>Some increased the potency of spells while some prevented any form of escape and some just decreased the power of disembodied souls or trapped them outright.</p><p><br></p><p>She had seen this before.</p><p><br></p><p>This <a href=\"https://power….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">power….it</a> was something <em>he</em> used with his wife, the Princess of the Nasca Kingdom, Lucia Nasca.</p><p><br></p><p>While not many people would recognise it, there was no doubt in Sylvia’s mind that this was the work of the Ultimate Skill: Raphael, Lord of Wisdom. It just couldn’t be anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>She took a peak at the three Angels and saw the same looks of disbelief on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, all done.” Rimuru said as she walked beside Milim, hugging the girl from behind and sitting on the ground, to watch Salvatore work.</p><p><br></p><p>To <a href=\"https://Sylvia….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sylvia….it</a> looked like the picture of an ideal family.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘To be a Hero.’</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The plot might seem to have slowed down a bit but I don't want to skip over these parts.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are just getting good.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Salvatore got a bunch of OP Skills once again and is putting his kingdom in line.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Yuuki is gone.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Luminous has absolutely no chill.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Vritra got what she wanted.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Leon arrived and Luminous found out that she had more competition for Chloe than she had imagined.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Too bad for them that Chloe just wants to stay with her Teacher.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally, some people are connecting dots….even when there are no dots.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br></p>",

One was through the front gates of Heaven. It was also the only one known to most people.</p><p><br></p><p>The second one was something only a handful of people knew about. It was through the Underworld and opened up in the third heaven. This Gate was made for God to travel to the Underworld, unseen and check up on his wife’s body.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on, this was the very same route used by Lucifer to take away Lilith and that’s how she found out about this gate.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t have the time to go through the back door so we were currently heading towards the Gates.</p><p><br></p><p>These gates were always guarded by hordes of Exorcists and Angels with the sole duty to prevent any attacks. Not to mention the gates themselves were strong enough to halt attacks from even Satan Class beings for a long period of time.</p><p><br></p><p>Attacking through the front gates would be the stupidest thing ever that meant Rizevim had attacked from the back door.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you should control yourself Damien. With your aura, we would probably get attacked before we can even start entering the other dimension.” Azazel said.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back towards him, who was following me. “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me weirdly but didn’t question as we were in a hurry at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>As we reached near the gates and into the Heaven controlled area, I ordered everyone to stop.</p><p><br></p><p>They did although they still seemed to be in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sean.” I asked and he knew exactly what I was asking for.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Damien, not understanding what he wanted….that was until Sean summoned the True Longinus and threw it at him.</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes. “I don’t think waving Father’s Spear at Heaven’s Gate would help. The problem is with you being the De….”</p><p><br></p><p>His words got stuck in his throat as he saw him catching the spear.</p><p><br></p><p>A wave of power passed through them.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘I am an angel of the Lord.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>Before he could register the words, a wave of holy energy erupted from Damien and a silver light covered his form.</p><p><br></p><p>When the light dispersed, Azazel’s eyes widened and his jaws hung open.</p><p><br></p><p>Gone were the dozen bat-like black wings and suffocating demonic power which was a trademark of a Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>In their place were the familiar and yet nostalgic six pairs of silver wings and three halos. The dark and gloomy demonic power was replaced by the bright silver light which gave him his title and was the trademark of the Lightbringer.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….how….” He stuttered out.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien looked at him, his gaze completely different from before.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked calm but Azazel could still feel the rage it was hiding underneath.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was about to show you the entire story but Kokabiel interrupted. I promise I will answer all your questions when we are done with this entire mess.” He promised and Azazel controlled himself, taking a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since when?” He asked finally.</p><p><br></p><p>“It happened a few years ago. In fact, I….didn’t even know such a thing could happen. I just….lost control and was attracted towards the Spear the first time I encountered it and that’s it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. “You will be answering everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I gave you my word.”</p><p><br></p><p>Without any more interruptions, they reached the Gates of Heaven which looked to be in chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>Angels were fighting against several magicians and fallen angels.</p><p><br></p><p>The Magicians seemed to be members of the Wizards of Oz and even some members of the Utsusemi Organisation.</p><p><br></p><p>They were about to help but before they could do anything, they noticed something weird.</p><p><br></p><p>A group among the magicians used a spell on a defeated two winged Angel. The Angel screamed in agony and writhed on the ground but in just a few moments, his wings turned black….he fell.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not the end either. His screams of agony didn’t end. His feathers looked like they dried away and his skin became greenish as eyes erupted from his body, all the while his aura kept increasing. He grew another pair of wings.</p><p><br></p><p>When the transformation was completed, what lay in place of the Angel was a monster-like being with four wings and dozens of eyes all over its body.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood up a second later but Azazel noticed that his eyes were vacant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Attack them.” The Magician ordered and the Fallen rushed into the barricade of angels like a wild beast. He didn’t have any care for his safety or even consciousness for that matter.</p><p><br></p><p>“What in Father’s name is that?” He asked, shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>Those magicians….just what did they do?</p><p><br></p><p>All of them paused on seeing this and Michael was the first to burst into action.</p><p><br></p><p>He rose to the skies, summoning his sword and raised it to the skies. Thousands of light spears lit the skies and everyone present turned towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>The Magicians hurriedly raised the shields and made barriers, looking pale at the sudden attack but Michael didn’t give them any chance as the light spears rained death on the intruders, taking out the makeshift outpost of the magicians almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Brothers! Do not hesitate. Do not panic. Our chaos is their weapons. I plead to you all, do not empower our enemies. Get into formation and come, let’s defend our home.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Angels looked like they had seen hope all of a sudden. The entire scene reminded Azazel of the wars they had fought before their fall.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael was always an able general, quick to gain the trust of his soldiers and with the ability to boost their morale with just a few words.</p><p><br></p><p>This Micahel had disappeared since Father’s passing as the man had become almost a shell of his former self. Today however, he looked every bit as the foremost general of Heaven’s once more.</p><p><br></p><p>The troops rallied on his commands and he looked back at them and spoke. “Uriel, Helel, you all go inside and take care of the other side. I will clear things up here and then go to the Seventh Heaven to take control of Heaven's system.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will stay here and check what they did to turn Angels into those….monsters.” Azazel said, earning a nod from them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merlin. You stay here and assist Azazel. Find out what they did and if there is any way to reverse it. You can contact the base and get help if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As you command, my king.”</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked at Michael. “Do you need someone else to help you out?”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael shook his head. “No. I can handle this by myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then….take care.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, both groups separated and he quickly went forward and checked on the transformed angel.</p><p><br></p><p>The eyes of several angels dug on him as he knelt before the body but due to Michael’s presence, no one took action.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly cast several spells to check the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin did the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“This….what exactly is this? I don’t recall seeing anything like this before.” He spoke after his checks were completed.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin’s spells were completed soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>“This looks like some kind of a curse.” He said, his eyebrows furrowing as he used several more spells. “A curse to bring out the monsters from inside them.” Suddenly he paused as if recalling something. “Azazel, do you recall the information about the Utsusemi Organisation?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Utsusemi Organisation? Yes, they have been causing ruckus in Japan. I know that they have been working together with the Wizards of Oz and Satanael and also have some connection with Ophis but apart from that I don’t know much. They have been in hiding most of the time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Well, thankfully, we do have some members in their ranks as spies and were able to glean some information. They are working on creating something similar to the Independent Avatar Type Sacred Gears. One of our members, Lavinia, was the student of Glenda, the Witch of the South. She is also the wielder of the Absolute Demise and the Wizards of Oz already have Augusta, the Witch of the East, as the wielder of the Incinerate Anthem. With research on both these Sacred Gears, they collected data and they have created these….Utsusemi using the people they had kidnapped to fight against the Five Principal Clans.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel frowned at the information. “But these do not look anything like any kind of Artificial Sacred Gears, Independent Avatar Type or else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….from what little we were able to find out, they draw out the inner monsters of humans, their inner hollows if you will. Now apply that logic on Angels….from what you know now, what do you think their inner demons are?” Merlin concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel found his mouth hung open as the thought struck him.</p><p><br></p><p>“But then….”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is what Angels could have become if your Father hadn’t made you the way he did, although unlike these, you all would still retain your minds but in terms of form, you would most likely become something like this….an eldritch looking being.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel looked at the unconscious monst….Angel in front of him and then at his own hands….his brain struggled to find any semblance between the two.</p><p><br></p><p>What even was going on?</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, he realised that he didn’t know what was going on anymore. He, someone who had prided himself on his knowledge of this world….didn’t even know what he himself was….</p><p><br></p><p>The realisation was frustrating and yet….humbling and all these feelings had left him completely exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>He was tired.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, he wanted nothing more than to meet with his father and ask….ask what he was.</p><p><br></p><p>What even was his purpose?</p><p><br></p><p>“....zazel….Azazel!” Merlin’s voice broke his thoughts and he looked at the white haired man in front of him. “Are you alright?” he asked, concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes….yes, I am fine. Is there any way to change them back?” He asked, pushing the stray thoughts out of his mind. They had to concentrate on the situation at hand first.</p><p><br></p><p>All these….had to be left for later.</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably. But this is simply beyond our abilities right now. It would take us extensive research to develop the method to do such a thing but they don’t have that much time on their hands. To be honest, right now, there is only one person I know who can reverse this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien?” He asked, already knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin nodded. “He is the only one even remotely aware of the method of creating life and the intricacies of the races in the Three Factions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>As they were in their thoughts, Michael flew down to their place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We have a slight idea of what might be wrong with them but I cannot do anything. Maybe Damien can, so we need to subdue them first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I see. Very well. That’s what we will do. They will be subdued and kept in captivity till something can be done for them.”<br><br></p><p>“What of the magicians?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s face took on an emotionless look. “Take them in and interrogate them about the curse. If they do not cooperate….eliminate them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....Got it.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, all three of them got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel and Merlin went after the Magicians first as they possessed the most danger to the Angels with their curses.</p><p><br></p><p>He could feel the eyes of many angels looking at them unkindly but no one spoke anything with Michael beside them.</p><p><br></p><p>The main battleground between the angels and the magicians was in the second Heaven. </p><p><br></p><p>It looked like there were more than one Ultimate Class Magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did they bring out their entire organisation here to attack?” He asked, surprised at the gathering.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, is that the Witch of the West and beside her seems to be the Witch of the North. I didn’t expect them to still be alive.” Merlin commented as he strutted forward, ignoring the barrage of attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, I last saw them three hundred years ago. And going by their looks, they look fairly young. Maybe they are using sorcery of some kind.” Azazel commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, perhaps. It looks like they have changed bodies though. Their magic seems slightly different than before.” Merlin said, narrowing his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does it even matter? They have attacked Heaven with the intention of war. Any time for words is gone. We need to take them down. Those two would most likely know the details of the curse.”</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, he was not as forgiving as Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s true, I guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel didn’t want to delay anything either so he directly brought out his trump card.</p><p><br></p><p>“Balance Breaker!”</p><p><br></p><p>‘Golden Dragon Balance Breaker: Downfall Dragon Another Armour.’</p><p><br></p><p>With his golden armour donned, he rushed into the crowd of magicians. The fight with Kokabiel hadn’t helped him get rid of his frustrations. Maybe these magicians would help.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, he just needed to keep the two witches alive for questioning.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Merlin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched as Azazel shot into the crowd of magicians, like an arrow from a divine bow. Everywhere he went, light spears rained, crushing the enemies below.</p><p><br></p><p>His progress was halted only when the leader of the other side came personally to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The Witch of the West fired a large fog of miasma to stop him from coming near them. Several of her own people crumbled under its effects and her power increased simultaneously. It was nowhere near the level of Azazel but was enough so that she could stall him for a while with the help of the other Cardinal Witch as Azazel would resist going all out to not destroy parts of Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a good plan….But that was only possible if Merlin were to sit back and do nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered if Satanael or Rizevim even imagined that Damien would come here to lend a hand to Angels of all people?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, since Azazel wanted to do the fighting, Merlin decided he would let him do that. All he needed to do was to prevent the surroundings from getting destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, he had just the thing for such cases.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Balance Breaker.’</p><p><br></p><p>Innovate Clear was a wonderful piece of art and among his favourite Longinus’. In fact, it was his second favourite one right after the Sephiroth Graal as the things he could do with it were nigh endless and only limited by his power and imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>The Longinus spread its magic, changing the pure white of Heaven into an expanse of endless golden clouds.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Avalon.’</p><p><br></p><p>Innovate Clear was a Sacred Gear that allowed one to drag people into the world created by Innovate Clear where he was basically God. The world could become anything he desired and laws of physics would mean nothing inside.</p><p><br></p><p>But this was just the basics.</p><p><br></p><p>Creating a world was far more than just manipulating the Laws of Physics.</p><p><br></p><p>What Innovate Clear did was create a Temporary World itself. A whole new world according to the user’s desires. The only reason this world had any similarities to the normal world was because of the user’s mind.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, normal people wouldn’t even be able to imagine a whole new world and all the work that took to create it….so the Sacred Gear just uses the outside world as a template for them.</p><p><br></p><p>The more the user learned and explored the Sacred Gear, the better they could use it and obviously the more power they have, the stronger the effects will be.</p><p><br></p><p>Not just the Laws of Physics, he could make and change <em>anything</em> inside the Sacred Gear’s domain.</p><p><br></p><p>New Laws of Magic, new kinds of life, anything.</p><p><br></p><p>He could in theory stop any magic from happening inside his domain by making a new Law which prevented any magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, even he would get caught in this and so it was hard to practise but that’s only when you didn’t have the cheat called the Archmage’s Essence.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone like him or Damien who can understand the Essence of Magic itself, are the only ones who can fully utilise <em>this</em> power.</p><p><br></p><p>This is exactly how he had been able to tamper with the Law of Time and alter the flow of time inside this world for his teammates to train longer. It was only the lack of his own power that prevented him from dilating the time even more.</p><p><br></p><p>And all this was only the function of the basic form of the Sacred Gear. As for the Balance Breaker, that was a whole nother beast.</p><p><br></p><p>The Magic of the Wizards of Oz was of the corrupting nature which was affecting the minds and very souls of Angels, turning them into those….abominations, not to mention the damage it was causing and the negative effect it had on Heaven's System.</p><p><br></p><p>This was one of the major reasons why the Angels were desperately holding back to prevent the already fragile system from collapsing and failing to even defend themselves, thus putting themselves at a disadvantage.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s where his Balance Breaker came in.</p><p><br></p><p>The Balance Breaker of Innovate Clear did exactly what the name suggested. It broke the balance of the world, allowing the Longinus to perform beyond its stipulated limit….of only changing the world <em>inside</em> it by temporarily overwriting the real world by the world of its creation.</p><p><br></p><p>So when his Balance Breaker spread, it rewrote the current Heaven….with the world of his own creation….the everlasting eutopia….Avalon.</p><p><br></p><p>Avalon- the place which was exactly that….a utopia where everything was perfect, where no one got sick, where no one died, where everyone was healed….a perfect place where everything was good.</p><p><br></p><p>It was his greatest dream and the first part of his biggest trump card, something which he had prided himself <a href=\"https://on….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on….at</a> least before being humbled by the words of his new King.</p><p><br></p><p>When he had told Damien about it, his King had laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin smiled remembering his words from that day?</p><p><br></p><p>‘Perfection? I can see how that curse can make for the best weapon.’ He hadn’t understood the words, Damien further explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Perfection meant that there was nothing else to improve, that one had become stagnant. Not being <em>able</em> to die might sound good, could also mean losing the choice of completing the cycle of life.</p><p><br></p><p>What might seem like an utopia, could instantly be transformed into a hauntingly painful prison for the unwanted….all he needed to do was change the laws slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, any damage caused by the Miasma was healed as soon as the golden clouds spread over the area.</p><p><br></p><p>The angels who had been transformed into monsters were returning back to their original shape….temporarily and helping their brothers and sisters turning the tides of the war.</p><p><br></p><p>Such change caused even the leaders fighting in the distance to stop their battle and look at him. He gave Azazel a nod. “You wanted them captured, right? Go on, let it all out. No one will die….even if they beg.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was donning a scale mail and Merlin couldn't see his face but he was pretty sure the man was grinning maniacally before his entire aura erupted, stunning the two witches in place.</p><p><br></p><p>All it did was disperse the golden clouds a bit before more took their place and all the damage was restored.</p><p><br></p><p>What came next was the show of power by Azazel as he showed everyone why he was called the strongest Fallen Angel and the scariest of them all.</p><p><br></p><p>It also gave Merlin an idea on the limits of Balance Breaker.</p><p><br></p><p>The witches stood no chance against Azazel’s assault.</p><p><br></p><p>The man tore them apart, only for them to reform, <a href=\"https://healed….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">healed….at</a> an agonisingly slow pace.</p><p><br></p><p>They could see their entrails knit back and crown slowly in their bodies before their wounds closed, only for them to be torn apart by another light spear.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes the angles at which they saw things were completely different as their heads were flying after being lopped off.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like being thrown into a blender of light spears while making sure they would never die.</p><p><br></p><p>Within minutes, the magicians who saw the condition of their leaders panicked. The angels being immune to their attacks didn’t help either.</p><p><br></p><p>In general, Magicians were physically weaker than even two winged Angels. They stood no chance as they were captured and tied up….that was not mentioning the fact that a large part of them surrendered after realising the futility of their efforts when even their suicide attempts didn’t bear any fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>The witches had it the hardest. By the time Azazel was done, the repeated deaths and the horrifying scenes of their guts being healed over and over had almost broken the wills of the witches.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it was one of the drawbacks of his Balance Breaker. His targets can still feel despair.</p><p><br></p><p>With them captured, the following barricades fell down quickly one after another and the 2nd Heaven was also recaptured.</p><p><br></p><p>He just hoped things were this easy on the other sides too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sean -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He slammed his spear into the ground as runes lit up in the air in front of him, protecting him and several angels behind him from a barrage of light spears from the Fallen Angels on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>When the barrage ended, the whole place was covered in the bright explosion of the light spears, obstructing the sights of most although it did nothing to his Observation Haki. He picked up his spear and taking a deep breath, threw it towards the Fallen Angel leading the attack on his group.</p><p><br></p><p>It went piercing the air and was at the face of the eight winged fallen in less than a second, undetected under the cover of the light explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fallen had not expected this attack and as someone who had been in combat for more than hundred times his age, he erected a barrier but….the spear imbued with Armament and Conqueror’s Haki was not that easy to stop. It effortlessly ripped through the barrier and pierced the Fallen through its heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Even as the Fallen….fell from the skies….the look of disbelief was etched on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean raised his hand over his head and the spear reappeared in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>This was his spear, Fur Cor, meaning the Thief of Hearts in Latin.</p><p><br></p><p>It was made by the Norse Blacksmiths and enchanted with Nordic Runes by their best enchanters. While not as good as the named mythical weapons, it wasn’t far from them either. Especially with the constant nourishment of his Armament Haki, it had gained a black edge, similar to the Black Swords that the Boss talked about, increasing its power even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin and Hagoromo Gitsune analysed this and came to a conclusion that continuously nourishing a weapon with his Haki, which was similar to Spiritual Power, awakens some kind of spirit inside the weapon, raising them above normal weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>He agreed with this theory as he could feel a bond with this Spear and it felt even better than what he did with the True Longinus to some extent. Then again, it was understandable as that weapon contained the will of the God of the Bible while this one contained his own will….obviously it would match him the best.</p><p><br></p><p>It had the ability to return to him from anywhere at his call and get restored even when shattered into pieces as long as he called its name. The runes gave it the power to buff the power of his attack in accordance to the willpower of the wielder. </p><p><br></p><p>“Take them down!” He shouted and the Angels, taking the advantage of the delay in command order of the Fallen, retaliated quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>He joined them and dodged the volley of light spears, deflecting some of them with his spear and struck down a Fallen with a thrust of his spear.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them took to the air to avoid him when they sensed they couldn’t beat him in a head on fight.</p><p><br></p><p>That was of no use though. In all his time, he had learned more than one technique to combat enemies in the air just to avoid the boredom of fighting against enemies who tried to kite him from a distance. Among them, his favourite one was most probably -The Moonwalk.</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to stamp his foot on the ground and walk through the air when he sensed something and ducked.</p><p><br></p><p>A foot landed on his shoulder as Musashi used him as a platform to jump into the air and slice off one of the Fallen Angels and then using that Fallen as a foothold, jumped towards another.</p><p><br></p><p>She blitzed through the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean didn’t want to be left behind so he stepped up his game too and began taking down the opponents.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were doing so, they heard a loud explosion and saw a huge wave of Holy Flames rise from a distance and rush towards a crowd of Grim Reapers on the other side of the battlefield, drowning all of them in the purple flames and wiping them all at once.</p><p><br></p><p>In the skies above the wave were two figures, two angels with twelve wings, one pure, one fallen.</p><p><br></p><p>Celine was fighting there with her father, Archangel Uriel.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was expecting her to snap at the man.” He said to Musashi who landed beside him the very next second.</p><p><br></p><p>“Celine-sama has a lot of self-control. After what she has been through, her previous grudges with her father were almost normal for her. Moreover, she is under orders and you know how particular she is about following orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I can’t argue with that.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Celine was almost fanatical when following orders. Ultra focused on her goals, not deviating at all.</p><p><br></p><p>As the boss said, ‘She’s a woman of Focus, Commitment and Sheer Fucking Will.’</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think encountering Akeno has helped her to deal with her own past. They have been very close to each other since the first time they met, so much so that Akeno taught her how to use the Purifying Flames.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, when did that happen?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“When you were in Asgard to train.” Musashi answered before turning back and slashing her swords, sending a wave of energy behind him to take down a light spear that was coming towards him as well as the Fallen who attacked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Well, they don’t look like they need any help on that side. We should clean up here and go and give the boss a hand. He has gone after the big ones after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to step towards the Fallen when a huge aura erupted from the Grim Reapers, making him freeze in his place. His head snapped in the direction of the power as did Musashi’s.</p><p><br></p><p>“What the fuck is that?” He asked, astonished at the sheer power of the aura.</p><p><br></p><p>That aura was just that strong.</p><p><br></p><p>In intensity, it felt similar to the Boss Lady’s power if not a bit higher. It had created tremors throughout the entire Third Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>He had heard from the Boss that the Third Heaven was the largest layer of Heaven with the size similar to that of the Earth and although not completely, this monster was shaking a large part of it with his aura alone.</p><p><br></p><p>In the distance, the place where the holy flames had lit up the ground, a violent aura of death erupted soon after and completely annihilated the holy flames, dying the area around it black smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>The smoke twisted and formed a gigantic figure in a ragged black cloak formed from clouds of death energy, red flame in place of eyes and a hugged jagged scythe lit with purple black flames, which looked like it would fall down at any moment but still gave Sean chills when looking at it.</p><p><br></p><p>A Grim Reaper?</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t know of any Grim Reaper of this strength.</p><p><br></p><p>At this level of power, he might be close to his master’s level. How was such a Grim Reaper unknown?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It had to be something else.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason why Hades still lives in the Underworld is because both Zeus and Poseidon work together to keep him there. Individually, he is stronger than both of them so….if he had such a strong subordinate….there was no way he wouldn’t take control of Olympus and still be rotting in the dark place called Hades.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this a new experiment?</p><p><br></p><p>Too many questions swirled around his mind but he didn’t have time to think about all of this. That aura couldn’t be allowed to rampage in heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>They were just outside the Third Heaven, the place where the souls of the dead resided. These souls were here to rest in peace and didn’t even have any means of defence.</p><p><br></p><p>If that….<em>thing</em> were to rampage here, it would cause too much damage.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Musashi and they shared one look, their years of partnership coming to work as they understood each other’s thoughts and rushed towards the Grim Reaper.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, he called for backup.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Emergency. Need Backup.’</em> He said through their link.<em> ‘We have encountered a Super Level threat. I repeat, we have encountered a transcendent level threat.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>As they neared the giant Grim Reaper, it raised its death scythe and swung it.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Celine and Uriel created hundreds of barriers to stop the attack from affecting the surroundings but as soon as the attack landed, most of them shattered as they barely contained the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>The Grim Reaper wasn’t done however as it just spun around, further increasing the power behind his next attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean used all his power and threw his spear at the monster and spun around using the momentum of the throw, preparing for a kick.</p><p><br></p><p>Musashi jumped and stepped on his leg as he shot her towards the Reaper for the follow up attack.</p><p><br></p><p>The Spear shot forward as if a red meteor and crashed with the scythe of the Grim Reaper as waves of Conqueror’s Haki swept across the surroundings. The Spear was knocked back but it had reduced the momentum of the attack and Musashi who was just behind them slashed down using both her swords, finally pushing away the second attack of the Grim Reaper.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean watched in astonishment as he summoned back his spear.</p><p><br></p><p>Those two attacks would have gravely injured any Satan Class devil and all it had done was push back the monster.</p><p><br></p><p>This was going to be a long drawn battle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you, soldier of Hades!” Uriel shouted as he fired a wave of holy flames at the monster which the monster casually waved off.</p><p><br></p><p>The grim reaper looked at the Archangel and to the surprise of everyone, it answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am no one’s soldier. I am….the Goblin.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked around the place as I rushed at my fastest pace towards the Fifth Heaven, the place where Gabriel and Ariel were fighting with Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>The scenes which flashed past me were….nostalgic. It was almost as if I was continuously in a deja-vu. As if I had already seen everything and knew what was going to happen when I turned the next corner.</p><p><br></p><p>Not a surprise though as I had indeed seen some of these places in the memories of Lucifer….but it was different somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>I was actually <em>feeling</em> everything.</p><p><br></p><p>My heart rate was rising as time went by as I looked around. New memories kept on flashing as I turned each corner. The scenes from Lucifer’s life.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however I was not closing my eyes….I didn’t need to.</p><p><br></p><p>I was….almost hallucinating everything.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind was filled with these while my body was acting completely on instinct.</p><p><br></p><p>Anywhere I passed, silver coloured light spears rained down, sniping any one not a pure angel, taking down an enemy in one shot.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind me were Lavy and Michael. Others had stayed behind to help the angels at the lower levels.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Michael, he went ahead, teleporting to the Seventh Heaven directly as the person who controlled the System.</p><p><br></p><p>The effects were visible too as the power of faith collected in the Heaven’s system empowered the pure angels as well as increasing the stability of Heaven so we could fight without restrictions.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached the entrance of the Fifth Heaven finally</p><p><br></p><p>The level of angels had increased as he went forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them in this field were either High Class Angels but there were also over a Eight Winged Angels, who were already fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the battle was in a stalemate.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps due to the Fallen Angels who were using Ophis’ snakes to increase their power.</p><p><br></p><p>Even normal fallen angels were buffed up to High Class level and any High Class one was pushed up to Ultimate Class.</p><p><br></p><p>They obviously wouldn’t have lasted for long but they would have caused utter destruction to Heaven before they were taken down, ensuring that the Heaven’s system collapsed and the result from that would have left the entire Heaven and Church devastated.</p><p><br></p><p>I was going to fly forward when I noticed a figure down below, surrounded by several others who were defending her.</p><p><br></p><p>Ariel?</p><p><br></p><p>She had her right arm pierced by a light spear and was stabilising the wound while the rest were holding the attacks from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised the True Longinus and Holy Power roared at my command, drawing the attention of everyone below. I swung the spear, sending a wave of holy power towards the attackers.</p><p><br></p><p>Their defence was nothing in front of the attack and they were all knocked out instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at them and saw many faces from my memories. Their eyes were wide, jaws slack as they stared at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Without minding them, I descended down.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole group separated to make way for me.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the group, Ariel was gawking at me, her eyes flickering between me, my wings and halo and the True Longinus in my hands.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her hand once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Asia.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes!” The girl behind me answered quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Go and heal Ariel.” I commanded and turned back.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded and stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that some of the angels had broken out of their stupor due to my voice and were looking warily at Asia and were about to step forward to stop her but then something happened which made them all freeze in their tracks.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia closed her eyes and joined her hands in prayer and eight pure white wings burst from her back and a golden halo on her head as holy power radiated from her form.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia Argento was now a pure Angel.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the angels who looked like their eyes would pop out at any moment at the scene. Most of them were high ranking Angels and they were highly likely to know who Asia was, after all, that was a scandal, wasn’t it so to see the former human turn into an angel….</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t blame them though.</p><p><br></p><p>I was the same when I had discovered this power of mine.</p><p><br></p><p>When experimenting to find out what my Lucifer Clan trait was, I encountered Demonification and began to explore it more.</p><p><br></p><p>We had many captives from different races, some enemies and some were criminals we had just captured for the bounty to collect funds.</p><p><br></p><p>I discovered many astonishing results from these experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>Any devil I reincarnated from other races became pure devils unlike the Evil Pieces which only produced a cross between both races if the other race was anything except human although I guess even humans were not changed into <em>pure devils</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>They still retained their original racial powers though but it became a part of their new devil physiology….similar to a Clan Trait in other Clans.</p><p><br></p><p>It was understandable as Leviathan had been a Sea Serpent and a Dragon before she was turned into a Devil by Lucifer, Asmodeus was an Incubus and Beelzebub was a demon.</p><p><br></p><p>Another difference was that any person I changed into Devils had multiple pairs of wings depending on their power. This was true for even the humans I changed.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, this was true for Lilith too who had been reincarnated by Lucifer. She had multiple pairs of wings too.</p><p><br></p><p>The real interesting change came when Sean joked about Angels giving away their balls to have the ability to change others into Angels.</p><p><br></p><p>It made me pause and think of something and the next thing I knew, I was in my Angel form, True Longinus in my hand and tried to use the Lucifer Demonization Trait….only with Holy Power this time.</p><p><br></p><p>And lo and behold, the first angel reincarnated by someone other than Father was born.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, the man I tried it on was a criminal, a serial killer. He was born with a Sacred Gear which made him invisible. The man had used this ability to cause quite a lot of chaos before he was caught by Merlin who had taken Arthur and Meridith out to teach them about real combat. The guy was involved in many kinds of crime so he fell almost instantly after being reincarnated.</p><p><br></p><p>I still got a lot of data from the experiment after which I started a completely new series of experiments which concentrated on exploring the effects of Angelification.</p><p><br></p><p>What I found out was that creating Pure Angels was much….<em>much</em> harder than creating devils.</p><p><br></p><p>For one, the base for creating angels had to be at least neutral.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hard, nigh impossible to do so for creatures purely related to the dark like youkai and ayakashi for example.</p><p><br></p><p>They were creatures who were born out of the fears and negative emotions of humans in most cases.</p><p><br></p><p>This made them a complete apotheosis of Holy Power and thus changing them was extremely hard and almost impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not saying it was completely impossible as Father had in fact created angels from the energies of mother but that involved changing a part of their souls and using the holy part as a seal on the other part kinda like the Fallen Angels.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not even close to that level yet. Maybe something could be done in the future? But not now.</p><p><br></p><p>I could however change a Fallen Angel back to their Pure Angel form although they rarely lasted. In fact, I had offered to do the same to Celine but she had rejected my offer.</p><p><br></p><p>She said that she was no longer a part of heaven and so it didn’t matter if she wasn’t a pure angel anymore. Moreover, she wouldn’t be able to take it if she were to be turned back and somehow….fell again.</p><p><br></p><p>There was someone who had accepted my offer though.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno was quite eager to get rid of her Fallen Angel part. She wasn’t the angsty girl whom we had rescued from the Himejima clan members due to the regular therapy sessions but she still held a grudge against Baraqiel who let her wander around, getting chased.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t blame her either. Baraqiel did fuck up.</p><p><br></p><p>The only problem was that I hadn’t worked on half fallen and while I knew there might not be any problems, I didn’t want to risk it before I had confirmed it completely so she was in line to reincarnate into an Angel.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after all my research was concluded, I turned Asia into an Angel yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>It was mainly to pull a prank on Michael and give him some hope that not all Angels will go extinct. It would have been a nice thing after Kokabiel’s dumbass plan to attack….and Rizevim ruined it all.</p><p><br></p><p>The more I thought about it the more annoyed I became.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia, on the other hand, kneeled in prayer when she reached the middle of the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“Balance Breaker.”</p><p><br></p><p>‘Twilight Healing Balance Breaker: Holy Mother’s Lullaby.’</p><p><br></p><p>A soothing green light spread out from her and covered everyone nearby and their wounds began to disappear one by one. Even poisoned flesh was cured and broken bones attached as the green light seemed to sing to everyone like a mother’s lullaby.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Ariel who was coming towards me, still unsure about everything.</p><p><br></p><p>I think Michael had told her about me but hearing is something and seeing is something else completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“So it’s true. You are….”</p><p><br></p><p>I just looked at her, my emotions complicated at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are the rest?”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly she seemed to recall the situation and quickly answered. “On the other gate. Both Satanael and Rizevim are there. I don’t think Gabriel can hold on for much longer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy, let’s go. Asia, you stay here and heal everyone.” I ordered before looking at Ariel. “Take care of Asia and back us up when you are healed. I will go and lend them a hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and we left quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>The scenes here were completely different from the previous level.</p><p><br></p><p>Whereas the previous level reminded me of the memories of Lucifer and gave a sense of deja-vu at every turn, this level was like a nightmare.</p><p><br></p><p>The actual scene was completely different from the ones in my memory.</p><p><br></p><p>In my memories, this place was the Silver City, the place where angels lived. Every corner gave the feeling of peaceful ambience by which even a fool would know this was Heaven and yet….now, in place of those scenes what lay were burned and broken buildings. Bodies of angels and fallen, magicians and grim reapers laid at random corners, tainting the place with the scent of blood and war.</p><p><br></p><p>It was painful to watch it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was infuriating.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt like burning the world with each scene that passed in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>The True Longinus pulsed as if sensing my emotions and its presence worked to soothe my feelings but it was hard to control.</p><p><br></p><p>All of this….Satanael and Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>I will make them pay.</p><p><br></p><p>I grit my teeth and increase my speed once more going ahead of others.</p><p><br></p><p>And soon enough I came near my destination.</p><p><br></p><p>My Observation Haki caught the presence of the ones I was targeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Three presences were standing out among all others.</p><p><br></p><p>I could recognise Rizevim’s presence even in my sleep. It was vile, almost nauseating.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t encountered Satanael so I didn’t know how his presence felt but I was pretty sure that he was the strongest fallen angel I was feeling there.</p><p><br></p><p>His own power had the tinge of draconic aura from Ophis like many others.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, the third presence who seemed weakened. It was almost as if it was injured and was weakening but even then, it felt calming like pure water.</p><p><br></p><p>Gabriel.</p><p><br></p><p>As I reached nearer, I could catch their words through my Haki and what I heard made my blood boil even more.</p><p><br></p><p>That bastard Rizevim….he wanted to kill Gabriel….just to see if I would get angry….if it would hurt me….</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t think I could get so angry and yet….here I was.</p><p><br></p><p>The True Longinus pulsed in my hand once more and as soon as I spotted the bastard….I poured my power into the Spear, throwing it with all my strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim was going to attack Gabriel but he sensed the spear approaching and barely moved back as the spear struck the place he was standing, blowing him away into a nearby building.</p><p><br></p><p>I landed in front of Gabriel and pulled out the spear from the ground and looked around me.</p><p><br></p><p>What greeted me was utter silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael was staring at me, fear and anger evident on his face.</p><p><br>Why the fuck was he angry?</p><p><br></p><p>The angels had similar reactions to what Ariel had a while ago.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back and saw that Gabriel had a stab wound on her side so I brought out one of our newly developed healing potions and threw it towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Drink this. It will heal you.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and then at the vial and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?” I uttered through gritted teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who did that?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened and for a single moment her eyes went towards Satanael before coming back at me again but she didn’t answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Stay back and create a barrier with the others. I will take care of the rest.” I said as I walked towards the enemy side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t! They are far stronger than before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. They might be strong….but I am….the strongest.” I replied as my wings spread wide and I slashed my spear to cut an attack which came towards me from the ruins of the building where Rizevim had crashed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha you really are great at giving surprises, father. To think you would fall to this….this level….” The bastard walked out of the rubble, dusting his clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>Just at that time, Lavinia landed beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy, protect Gabriel. If anyone attacks her….<em>kill them</em>.” I ordered and gripped the True Longinus tighter.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Lavinia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She walked in front of Gabriel and created a barrier to protect her until she was healed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously….to think you gave up….and for what? A few words said by your father?” Rizevim shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien was looking at him with a completely blank expression. There was no anger, no pain, no disappointment, no emotions at all in his eyes but after knowing him for so long, Lavinia knew that he was beyond angry right now and as could be seen if one looked at his hand which was holding the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>It was bleeding.</p><p><br></p><p>He was gripping the spear so hard that his nails dug into his own skin and his blood coated the spear, dripping on the ground from the pointed end.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was truly sad when you died, you know? For once, I am not lying. I truly thought that if I killed you that day, I could preserve the image of your ideal self, the image of <em>‘The Devil’</em>, in my mind and not that pathetic emotional coward who broke down from a few words of his dying father.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in Heaven looked at the madman with different expressions. Some were stunned, shell shocked at the revelation while some incensed, so angry that even their wings flickered black several times.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia understood their feelings, after all, she was feeling the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster continued. “When you returned from death, I was over the moon. I even planned all this to get you excited, to bring out the devil in you….and you….what did you do….turned into….this….into this….abomination….as if everything you were….everything you stood for….was all a lie….”</p><p><br></p><p>A look of sheer hatred enveloped Rizevim’s face as he looked at Damien.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You disappoint me, father.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was pin drop silence in the battlefield as if no one even dared to breathe loudly at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally Damien opened his mouth. “Are you done?” He asked in a low voice, his voice extremely calm.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim narrowed his eyes. “Yes….I have nothing more to say to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Damien nodded. “Good, then die.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim’s eyes widened and he spurted blood from his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes went down to his chest.</p><p><br></p><p>There, poking out from his chest….was the Spear of Destiny.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Damien and saw his figure fading away as the real figure of Damien appeared behind him, holding the spear which was currently piercing through his heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could do anything, the spear was pulled out and the spear was slashed twice, cutting off both his arms and then finally with a spin, Damien cut off his legs, making him crumble to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The mad man looked at Damien who stood above him, True Longinus in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to hate you….for all you have done….for people dear to me that you have hurt….Aria, Razevan, Gloria, Gretel, Vienna, Lilith….Father,” Damien took a deep breath and continued. “….but I can’t….because hating you would mean devoting my time to actively think about you….you Rizevim….are not worth it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim snarled, his power rising but before he could do anything, Damien pierced his skull with the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened and his energy dispersed and his body followed soon enough as it turned to ashes, blown away by the wind.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, the first Super Devil of the world, Rizevim Livan Lucifer….died.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien turned towards the rest of the attackers. “I will give you all one and only one chance….Surrender….or Perish.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support

    "content": "<p><strong>Buné Farmer</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 16: Work and Rest</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I signed the last document and fell down face first on my study table.</p><p><br></p><p>Doing all this paperwork was such a pain in the ass.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Shizuka on the other side of the room who was still working on her own pile. She hadn’t even taken a moment to stretch or any breaks at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Truly, she was the Dragon of Paperwork.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she was a bit too dedicated and didn’t take any time to chill. It was always either training or working for her.</p><p><br></p><p>The only times I have seen her taking a break is when Lavinia drags her along to spend some time with the other girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s take a break for today, Shizuka.” I asked her, knowing that she wouldn’t if I didn’t tell her to.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just need a few more hours to complete this.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have been at it for three whole days. I think it would do us both a lot of good to go out and get refreshed. What’s my schedule for today?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have to go to the Leviathan Capital City and meet Lady Serafall for some meeting. You wanted me to remind you to pay a surprise visit to your shop there. After the meeting, you need to go to the Gremory House and pick Miss Rias and Miss Latia up for dinner at the Dantalion House to discuss the warding of your farm areas.” She quoted my schedule.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then come with me for the shop visit and the meeting with Serafall. It would be good for you to have a change of scenery. Being cooped up in this place all day is not good for anyone. And after that we can go to the Gremory’s and you can meet Akeno.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the paperwork for a moment but then nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“But first, let’s go and eat something. I am starving.” I stood up and stretched and the two of us left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>We still didn’t have servants in our home but some of the others were learning how to cook.</p><p><br></p><p>All the chores of the house are done by us in turns. Magic makes most of the mundane things very easy so it wasn’t much of a problem maintaining such a big place by ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, apart from Shizuka and me, Ingvild and Natsume knew cooking. They had learned it recently and Ingvild was quite good at it.</p><p><br></p><p>We got to the kitchen and made ourselves some sandwiches before getting ready for our visits.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally Uncle Logan brings me reports about the sales and stocks of the shops but he also advised me to pay surprise visits to the shops to keep the people on their toes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was good advice too.</p><p><br></p><p>The shops were running fine.</p><p><br></p><p>The people were still new and they were the ones uncle had chosen himself so their loyalty shouldn’t be an issue.</p><p><br></p><p>We still checked the stocks and Shizuka did some looking around, asking the staff if they had any problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now the business was new and after the stance I had taken during the opening ceremony at Lilith, people were keeping a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>It was probably also due to the fact that the Satans themselves were promoting these businesses and our brand had some powerful backing in the form of my allies.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s pray that things remain this way for a while longer.</p><p><br></p><p>We went to the Leviathan Castle after that. The Leviathan City was actually surrounded by a lake of sorts.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally, there were no huge water bodies in the Underworld, that's why our plan to make an ocean was such a new and unique idea.</p><p><br></p><p>There were however some lakes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Leviathan city was created on the top of the largest of such lakes. I guess that Leviathan wanted to flex or maybe she really wanted to live in a city of her liking. Then again, it could be due the fact that the lake water would make her attacks easier to use.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked up to the reception.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me.” I asked, making the receptionist look up at me.</p><p><br></p><p>She hurriedly got up. “Lord Buné Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahaha relax. No need to hurry so much. I have an appointment with Lady Leviathan. I was wondering if you could point me towards where I should go?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Certainly.” The woman bowed and called someone. “Someone will be here momentarily to guide you. Please take a seat till then.”</p><p><br></p><p>We did just that when we heard the voice of a woman who was sitting near us. “Sir….if I am not mistaken, you are Lord Buné Zagan, right?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the woman. She was….a half devil, purple black hair and grey eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like she was also waiting for some kind of meating.</p><p><br></p><p>“In the flesh.” I replied with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“I knew it. I am Emine Drake, a magician working in the foreign affairs department. I just wanted to say that the Cuticle Berries from your farm are wonderful.” She smiled as she waved a hand through her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! I am glad you liked them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are. I haven’t felt my hair feel so great for centuries.” The woman said quickly. “ I have tried many products but I didn’t expect the Cuticle Berries to have such great effects.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” I looked at Shizuka and then at the woman. “Do you think if we launched products geared towards beauty and healthcare, they would be appreciated by the females of the Underworld. I mean, we Devils can shapeshift to a certain degree after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“True. Devils can change their body shape as we want but taking care of hair and skin is still difficult. I am sure if you launch such products, it would be a great hit among the women.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things by which the person called to pick us up had arrived. Dressed in a butler’s costume, it was none other than Behemoth, Serafall’s Rook, so I took my leave.. “Thank you for your advice. I will look into it more and see what I can do about the matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was always nice to see people like my products.</p><p><br></p><p>Behemoth bowed slightly towards me. “Lord Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Behemoth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. My Lady has been awaiting your arrival for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>He led us towards Serafall‘s office.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I had come to this place. All the previous meetings were in New Lilith at the Lucifer Castle or at the Beelzebub’s Castle as that’s where the Devil Research and Development Department was located.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall’s Castle was all about Foreign Affairs. In fact, not just the castle, even the entire city was full of people of different races, many visiting while many setting up shops.</p><p><br></p><p>People came here for many reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>It was surprising to see that the Underworld and the Supernatural world also worked in a similar way as the modern countries did.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the branch of my shop here was so important.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached Serafall’s office soon and Behemoth asked for permission before entering the office.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty! Come in. I have been waiting for you for a while.” Serafall greeted me from her seat as soon as she saw me.</p><p><br></p><p>She was dressed in a formal suit and looked completely different from her usual magical girl look.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Surprised to see me like this?” She noticed my stare and asked with a cheeky smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the room and noticed that there were other people in the room too.</p><p><br></p><p>I recognised two people.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger Rosenkreutz and Euclid, the latter of whom was currently standing behind her and smiling at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit, yes. I am more used to seeing you in pink all the time.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I told you I should change the official Leviathan uniform to Magical Girl Levia-tan.” She remarked making Euclid facepalm.</p><p><br></p><p>“On second thought, I think you look quite good in this type of dress too. Gives a much more Onee-sama feel. I think Sona would like this better.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, really! Well, then changing costumes is cancelled.”</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed at her antics.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, sit Mathias. We have a lot to discuss.” She said as I took the seat.</p><p><br></p><p>She then pointed towards the third man in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you two have already met before?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I had the fortune of meeting Lord Rosenkreutz at the opening of my Shop. Unfortunately I was not able to spare much of my time on that day. I apologise. I will rectify this soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. The party you threw was great and I know how much work you put in everything. I couldn’t ask for all your time on such days. But I will be more than happy if you join me for dinner at my place.” The guy offered politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would be honoured.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will have someone send you an official invitation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, while it’s always good to see Matty come out of his territory and make friends, I think we should get to the matter at hand.” Serafall clapped hands and I looked at her curiously. “Let’s start from the start, I guess. Would you like to explain the situation, Rudiger?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man nodded seriously and then looked at me before explaining the entire story to me. In the meanwhile I tried to remember what I knew about him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was reincarnated by Delphiena Mammon, a member of the Extra Devil Clans, the daughter of the Lord of the Clan actually. The woman was an eccentric person, someone who lived for her curiosity. In fact, she was curious about the Evil Pieces so unlike many Extra Devil Clans, she came forward and received her own Evil Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger was someone who summoned and made a deal with her. The deal was that if he could solve twelve puzzles from her, she would make him her peerage member and basically let him do whatever he wanted. If he couldn’t however, then he would do whatever she wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>His goal was to get a devil’s long lifespan to work and progress his magic to new heights.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say, he won and she kept her word too.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger became a member of the Mammon Household and has been a devil for a few centuries already and had even risen to the position of an Ultimate Class Devil and one of the Top Ten Rating Game Players through hard work. He is very close to the Mammon House and is still friends with the Heiress and his King.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, this would be a perfect life but there was one problem for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger couldn’t have children. He tried for centuries with several  wives but Devil fertility rates are really abysmal.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, things did work out in the end, he had a child, Alfred Rosenkreutz with a female magician he was contracted with.</p><p><br></p><p>The child was a half devil but for Rudiger, he is his only child and the man dotes on him a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that Alfred has always been sickly and his health kept deteriorating as he grew older and it wasn’t until a few years ago that it was diagnosed that he was born with a Sacred Gear which was the cause for all this.</p><p><br></p><p>His Sacred Gear was born in a hyperactive state and has been taking a toll on his body and according to the doctors, he wouldn’t live for long.</p><p><br></p><p>The man has been running around everywhere to look for a cure for his condition but hasn't found any solution yet.</p><p><br></p><p>His son’s birthday was coming up and the man just wanted to make the kid happy. The kid wants to meet his idol… the strongest upcoming exorcist and the Trump Card of Heaven, Dulio Gueseldo.</p><p><br></p><p>How did that even happen?</p><p><br></p><p>How could a kid, the son of one of the most famous people in the Underworld, meet or know about the strongest upcoming exorcist and even become a fan of the guy?</p><p><br></p><p>Truly, the internet was a frightening thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, Rudiger wanted to make his son happy as it could very well be his last or second last birthday so he submitted a request to the Satans who were quite understanding and sympathetic of his situation and forwarded the request to Heaven, because let’s face it, there was no way the Church would do such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is where I come in.</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven also would obviously think several times about such a strange and admittedly suspicious request.</p><p><br></p><p>They however did….on the condition that they get to meet me too.</p><p><br></p><p>Huh, I guess the products did catch them off guard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now Mathias, no one is going to force you. This will be your choice only. Knowing the previous records, if you want to deny the visit, we wouldn’t blame you for it.” Serafall said and even Rudiger didn’t say anything about this.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought for a second. “Where do they want to meet me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We would negotiate it to either be the Underworld or any neutral third party grounds under supervision but considering the fact that Dulio would have to come to the Underworld itself….I doubt that they would agree to that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So their territory.” I concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Most likely.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Dulio ready?” I asked. I remembered something like this but I didn’t know everything from the books and this world was quite different so I had not paid much attention to that stuff either.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. In fact from what I could glean from my sources, the boy had decided to come regardless but was stopped and they put in the new demand later.”</p><p><br></p><p>I heard Rudiger sigh. “Don’t mind it, Lord Buné Zagan. I couldn’t ask you to put yourself in such danger for my sake alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll do it.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll do it. Just let my peerage members come with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, you don’t understand….” Serafall started.</p><p><br></p><p>“I understand everything, Serafall. I know the risks but….if even an exorcist….was willing to go so far for the sake of a devil’s child….I think it would be incredibly selfish for me not to lend the same support, don’t you think?” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>A kid was dying….sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>They just looked at me for a few seconds. “Are you sure you want to do this, Matty?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Absolutely. Moreover, there is only so much I can run and hide. I will have to face them one day. It’s better to get it over with as soon as possible.” I nodded and then remembered something. “Just a request.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t tell Rias or Latia.” I smirked. “They would kick up a fuss.”</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall rolled her eyes. “You are planning to go to the biggest enemy of the Devil Race and you are afraid of your little fiances kicking up a fuss?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. I am going there….I don’t plan to live the rest of my life with them.” I laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger, on the other hand, bowed. “Thank you, Lord Buné Zagan. I will never forget this favour of yours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, don't sweat it. Also, just call me Mathias. Lord Buné Zagan is a mouthful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Mathias.” He repeated again.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards Serafall, “When should I expect this meeting?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked pensive. “Probably a week.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, just let me know when you decide.”</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few more things before I left the place.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, you are here!” Rias greeted us as soon as we teleported to the Gremory House. </p><p><br></p><p>“Hey there. You look beautiful.” I complimented because she was indeed looking gorgeous in her black dress.</p><p><br></p><p>“T-thank you.” She replied with a blush. It was adorable so I went ahead and gave her a light hug.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind her Akeno was smiling widely at her King’s state.</p><p><br></p><p>“A-anyway, Latia is already here. Come in. She's waiting inside.” She said hurriedly and pulled me in.</p><p><br></p><p>I could hear Akeno giggle behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a moment to realise that this was probably about that night.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it looked like she was embarrassed after her adrenaline had worn off.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t mind since she looked quite adorable like this.</p><p><br></p><p>We were led inside where Latia was already waiting and talking to Venelana and Elsa Gremory, the wife of Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside them were the other members of the Gremory family.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good evening.” I greeted everyone, Shizuka standing behind me also bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good evening, Mathias. Come take a seat. We were just talking about you.” Zeoticus said and I did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias took the seat next to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is being a Lord treating you, Mathias?” Zeoticus asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I winced.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, that bad already huh? Then again, with the amount of work you have to put in, I guess it’s understandable.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that the sales in your shops are increasing everyday. Even the staff working in our place are praising the products.” Venelana praised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I have seen the reports and things have been going well till now. The demand is rising slowly and thus I need to expand the farm area.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Elsa looked at me and spoke first. “Latia was just explaining to us the situation. She said you need wards for your farms, is that correct?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“How much land are we talking about and how strong of a warding system do you want?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, let’s see. I will mainly grow the F and E Ranked products in those places but it would be on a very large scale. The demand of the products is the highest at the Low and Middle Classes and they grow faster too. As for how much, hmm….let’s say almost three times the current area….around fifty to a thousand square kilometres.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” She exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, the area was just that ridiculous.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean I don’t need all of them done at once. This will be a long term project after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait wait, hold on for a second. You said three times the current area of your farm. You mean to say that your current farm is as big as fifteen thousand to twenty thousand square kilometres?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“More or less.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“How does no one know of this?” She asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>I could understand it. Although she had been to my place several times, she didn’t know the true extent of the farm’s area because it was almost impossible to give them the entire tour.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are entirely under wards.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“The entire area. The entire fifteen to twenty thousand square kilometres of area?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you did it by yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. None of the other members of my peerage knew wardcrafting.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>She just stared at me, completely quiet. Even the rest were looking at me in stunned silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there a problem?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, Zeoticus spoke. “I think she is just taken aback at the scale of things. We….don’t usually ward off farming areas….or any areas of that scale. Your situation is a unique one. It’s just something we have never encountered before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….I guess that’s true. But I can’t leave my farms unguarded either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you have done an impeccable job at that. I have seen the wards you have put around the areas you showed us on our visit. Those were some of the best works I have seen so far. In fact, I have seen wards around Lucifer's Castle and they were comparable to those.” Elsa praised, having gotten out of her stunned state. “And they were quite extensive too, surrounding all the area around your mansion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, it covers my entire farm as of now. I have used the same quality of wards for my entire farm.”</p><p><br></p><p>She paused for a moment again and then spoke in a deadpan. “That’s impossible. The energy for that would be….”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are powered by my Dryads and Dragons as well as several of the stronger of my creations.” I interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>She held her words, thinking for a while before speaking again. “But even then, that would require over a hundred Ultimate Class beings….” She suddenly looked at me, her eyes wide.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s say that just like the Great Gremory Horde, I have my own Horde as well.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t tell her that all of them are only using a small part of their powers and the actual numbers were actually over ten times that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Meh….as if those plants and lizards can rival my cute Camels.” Runeas snorted from the side, making me laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>The others smiled at her comment too.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….I doubt we could get you wards as strong as those Mathias. Covering that much area would be.” She said, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not looking for those kinds of wards for my entire farm. I doubt I would be able to support those either. Just minor ones which can help with the detection and stop even Mid Class beings. My Dryads and Hunting Squads will take care of the rest. As I have already said, I am not planning to grow expensive stuff in those places.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….doable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, let’s go. The entire thing still has to be passed by my brother.”</p><p><br></p><p>I left Shizuka there to spend some time with Akeno and the rest of us left.</p><p><br></p><p>We teleported over to the Dantalion House where the Lord of the House, Atticus Dantalion, was already waiting for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Brother. These are the people I was talking about.” Elsa introduced.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Mathias Buné Zagan. I heard someone wanted to discuss the deal about warding but Elsa didn’t tell me who it was. You have always had a knack for surprising me.” The man greeted us with a smile and offered his hands for a handshake. “Welcome.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shook hands with him as we walked in while recalling everything I had memorised about them.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dantalions were a Duke House just like the Buné, ranked seventy one among the seventy two pillars.</p><p><br></p><p>They have mostly stayed out of politics all this time. In fact, the Dantalions have been one of the only houses who had shown to have no ambitions for power. Even during the time of the previous Satans, they were quite well liked by Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of this didn’t mean they were easy to walk over.</p><p><br></p><p>They were the leading researchers of the Underworld. Just a simple fact: around 48% of all the researchers in the Devil Research and Development were either from the Dantalion House or were related to it and over 60% of all the new technologies invented in the Underworld have the hands of Dantalion at least somewhere on them.</p><p><br></p><p>They had enough royalties from the research they do to keep the house afloat even if they didn’t work for a few thousand years and no house would want to make enemies of them.</p><p><br></p><p>This was not even considering their main business, Warding.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dantalion Clan Trait was Space Magic Affinity and they had developed incredible Warding Skills just like the Sitri had their hands in the hospital business.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs marrying Elsa had several reasons apart from the two liking each other.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained the situation to Lord Dantalion and he, while as surprised as his sister, agreed to help us out.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the negotiations for the payments that were hard.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t demand monetary payments and to be honest, such high payments would have made us make several cuts to our future plans so I was thankful for that. Instead they asked for payments in a different method.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I will open a shop in the Dantalion House territory and offer them a fifteen percent discount on F Ranked products, 10% on E Ranked Products and 5% on D Ranked products for the next twenty years.</p><p><br></p><p>This point was argued over by Latia and we put forward a proposal to fix a maximum amount of products on which the discount will be available because otherwise people from other territories will try to buy from here and it would result in losses and while the system of selling only a certain amount of products will still be applicable, it would still result in us taking losses.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Dantalion offered a counter proposal that the people will have to provide proof that they were the residents of the Dantalion territory for a certain period of time to avail this discount and any extra costs for this will be handled by the Dantalion House themselves, in return, we offer them a five percent discount in the auctions.</p><p><br></p><p>After a long period of discussion, the contract was reached with the final clause being the alliance between the Dantalion and the Buné-Zagan Houses.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, I think the trip itself was quite good.</p><p><br></p><p>We returned to the Gremory House after that and Latia and Rias decided to come with me for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“That was mind numbing.” I sighed as I slumped in the bath and closed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were quite good. I am surprised you actually argued over the point.” Latia said as she walked into the bath beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was an obvious point, the main reason why I am even resorting to the warding is that I don’t have enough to sell everywhere. Giving them discounts without any limits would have increased sales in that area beyond what I was ready for.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“I still think we didn’t lose out. The Dantalion allying with you will help you out more than just the wards. They are the foremost family when it comes to research. They could develop several products using different produce from your farm. For example, Shizuka was telling us about how you were talking to some woman about expanding towards the cosmetics and healthcare industry. Instead of selling the Cuticle Berries directly, we could always make Shampoos or other hair care products from them and sell them, creating a completely new line of products.” Latia suggested as she sat down beside me and made herself comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, we could always open up spas with the different animals which help cleanse the body when we expand into tourism with the new sea.” The one who said this was Rias who had followed us to the bath.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a slight blush on her cheeks as she sat on my other side.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at her and she explained. “We have been thinking about some ideas which could be good.”</p><p><br></p><p>As she settled, I hugged both the girls to my side. “Thanks for working so hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t just saying this, I actually meant every bit of it. They were actually putting lots of effort into all of this.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is going to be my family so there’s nothing strange about working for it.” Latia just rolled her eyes, but I could feel that she was actually happy with the praise.</p><p><br></p><p>“As she said.” Rias nodded although it was easy to see her happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….wanna tell us why your queen was teasing you so much today on my arrival?” Latia asked, looking at Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh!” The girl yelped not expecting the question, especially from Latia.</p><p><br></p><p>I kept quiet, not interfering in this matter.</p><p><br></p><p>“T-that was….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on, Rias, you can share things with us but if you don’t want to then you don’t need to force yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” She hesitated a bit and I decided to lend her a helping hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“She probably heard about the kiss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kiss?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>It took her a second to realise and she narrowed her eyes. “That doesn’t explain why she was teasing her with me.” Latia questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to explain when Rias cut off the conversation. “Let me. I….don’t want to hide.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, go on.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see….that night….after Matty’s first Council Meeting….”</p><p><br></p><p>The blonde realised what she was talking about and her cheeks blushed immediately but she played it off quickly. “I see. So you were awake. Hmm, I guess we should have guessed that earlier. We were kind of impulsive that night.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias just nodded her head embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to be that embarrassed. We already discussed these things between ourselves earlier.” Latia said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, you did?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Private matter, Matty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? I think matter concerns me too.” I argued….but was easily ignored.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess you were caught off guard that day.” Latia continued making the other girl nod. “Well, it’s not bad that you found out. Now you can join us.” She smirked, making Rias stutter before she pouted, realising what we were doing.</p><p><br></p><p>We laughed seeing the usually boisterous girl stutter on such a matter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, you can always share these kinds of things with me. We made a pact, remember.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What pact?” I asked….but was ignored again.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, you had your first kiss that night?” Latia teased this time and Rias nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“After you went to sleep.” She confirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was trying to not make the situation awkward.” I interjected to prevent any future attacks on me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….you saw?” Latia asked, embarrassment tingling her tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….just heard most of the things.” Rias whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….”</p><p><br></p><p>The situation became quiet all of a sudden, both girls dealing with their embarrassment so I decided to change the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>“And Akeno found out so she was teasing you.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that she was explaining the whole situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically, Akeno knew her King very well and saw through her off behaviour on the very next day and while poking and prodding, she found the reason and both her and Kuroka have been teasing the girl since that day.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia smirked and suddenly threw me a curveball. “I for one think she was also throwing heated gazes towards you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Girls this age are curious, Matty. They just hide it better.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! I don’t think she….” I started to explain but Rias interjected.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, she is not wrong about that. Akeno <em>is</em> interested. She might have made one or two such jokes regarding this but I know her well enough to see through her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Well, she is someone I can agree to. We know she will not betray us. Although, I was planning to pull in Shizuka to be honest, but this works as well.” Latia shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait what? Are you both still carrying out that plan of yours? I am telling you I can control myself just fine.” I said but they were just adamant.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not about you controlling yourself. They are good girls and you will need to have more children so why not keep your options at hand. Even father has a harem and you actually <em>need</em> it.” Rias said.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s not wrong. Tell me you are not enjoying the company of Lavinia and Ingvild?” Latia questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….am.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And that proves my point. If anything, I am actually surprised you are holding yourself back so much….n-n-not that I am complaining but you are a devil….and a dragon. All other devils your age are far more open about this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, if what I have heard from Lili, even Armin is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait wait….I don’t want to hear about the sex life of my best friend from my fiances. Seriously, what do you girls even talk about in your free time?”</p><p><br></p><p>And I already knew that about Armin.</p><p><br></p><p>We had a field day teasing the crap out of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I learned Senjutsu for a reason, ya know. I knew I couldn’t afford to think with my dick and thus sort of a way to control myself.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….makes sense.” They nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….do you like Akeno and Shizuka or not?” Rias asked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh he has a good chemistry with Shizuka and he is probably the only guy I have seen her being that open to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, I have a good chemistry with Armin and Sairaorg too but I don’t swing that way. Having good chemistry doesn’t mean anything. Both sides have to like each other for a relationship to work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think you know how many girls like you, Matty. You didn’t even approach Ingvild and Lavinia and they were both waiting to practically throw themselves on you.” Latia argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Even the girls in my peerage like you as much as they like me. Especially Isla. She would gladly join your peerage if you ask her even once.” Rias shrugged. “Hell, I have even seen Kuroka, secretly sniffing around.</p><p><br></p><p>“....I have no words.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You still haven’t answered whether you like the two girls or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t dislike them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s enough. No one is telling you to jump into a relationship. Just consider them as potential partners and see if it works.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“....I guess that makes sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>We had been in the bath for a while so we decided to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias called home and informed them that she would be living here today.</p><p></p><p>We were already adults and engaged but still had to tiptoe around for such matters. I just wish we could get married soon and live together already.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to do this?” I asked Latia who had a deep blush on her cheeks but agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“We did make a pact.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....one day, I will find out what that pact is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. But that day is not today.” She whispered as she leaned in into my lap and kissed me, preventing me from replying.</p><p><br></p><p>We were in my bedroom.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of us, Rias, Latia and I, were here to….celebrate today’s deal with the Dantalion House.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia was not kidding when she said that next time Rias could join us. She actually pulled the other girl into the bedroom with us and even though Rias was not exactly going to participate, she was free to watch this time….which she was quite eager about.</p><p><br></p><p>I returned the kiss, pushing other matters aside for later. This was not my first time with two girls together as I have slept together with Lavinia and Ignvild multiple times so I was used to it.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t, so I tried to make her comfortable first.</p><p><br></p><p>Our lips met lightly before I took her lower lip into mine and pushed my tongue into her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>One of her hands roamed on my naked back as she hugged me tighter and her other hand went to my head, grabbing a hold of my hair.</p><p><br></p><p>She was more aggressive than usual.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess she wanted to put on a show for our third partner.</p><p><br></p><p>We pulled apart after a few minutes and there was a line of saliva between our lips.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard heavy breathing from our side and from the corner of our eyes saw Rias, grabbing a hold of her breasts and massaging them slowly, her eyes glued to us.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, since Latia was putting so much effort to put on a show, why should I hold back?</p><p><br></p><p>I leaned in and started kissing her neck, slowly going downwards to her chest, taking one of her nipples in my mouth and sucking at it lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Mmhhh</em>.” She moaned as her grip on my hair became tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>She moved her waist, grinding herself on my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already hard from the kiss and the heat from her core made me even harder.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slipped down from her waist and to her supple ass as I grabbed it and pulled her against my body, assisting her in her grinding more.</p><p><br></p><p>I shifted to her other breast and gave it the same treatment as the first one.</p><p><br></p><p>She was now totally in the mood and got up, pushing me slightly so I was on my back as she slowly went down, grabbing my hard length and stroking me slowly. I closed my eyes and let out a pleasant breath.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already slightly wet due to her core rubbing on me and my own precum and she had gotten a lot better than our first time. She leaned down, slowly moving her hair to the side so that her face could be seen by Rias as she placed a soft kiss on my tip.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” My hand went to her head and caressed her slowly as she showered my entire length with kisses before coming to the tip and giving it a lick with her tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked on the side and Rias was currently breathing heavily, one of her hands between her legs, with both her legs closed tightly as she watched us with unblinking eyes. I signalled for her to come to me, shaking her from her thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>She did, slightly hesitant, and I hugged her to my side and kissed her lightly on her cheek but didn’t do anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia looked at us once, meeting our gazes as she opened her mouth and took my tip in her mouth, making me groan in pleasure as she moved her tongue around my tip.</p><p><br></p><p>My grip on her hair tightened and the speed of her tongue increased as well as she started working on me earnestly.</p><p><br></p><p>She bobbed her head up and down, slowly increasing her speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I felt Rias hug me tighter, making me turn towards her. She had a dazed look in her eyes as she leaned in towards me. I knew what she wanted so I went forward and captured her lips with mine.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t as experienced as Latia and not on an adrenaline high like the last time so her movements were still clumsy but her excitement was easy to feel.</p><p><br></p><p>I slowly pushed my tongue into her and while she stiffened slightly, just a moment later, I felt her lips open up to allow the entry of my tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>My tongue slowly explored her mouth and she, while hesitant at the start, was slowly reciprocating. Very slowly her hands wrapped around my neck as she got more into the kiss. Latia was not sitting idle either, she moved in, bringing her breasts to play as she wrapped my length between them and started working on the tip.</p><p><br></p><p>I slowly thrusted between her breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias pulled back as she realised what we were doing and looked at the scene, enthralled.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that I was free, Latia increased the speed and a few minutes later, I could feel myself reaching the edge.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m coming.” I whispered and thrusted harder, releasing jets of my cum between her breasts, painting her already pale chest white.</p><p><br></p><p>She was about to snap her finger and clean everything when she saw Rias reaching with her hand and touching my cum on her breasts, looking at it with curiosity. It took her a moment to realise we were looking at her and she blushed once more and snapped her fingers, cleaning everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just curious.” She said shyly.</p><p><br></p><p>We merely smiled and didn't tease her for it anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, next up is my turn.” I said as I kissed her lightly before pushing Latia on the bed. Next I made Rias lie down beside her and got between Latia’s legs.</p><p><br></p><p>She was already glistening from arousal as I slid my finger along her slit, my finger became wet. She gripped the bed sheets tightly and I smirked at her before sucking my finger.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are….incorrigible.” She huffed with a blush.</p><p><br></p><p>“Guilty as charged.” I smirked before diving for her core.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave the top a small kiss before giving the whole slit a long lick.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmmhh ahhhh.” She moaned, her hand reaching for my head.</p><p><br></p><p>WIth my other hand, I reached for Rias, my hand slowly caressing her thigh.</p><p><br></p><p>She put a hand on mine but didn’t make any attempts to move me away, instead she pressed it harder against her own body. I got her message and continued massaging her thigh to make her more comfortable with everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile my tongue was working continuously on Latia, lapping greedily at her sodden core. Her legs snaked around my head and pulled me in harder, as if to feel more of my tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Latia was strong.Even with just her physique, she was at a solid High Class level with all the exercise and food she had been consuming so the pressure between her thighs was easily strong enough to crush rocks….fortunately, I have a much more durable head….and entire body.</p><p><br></p><p>All I could feel from her efforts was the softness of her thighs embracing my head, making me work harder on her. I reached upwards towards her clit, latching on in while my free hand which had been lubricated earlier with her juices traced her bottom, finding my way to her rosebud.</p><p><br></p><p>She jerked as soon as she felt my finger on that place but surprisingly, didn’t voice out her words.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a second to realise why.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t want Rias to know her weak spot.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a smile came on my face as I looked up from between her legs and into her eyes. Her eyes were pleading and my smirk grew wider as I slowly pushed my finger in.</p><p><br></p><p>She was tight and smouldering in there and the nervousness was making her clench harder. I could only push till the first joint of my finger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ummm….” She bit her lips and controlled her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>I started to lick her slit once more to make her relax and slowly but surely, the pressure on my finger was reduced, helping me push further till I was fully inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>Her moans increased as she relaxed more and from the corner of my eyes, I saw Rias looking at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She couldn’t see what was happening down here but her moans were even sexier now.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute or so later, their bodies convulsed and they hugged each other as both came at exactly the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>To my surprise, Rias reached for Latia’s breast and caressed it slightly, making the other surprised at the sudden attack but she was already in the mood. And then something happened which blew my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia slowly reached and Rias closed her eyes, leaning forward….and kissed.</p><p><br></p><p>It went on for a few seconds but damn if that wasn’t hot.</p><p><br></p><p>When they broke off, they looked at me. I was raging hard by that time.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia looked at my hardness and spread her legs and I knew what she wanted so I got on top of her with my length on her core.</p><p><br></p><p>We had decided to wait for the last step till we were married but everything else was fine. My length easily slid over her smoking hot slit as it was already wet. On the other hand, Rias leaned in and took her breast in her mouth and began sucking on it.</p><p><br></p><p>The room was covered in sounds of sucking and slapping of thighs as a musky smell covered the whole room. I thought about what we had talked earlier….about me being a devil and a dragon and realised that they were not that far from the point.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t as if I wasn't aware of the girls around me and some of their interest in me. Each and every one of them were people who would have had hundreds of boys lining up for them and they had great personalities too but sometimes even people with great personalities, who were the best of friends, make for terrible couples. I actually cherished my relationship with them and didn’t want to ruin them in a moment of impulsiveness. But even worse, If I were to ever cross the line, I know it would be hard to control myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like now. The feeling was almost intoxicating.</p><p><br></p><p>I held her thighs and leaned in, putting her in a mating press as I kissed her lips. A few seconds later, I shifted to Rias, taking her lips for mine before kissing them alternately.</p><p><br></p><p>Several minutes later, I found myself approaching the peak and pulled back, releasing my seeds on both girls.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene of both my fiances laying there, their hair sprawled all over the bed as they were covered in sweat and my <a href=\"https://seed….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seed….it</a> was beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>I was back up almost instantly and saw their eyes widening.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Five rounds later, I lay between both the girls who were breathing heavily by now.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know what, now I think that we might need to add even more girls….and not just to keep the gold diggers away.” Rias laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s the entire story. Now I will have to go to a place decided by them and meet the Leaders of Heaven and probably the Church for some talks.” I explained as I laid down on the ground and watched the moon in the purple sky.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was quite a bold decision from you, Matty.” Tia replied as she waved her hand through my hair. “Very dragonlike. I like it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew she would say something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a week since the meeting with Serafall and she had discussed the matter with Gabriel, the one incharge of Heaven’s Foreign Affairs and after lots of back and forth, they reached the decision of holding the meeting in Sweden.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a place near the Norse territories where neither the devils nor the angels or any pantheon for that matter had any sway, a perfectly neutral territory.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones attending the meeting with me would be my peerage members and Euclid, Serafall’s Queen who will be representing her.</p><p><br></p><p>As for who will come from the other side, I have no idea.</p><p><br></p><p>First Dulio will be coming here though and I was asked to visit the Rosenkreutz Mansion with the guy to meet Rudiger’s son as well in three days.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you going there alone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I know I could return even if I had to fight two Archangels in a solo fight but I wouldn’t risk such a situation. I am not foolish so I won’t underestimate their means. I have sent a message to Crom and will take Ingvild and Lavy with me. And in the worst case that they really give up all pretences, I will summon Leafa and let them understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had too many trump cards to be afraid of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take Shizuka.” She offered up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take the girl with you. She is strong enough and it would do her well to interact with the outside world again. Didn’t you yourself say such a thing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….did.” I thought over it and didn’t find anything to refute and agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. You will be fine.” She brushed my hair. “Judging from the smell of the girls on you, I don’t think you are worried about it either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?!” I was suddenly caught off guard at her curveball and looked up to see her smirking and realised that the simple bath couldn’t remove the scent of the girls.</p><p><br></p><p>After that night with Latia and Rias, Lavy wanted to try those things too and dragged a blushing Ingvild in with her for another threesome.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say, I had no problems accommodating them.</p><p><br></p><p>I was broken from my thoughts when Tia leaned in and kissed my forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t mind you having other lovers. Dragons, especially ones as strong as you, almost always have more than one partner but I would get angry if you think about other girls while in my lap.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled, embarrassed. “I’m sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am still waiting for our fight. Three years, eleven months and twenty one days left, so keep yourself safe.” She went back to caressing my head. “After all, I wouldn’t have anyone saying that the Partner of the Chaos Karma Dragon is weak.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “I promised and have I ever broken my word to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you better keep that up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Ma'am.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things and I decided to take the opportunity to enjoy the lap pillow and take a nap.</p><p><br></p><p>The coming week was going to be interesting to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘The Farmer’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Several things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Matty is making deals and is finally going to meet the members of other factions for the first time ever.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What will happen, who knows?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the other side of things, he got closer to both Rias and Latia.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Next chapter will be ‘The Deal’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

You look funny when you sleep, especially with all the snoring dahahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“30%.” I ignored his words and asked directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was that just 30% of your Conqueror’s Haki?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you heard that. Well yeah. I guess I can still get stronger. The top figures in Grandline are stronger and I want to become one of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The top figures?” I suddenly realised something.</p><p><br></p><p>This Shanks….he was not even the Emperor Shanks.</p><p><br></p><p>He was the Foosha Village version of Shanks.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t realised this but it seems that I got the strongest version of the character I had drawn yet which means that I needed to wait till the time Yonko Shanks appears for the first time which will be during his meeting with Hawkeye.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should have summoned Roger.</p><p><br></p><p>A quick calculation told me that I needed to draw around twenty more chapters to get that version of Shanks.</p><p><br></p><p>But that means….I couldn’t even withstand 30% of this Shanks’ power….</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey! What’s that face for? Why do I feel that you are insulting me in your thoughts?” The guy jumped up quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Nothing like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Liar!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….will you teach me?” I asked.</p><p><br>“Well, I was called for that so why not. Let’s start with physical training first. I won’t be able to teach you swordsmanship if you can’t even pick up a sword.”<br><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two months had passed since that day. I trained my physique every day. Twenty chapters of One Piece were drawn and the Shanks I could summon changed too.</p><p><br></p><p>My guess was right.</p><p><br></p><p>What I hadn’t realised was the difference between the strength of the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I had formed a habit of wearing weights and there was a massive problem with those.</p><p><br></p><p>My body could withstand the weight….my furniture couldn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>It made adjusting to normal life very difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn't wear those to school until I got used to them or I would have broken some furniture there too.</p><p><br></p><p>The effect of the One Piece Bloodline and Shanks’ training was showing. The best part in all this was that my Chakra was increasing rapidly due to the increase in my physique.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing happened during this time was that I completed writing Demon Slayer and had Tobi read all of the chapters.</p><p><br></p><p>Two things happened due to this.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the slot being occupied by Demon Slayer slot was vacant again.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, I got two Gacha Tickets.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the second method of earning Gacha Tickets which I had discovered.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already struggling to keep up with so much training from the Naruto and One Piece worlds so I decided to keep the Gacha Tickets and empty slot aside for now. I will roll when I get the C Ranked upgrade which I estimate will be in a year and a half.</p><p><br></p><p>I was dragged by Kiyotsugu and the rest to the Club Room today.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, that idiot had really made an official club known as the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol and even got permission for it. What I didn’t know was how he got my name there.</p><p><br></p><p>I had been concentrating too much on training since that day when we visited Rikuo’s house and due to this, I hadn’t spent much time with them so today, they dragged me with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiro and Yura were not coming today and it was just us at the club.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s done.” We heard the voice of the idiot and went to check what he was doing on his laptop.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is done?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have collected the data about the most number of youkai sightings in the country.” he replied, very happily.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the map and the most number of youkai sightings were reported in Kyoto and Shikoku….as Yura said.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he went on to explain about the game he had created about Youkai and I was too bored to indulge him any longer with his obsessions so I gave an excuse about taking care of Gin and left.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way back home, I passed by a park and noticed some unexpected faces there.</p><p><br></p><p>Yura and Rikuo’s Grandfather.</p><p><br></p><p>What were they doing there?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t disturb them and walked ahead but just as I passed the park, I heard the sound of an explosion which sounded like it came from the park.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly spread my senses and found that there were several dark auras in the park, surrounding Yura and Rikuo’s grandfather.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t run there immediately but instead went inside a nearby building and created a Shadow Clone and transformed it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shadow Clone went to keep an eye on them while my real body left the place.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not going to be seen anywhere near the area.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shadow Clone -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He quickly went to the top of the building and checked the situation down below.</p><p><br></p><p>Yura was fighting a few guys who looked like very bad copies of Michael Jackson. They were using wind to attack her. She was defending with her talismans.</p><p><br></p><p>She suddenly threw a talisman and a large deer appeared. She pushed the old man onto the deer and it flew….directly towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly disguised myself with the nearby wall and watched the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>They landed near me and the deer disappeared, leaving the old man and a….was that a Natto kozo? </p><p><br></p><p>“Supreme Commander. What should we do?” The smaller youkai jumped nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, we look. The girl seems to be quite able. She can handle herself. We on the other hand have something else to take care of.” The old man looked back and said. “Come out. The view from here is quite nice. Don't stand there alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't move.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, do you love that wall that much?” This time he turned towards me directly and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>When I didn't move, he kept staring at the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, seeing no way out of it, I dropped the camouflage.</p><p><br></p><p>And I had learned this from Jiraya with so much trouble. “Ohh, that's a useful trick. You can use it for so many things.” He giggled….eerily similar to Jiraya.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned his back to me and looked down. “Oh! Three Shikigami at once. The girl<em> is</em> talented.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the odd situation and shrugged. Since I was found out either way, better stay and watch.</p><p><br></p><p>Boss wanted information and at the same time to keep his identity a secret. As long as that was not compromised, what does it matter if he is revealed?</p><p><br></p><p>He looked down and she was indeed keeping up with the youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….want to introduce yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly thought of an identity.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Shadow. He who lurks in the shadows to hunt the shadows.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a good thing that he would be able to dispel himself when this is over. Let the boss live with it. And who could blame him? Boss didn't give him a fake identity to use. At least this much was his privilege for putting himself in such dangerous situations.</p><p><br></p><p>“.... Oh. And are you here to hunt me?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no enmity with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Hahahaha I wouldn't want to stress my old bones either. What a relief there.”</p><p><br></p><p>We kept quiet for a moment and looked at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>now that I wouldn’t have stood a chance if that ever came to be.</p><p><br></p><p>He thought of something and opened his mouth to ask. “I….” But paused at the next second?</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes? Do you have any questions? I might be old but this age has brought me some wisdom. Maybe I might be able to help you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the man and pushed through. Since the guy was giving an invitation, who was he to deny?</p><p><br></p><p>“You are Nurarihyon, correct?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, no. Why would you think so?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He spoke nothing after this and looked down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Any more questions?” The old man asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“None if I don’t get truthful answers.” He replied curtly.</p><p><br></p><p>Just at this time, they saw Yura being pushed back by the youkai who then flew towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked as the youkai flew to the top of the building and looked at Nurarihyon, completely ignoring him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sorry to keep you waiting for this long hehehehe.” The guy laughed. “You thought you could escape but you just drove yourself into a corner….Nurarihyon.”<br><br></p><p>The old man just stared at the guy. “Tell me Muchi. Are you the one who killed Hihi?”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just grinned.</p><p><br></p><p>“How regretful. He pledged loyalty to me a long time ago and was one of the Clan’s most respected veterans. We would hang out from time to time, going to cafes for a cup of tea.” The old man shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>Well boss, looks like he got here in the middle of some drama.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just smiled. “He was right. The Nura Clan is so lax. After all, their most high ranking officer was nothing but a weakling! It won’t even take a week to destroy you all.” With that said, he attacked with wind blades.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the old man and he jumped away from the area of impact where the concrete shattered.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man landed on the edge of the building and looked at him. “Could you please lend this old man a hand?”</p><p><br></p><p>He rolled my eyes. “Will you answer some questions from me truthfully if I did so?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man thought for a second and nodded. “I will see what I can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well, that’s better than nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the wind-youkai, who sneered at me. “Oh, another bug here. I didn’t even notice. Well, I can correct that.” With that said, he sent several wind sicles to attack him.</p><p><br></p><p>He easily jumped away and dodged the attacks.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Nurarihyon -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched the kid weave through the attacks with practised ease. It showed that he had trained intensively for this experience.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t expected to find another person in this place and a human at that but this one didn’t seem to be from their side.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the boy, he recalled the description of the person who had saved Rikuo and his friend from the attack a few months ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those attacks are….so predictable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have such a good power. Poisoned wind. Even your raw power is….not bad. And yet your attacks are extremely predictable. Sigh….such a waste.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You!” Muchi was enraged and attacked with large waves of <a href=\"https://wind….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wind….in</a> the wrong direction.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Illusion?</p><p><br></p><p>Did he use some kind of illusion?</p><p><br></p><p>After that the boy looked at him. “Do you want me to finish him off?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I would appreciate it.” He nodded and the boy made hand signs eerily reminiscent of shinobi and brought his fingers before his mouth and breathed a large wave of flames.</p><p><br></p><p>The flames were further boosted by the wind and a tornado of flames enveloped Muchi, taking it out instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy turned towards him. “Now, my question.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stared at me for a moment and then shrugged. “Sure. Go on.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is the cult of Hagoromo Gitsune?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow when the old name suddenly brought forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do you want to know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Personal reasons.” The boy answered curtly but his voice told of his anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….I don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I really don’t know. I haven’t been keeping an eye on them since they dispersed four hundred years ago. I know they are still active somewhere but I don’t know where.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s expression changed, looking frustrated for the first time since the start of the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would suggest that you don’t look for them as you are now.” He suggested. The boy had tried to save Rikuo’s life so this much was something he could do.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy just looked at him stoically and he elaborated. “At your level, you wouldn’t last ten minutes against them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He kept silent and Nurarihyon let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say, how about this. Come to the Nura Clan anytime you want and….beat me. I will find out the whereabouts of the Cult and tell you myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked taken aback at the sudden proposal.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want me to….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Beat me, yes. If you can’t even beat me, how do you expect to go up against the cult of Hagoromo Gitsune?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy laughed. “So you want me to beat the guy who defeated Hagoromo Gitsune….to go after her people. As for going after them unprepared, I am not that foolish. I would only go after them when I am at least at the Ultimate Class level.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow. “I think you are misunderstanding something.” Seeing the boy’s confused look, he continued. “Ultimate Class is a very broad power range. From any local leaders to some lower Gods, all fall under this definition. They can vary from town destroyers to someone capable of taking out multiple prefectures at once and Hagoromo Gitsune….was one of the stronger ones. Even I was only able to win against her due to various circumstances and that too by paying a huge price. Even if you enter Ultimate Class, you would be sending yourself to death if you go after her people. They had several legendary youkai after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy controlled his expression but Nurari could see that he was extremely frustrated so he decided to push a bit more. It would be such a shame to see such talented children die due to their inexperience.</p><p><br></p><p>“You need to be at the very least at the Leader Class to have a chance to go up against all of them.” He knew he was overstating it a lot but whatever stops the boy and keeps him from going to his death. Youkai weren’t known for their truthfulness after all.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s a Leader Class?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s what the leaders of most decent factions and most legendary beings who have their names mentioned in stories across the world are at. You need to be able to destroy a country at the very least. Once you reach that kind of level, you will be able to go up against her cult and live.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked to be in thought and looked at him finally. “And what level am I at right now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….Mid at best from what you have shown me.” He shrugged so he clarified. “After Mid comes High Class at which you are basically a mountain destroyer. Then comes Ultimate Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy nodded. “I see.” Then his eyes narrowed. “Do you mind, if I try my hand against you right now? I want to see how far I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oho, wanna use me as a measuring tape. Don’t you think that’s a bit rude?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s mouth opened lightly and he chided.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kids these days, don’t even know you should bring gifts to someone if you want to ask for a favour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bring me a plate of Kofuku Manju next time you come to fight me….actually bring me three plates. One for this time and two for that time. The price will double each time you come to visit me. What? Fair deal isn’t it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….just that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. You can add some tea if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” The boy nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>What an earnest child.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now come on. Come at me with all you can. Don’t hold back. Believe it, I can take it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy however looked at the stairs and the door to the roof opened revealing the onmyoji girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright! Eh….who are you?” She asked, looking at the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is the one who arrived and helped me.” Nurari quickly covered for the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?” The girl asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy just stared at the girl and Nurari answered instead. “His name is Shadow- He who lurks in the shadows to hunt the shadows.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked like he had too much of the teasing and put a hand on his shoulder. “I’ll take you back to your home.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could say anything, the scene around him moved at a quick pace and he found himself on top of a nearby building and the boy moved back.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is not my home.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy took position a little distance away from him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, kids these days are too impatient.” He too drew his sword and narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shadow Clone -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath but as soon as he blinked his eyes, the figure in front of him disappeared. He instinctively dodged towards the side but there was no change. No attacks, nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he run away?</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he thought this, he heard the sound of footsteps.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked around and found nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Genjutsu!</p><p><br></p><p>Almost instinctively, he pulsed his chakra to dispel the genjutsu bit to no effect.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound of footsteps were still heard.</p><p><br></p><p>He was right there and yet he couldn’t see the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“You cannot see….what you don’t want to see.” The old man’s voice was heard….from all directions.</p><p><br></p><p>The voice continued. “No matter who you are, when you encounter an existence far greater than yourself….the fear begins to take over.”</p><p><br></p><p>He still couldn’t see anything or even sense anything so he decided to go a step further.</p><p><br></p><p>Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Still nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>How?</p><p><br></p><p>The voice went on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your mind loses the ability to notice anything else so….even if you can see….You fail to recognise.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened as he understood the meaning of the words. I tried to sense his aura but I couldn’t sense anything.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly jumped in the air and with a few hand signs, let out a massive fire style jutsu, covering the entire roof of the building.</p><p><br></p><p>As he landed, he didn’t even feel a ripple. The attack missed.</p><p><br></p><p>The voice continued “This is how youkai fight….by overwhelming others with their fear. Fear comes in many forms. This in particular is my power, Nurarihyon’s Meikyo Shisui.”</p><p><br></p><p>WIth that, he felt a cold blade on his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get stronger boy. You have a long way to go.” The illusion disappeared and the man stood in front of him, with a sword drawn to his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and caught the blade. “I will come back in a year. Also….”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“This might sting a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow Clone explosion technique.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man’s eyes widened and he moved away quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>BOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes as I regained the memories of the clone.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting on my couch, I let out a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was that an Ultimate Class? My shadow clone didn’t even last ten minutes against it and the guy wasn’t even serious. Not to mention, Hagoromo Gitsune was stronger than him so her people would be strong too.”</p><p><br></p><p>And here I was thinking I was getting stronger. I looked at my hands and clenched my fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>With that I directly headed to the Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon’s technique was a genjutsu so the best people would be….</p><p><br></p><p>“I can’t help you with that.” The white haired geezer directly denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“But why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is something you have to face yourself. If you face a difficult situation in battle, will you always come to me to ask for help?”</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to say anything but realised his words were correct. The man continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were lucky that the person didn’t intend to kill you. In real life battles, you will have to look at an enemy’s techniques and decipher them with one look and think of a counter against it. Tell me, you couldn’t see him, but couldn’t you set a trap for him? You could have used your strength to destroy the ground and tracked him through the dust in the air.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….filled the whole field with flames but there was not even a ripple.” I countered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then that means he was not on the surface then….where could he be? Either underground or in the air around you. You keep eliminating options and what is left at the end is the right answer but there were other things you could have used. Fuinjutsu. You said you were able to catch his sword, why didn’t you mark it? Your sight or rather your mind was overwhelmed by <em>fear</em> he said, then use your other senses. If you cannot use senses, bait him in a trap. We are shinobi, we don’t fight fair.”</p><p><br></p><p>“….I….my clone didn’t get much chance to do a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Which is understandable. The opponent was vastly superior to you. You did say that your clone wanted to see the difference in your skills. If what you say about his power is true then he would be no less than a tailed beast. Are you dreaming of fighting such beings with just two or three years of training? Go and meditate and get your head straight.” Tobirama Senju scolded me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….am sorry. I just thought his genjutsu was different from anything I had seen. Even my Sharingan wasn’t able to see any difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>A bad look came on his face at the name of Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Sharingan is not all seeing. Even I have devised techniques which it couldn’t see. You shouldn’t rely on it.”</p><p><br></p><p>After that he didn’t say anything and proceeded to beat me up throughout the day, especially using his Bringer-of-Darkness technique to force me to fight without the sense of sight.</p><p><br></p><p>The next day, I decided to summon Itachi and he was the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“The greatest weapon of a shinobi in battle is their mind. Your clone stopped using it and that’s why you lost.” He said as he sat calmly eating pocky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any ideas why  the Sharingan didn’t work?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s something you need to think about yourself. I don’t know how people of your world fight and what things they use so any conjectures I make will be guesswork. Do you want to risk your life on my guesswork?”</p><p><br></p><p>Well, he was not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>At least he wasn’t an ass about it like Tobirama….not wrong, just an ass.</p><p><br></p><p>Next he too proceeded to train me to act on my instinct and hone my senses other than sight as well as force me to acclimate to fighting against enemies who could take away my sense of sight.</p><p><br></p><p>The most annoying mentor regarding this was without a doubt, Shanks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dahahahaha….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you stop it already?” I deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been fifteen minutes since he started laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no. It’s just too funny. You got your ass kicked by an old man dahahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That old man could destroy cities.” I countered.</p><p><br></p><p>“So? You still lost.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>I should have expected this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I think I know what happened to you in that fight.” He said after he stopped laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>He still snickered from time to time.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up at him, expecting another joke but his face was serious instead.</p><p><br></p><p>“What you lacked was spirit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The guy already told you, you couldn’t see because your mind was overwhelmed by fear and refused to see. It’s a protective measure taken by the brain. Understand it this way, when something excessively stressful happens, people often tend to lose consciousness or sometimes even lose the memories of that incident. The brain does it to protect you. A similar thing might have happened. So if you want to solve this problem, it’s simple….just overcome your fear.”</p><p><br></p><p>I considered his words and it made sense.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you thinking?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? I was thinking how you know all these things. You don’t look that smart. Did you hear it from someone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey!”</p><p><br></p><p>I smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. You are my student and it would be a shame if someone said the student of Red Haired Shanks is a coward who gets his ass kicked by old men.” He smirked. “So….let’s train your spirit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How?”</p><p><br></p><p>On this, his spirit turned feral as overwhelming force fell on me.</p><p><br></p><p>Conqueror’s Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>I was so jealous of this.</p><p><br></p><p>I had bought the skill but it turned out to be the potential to use the skill and not the skill itself. I still needed to awaken and learn to use it myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are going to train under stress on your spirit to get used to it.” He said. “From what you have told me, this fear thing is quite similar to Conqueror's Haki. With Conqueror’s Haki, I overwhelm your will to make you lose consciousness. You need to resist this. From today on, you will be training under the pressure of having your will suppressed continuously. Overcome it yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he did exactly that.</p><p><br></p><p>For the rest of the day, I was trained under the influence of Conqueror’s Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>The Training Room not only healed me but also continuously healed the Mentors to keep them at the peak shape which means his Haki never wavered….although I doubted that he would have even let out a bead of sweat in a week, let alone a day.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving, he stopped me for one last piece of advice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Also, fight those youkai as much as you can. Getting used to fear is also necessary for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....dahahahaha and don’t get your ass kicked by old men again.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I came out of the Training Room before he could say anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy had the talent of getting on anyone’s nerves.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san, how much longer do we have to run?” Tobi huffed, trying to keep up behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you can talk, that means you still have energy. We are going to run two more laps.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>I had started training Tobio in basic physical exercise when I got home this week.</p><p><br></p><p>While this town might not be as dangerous as Ukiyo E, we never knew. I didn’t want him to be completely helpless if he encountered any dangerous situation. I want him to at least be able to run.</p><p><br></p><p>To learn the Hinokami Kagura to the complete extent, he needs to train his body or he will just be imitating the dance in a half baked manner.</p><p><br></p><p>This required a lot of physical strength and thus this training.</p><p><br></p><p>I was back home for the weekend and all this week, I was left thinking about the situation with the youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks said I needed to fight the youkai to get used to their fear but….I didn’t want to go beating up just any youkai. From what I have seen, most of them live peacefully with other humans.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the youkai in that town were probably under Nurarihyon and he would be pissed if I went around beating people up willy nilly.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to find the type of youkai who harmed humans.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, how do I do that?</p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san….I….I can’t.” I heard Tobi’s voice and looked back to see him sitting on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. We will slowly increase the distance. You did good on the first day.” I let go of Gin’s chain and picked Tobi up on my back and began running.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Be quiet. I still need to complete my run.”</p><p><br></p><p>We came back home an hour later and Tobi collapsed on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>“You both look like you worked very hard today.” Grandma said, as I washed up and came out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Woof!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, I apologise. You three worked very hard today.” She corrected herself at Gin’s protest.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma brought our food out for us and I relaxed as I took a bit out of my favourite okonomiyaki.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this time is something I cannot imagine myself without.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been thinking too much about the youkai and the cult and not concentrating on this time with my family.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to correct that.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobi was too tired so he went to take a rest after eating and only grandma and I were left in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, Koji-kun will be coming in a while. He said he wanted to bring some documents for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….yes. I guess it should be about the sales of the newest volume of the manga.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. That’s good. You did seem a bit worried these days.” She said, taking a seat beside me and I looked at her, surprised. “I thought there was some problem with your work.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a breath. <a href=\"https://“No….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“No….no</a>. There is no problem with my work. In fact, it’s going all too well.”</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t lying.</p><p><br></p><p>My manga had reached the one million mark and that's probably why Koji-san was coming to visit me.</p><p><br></p><p>Only 1.5 million volumes more and I could get the C Ranked upgrade.</p><p><br></p><p>That will probably help increase my strength by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“There you go making that face again. Is something the matter, Tatsu?” She patted my head and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma knew about the supernatural. Should I ask her?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to trouble her as she had left that life behind here. It was one of my reasons for going to Ukiyo E town to keep her away.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you worried about, Tatsu?” She asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandma.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I saw….youkai.”</p><p><br></p><p>She became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you hurt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....no.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….how do we even know if there is a youkai or any other supernatural being nearby?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked forward towards the wall. “Hmm….that bit requires practice. Are you sure you want to do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….was just worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>She caressed my hair. “It’s understandable to be afraid. Youkai are beings who instinctively invoke fear in humans. Your fear just proves you are human.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait here.” She said as she got up and went to her room and came out after a while with a box and placed it in front of me. Opening it, she revealed several books.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Some books on buddhist magic and chants and onmyoji arts.” She answered as she looked for something. “The reason I was exiled from the Himejima Clan was because I chose to learn magic not belonging to the Clan.” She explained as she found a book and slowly dusted it off.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” I asked, shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Principal Clans are deeply rooted in their ways. Over the years, it has changed from tradition to obsession. Now they view anything foreign not as an opportunity to learn but….as a threat to themself….and thus do whatever they can to remove it and distance themselves from it.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me. “Here.” She gave me the books. “Read them. If you don’t understand anything, you can ask me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gaining means to protect yourself is not a bad thing, Tatsu. I would have taught Tobi about this too but that child has his own way.” She said looking off in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” I asked, confused. “What’s wrong with Tobi?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is nothing wrong with Tobi. He is just chosen by someone which will ensure that his life is always….eventful.” She didn’t explain anything clearly but I was getting worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it dangerous?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. If anything, it is one of the greatest means of protection one can ask for. It’s others that he might attract that can become dangerous to him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it grandma?” I asked again but she just smiled and patted my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry about that. You will understand everything when the time comes. You two brothers should just stick to each other. As for these books, keep these a secret between us.” She smiled. “I know you want to keep your training a secret from everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>I froze while she just chuckled. “Come on, Tatsu. I am your grandmother. Do you think I wouldn’t notice the changes in my own grandson?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t want to worry us.” She completed it before I could. “But you should understand that you are <em>not</em> worrying us. Helping each other is what family does.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded, a bit ashamed for trying to keep everything a secret. Then again, how could I explain all this?</p><p><br></p><p>“We all have our secrets, Tatsu. It’s not a crime to keep a few for yourself.” She said as she sat beside me. “What you must never do is let these secrets become a barrier between you and your loved ones. Just don’t lose yourself in it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I won’t.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know.”</p><p><br></p><p>I put my head on her shoulder and rested.</p><p><br></p><p>Gin was feeling left out so he came and sat near our leg, making both of us smile.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was sitting on the roof, eating bento with the rest of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Training Camp at your house, Nura?” Kiyotsugu asked and even I was surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>It was completely unlike something Rikuo would do.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am thinking of inviting everyone to a training camp at my house this weekend.” He smiled and I looked at him curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….have to go back to my home on the weekends. I am sorry, I might not be able to join you guys.” I made an excuse for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Oh man….that sucks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, what was up with Yura? I saw she was all bandaged up. How did she get hurt?” I asked, changing the topic. In fact, I was curious too. She wasn’t that hurt in that fight so how did she get hurt all of a sudden?</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you have asked the correct person. It turns out that Miss Keikain was attacked by youkai.” Kiyotsugu said excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh come on, we don’t know that.” Rikuo tried to change the topic but this time I listened to Kiyotsugu who continued enthusiastically.</p><p><br></p><p>He went on to explain the several incidents that had happened over the weekend in the town. “I am sure it was all caused by Youkai.” He exclaimed….and seeing Rikuo’s reaction and remembering the incident from that day, I was inclined to believe.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should clarify it with Yura first.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will go and check if Yura is fine. I haven’t been able to talk to her today.” I said as I got up and began to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, I will come too. I want to invite her to the Training Camp as well. I don’t want her to think she was left out.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two of us found Yura and Rikuo invited her but she denied saying she had some research to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I accompanied her and asked her about her wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was it a….youkai?” I asked but she kept quiet. “I am sorry. That was insensitive of me. I was just wondering if the rumours about all the incidents in the town being caused by youkai were true?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is. There is something very wrong going on with this town and….I am going to find out what.” She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think the youkai of this town attacked you?” I asked, surprised. I didn’t think Nurarihyon would do something like that, especially Rikuo.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, she shook her head. “No. It was someone else. I think they were from outside the town. The Shikoku youkai, to be precise. The one who attacked me was a fire type youkai who looked like a chicken human. They were probably the seven phantom travellers of Shikoku.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are they dangerous?” I asked, fishing for more information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very dangerous. They are known to regularly hunt humans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I see. Thank you, Yura. If you need anything, be sure to ask for help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” She bowed slightly before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shikoku Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew exactly whom to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>This weekend, I stayed back giving an excuse about going on a training camp with my friends.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, I was sitting and studying the books grandma had given me.</p><p><br></p><p>It contained basic mediation styles which involved chanting different verses or mantras to facilitate sensing the supernatural energies around me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was just getting started so I still relied on my Aura Sensing for this purpose. In the box Grandma had given me, there were also bracelets made of beads which help hide my aura.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma made them specifically for me so that I could keep myself hidden from general youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently my strong life force was attractive to youkai and dangerous supernatural beings and would put me in danger if I didn’t know how to hide it.</p><p><br></p><p>I was using the basic chakra suppressing method nowadays but the beads worked better.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope my Shadow Clone will return with good results this time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rikuo Nura -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Master Rikuo, we have found some traces of the attackers. They are at the Water purification plant.” Kappa informed him.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked back at his friends playing in the house and then at Kappa and nodded. “Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, he quickly changed into his youkai form.</p><p><br></p><p>They quickly left the place and headed to the water purification plant only to find a strange scene there.</p><p><br></p><p>On one side was a member of the Shikoku youkai, the water youkai, Gangi Kozo and on the other side was a hooded figure who seemed like a human boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them were standing on water and facing each other.</p><p><br></p><p>As they came nearer the hooded figure looked at them. “Is he one of yours?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head. “No. He’s an intruder. Who are you?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, where are my manners? My name is Shadow- He who lurks in the shadows to hunt the shadows.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow! Where is my grandfather? He was last seen with you.” He quickly asked. He had been searching for this guy since Yura informed him about his grandfather’s encounter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your grandfather?” He asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Supreme Leader of the Nura Clan, Nurarihyon.” Rikuo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nurarihyon? Wait, you are….Rikuo Nura. You look a bit….different.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my youkai form.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....oh. I see. As for Nurarihyon, I don’t know. I left after our spar. Wasn’t he home?” The boy asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo observed him closely and shook his head. “No. He hasn’t been seen since then.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked in thought. “Then he must have gone somewhere. Don’t worry. That old man is very strong.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know that already. He’s my grandfather.” He scoffed. “So….I guess I should thank you for saving my counterpart’s life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was merely passing by.” The boy said off handedly, his attention still concentrated on the youkai before him. He asked. “Tell me. Are you the ones who are attacking and killing humans in the town?”</p><p><br></p><p>Gangi kozo looked taken aback by the question but grinned. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?”<br><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you doing that? Did they harm you first? Were you retaliating, protecting yourself?” The boy asked, evenly. </p><p><br></p><p>“Reason? Hahahaha why would youkai need reasons to attack humans? We do so to collect fear, to attain the true place of the youkai, as the rulers of the land, unlike fakes like them.” Gangi Kozo pointed towards him. “Under the rule of the Shikoku youkai and Tamazuki, we will take over this town and turn it into a place to harvest fear for youkai.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” The boy then looked towards them. “Do you mind if I take this one?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo stared at the boy and shrugged. “All yours. Kappa, step back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kakakakaka you….human….you want to fight <a href=\"https://me….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">me….in</a> this place?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy drew his sword. “That is exactly my intention.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then DIE!” Gangi Kozo controlled the water under their feet into arrows and shot them towards….the side?</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo narrowed his eyes and watched the fool maniacally laughing while shooting water arrows around the boy, never once attacking him while the boy slowly walked forward, drawing his sword.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood in front of the youkai and with one slash, the youkai was bifurcated and so was the water behind the youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow…..” He heard Kappa exclaim softly.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy had separated the entire pool of water behind him with that slash as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I overdid it a bit.” The boy whispered. “Still….this <a href=\"https://was….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was….no</a> good.” He then looked at them. “Are the rest of his teammates strong?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo looked at the boy unsurely and asked. “Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….it’s like this….I am looking for strong youkai to fight, to know what kind of fear they use but I don’t want to kill them without any reason. These people however have given me a reason to do so. They have hurt someone close to me. I think that’s a good enough reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you are going to kill them all?” Rikuo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy just stared at him for a few seconds. “Then what would you do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If they are willing to change, they should be given a chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. That is indeed a kind way of looking at things. A naive but kind way. Then answer me this, Rikuo Nura….what of the people they will hurt if you let them go? They are the people of your territory? I don’t know the rules of the youkai but I would assume that you have some kind of duty to protect them. Then what of those people?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will save them all.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy smiled. “Put your hand on your heart and tell me….do you truly believe you can do that, save every person in this territory after letting them go? Have none of your people died yet?”</p><p><br></p><p>The question struck a blow to his heart and the faces of few people who had passed away emerged in front of his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because I am pretty sure Nurarihyon was talking about some Hihi guy with the youkai who attacked us. That guy was apparently the one who killed him and wanted to kill Nurarihyon too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I finished him off too. He was….disappointing.” The boy sighed. “You are the leader of your faction. Your decisions affect not only you but all the people you lead. I have heard of a saying and maybe it will help you. ‘A wise king never seeks out war, but he must always be ready for it.’ Goodbye, Rikuo Nura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait!” He called out to the figure but he was already gone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Should we follow him, Master Rikuo?” Kappa asked?</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. “No. We have to return back home. My friends will be looking for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kappa nodded and they headed towards their home although his mind was full of thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shadow Clone -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He ran away, avoiding any questions from them</p><p><br></p><p>That was Rikuo?</p><p><br></p><p>Holy shit, he looked different.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, not only did he look different, he even felt he had a different personality….although not completely. There was still a hint of kindness in him. The guy who was always trying to protect his friends from getting hurt due to their foolishness.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, he sensed Yura looking at them from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>It was turning out to be a gathering of friends he was trying to avoid at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, that youkai was a miss.</p><p><br></p><p>Using basic water arrows and water whips like that was not even good enough to be a decent C Ranked jutsu, let alone a challenge for him.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why he didn’t waste his chakra on the fool and used his sword. Although it seems that even with that, he overdid it.</p><p><br></p><p>The boss needs to fight some normal people once in a while….to know how much strength to use against them.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he was passing by, he sensed an attack and dodged only for the place he was at to get drowned in a wave of flames.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked back to see the figure in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Was that a chicken?</p><p><br></p><p>It had the head of a chicken but the body of a man.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, these things just keep getting worse.</p><p><br></p><p>It took him a moment to realise that this was the youkai, Yura had described as the one who had attacked her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You! You killed Gangi Kozo!” It roared….chirped….what was that even called?</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure did. He was kinda weak.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bastard! I, Inuhōō, will avenge my comrade.” It shouted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Inuhōō -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It shot waves of flames towards the bastard who had killed Gangi Kozo. </p><p><br></p><p>The human dodged across the place, even waving his sword but wasn’t able to do anything to Inuhōō in the air. It took advantage to use his full power, and drown the entire area in flames, not leaving any place for him to dodge.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, all that was left was a charred up body.</p><p><br></p><p>Inuhōō didn’t stop there. It went ahead and picked it up. It needed something to satiate Tamazuki’s rage when he was informed about the news about Gangi Kozo.</p><p><br></p><p>It headed right to the building they were using as their base and threw the corpse in front of the rest of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this, Inuhōō?” Tamazuki asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tamazuki….I….I am sorry, I couldn’t save Gangi Kozo. He was killed….but I was able to avenge him. This is the corpse of the guy who killed him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said pointing towards the guy as he kneeled in front of Tamazuki, hoping that his punishment wouldn’t be too harsh.</p><p><br></p><p>“What corpse?” Tamazuki asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Inuhōō turned back….or tried to but found that its head was not responding. The next second, he felt the scene in front of him started spinning round before everything fell dark.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shadow Clone -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He spread his senses to check the whole area.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire building was crawling with hundreds of youkai, especially the lower floors.</p><p><br></p><p>So this was the base they were using to hide.</p><p><br></p><p>Aerial warfare was not his strong point. Maybe if he learned the Six Navy techniques or got some good Devil Fruit or learned the Tsuchikage’s technique or got the Rinnegan, but all of these were distant dreams. For now, he could only use other tactics.</p><p><br></p><p>So he decided to use what Tobirama had taught him. Eliminate options and the one he was left with was the answer and that answer was….Genjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why he used a genjutsu on the phoenix wannabe chicken who to his surprise didn’t kill him but rather carried him to this place.</p><p><br></p><p>He too wanted to know where it was carrying him. There was always the danger of it just clenching its claws hard and he would pop but there was a chance that he could discover more information about them and his bet was correct.</p><p><br></p><p>The boss would probably be happy to know where they were all staying.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the youkai were taken aback by the murder of their member and took defensive stances.</p><p><br></p><p>All that was left was to fight and collect as much information as he could on them….and see how many of them he could kill.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very interesting. A human….dares to come face all of us and even kill one of the seven phantom travellers in front of us? I am curious, why did you decide that. Are you truly unafraid?” The guy they called Tamazuki asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was completely confident that he was completely in control of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Best way to get a reading on someone….get them angry.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are the leader of these circus clowns, nerd? To be honest, I was searching for strong youkai to fight….but you lot don’t look like much. Then again, I should have expected as much from a group where even chickens can become officers.” He smirked, looking at them, and taking all their movements in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bastard!” The giant in the group shouted and came forward, attacking directly.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes were already in the Sharingan mode and he used a Genjutsu on the giant, making him target the smallest round-faced youkai while his hands moved in a flurry, preparing for the next jutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>They were all taken aback by the giant suddenly turning and punching the round-faced youkai, launching it directly out of the building.</p><p><br></p><p>In that moment of hesitation, he used fire style fire dragon jutsu and blasted the woman who was trying to attack him using her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>“Inugami, take him down!” The nerd shouted as he drew a sword of his own.</p><p><br></p><p>My aura sensors went haywire as soon as that sword came out.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like a severely damaged katana with several cracks and a broken edge. If I had to compare it to something, it reminded me of Kenpachi Zaraki’s sword which looked like it would fall apart at any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>What told me otherwise however was the sheer aura the blade was giving off.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt far worse than any of the youkai present here. In fact, it was far stronger than all the youkai here….combined.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly several feathers came cutting the flames and a dismembered ghastly dog’s head came roaring towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>He took his stance.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun Breathing First Form: Dance</p><p><br></p><p>He sliced through the head of the dog which gave him sight resistance but was cleanly cut through with a single slash.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, he used Replacement Jutsu to change his place with some debris in the area. Using a Genjutsu to make it look like him and hide his movements in case they were capable of seeing his speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Several black feathers attacked his new position.</p><p><br></p><p>Second Form: Clear Blue Sky.</p><p><br></p><p>He knocked away the feathers and then put the giant in a genjutsu to make him attack the nerd leader of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>What surprised him however was the fact that the nerd actually used that woman as a shield to take the blow of the giant and then stabbed the giant through the eye. The strangest thing however was that the blade’s aura seemed to have gotten stronger after that.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, he sensed a dangerous aura from behind him and dodged.</p><p><br></p><p>The dog head he had sliced a second ago had somehow completely healed and was attacking him again.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time, the nerd slashed the sword and sent a wave of red energy towards him and more black feathers attacked him again.</p><p><br></p><p>Fourth Form: Burning Bones: Summer Sun.</p><p><br></p><p>He spun around, cutting the attacks and at the same time destroying the floor of the building they were fighting in.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack from the red aura was heavy and the nerd seemed like he was transforming into something else.
