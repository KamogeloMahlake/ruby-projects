    "content": "<p>I wanted to leave training, but not immediately. I needed to make sure that the training worked perfectly first. </p><p>And, as an added benefit, Kim took several photos showing how hard I was working, triggering a social media fight about our chances — particularly successful since it not only galvanized our fans, but also the fans of the opponent.</p><p>The additional Intent was certainly useful. </p><p>I stayed with Coach Juana and the team for two hours, helping the team to practice — particularly the new quarterbacks — while making sure every single player would listen to her words perfectly.</p><p>A dose of Intimidation, coupled with the warning that I would be watching from the cameras, was enough to warn them. </p><p>Of course, under normal conditions, the cameras were impossible to watch from outside to prevent other teams from hacking, but handling that was easy even before the Traits increase due to living streaming my car repair session. </p><p>And, just like the traits I received from Chess helped my football career, particularly the Design Trait, Electronics also helped significantly, especially with the hardware part. </p><p>A little play, and I had real-time access to the feed, a brand new security measures installed with several failsafe that I came up with on the spot — which I doubted to be useful, but I implemented more as a practice.</p><p>Having permanent control of the stadium was rather useful.</p><p>Things had reached a satisfactory degree, and I didn’t have much fear of the upcoming chess match. </p><p>Unfortunately, while each of those two events was disasters that would keep others occupied without anything, for me, they consisted only of the less important portion. </p><p>I still had my guide, shadow assassins that targeted me, and upcoming darkness… As well as several other supernatural that would no doubt rear their heads. </p><p>It was I had a pile of small stones in the driver seat, and I was channeling some of the Intent I was receiving, doing my best to copy the attack I pulled against the shadows, crushing them under the resulting pressure. </p><p>The first stone took over a minute to crack, which didn’t surprise me in the slightest. The shadows had given me a much weaker impression, and damaging them was the magical equivalent of popping a balloon, the slightest attack sufficient. </p><p>In comparison, breaking the stone was a much more challenging affair. I repeated the trick a  few times, putting most of my focus on the intent that was flowing, while trying to rely on Pattern Recognition and Perception to give me a better sense of what was going on.</p><p>It worked, but not as I expected. Suddenly, the whole structure of the rock appeared in my mind, like I had used several high-class scientific tools to create the perfect hologram, and spent hours studying it. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured as I thought as I grabbed another stone, flooding it with Intent without focusing on Perception, and, a minute later, it shattered. Another stone while focusing on Intent, and once again, I generated that insight. </p><p>I played with the stones repeatedly as I drove, wasting some of the Intent I gathered, which might have annoyed me if it wasn’t for the flood I was receiving. The upcoming football game already provided a significant portion.</p><p>Yet, our dear sports director and dean decided to help me even more by aggressively advertising the upcoming chess tournament very aggressively, to the point of setting up live screens at several points across the school. </p><p>Giving an unprecedented focus to chess. </p><p>People weren’t idiots, and more than one realized that it was about the scandal — but that only made the arguments around it even more intense. Even the people that were trying to defend me only intensified the argument further. </p><p>If I lost after such a spectacle, it would be enough to destroy my popularity. It wouldn’t be fair, of course, but I doubted there was any celebrity in the world that would actually claim that fame had anything to do with fairness. </p><p>It was always a fickle mistress... </p><p>Yet, I cared more about the contribution it was making to my Intent flow rather than the risk it represented. Against the potential that was represented by them, a little risk was nothing. Such a  generous step allowed me to feed the System and Experiment at the same time. </p><p>When I pulled in front of my dorm, I decided to move on to the next stage of my experiments. I grabbed a piece of stone, and flooded with Intent once more. Only this time, I chose to focus on Strength rather than Perception. </p><p>The results were spectacular enough that I was glad that I didn’t do it in my car — or near anyone’s car. </p><p>The stone not only shattered easily, but also it exploded outward, fast enough to sink into the trunk of the nearest tree.  “Nasty,” I murmured as I examined the results, shivering. If the explosion wasn’t directional, I would have been testing the effectiveness of my Recovery as well. </p><p>Maybe I should be more careful while experimenting. </p><p>“I wonder if I can find anything about magic in the net,” I murmured as I climbed the stairs, only to chuckle when I realized the absurdity of my question. Finding something about magic was not a challenge, not with all the new-age witches, cults, seers, not to mention people who took games way too seriously, enough to create real-looking materials just for fun. </p><p>Finding something was not a challenge. Identifying something useful, on the other hand… </p><p>I was wondering whether I could improve my little web crawler enough to actually be useful, when I received an alert on my phone. </p><p>One that warned me about unauthorized access to the computer systems of the Stadium. “I didn’t expect you to come useful that quickly,” I murmured as I turned on my computer, quickly typing a few commands to see which computer was responsible for it. </p><p>Only for that attempt to fail. No computer that was currently connected to the Stadium intranet was currently active, which was suspicious. </p><p>Curious, I turned on my security cameras, only for them to fail to find the culprit. Every single camera was working, but none of them showed anyone near the computers. </p><p>I noticed my first discrepancy when I checked the field itself, only to notice several players missing, and the rest taking a break. A frown appeared on my face as I took note of the missing players, and most of them were new players.</p><p>Annoyingly, their disappearance made sense, as they were not used to heavy practice. They would either be in the medical wing, icing their bruises, or in the bathroom, trying to hide just how exhausted they had been. </p><p>Locations that lacked security cameras to protect the privacy of the players. A sensible measure under normal circumstances, but it left me questioning who was responsible. My mind already went to Arthur, whose appearance was suspicious enough, and I started searching for him.</p><p>He walked out of the bathroom, lazily dusting his shoulder like nothing was out of the ordinary. He didn’t have the attitude of someone that had been poking around to steal our tactics. However, after the little discrepancy in his reports and his suspicious date of appearance, I decided to poke around a bit more. </p><p>First, I rewound the recording, watching the moment he went into the bathroom, fifteen minutes ago. A long time, especially since he wasn’t showing any kind of discomfort. More importantly, I noticed a small, concealed bag in his hand, one that wasn’t with him when he left.</p><p>And, the first breach happened five minutes after he had gone into the bathroom. With the dust on his body, I realized the trick he pulled, and a little digital check confirmed it. </p><p>He had drilled through the walls to create hidden physical access, then a device was connected to the intranet, and it somehow managed to stay invisible and bypass the firewall easily. </p><p>A technology that I didn’t expect to be used against college football. If it wasn’t for my new security measures, it would have gone without notice, and even with them, I was only able to catch their footprints. </p><p>“Am I the one that underestimates the level of competition, or I somehow underestimated just how much money Coach Spencer was willing to sink in.” </p><p>Luckily, I was able to catch which files they accessed, which gave me a chance to determine it. If they were more focused on me and Coach Juana, it was likely Spencer trying to find dirt, and if they were focusing on the tactical archives, it would be our upcoming opponent. </p><p>After five minutes of furious typing, I managed to find what I was searching for, but that left me with more questions. He wasn’t trying to access any camera records or possible dirt on me, nor he was trying to access tactical records. </p><p>He was trying to access the recorded assessment records. Which, under normal circumstances, could be about strategic espionage. </p><p>But every single player report he had targeted didn’t belong to players that had left with Coach Bill. </p><p>Not what I expected.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t the only one that noticed the sudden change, as more than one phone rang on the sidelines, distracting the players. “Take five and rest,” I shouted, giving them a chance to focus. “But make sure don’t say anything too aggressive in any platform no matter who goads you. We are already suffering from a lack of players, and we don’t want anyone receiving unnecessary bans.” </p><p>“What’s going on?” Marcus asked, realizing the situation. </p><p>“Let’s just say the dean is learning that supporting an idiot unconditionally is not for free,” I said, and walked away. </p><p>Still, as I walked away, I threw one last glance at Arthur. The timing of the transfer was not suspicious, and even the potential discrepancy in the reports shouldn’t be suspicious. </p><p>After all, he wouldn’t be the only student that pulled some strings to gain a fake-athletic scholarship for admission. Ironically, I might have written it off as another glorious sample of nepotism and bribery if it wasn’t for one fact. </p><p>He actually had sufficient ability to gain admission without trickery. </p><p>I took a note to dig deeper, but not right now. I had more important things to address first, such as the growing crisis — I wanted to feel resentment at the necessity, but considering I was the architect, it would hardly be fair. </p><p>I found the girls in the main conference room, which was normally dedicated to the coaches. Megan sat in the corner, typing furiously with a focus that surprised me, not even noticing my approach, while barking occasional orders at Kim, who was busy on the phone. </p><p>And, Coach Juana was on the phone, nodding with a smirk. “I understand, sir,” she said occasionally, making it easy to guess who she was talking to.</p><p>The Dean. </p><p>I gestured for her to mute for a bit, and she did. “How’s it going?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, he’s furious, and he threatened me a dozen times already,” she said. </p><p>“You’re recording the call, right?” I said. She just nodded with a smirk, showing that she had that handled. And, considering some of the words the dean was using, I guessed that he didn’t factor that in. </p><p>I might have felt slightly bad against a nicer man, but against him, that was hardly an option. “Is there anything else I need to address —“ I started to ask, when my phone rang. I checked the caller, ready to turn it off, only to realize it was the Director of Sports. </p><p>I turned on the call recorder before answering the call. “How can I help you, sir?” I said. </p><p>“Oh, Terry, how are you,” he answered, with an annoyingly saccharine voice that set my teeth to the edge. </p><p>“As well as I could be, after losing a valuable member of the Coaching team Coach Spencer, sir,” I said, not bothering to hide my mocking tone even as I used my Taunting ability. </p><p>“Yes, it’s bad news, isn’t it,” he said, his forced cheer immediately replaced by barely-restrained anger. To his credit, barely restrained was still restrained. “Anyway, I have decided to arrange a beautiful event that would allow us to manage this horrible disaster. Check the link I sent you.” </p><p>I did so without bothering to answer, and met with a hastily put-together paper.</p><p>One that was declaring a friendly chess match before the football game with our dear rivals. </p><p>A classical chess game.</p><p>“I’m guessing my attendance is mandatory,” I said. </p><p>“Of course not,” he answered with a vindictive chuckle. “Since you are busy with the football team, we understand if you’re busy enough not to attend it.” </p><p>I had to admit, his plan was not bad, especially since it took only a few minutes for him to come up with it. I either go and join the tournament, wasting critical time that was needed for the upcoming match. </p><p>Or, I rejected it, and the tournament happened without me. Ordinarily, a chess tournament wouldn’t matter, but at this point, that had turned into a part of my reputation, and skipping a tournament would reflect badly.</p><p>Especially if they advertise the tournament as much as I expected them to hype it. </p><p>And, the last dagger was the fact that it was a classical tournament only, with no blitz portion, not only making sure it would waste a great deal of time, but also confronting me at my weakest.</p><p>They were clearly determined to destroy my reputation. </p><p>I almost felt bad for him that this clever strategy was dead under the boost of my Traits. </p><p>“I … I don’t think I can reject it, sir,” I said with a trembling voice. It wasn’t a particularly good example of acting, but talking through the phone allowed it to be relatively convincing against someone that was sure of their success. “How does the schedule looks like?” </p><p>“We have a meet and greet today at six, and the real tournament is half-day Friday, and full-day Saturday,” he said gleefully. “And make sure you attend them, we arranged some fun events for it as well.” </p><p>“I - I will be there,” I stammered. A little overacting, enough to earn a dubious glare from the girls, but I managed to hold back my chuckles until the call ended. </p><p>“What’s going on,” Megan asked. </p><p>“Nothing much, just some more work for you,” I said as I forwarded the announcements. </p><p>“A last-minute chess tournament. Isn’t that a bit, irregular?” she asked. </p><p>“Oh, very, which means that either our Dean is pulling some strings, or our dear coach is still afraid of failure,” I said. </p><p>“You can win, right?” she asked, which I answered with a nod. It was enough for them considering their limited knowledge of chess, with little knowledge of the distinction between blitz and classical chess. </p><p>“How about the training schedule,” Coach Juana intercepted as she checked the schedule. “Even if you win, you won’t be able to attend the meetings.” </p><p>“Worst comes to worst, I’ll somehow handle it, but no need to alarm yet. I have a way to cut the time short.” </p><p>“What?” Kim asked.</p><p>“That’s a surprise,” I said with a widening smirk. “Let’s just say you two need to be on standby during the event to make some noise, maybe even arrange a few people.” </p><p>“Should we start already?” she asked. </p><p>“No, not yet. I have the feeling that the school would do its best to exaggerate the event. They need to cover up their current scandal, and what better way to humiliate me very publicly.” </p><p>I didn’t need to check the social media to know that, not when the intent flow I was receiving had increased already, people’s anger at the scandal replacing the earlier pity. </p><p>Megan frowned. “But you said that you would win easily.” </p><p>“Yes, but does that  mean they know that fact?” It earned another set of raised eyebrows. “Hey, they gave me a partial scholarship, and I gave them a partial champion. More than fair, right?” I explained. “It’s not like I could make a fortune through chess.” </p><p>It wasn’t true, but it was passable enough to be convincing. </p><p>“Now, before I go to that meet, I have some things to prepare,” I said as I pulled on a laptop, and started drawing a detailed practice schedule for every single player, their strengths, weaknesses, the roles they would play…</p><p>And the most urgent technical deficiencies they need to be dealing with. </p><p>“That’s a detailed breakdown for a quick session,” Juana said. “Are you sure that they are all accurate?” </p><p>“Enough to make a bet on it,” I said. </p><p>“And the imbalance of the tactics,” she added. “What kind of tactics we can put with such a broken skillset,” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. “A crazy one, of course,” I said. “With what we have, we don’t have any other options.” </p><p>Unless I figure out how to empower people. Though, if worst came to worst, I would just awaken my guide and ask her to intervene.  After all, she needed the Intent the games provided as much as I did. </p><p>Maybe even more than I did, depending on what awaited her if the darkness she mentioned would actually return. </p><p>In any case, I trusted my ability to change the game in unexpected ways even if things had worked worse than I expected, so I focused on drawing a few trick-play examples for Juana. </p><p>“A-are you sure,” she stammered in shock. “These plays are crazy.” </p><p>“Crazy enough to work?” I asked with a chuckle. </p><p>“Maybe … No, they are just crazy,” she gasped as she looked at me, though I could see that she was already wavering. </p><p>Not that it mattered much. At this point, changing her mind was not an option. “Let’s go and see the players,” I offered. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked the corridors, I was whistling calmly. A part of it was about the relaxation granted by the fun dalliance with Kim, but another part was about my guide, once again back to her stand-by position. </p><p>It was good to see that, despite her attitude change, her shyness stayed a constant, easily allowing me to goad her back to her place — a place where she had the ability to distinguish the passage of time. </p><p>And, even better, since she wasn’t trying to recover from what was, for all intents of purposes, debilitating exhaustion, she wasn’t sucking the Intent that was being generated, allowing me to channel much more easily.</p><p>It was a pity that the flow itself was pathetic at the moment, with most people’s feelings of awe and jealousy replaced by pity — an emotion that was clearly weak enough to properly fuel the system. </p><p>Luckily, there were only a few days until the match, which would give me an opportunity to flip the situation once more — something I wanted to do before dealing with that professor once more, with a reach strong enough to make that arrogant asshole back off. </p><p>“Nice,” I murmured when I arrived at the field once again, and saw every single quarterback hopeful studying passionately, which was more than I expected. I had expected to find at least half of them slacking off, bored trying to memorize the plays, but they kept their attention. </p><p>I had underestimated their passion, I thought as I walked toward them. “It’s time for the test, boys,” I said, only to see every one of them flinch at my voice. </p><p>Maybe it wasn’t the passion I had underestimated, but the degree of fear and respect they felt toward me, was enough to trigger their study habits. If that was the case, I was very glad. </p><p>“Are you ready for the test,” I said.</p><p>“Yes, coach,” they answered in one voice, which confirmed that it was the mixture of Leadership and Intimidation that was working wonders  — helped by the spectacular story of growth I presented, of course. </p><p>“Good, we don’t have time to waste. Everyone, grab a  pile of paper, and a pen, and spread it around. It’s time to see just how much you have managed to learn.” </p><p>They nodded before following my request, and spread along, distant from each other to prevent copying, none of them willing to help the competition. “The test is simple. I’m going to call a play, and you’re going to draw it on the paper as  accurately as possible, both the formation and the receiver routes.” </p><p>A few of them already had signs of panic growing on their faces, tempting me to just fail them. “T-the full play,” muttered one of them, showing just how badly his confidence was going, tempting me even further.</p><p>But it wouldn’t be nice for their morale if I unilaterally failed them after forcing them to study for a full hour. Instead, I gave them a chance. </p><p>“Draw the offensive scheme, B-fifteen,” I said.  Half of the pens stayed frozen, while the other half moved immediately. </p><p>The play itself was a singleback formation, which was one of the more popular passing formations that spread out the receivers in a tight formation, though it still left enough strategic space for some running plays, mostly relying on the threat of the receivers to create space. </p><p>It was mostly used for pass plays, which was why I called for B-fifteen, which was a tricky running play, relying on the confusing structure to push forward through the right side, aiming to gain around five yards under ideal circumstances. </p><p>I waited for thirty seconds before I called. “Enough, flip it,” I called, calling the stop. They stopped writing as they flipped their clipboards, letting my gaze at their ploys. </p><p>“Not as horrible as I feared,” I muttered as I gazed toward the plays. Every single one of them had drawn the singleback layout correctly, which was better than I expected. Unfortunately, flawless success was limited to that. </p><p>Three of them had already drawn pass plays, mistaking it for other, more common variants. The other seven were drawn more accurately, but for none of them, the details were perfect. They have either blown the assignment of the protections of the offensive line, or mistaken in the assignments of the receivers. </p><p>Still, two of them distinguished themselves enough by accurately drawing the core aspects. </p><p>“F-twenty-two,” I called, this time a variation of the double-wing passing play. I had picked that deliberately, because, unlike the earlier formation, double-wing passing offensive layouts were famous for their complicated nature. Since it was a symmetrical formation, it could be used to attack any side easily, requiring a very careful understanding of the assignment. </p><p>It was a good passing play to use in a variety of situations because it combined short and long crossing routes. Yet, it was complicated for that exact reason, with the outside receiver and tight end running cross routes, while other receivers running sharp go and out routes. </p><p>To my pleasant surprise , the two managed to draw the play with reasonable accuracy. Not perfectly, but with enough accuracy to show that they had understood the concept.</p><p>Interestingly, not both of them belonged to the practice squad. One of them had been a part of it, and if I was remembering perfectly, actually playing the center of the offensive line — which gave him a great advantage in knowing the plays, as centers had to study almost as much as the quarterbacks. </p><p>Still, the fact that he had done it as a practice squad player was certainly a good sign. The more he knew, the less he needed to memorize. </p><p>The interesting player was the other one, able to learn much more accurately than the center, a performance that I didn’t expect to see. And, even a glance was enough to confirm that he had the physique of a runner. </p><p>I trusted my abilities to read him accurately during the earlier practice, which confirmed he was fast enough to compete for a starter receiver position. Interesting enough to take note to research him.</p><p>I wouldn’t put it above Spencer to send another practice squad player to join the team, just to pull him away at the last minute to make sure everything was ruined. </p><p>I had given them five more plays, enough to make sure I was confident in my assignment. “You three, stay,” I said as I pointed at the three of them. Normally, it would have been enough to keep the center and the newcomer, but I chose to keep a practice-squad running back as well despite the poor performance. </p><p>A part of it was the potential for the trick plays that could be used to confuse them, but a bigger part of it was to have backups against the potential problems. </p><p>“Now, I want you three to line up and throw passes,” I called, followed by assigning a group of receivers to them as well, and outlining a simple cycle of passes, based on a variety of short, mid, and long passes. </p><p>I wasn’t very hopeful, particularly on the long passes, but it was better to test their capabilities directly. And, while they were distracted by the plays, I started going through their files.</p><p>The first file I had gone through was George, the center. The reports showed that his physical capabilities were impressive, but he didn’t have the speed or the agility to match them. Yet, I could see that his passing performance was surprisingly well, especially in short passes, though his medium-range passes were passable as well. </p><p>After digging a bit, I saw the reason. He played quarterback in middle school and part of high school, until the growth spurt hit him and he had reached a significant degree. </p><p>In comparison, the running back I had picked, Tristan, was putting a performance that could only be described as middling, barely able to hit a part of the short passes, not enough to be even the backups, though, combined with his ability to run, it should be enough for a couple trick plays. </p><p>Which had the potential to be interesting, especially if I used him and George and Tristan at the same time, making them confused about which one was playing the Quarterback, and which one was the running back. </p><p>Admittedly, such trick plays were not used often, mostly because they had a high chance of going badly, therefore most coaches avoided them, not wanting to look like idiots.  </p><p>I certainly didn’t want to look like an idiot as well, but unfortunately, the material in hand was limited, forcing me on the riskier path. Hopefully, my tactical acumen would be enough to twist the tide. </p><p>Only then, I had turned my attention to my newest, and most promising player. Arthur. His file showed that he wasn’t just new to the team,  but to the college as well. The date of joining was Monday, right after Coach Bill’s departure, but before that mess with Spencer began. </p><p>Still, considering the transfer would require several days to be processed,  it should be normal. I started going through the documents about his transfer, which included reports from his coaches, both high school and college. </p><p>I was just looking for the best way to leverage his skills, but as I read the reports, something started to niggle at me. </p><p>The style of writing, I realized after I had read several reports. It wasn’t the handwriting — as they were typed — and the signatures on the scans were different. </p><p>Yet, the reports were suspiciously similar in terms of sentence structure and the choice of words. Even worse, the similarity was subtle enough that I doubted I would have caught it without Pattern Recognition enhancing my capabilities. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured. “Especially when combined with the timing.” I was considering the merits of confronting him directly and letting it slide, when a sudden flare of Intent distracted me. </p><p>One that followed immediately with my phone starting to buzz with endless notifications. </p><p>I had a feeling that our documentary just went online.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Nancy’s growl of frustration was beautiful, especially, even in the midst of her anger, she didn’t bring her gaze away from the great show we were creating. I expected Penny to tease her about that, but a glance was enough to confirm that she was watching us, hypnotized by the view on the screen of the phone as she continued to record. </p><p>Poor Luara, still bent over the table as I pumped into her from behind, blushed even more under the combination of the pleasure and the fact that she was being watched by two other people. “No need to be shy,” I said, unable to keep my chuckle back as I spanked her ass. “They are your coworkers, after all.” </p><p>I didn’t bother mentioning that they had gone through a similar experience, as their current state of dress — or lack of it — more or less confirmed that fact. </p><p>I might not use sex as a condition, but it certainly didn’t mean I would turn it down if the opportunity presented itself. </p><p>“R-right,” Laura managed to gasp as I picked up speed, her ass, and thighs jiggling with each thrust as her body moved back and forth, the sturdy table creaking under our weight. Nancy looked frustrated as she turned and walked back to the bedroom, but I didn’t miss the fact that she left the door open, or the fact that she deliberately sat in a place she could watch the show. </p><p>Since she wanted to watch that show, I decided to give her a proper one. I picked up even more speed. Laura grabbed the edge of the table, her grip tight as she tried to resist the invasion of pleasure, but her moans exploded soon after. </p><p>She was lucky that the room she arranged for was a top-grade one, her tits sliding back and forth over the smooth surface of the table easily, making it a more comfortable experience for her than it otherwise would have been. </p><p>Penny walked around us, bending, leaning, and otherwise moving to pick the best angles like she was an experienced cameraman, still doing her best to record the show. I wasn’t a director, but there was enough overlap between our jobs for me to know that the angles and the distance she picked up were rather terrible. </p><p>Still, seeing the beautiful enthusiasm on her face, I said nothing. Admittedly, it might also have a slight relation to the way her naked bosom was swaying as she pushed herself into difficult angles. </p><p>Watching her buxom beauty as she walked around, unaware of the show she was creating — though whether she would care considering the mood she was in was another question. </p><p>I continued to slam into Laura when a gasp rang in the room, one that didn’t come from Laura. It was Nancy, who was currently sucking her finger, looking angrily at the needle she dropped on the floor. </p><p>“You need to pay more attention to your job rather than watching us, needles are no joke,” I said as I caught her gaze. </p><p>“Shut up,” Nancy answered, trying to look angry to hide her shame, though her anger was quick to turn genuine when she realized Penny started recording her instead. The growl she let out as she stood up was beautiful, enough to make Penny take a fearful step back, but rather than meeting with her, she just slammed the door close loudly. </p><p>“That’s Nancy,” I said with a chuckle to Laura, who was busy moaning as the climax drove nearer, slowly losing her ability to pay attention to her surroundings, even Nancy’s fiery display barely noticeable to her. That didn’t stop me from explaining of course. “She has a tendency to act prickly, but don’t worry, that’s all for show.” </p><p>“Definitely,” Penny commented with a chuckle, clearly still satisfied by the trick she had pulled the night before.</p><p>“I … see,” Laura murmured, but only after I spanked her ass to prompt an answer, her tone suggesting she has not fully comprehended the question she had been asked. </p><p>Not that it was a problem for me in the first place. </p><p>I could help but chuckle as I continued, not bothering her more, leaving her free to grunt and moan. As I rammed, Penny walked closer, the camera still pointing at Laura to record her daze, but when she walked close enough to fall into my reach, I grabbed and pulled her to me, capturing her lips in a searing kiss. </p><p>She deserved a reward after her success in warming up the brunette beauty moaning under me. </p><p>Soon, Laura tightened, her dazed moan suggesting that she had already reached the edge, so much that, if I continued to push her without letting her relax, I would risk her turning useless for the upcoming shoot for Nancy’s book and my own work. </p><p>Luckily, pulling out of Laura didn’t mean that I needed to stop. “Lay on the table, next to her,” I ordered Penny as I grabbed the phone off her hands — planning to ignore the crack that was going across the screen, a crack that wasn’t there when I had given her the phone.</p><p>Her sudden naughty blush even as she hopped on the table and spread her legs changed my mind. I didn’t care about the phone, but I cared about the fact that she assumed I was blind enough to miss it. I slapped her breast, enjoying the echo it created. “Such a clumsy model I have,” I said as she let out a sound that was a perfect mixture of a moan and a cry, one that was recorded by the phone I continued to hold. </p><p>I didn’t waste much time before sliding inside her, and she let out a pure moan to follow her earlier one, tainted by a dash of pain. One that was followed by several others as she threw her head back, her back arching beautifully, making me slightly annoyed that I was just using a phone to record the show. </p><p>After the extended foreplay, her insides were slippery enough not to provide the slightest resistance as I invaded her core again and again mercilessly, my free hand alternating between slapping her breasts, swaying with each thrust, and her nipples, getting harder and harder with each push. </p><p>Her legs soon wrapped around my waist, imprisoning me inside despite my upcoming explosion, not that I had any intention of pulling back. Penny was mine, and I had no problem marking that ownership in a more primal manner. </p><p>Soon, Laura managed to stand up, her gaze filled with astonishment and arousal as she watched the show that was happening inches away from her. “How about some payback,” I said as I passed the phone to Laura, whose smile widened even more as she grabbed the phone. </p><p>I grabbed Penny’s hips with both hands for increased leverage, and started slamming with a dangerous vigor, hard enough to shake the sturdy table underneath us, which was certainly not designed for the purpose we were leveraging it for. </p><p>As I rammed, her tits shook beautifully, each thrust exploding louder and louder. Despite that, her legs got tighter and tighter around me, guiding me inside her. </p><p>I would have loved to say that time and space lost all meaning as I rammed her for hours, but my body had limits, especially since I had been already challenged by the brunette beauty that was currently busy recording us, not to mention the amazing show I received preceding that. </p><p>Luckily, I was not the only one suffering from overestimation, and Penny tightened in a very familiar manner before I could surrender, her tightness reaching a phenomenal level as I exploded inside her… </p><p>Penny moaned deliriously as I pulled out, but before I could say anything, Nancy stepped out, already wearing her costume and wig while she carried the impromptu one in her hand, her expression not exactly charitable as she glanced at the situation on the table. </p><p>“So, that was a nice warm-up,” I said as I pulled the phone off Laura’s fingers even as I wrapped my arm around her waist, and pulled her down. “Why don’t you be a nice girl and put on the costume Nancy brought in, so we can start the real work,” I said, enjoying the shocked expression on her face, especially when I whispered the numeration she would receive as a result, especially if she was willing to travel weekly for regular photoshoots. </p><p>Yet, it was nothing compared to the unsteady look she gained when I whispered a second number into her ear, one to make her an exclusive model for my new agency. </p><p>She was barely able to mutter a rapid yes before dashing forward and grabbing the costume in Nancy’s hand and starting to change. </p><p>Nancy looked at me, trying to look angrily, but considering she just succeeded in her lifelong dream to be a successful writer, years in advance — albeit through some dubious marketing campaigns — her anger was not exactly strong as well. </p><p>Unfortunately, our next task was a long, grueling photoshoot rather than a proper, lengthy celebration orgy for success, one that missed the usual teasing tricks I embedded. </p><p>Playing was fun, but I was experienced enough to know that working hard was a part of life as well. The shoot lasted for full eight hours — extending the room was nothing with the cash influx we received —  creating an impressive number of pictures, some to be used for the official campaign, some to be offered on the official platform, but almost none for my private stash, which would have been a pity if the warm-up exercises resulted in some very treasured moments. </p><p>And, after eight hours of the uninterrupted shoot, where both girls worked alternatively as a model and an assistant, the trip back lacked the excitement of the first trip. Exhausted by the grueling combination of work and explosive fun, the girls were quick to collapse, sleeping cutely even though we closed in the distance. </p><p>It was already midnight when I dropped Penny at her home and went back to my fun residence. </p><p>All around, an amazing day of victory… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“What an excellent idea,” I said, doing my best to hide the fact that Laura wasn’t the only one that was feeling nervous at the suggestion. </p><p>Penny had many good qualities, but unfortunately, a good balance was not one of them. I still remembered the small string of disasters she created during our first mission, when she tried to help me set up a temporary studio in her living room, only to create considerable chaos in the process. </p><p>“But use this,” I said as I passed my phone to her. “The camera is running low, and I need to charge it.” I wasn’t entirely confident as I gave her my phone as well, especially after seeing her trembling fingers, but it was better than risking my camera. The phone was both harder to break, and easier to replace. </p><p>I didn’t ask her to use her own phone, because I didn’t trust her to leak them. Not intentionally, certainly, but it was for the best to be on the safe side when dealing with Penny. </p><p>The short walk between my bag and the plug gave everyone some time to process the next step. Penny slowly overcame the effects of her recent climax enough to stand up on her feet, displaying her amazing curves freely. It allowed me to put a new plan on how to handle Laura, to teach her that her earlier aggression was not free. </p><p>Laura decided to use that little time panicking about what was to come, her brown eyes widening beautifully as she realized her earlier moves, done in a momentary excitement, were more dangerous than she realized at the moment, escalating the situation with no benefit to her other than momentary satisfaction. </p><p>Her gaze, locked to my midsection as I walked back to her, my robe a poor barrier to hide my raging arousal, showed her the exact risk she was dealing with. </p><p>As I closed in the distance, I expected her to open her mouth and ask me to stop, but Penny chose to speak at that moment. “We can stop if you can’t handle working,” Penny said, her tone gleefully smug, clearly hoping that Laura would fail to take that step. </p><p>“Nonsense,” Laura answered, showing that Penny wasn’t the only one that was fueled by vindictiveness. She even put her hands on her waist as she said so, displaying her body perfectly. </p><p>Penny just smirked as she took a step, closing the distance. “Let’s see if you can handle it,” she said as she grabbed the strings of Laura’s bottom, and pulled them free. It would have been a charismatic move if doing so didn’t send my phone away flying, but the floor was luckily covered with a thick, decadent carpet, preventing it from breaking. “Sorry,” Penny said, her blush cute.</p><p>“Not a problem, sweetie,” I said, but I was certainly glad that it was my phone that she flung away. Even with the recent windfall, I doubted I would react well if it was my camera that experienced that unfortunate experience. </p><p>Laura chuckled derisively as she watched Penny dashing back to pick up the phone, which died halfway as she felt me hugging her from behind. </p><p>With nothing in between our bodies, I removed my robe while she was busy paying attention to other objects. </p><p>“M-maybe—“ she started, only for her words to die as I pressed my finger to her lips. A touch daring, I had to admit, but not as daring as my shaft lodged between her tight asscheeks. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. Don’t change your mind on things that we already agreed upon,” I said. While nowhere in our discussion we had discussed that I would be naked as well, I had no problem blurring the lines a bit. </p><p>And with Penny returning, already taking pictures with her camera, Laura failed to clarify that point as well. And then, I used my hands to help her cover, one on her breasts, the other between her legs, the resulting moan enough to prevent her words. </p><p>A touch excessive, maybe. Entirely deserved, certainly. </p><p>“Try not to look so shocked, it looks horrible,” Penny commented as she continued to take photos, showing that her surprising modeling talent certainly didn’t carry over backstage. </p><p>“She’s right,” I whispered to Laura’s ear as my hips moved, rubbing against her ass. “You need to be ready to take if you’re ready to dish out,” I whispered, teasing her much more than I had been initially planning to, even after she had shown her naked pictures as audition photos. “Being my exclusive model is not an easy job.” </p><p>Fingering one of my favorite models — not the most favorite yet, as Penny was yet to take that position from Nicole — in front of me was certainly an interesting move. </p><p>I let my fingers dance over her surprisingly tight body, suggesting that a busy exercise regimen was a constant part of her attempts to be an actress, my fingers finding her nipples, twisting, and teasing. </p><p>“Exclusive model?” she whispered, her voice shocked. “Really?” </p><p>Yesterday, it would have been a cruel statement, but considering the great amount of cash I had received and the urgent need to find new models to further leverage that popularity, it was just a reality. </p><p>And I would certainly prefer to build my business over exclusivity agreements both in terms of the models and terms of the client. It was the way to build a proper business, even though it often came with lengthy legal battles. </p><p>“As long as you’re hard-working enough,” I said. I wasn’t trying to use any kind of innuendo, and was just trying to say that I was actually very demanding when it came to real business aspects. </p><p>Laura clearly misunderstood what I was trying to say, a fact that I realized when she pulled her hips away, only to grab my shaft before pushing herself back, enveloping me inside her warmth. </p><p>“Is this —“ she gasped, interrupted by a moan as her wetness strained around my shaft, “hard-working enough?” </p><p>I just chuckled even as I put one of my hands over her hips, while I grabbed her hair with the other, pushing her against the nearest surface, which was the dining table. “Let’s see if you’re hard-working enough,” I said as I pushed deeper into her, entering her core properly. </p><p>“I am,” she gasped, but the intensity of the pleasure in her tone suggested that it might be something more primal than her dreams of becoming an actress, the unfamiliar situation enhancing her arousal to a ridiculous degree. </p><p>It might have been an interesting discussion, but as I invaded her core aggressively, her ability to speak was temporarily lost, her mouth occupied by a loud string of moans, one that made me glad that the penthouse suite came with a very impressive autistic insulation. </p><p>Insulation that didn’t work just as well between the rooms, as evidenced by the sight of Nancy bursting out, carrying a modified bed cover in front of her, the only thing she had to hide her still naked body.  </p><p>“Really?” she growled as she looked at me, bending Laura over the dining table. “Again?” </p><p>I chuckled as I caught her gaze, anger, and jealousy created a beautiful mixture. “Well, you’re not the only model I work with that enjoys a proper warm-up,” I answered as I picked up speed. “By the way, this is Laura.” </p><p>“Yes, I can see her,” she answered drolly, while Penny didn’t even acknowledge her presence as she moved around us — though, considering she was just holding her finger on the screen, it suggested that she started recording the show. </p><p>“Don’t be rude and say hi,” I said to Laura as I slapped her ass, the clap echoing in the room. Penny’s satisfied smirk was understandable considering their earlier scuffle, but Nancy had an even bigger one, considering the anal adventure of the night before only intensified her rough edge. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. She had earned herself a lot of leeway after accidentally giving me the flicker I needed to trigger my career’s resurrection, to blaze even stronger than before. </p><p>“H-hi, I’m Laura,” she managed to say, though, between moans, it took three attempts to utter that beautiful sentence. </p><p>Nancy just nodded before turning toward me. “How long you’re going to … warm up?” she asked. </p><p>“Have you finished with the costume?” I countered. </p><p>“Almost, maybe five more minutes,” she answered doing her best to keep her gaze on my face. Her forced casualness might trick the girls, but I could see that it was just posturing, trying to act superior. </p><p>“Good, I’ll speed up then,” I said as I picked up speed, only for Laura to tighten even more, signaling she was not exactly far away from a climax. “Assuming she could last for that much,” I added with a chuckle…</p>",

    "content": "<p>As that new fragment of Divine Spark floated in the trunk of the tree, dancing against the rest, yet to be sublimed —  which wasn’t surprising considering how little Spark the tree contained originally — my first reflex was to check the crystallized Divine Spark of the mage, expecting him to sacrifice a portion of it. </p><p>Only to see it completely intact. </p><p>“Can worship actually create Divine Spark,” I thought with fascination. I was shocked, though I had to admit, it wasn’t supposed to be that shocking. After all, gods were obsessed with worship, and assuming that it was just about pure ego with absolutely no benefit had been prejudicial. </p><p>In my defense, I neither had a direct interaction with god. The closest had been the headmistress, and she had shown no inclination of organizing such a thing — admittedly, her problem never had been finding enough Divine Spark, but controlling what she had in possession. </p><p>And, that was assuming such a thing was possible with the System greedily devouring anything in the first place.</p><p>While I was lost in my thoughts, the spark continued to dance in the soul-equivalent presence of the tree, conflicting against the Divine Spark, even causing some damage — that I  repaired without significant side effects — showing that, a worship ceremony was not exactly something simple. </p><p>I continued to observe them, and fifteen minutes later, another flicker of divine Spark joined the first. The amount of newly acquired Divine Spark was almost as much as the seed originally had — thought it was less about the great efficiency of the ritual, and more about how little Divine Spark the seed had contained in the first place.</p><p>I could have helped the tree to absorb the Divine Spark, which would have been much more easier than actually repairing the damage, but I waited, wanting to see if the elves had the ability to detect it. To this aim, I didn’t even let it crystallize into a safer state, but forced it to stay moving. </p><p>The elves continued their ritual-dance, unaware of the danger that was brewing at the target of their worship. Fifteen minutes later, another sliver joined the mixture, this time intense enough to fight against the tree. </p><p>The elves started to look exhausted, which was not just a physical failure or mana deficiency but something different, showing that the ritual was not a trivial affair. </p><p>I continued to observe them, but my attention was on Divine Spark, examining its nature. As the amount of Divine Spark grew, I started to realize that its structure was more chaotic than all other Spark I had touched. </p><p>Every other spark I had touched — which wasn’t a great list, but still included the headmistress, the princess, and most recently, the guardian tree — had been, for the lack of a better term, pure. </p><p>Sharp. </p><p>Even when I used my Tantric abilities to purify it to destroy their hardness, it only stripped that intent further, turning it into something soft and pure. </p><p>In comparison, the one that was provided by the elves was chaotic and without direction. It still had the same general essence of Nature, but there were differences to it, like two different artists, drawing a picture from some description. No matter how well they practiced before, they couldn’t just put their halves and create one flawless picture. </p><p>Only in this case, there were multiple artists with slightly differing visions, their creations conflicting despite the spell around them — which was affecting their mental state, allowing them to focus on the same thing. </p><p>Elves continued, unaware of the risk, which confirmed that they had no idea of the risk they were creating. Their ritual would have created no problem for the other guardian trees, which had enough Divine Spark to sublimate the little amount their worship had generated. </p><p>They had no idea my tree was cheating. </p><p>Luckily, my cheating was not limited to just transforming mana. I was experienced in helping others sublimate Divine Spark. I pulled the amount they generated, and after some processing, I let the tree absorb all of it. </p><p>Enhancing its godhood, not that the mana it could generate had the slightest significance against what I was providing at the moment. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the elves, trying to understand how they could generate Divine Spark. I spread my mana to the immediate surroundings, which would have been a very alarming affair if it wasn’t for two things. They were distracted by their ritual…</p><p>And that mana was coming from their guardian tree, therefore absolutely trustworthy. </p><p>Yet, even with such a thing, I had little progress with the source. I poked, pulled, and occasionally detonated my magic, but all was useless. I even checked the Aether Dimension, but with nothing out of ordinary. </p><p>Well, not technically useless, I corrected, as it gave me one very important conclusion. Whatever was going on, it was certainly not mana, pure or transformed. </p><p>Sometimes, eliminating the possibilities was as important as finding the clues of the correct path. </p><p>Still, I wasn’t discouraged. I enjoyed delving deep into the mysteries of magic and existence, and the importance of the topic only made me more interested. My mind was already filled with different experiments I  could conduct…</p><p>Only to be distracted by a warning from one of the wards upstream. </p><p>The undead really had terrible timing. </p><p>Elves proved that they weren’t a slouch in detection, by discovering the undead barely a minute after, their sentry barking in alarm. The ritual stopped, which was unfortunate as I would never say no to more Divine Spark, especially, for all intents and purposes, it looked like it was being generated from the thin air. </p><p>My first real discovery about the source. </p><p>The elf mage replicated his attempt to cast the spell again, and once again, I used that to create another protective layer around the tree. It surprised him more than his first attempt, showing that he expected their ritual to work. </p><p>Maybe it worked like taming an animal, feeding them to make it calmer. If that was, it was a pity that it wouldn’t work. </p><p>He attempted it twice more, but the warriors around him started to act restless. One of them said something sharply, and the mage responded with anger. It didn’t take long for it to turn into a heated argument, showing the apparent control of the mage wasn’t as strong as it had implied. </p><p>Elves might be a mystical race, a part of the stories, but their reaction to danger had been refreshingly ordinary. A pointless battle for power among a few, while the rest watched ineffectively, risking their lives with inaction, yet unable to intervene directly. </p><p>I examined the archer that started to battle, and noticed a few differences. For once, his bow was different. Not just more intricate, but also in a different style, giving me the impression that it was created by a different expert. </p><p>And he had a dagger, wooden just like the others, but with a large, intricate emerald on its hilt — with no hint of magical energy, suggesting more of a status symbol. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact elves had just given me the key to continuing growing stronger, I wouldn’t have cared much about anything other than aggravating the undead. After all, after I had destroyed more and more undead while disguising my actions, the higher-up of elves would inevitably join. </p><p>Yet, after their performance of generating Divine Spark, I changed my mind about keeping them as incidental participants. I needed to impress them more. </p><p>“Sorry, old man,” I murmured as I stretched a tantric-filled mana string to the mage, and invaded his crystallized Divine Spark, taking half of it before he could realize it, and transferring it to myself. With the mage distracted, and without the System constantly trying to devour every free particle, it was very easy to succeed. </p><p>I had to admit, I felt slightly guilty at doing so, but under the circumstances, a lot more than a slight guilt was necessary to keep me from acting. </p><p>I created another fake soul space to prevent interaction between two fake Chosen Nodes. I had no idea how they would react, but remember the first time I tried to mix different-natured mana, I had no intention to test it casually. </p><p>The amount of Divine Spark I had taken was not significant for me, but it was still significantly more than what the tree had. And, more importantly, converting the mana directly was much easier than letting the tree do it — not because I was more efficient while using the same mana, but because it helped me to control the results. </p><p>And, I used the resulting mana to feed the tree directly. Just like that, its growth, which had been stunted due to the instinctive priorities of the tree, picked up speed once more. </p><p>Thirty feet turned fifty, which, in seconds reached sixty, then seventy…</p><p>I expected the elves to watch in shock, their argument was forgotten, but, against my expectation, it got more intense the faster the tree grew. And, even more surprisingly, it was the mage that was getting more subdued, while the archer started to act brazen, a smug smile on his face. </p><p>I was prepared to intervene when the mage admitted defeat and started walking, only to be surprised when he moved in the opposite direction I expected, followed by most of the archers. Rather than retreating, they started establishing a defensive perimeter, while the archer stood in the middle, smug. </p><p>Then, he gestured to two archers, and talked with them quickly, his attitude implying a certain amount of authority — though not a welcome one, if the stiff attitude of the other two told. </p><p>Their stiff attitude didn’t prevent them from listening to his orders, and one of them took running, following the river, directly toward the encampment I had just seen. Yet, the other was more interesting. He took the dagger with the emerald the other presented, and took running. </p><p>Toward a different direction, confirming that I had misunderstood the nature of their argument. </p><p>“A happy misunderstanding,” I thought with a smirk, continuing to feed the tree with forcibly converted mana  — with a speed that was getting exhausting — while the mage and the remaining others worked hard to create a defensive position. </p><p>The mage spread some seeds and cast a spell, which immediately turned into a thick wall of vegetation. He didn’t show any hint of noticing his loss of ability, which was to be expected considering he was using the generous amount of nature-life mana that was filling the opening rather than trying to do it on his own. </p><p>They worked hard to establish the position, with archers taking position all along the new wall, the tree continuing to grow behind them. </p><p>When the undead finally appeared over the horizon, the tree had already broken the height of a hundred feet, radiating an aura of security…</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was quick to move back to my cave at the warning of the wards, and even took down the ward that was protecting the tree from the necrotic energy. At this point, it was strong enough to handle the radiating necrotic energy with my assistance — especially since I didn’t place it right next to the river, but put in some distance, limiting the impact of the constant flow of necrotic mana. </p><p>Unlike undead, I knew little about elves, and it was better for me to stay concealed, with no sign of my presence at the surface, rather than testing the limits of their detection. </p><p>Luckily, not only I had warded my cave greatly, but also, as the tree grew, one of the roots reached the cave, allowing me to continue feeding it with mana while staying hidden. I watched from my hidden spot, assisted by several wards, as several cloaked figures arrived at the opening I had chosen as my hidden spot. </p><p>Admittedly, I was annoyed with the development. Based on the aggressive expansion of the undead and the defensive state of the undead, I expected the undead to arrive first. I had stayed close to the territory of the elves, because I hoped that the signs of battle would be the thing that received their attention.</p><p>Their aggressive scouting surprised me. </p><p>As they got closer, I realized that it was a small party of four, each armed with bows and arrows — and I noticed that none of the arrows had fletching, and the arrowhead was just the thickness of the branch that had been used as well. They looked grown rather than crafted.</p><p>It was a comment at a distance, but I felt rather accurate in my expectation. </p><p>I didn’t have the slightest idea of their language, but their shocked cries weren’t particularly difficult to decipher, nor their heated gestures as the group split into two, pointing between the tree and their encampment. </p><p>In the end, three of them stayed with the tree, tense, with their bows raised as they looked in the upstream direction, while the last one rushed back with great speed. Their reaction was not too surprising, making sure the news was delivered safely was important, but defending the sudden appearance of another guardian tree was clearly more important for them.</p><p>And, as I watched the elves, I realized that I might have misunderstood the importance of the guardian trees, even after what I had watched them in the battle. The battle itself was chaotic, with many things to focus on, but the current circumstances were much safer. </p><p>Enough for me to observe the elves more in detail. At the first glance, they were not too different than humans, but then I noticed them absorbing the nature-life energy that was radiating off the trees. </p><p>At first, I thought that they were preparing to cast the spell, but then I realized it was a passive, one-way absorption, eerily similar to breathing, implying a certain level of dependence on the guardian trees — though, I had no idea whether it was something of a luxury like a good dessert, or something truly vital like water. </p><p>I needed to observe more — preferably with more invasive methods than secret tendrils of mana — to make a definitive conclusion, which caused me to temporarily abandon that track, focusing on feeding the tree. </p><p>And, in response, it continued growing, the amount of nature-life mana getting more and more significant. When elves returned fifteen minutes later — this time as a group of twenty — the tree already gained another foot of height, with a corresponding increase in the mana that it constantly radiated. </p><p>I turned my attention to the elves. Out of the twenty, nineteen of them were archers, dressed in similar garbs, with the signs of battle still in their bodies. However, one of them was considerably different. </p><p>A man, wearing a different cloak, carrying a staff, its robe carrying several silver inscriptions that looked completely alien to my gaze. I didn’t need to feel the mana gathering around him, following his commands to detect that he was a mage. </p><p>I still used my detection capabilities to examine him. After all the times I had practiced that particular trick, examining others’ soul spaces, it was one trick I was truly confident in applying, easily invading his being before he could notice. </p><p>I noticed a great difference between him and the other elves immediately. A crystallized piece of Divine Spark, almost exactly like the Light Node the headmistress had created for me and Titania, though made of Nature Spark rather than Light Spark. </p><p>Still, the amount was small. Not as small as the minuscule amount the fruit I had stolen had been carrying, but still smaller than the tree had been carrying. It was enough to allow him to transform some mana, but I didn’t want to imagine just how long or exhausting such a process would have been. </p><p>I might have wondered why he hadn’t been a part of the earlier battle, but his face, etched with exhaustion, told me the story. The way he stumbled toward the tree just further confirmed the extent of it. </p><p>One of the archers approached to help, only to be dismissed with a harsh bark. </p><p>Interesting, but not as interesting as the ward that he started creating … or growing, I corrected myself, because the way he cast his spell was significantly different than anything I had seen, even when I included Janelor’s tricks.</p><p>Instead of using the mana to create a node and surround it with an outline and building the additional nodes one by one, he created — for the lack of a better term — a seed, and started gently supporting it with the nature-life mana the was supplying, and the ward started to grow slowly, just like the tree itself did under my assistance. </p><p>An interesting casting strategy, and one, in certain aspects, could probably generate a lot of advantages, but the disadvantages were equally clear. It was impossible to use it in any kind of direct confrontation. </p><p>Maybe his exhaustion wasn’t the only reason he wasn’t a direct part of the battle. </p><p>Another disadvantage was the lack of control during its growth phase. I had the ability to subtly break and take control of other wards as well — a skill I had applied against a great number of enemies. And while I could imagine such a different ward would have been harder to interfere with than a similarly-powered ordinary ward, the exact opposite was true while in the growth phase. </p><p>Making it trivial for me to intervene while keeping myself hidden. </p><p>I didn’t have the ability to transform nature-life mana directly, but with the tree helpfully providing a lot to me, all I needed to do was to gather some from the air and form it into the exact shape of the tendrils the tree had been extending into the astral dimension, and change the shape of the ward. </p><p>Just like that, the ward had changed shape. The initial intention was to create a protective layer around the roots. After seeing their other attempts, it was clear that they wanted to uproot the tree and bring it back to their encampment. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t trust myself to stay hidden as they brought it along. And even if I was confident, I had no intention of traveling to an area firmly under their control. So, under my intervention, the protection ward changed shape, and turned into an ordinary defensive ward that would protect the roots. </p><p>The protection such a ward would offer compared to anything I could create was negligible, but it didn’t mean that it was worthless. It created another layer to hide my intervention when they tried to dig around for my intervention. </p><p>An intervention I expected. After all, he was a mage — a terrible one, but a mage nonetheless — and it was only natural for him to start digging around why his ordinary spell had failed. </p><p>But his reaction proved that I might have misunderstood the extent of their difference. He cast another spell, but, rather than for it to travel down underground to explore the ward he had cast, it wrapped around the tree, then, connected to every single elf around the tree.</p><p>He barked another order, and all elves — except two of them that continued to guard — gathered around the tree, and started some kind of ritual, reminding me of an elegant dance, yet extremely serious. </p><p>I expected some kind of mana pattern to appear around them, ready to break it up, expecting them to use a more forceful method to move the tree. I was prepared to redirect their clumsy spell, or even break it directly if necessary. </p><p>I didn’t want the bait I had worked so hard to establish to be broken. </p><p>No spell appeared even as their ritual continued to build up, which surprised me. I expected them to charge a stronger spell, but then I realized there was no excess mana for that. </p><p>With nothing to do, I split my attention between observing them and feeding the tree, waiting for the undead to arrive and finally interrupting them. </p><p>Yet, it was not the undead that interrupted me first, but a flare in the depths of the tree. A flicker of Divine Spark. </p><p>My first reflex was to blast every single elf into pieces. Who were they, daring to try to steal the Divine Spark under my control, just because I didn’t let them move it.</p><p>I pushed my mana into the tree, ready to pull that flicker of Spark back, only to realize the Divine Spark of the tree was still intact, and it was an additional flicker. </p><p>How intriguing.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "title": "Darion's Office 3",
    "content": "<p>Darion first glanced around, making sure the office didn’t have any security cameras. He didn’t expect it to have, as very few owners actually did so, but there was no harm to be safe.</p><p>The room was clean.  </p><p>“Now, let’s find those ledgers,” he murmured as he looked around once more, this time trying to find the most convenient place to hide any financial documents in the outdated form. “Who uses paper…” he murmured in dismissal. </p><p>Especially since it was so easy to find, he noted as he noticed the large cabinet leaning against a wall had several scratches in front of it, far more than it would take in such a casual room. </p><p>Darion let a wide smirk invade his face as he pulled it forward, only to find a huge file hidden behind. “Jackpot,” he murmured in amusement as he grabbed the file, putting them on top, intending to take a few photos to record before putting them back. </p><p>He didn’t plan to confront his new boss. He just wanted to have it for the future. </p><p>Before he could do it, however, he heard the door open. He expected that it was his new boss to return, which would have accelerated his plan. Not a disaster, but it was never fun to adjust the plans, no matter how trivial. </p><p>“What are you doing?” a voice said, one that was familiar, yet different than what he expected. </p><p>Maybe he didn’t need to adjust his plans. </p><p>He turned toward the door, only to see the secretary moving closer, her beautiful face contorted in panic, and not annoyance. The distinction was important. Annoyance would have meant she didn’t know what was in the files. </p><p>Panic meant that she does. </p><p>He cut her off, amused by the shock appearing on her face as he did so, and she registered the difference in size once more. “What are you doing!” she warned in anger. </p><p>“What am I doing? Cleaning like just the boss lady wanted, until I found some misplaced files,” Darion answered calmly, curious just how far she would push. </p><p>“She can’t—“ she started, only to stop halfway as she registered her words, realizing that she might reveal more than he knew — or should have known — if she talked more. “Even if she ordered to tidy up, that does mean a general cleaning. Not a deep cleaning, in case the client comes. Now, put the files back in their place, and continue with the other places.” </p><p>“Really, that’s an interesting place to place some files.” </p><p>“What would a criminal know. It’s just a way to keep the confidential files secure,” she stated. “Now, let me go and I can make sure if anything was out of order.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, since they looked important, I made sure nothing would happen to them. I have already made a digital copy of them,” Darion answered, letting his smirk widen as he said so. </p><p>“You did what!” she gasped in fear as she tried to pass, only to bounce off him again. After all, she was not a superhero, and anger didn’t make her suddenly power up or move faster. As always, he loved the fact that he was tall enough to hover above anyone else. “They are confidential company documents, you can’t touch them.” </p><p>He certainly enjoyed the unease it caused on the smug secretary that treated him like garbage. </p><p>“Really,” he said mockingly. “And here I am, willing to bet that they are just some financial report. But maybe I had misread them. What do I know? I’m just a dirty prisoner.”</p><p>“N-no, you’re a productive member of the society,” she said.</p><p>“Of course I am,” Darion said, mock-affronted. “And I’m doing my best to show how good of a worker I am by digitally backing up every file in case they are important. I’m sure that’s even a part of my official work description.” </p><p> “Why can’t you act like a criminal and laze around,” she murmured like I wouldn’t hear, showing that she had some anger problems as well. </p><p>Darion chuckled, looking at her. “Well, after prison, I find myself filled with energy. I think I will continue recording them unless I can find something to distract me.” </p><p>“Like what—“ she started as she raised her gaze, only for Darion to capture her lips in a searing kiss, his tongue invading her mouth, silencing her excellently. </p><p>He expected a rough slap, or an ineffective push. He certainly didn’t expect her tongue to dart out to wrap against his, her hands already caressing his arms like she was doing her best to do so. </p><p>****</p><p>Janet was suddenly feeling dazed as she found a tongue invading her mouth. She should think about why her tongue suddenly responded, but that was not possible…</p><p>Not when she found her thoughts were occupied by the texture of his skin under her fingertips, the hardness of his muscles contrasting with the softness of his skin. Though, her dazed state wasn’t enough to make her forget that it was an absurd situation.</p><p>His hand firmly pressing against her back to pull her closer, rubbing repeatedly to deliver the most aggressive — yet somehow most sensual — massage she had ever received was enough to remind her that. </p><p>A part of her mind whispered to her to let it continue, but then his hips moved, only for something impossibly huge to press against her, telling her that things might reach a truly dangerous place if she didn’t stop them. </p><p>“S-stop,” she managed to say as she pushed him away after a while — a long while, she loathed to admit — and luckily, he followed. Unfortunately, that only came with a sudden sense of loss, as she found herself wishing that he hadn’t stopped. </p><p>Maybe that was clear on her face, because before she could take a step back, he grabbed her ass and lifted her, treating her like she had absolutely no weight. “Just how strong you are?” she found herself murmuring. </p><p>Even as she cursed herself as the stupid question, like that was more important than the secret financial documents being out. </p><p>“Just enough,” he answered as his fingers dug into her ass, her feet dangling, treating her like she weighed absolutely nothing. </p><p>She bit her lips as she tried to come up with a way to bring the discussion back to the financials, but her clouded mind came empty. Well, stating that as empty would have been a misnomer. It was just that, her mind was occupied more with different questions. </p><p>Like, how could a man be that strong … and reckless enough to just lean down and take her. It wasn’t that she was inexperienced with sex. She had several boyfriends, but none of them even dared to treat her badly under her sharp gaze, acting more like servants than lovers, afraid of doing the wrong thing and losing her. </p><p>Only to end up dumped even faster. </p><p>She loved the power that it gave her, thinking that it was more fun than the mediocre thing called sex… Or, at least she thought she did until she tasted his reckless assault. </p><p>And, he was reckless enough to do it in Mia’s office, who was one of the few people that she was actually scared of. </p><p>It took a while for her to realize she had been distracted once more, and that only happened when she realized, his right hand, which was rubbing her ass, had slipped under her skirt while her hazy mind had been lost on the implications of his approach.</p><p>“We need to stop,” she whispered. </p><p>“Why?” he answered idly. </p><p>Janet found herself freezing at the simple answer. “W-what do you mean why?” she managed to answer a moment later. Though, in her hazy mind, gathering that answer was difficult enough that, she was late to react when he moved her toward the desk. </p><p>Or react when her jacket fell open, revealing her absence of a bra. </p><p>What a day to pick a daring outfit, she noted.</p><p>“Please, Mia might return any moment now,” she begged. </p><p>“That’s your only problem?” he asked, his smirk damnable. </p><p>No, she wanted to shout, but her lips chose to rebel. “Yes!” </p><p>“Good then,” he declared smugly as she found herself leaning against her desk. “Because her sister just came and brought her away. It doesn’t look like she would return soon…” </p><p>And just like that, Janet found herself locked in an answer, one that she was supposed to hate. </p><p>But it was very hard to do with her body burning in excitement…</p>",

    "title": "Darion's Office 2",
    "content": "<p>His smile didn’t survive for long. </p><p>The moment he stepped into his new office, the elation he felt from his earlier victory was gone. He was not exactly like his peers, driven to crime by the dreams of expensive cars and condos, aware enough to know that it was nothing but nonsense. </p><p>But that didn’t mean that he was happy to find himself in a smelly dump, bright fluorescent lighting, a dirty mess, and only a bunch of broke crates to sit down on.</p><p>“You need to stick to it just a few months, Darion,” he murmured to himself, trying to calm down.  It was the best job he could find while still staying away from the gang. And he was not a fan of hard work, working in a place filled with sexy women was enough compensation. </p><p>He had needs. </p><p>But before he could even start cleaning, his phone rang. An unknown number, but considering it was a new phone, and he only gave the number to that sexy redhead, he decided to answer. </p><p>“This is your new boss, come to the office,” said a shrill voice, before slamming his face. </p><p>“As you wish, boss…” Darion found himself murmuring. He had a lot of criminals to attest that angering him was not a good idea. Not because he got angry quickly. Quite the opposite. He had the patience to wait before pulling the rug under the target of his anger. </p><p>He ignored the fact that the corridor leading to the bathroom wasn’t any better. Unlike his room, he had no intention of cleaning the other places. </p><p>He pick the longer road, walking through the inner garden — he had already checked the plans, and knew that there was a little path that would give a glimpse of the office. He wanted to get a glimpse of his new boss before he decided on his revenge. </p><p>He might use some sharper methods if his new boss was an old hag… </p><p>“Or not…” he muttered when he took a sneak peek through the window. A sexy, black-haired woman, well-endowed enough to rival her secretary. She was clearly aware of her sexiness as well, considering she wore a white blazer, but had no blouse; a fact that was obvious even with her arm covering her body.</p><p>As he walked toward the door, he sent a message — through his burner phone, obviously — to one of his friends that did almost no work with his gang; a relationship that Darion cultivated carefully. He was an accountant, one that also handled the financials — mostly money laundering — of his little coffee shop. </p><p>The answer didn’t come immediately, nor that Darion needed. He knocked on the door, ready to meet with his new boss. </p><p>He decided to give her boss a fun punishment, the kind that they could both enjoy. And he was sure that he could find a way to convince her of that, though it would be considerably easier if his friend could point in the right direction. </p><p>He didn’t believe anyone actually had a squeaky-clean business. Taxes were inconvenient for everyone. </p><p>“Come in,” came the answer from inside, and Darion did so, standing face-t0-face with his new boss. “So, you’re the new janitor,” she said. He noted both the distaste in her tone, and the wandering nature of her eyes, focusing particularly on his arms. </p><p>Not that he blamed her. He had a lot of time to work out in prison. </p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” he answered, though he didn’t bother to hide his smile, showing that it was more of a mocking tease than a genuine show of respect. One that was underlined by his wandering gaze, dancing down first, staying locked to her cleavage, then up again. </p><p>A clear expression of distaste appeared on her face as he examined her body, but it only made his smile even wider. “No one taught you that staring is rude,” she said, her voice challenging. </p><p>“They did, but some things are worth the risk,” he said as he closed in, enjoying as her distaste turned into a smoldering kind of anger. Not exactly a problem, as anger was a surprisingly easy emotion to mold into lust, a tool that most men were too weak to use. </p><p>Or lacked the assets to do so. </p><p>“Rude,” she answered, but that didn’t prevent her from sending an appreciative glance at his body as he closed in the distance, leaning toward her to give an even better show of his body. </p><p> “Maybe, but that doesn’t make it less true—“ Darion started, wondering whether he even needed any dirt to actually make any progress. Some women liked their chocolate bitter, and unless his game frizzled horribly, he was sure that his new boss was one of them. </p><p>Unfortunately, he was interrupted by an unwelcome knock. </p><p>“Or, not so unwelcome,” he muttered, too soft for his new boss to hear. </p><p>The reason, was the sexy redhead that walked into the room, one that was different from the sexy secretary he had dealt with earlier. He wasn’t sure which one was sexier, but the same challenge didn’t exist to measure which one was the sluttier. </p><p>The new redhead, with her absurdly high crop top — more of a large bra — and her transparent shorts, showed her assets to the best of effect. </p><p>“Oh, hello, handsome,” she said with a soft, alluring voice. “I’m sure you’re not a new employee, as we certainly don’t get anything as fun here.” </p><p>“I aim to please, but —“ Darion started, smiling wide, even though he didn’t miss the slightly mocking tone in her voice. She clearly had an angle more than his apparent attraction, but he was not the one to stop him from flirting with a woman with such clear needs. </p><p>Even if she was a bit to the younger side, barely in her twenties. </p><p>“Hell no, little sister,” his boss gasped, solving the small mystery about how someone thought that was a work-appropriate outfit. “You can’t flirt with the employees.” </p><p>“Oh, even when they are built like a castle,” she answered with a smirk, taking a slow, sauntering step forward, seductive enough to stir his pants despite knowing she was clearly trying to anger her older sister rather than trying to actually flirt with him. </p><p>“Working hard is a basic responsibility for any employee,” Darion answered, mocking in words, but throaty in tone, watching as her fake flirty smile tremble into something slightly more honest. </p><p>Maybe his little parole stint would be even more fun than he had initially expected — which was already a hard bar to clear with the two examples he had stumbled on. </p><p>Unfortunately, just as he took a step forward to see just how far she was willing to push that little game, her sister dashed between us, looking at me angrily. “Oh, hell no!” she growled in anger. “You’ll make sure to stay away from her, or it’s your job, understood!” </p><p>Darion ordinarily didn’t appreciate people threatening him, but he was willing to make an exception for his new boss, she raised her arm giving an amazing glimpse into her cleavage that continued the job that her sister started. </p><p>Behind her, the redhead was snickering in amusement, clearly more interested in angering her sister than making the flirting real. </p><p>Darion trusted himself to change that. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” he said, even managing to keep his sarcasm concealed — though the entitled anger she displayed made it much easier to achieve. </p><p>“If you finished protecting my chastity, sister, we’re going to be late,” the redhead said — though with the way she dressed, Darion could see the intervention had arrived too late.</p><p>“Move, and don’t dress like a whore in my office,” she answered, and they left. </p><p>Allowing Darion to enjoy their exit perfectly. </p><p>He smirked, realizing that with the sudden distraction, she didn’t even tell him why she called him to his office. “For the next time, then —“ Darion murmured, only to be interrupted by his burner phone buzzing. </p><p>It was the confirmation of his guess. Not only his new boss was using some shady practices, but also she didn’t use anything digital for those ladders. </p><p>Excellent, he thought. All that remained was searching, a task that his janitor job was perfectly suited for.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, which part are we going to focus on first, the assassination or sending that blond idiot away,” Valkyrie said, the little smirk on her face the only reaction she was currently paying to the extraordinary nature of the circumstances. </p><p>“Good question, let me think for a moment,” I answered as I made a thinking face. An exaggerated one, making her smile widen, making her realize what was about to come. She didn’t forget my habits, it seemed. </p><p>I found myself facing a choice. The nice thing was to ask Valkyrie to leave while I played with Sapphire — well, the really nice thing was actually stopping to play with her and include her as a part of the important discussion about her kingdom, but that was clearly not my attention and Valkyrie was clearly alright with that. </p><p>I ignored both as my face scrunched in confusion, like I was trying to make a decision or answer her question, but that didn’t affect the actions of my body. Particularly my hands, expertly untying the strings of her dress that kept her cleavage under control. Though, even with the skillful dance, it took a while. Understandable, as keeping her bosom under control was a significant challenge. Her dress required all the reinforcement that could be put fashionable degree. </p><p>The decision was clear. The potential fun of including Sapphire’s ‘loyal’ warrior in the mix was just too tempting to deny. I continued to play with her dress, until the center fell open, revealing Sapphire’s amazing cleavage. </p><p>One that Valkyrie wasn’t completely inattentive, if the sudden flash in her gaze was any indicator. “What do you think?” I asked with a chuckle. That question made her freeze. Silently admiring the cleavage of her Queen was one thing, but actively commenting on it was something different. </p><p>Technically enough to be counted as treason. </p><p>She didn’t answer for a moment, her concerns holding her back. Concerns melted under my teasing smirk, her competitive nature showing itself. “Well, they are certainly … more impressive than I expected,” she said, doing her best to keep her voice smooth, but unable to hide a flicker. </p><p>I chuckled. “You see, she’s surprised. But maybe it’s the fault of the dresses you chose. You certainly didn’t have that problem during your part-time job.” </p><p>“Part-time job?” Valkyrie murmured, her shock palpable, while Sapphire’s uncharacteristic blush confirmed that. I chuckled at her shock, not that I blamed her. The Queen working a part-time job was a funny concept. </p><p>“Well, the treasury certainly needs every coin we could find,” I said with a chuckle, deflecting the topic for the moment — mostly because I wanted to have that reveal in a more amusing manner. </p><p>“That bad?” Valkyrie asked.</p><p>“What do you think, my beautiful Queen,” I whispered even as my finger continued to dance on her dress, pulling her cleavage even bigger. </p><p>“Worse,” she admitted with a soft, resigned whisper. </p><p>“How?” Valkyrie asked, naturally angry. </p><p>I chuckled. “As you can imagine, it’s hard to make the nobles in the central lands pay any kind of tax, especially since they don’t see any danger.” </p><p>“Maybe I should remind them—“ Valkyrie answered, only to cut short. The reason, is the sudden pull I conducted, revealing Sapphire’s beautiful tits, a bit faster than I initially planned. I loved teasing her, but I didn’t want her to fall into a long tirade about irresponsible and selfish nobles. </p><p>Not when we could do so much more fun things than arguing about taxation. </p><p>I enjoyed her sudden silence as I continued pulling Sapphire’s dress down, pooling around her waist, leaving her upper body perfectly on display. </p><p>Not for long, however. Without a warning, I shifted my hands and stood up, hugging Sapphire in a beautiful bridal hold as I did so, and started walking toward the bedroom. Valkyrie stayed in place, frozen in surprise. </p><p>I walked until I arrived at the doorway, then froze, and gestured with my head for her to come in. “What are you waiting for? Come, we have a lot to talk about.” </p><p>Her gaze fell to check Sapphire’s expression. I might have taken that as an insult, but considering their relative positions, I decided to let that slide. Even with all that she had seen, it was only expected for Valkyrie to feel conscious about taking another step forward, especially to her bedroom. She might have even pulled back if Sapphire said anything. </p><p>Not that Sapphire was in a position to say anything. Even sending a disapproving glare was above her, as she was distracted by the way her skirt was sliding off her body, leaving the task of hiding her body to her panties — which was a hopeless affair with her amazing hips, and her spectacular wetness hardly helped. </p><p>“So, about the strategy, I think we need to send the moron away first, we don’t want him walking around, poking where he doesn’t belong after the assassination happened,” I explained. I even poked various places as I spoke, though Sapphire’s beautiful told me I was certainly not unwelcome. </p><p>“Makes sense,” Valkyrie said, even as a clank reached to my ears, one that I hadn’t heard for a long time. the distinct and familiar sound of her armor hitting the floor as she discarded it carefully. I didn’t look, but Sapphire glanced in that direction immediately, her blush intensifying as she took a glimpse of the show. Her soft gasp was music to my ears. </p><p>It was beautiful to see her haughty fake exterior chipping, even more, revealing the beautiful and alluring woman underneath. </p><p>“Now, about the assassination,” she followed up, but only after another clank, while I continued covering the distance between us and the bed. </p><p>“You’re even more familiar with the security protocol of the Empire to make it believable, so I want to hear your thoughts?” I asked as I lay Sapphire on the bed. </p><p>That earned a chuckle from Valkyrie, broken up by her clothes hitting the carpet. “Really, and you’re admitting it?” </p><p>I turned toward her, my smirk even wider. A part of that smile was about having a fun answer to her question, but another part was about getting another glimpse of her beautiful body, her clothes already gone — she had always been quick to dress and undress, a habit from her military life — to reveal her beautiful body. It was hard to classify her body as flawless, especially when compared to the other naked blonde in the room. </p><p>Her body was more angular, her muscles showing the overwhelming amount of time she spent wearing armor rather than dresses, spending her time in the training field rather than balls and feasts. A few scars that managed to persist over her body despite magical healing just drove that message deeper. Though, while her body was leaner, she still had some spectacular curves. </p><p>However, none of those details prevented my smirk from a naughty turn, or her from radiating a sexy allure that was enough to drive me crazy to a degree that could rival the beauty in my arms. </p><p>A monumental achievement, considering the woman in my arms was the Queen of the largest Empire that secretly moonlighted as the most desirable and untouchable exotic dancer of the Empire. </p><p>Valkyrie was always a beautiful example of femininity, and more beautiful for it.</p><p>“Well,” I said, answering her earlier tease only after enjoying her nudity for that long glance. “I can assassinate her easily, but making a fake spectacle of it after she got narrowly saved, only to die during recovery is outside my ability. I don’t plan for failure.” </p><p>“Arrogant much?” Valkyrie said after a chiming laugh. “Are you sure you want to claim that while the Queen is here? Maybe she’ll trust her security measures over her abilities.” </p><p>“What do you think, sweetie?” I said even as I lay Sapphire down and pulled down her panties. “Do you think your security measures can protect you if I was serious?” </p><p>“I … I don’t think so,” she muttered, blushing shyly, though it was less about the topic, and more about our mocking attitude as we talked over her. It was not an attitude she was used to, and she was not particularly good at adapting. I barely held back from teasing her about that. “You can certainly assassinate me if you wish…” </p><p>“Oh, he clearly stabbed you many times —” Valkyrie answered, reflexively, her mouth working faster than her brain. She pressed her hand to her mouth, realizing that, even in this situation, sarcastically mocking her Queen might be dangerous. </p><p>Luckily for her, I was more than able to keep Sapphire distracted, keeping her reaction to an annoyed glare. “Why don’t you take a seat and tell me what you have in mind for her assassination,” I offered, tapping the bed to invite her closer. Then, I chuckled. “And, you can have a better view of how I … stab your Queen. Maybe it could be inspiring…”</p>",

    "content": "<p>My first inclination as she revealed yet another secret was to shout, and shout loudly, and the only reason I managed to suppress that anger was the habit of a lifetime. Pointless flares of anger were not something I could afford without anyone to rely on. </p><p>“Would you mind explaining to me what is Empowerment?” I asked instead. </p><p>“Simple,” she said dismissively. “You just cast a spell to increase their physical capabilities while spending some of the Intent you gathered, and they experience an increase of strength, just like what you’re gathering.”</p><p>“Interesting, and is it permanent or temporary,” I said. </p><p>“Both, but I doubt you if you could manage anything permanent with the broken state of the System. It needs to recover enough to allow you to properly attain Divine Traits first. And, to cast temporary empowerment, you need to learn more magic,” she added.</p><p>I was tempted to mention to her that, maybe, just maybe, she shouldn’t be devouring all the Intent I was able to gather so that the system could recover, but once again I swallowed my words. She was getting more and more dismissive of me after her recovery, and I didn’t want to show just how much that annoyed me. </p><p>At least, her careless words told me that the current cap of capabilities I had been dealing with was temporary, and my abilities would increase even further by default as the System recovered. </p><p>A fact that I wouldn’t have cared that much if it wasn’t for the constant assassination attempts of the mysterious shadows, with the potential of bigger and badder things on the horizon. </p><p>Still, even with that looming threat I didn’t confront her directly, but chose a different manner. “Magic,” I muttered. “Do you mind teaching me a bit, we have time,” I offered. </p><p>“It’s not the time yet,” she answered immediately, but she wasn’t a good actor enough to hide the tone of finality in her tone. It might be my suspicious personality, but it was hard to interpret her sharp answer as anything but a firm rejection. </p><p>“If you think so,” I answered amenably, acting like I had accepted her declaration without an issue, even as I typed a text rapidly. After all, just because I lacked the ability to confront her directly didn’t mean I was helpless against her. </p><p>I dallied in the storage room for a few minutes, putting the stuff back in their place, when I heard a knock on the door. </p><p>“Come in,” I called, and the door opened, revealing Kim, who I had texted earlier. </p><p>“What do you want?” she asked sharply as she closed the door, but her smile disagreed with her sharp tone. So did her sashaying hips.   </p><p>I liked her sharp attitude. “I just wanted to check how your little documentary is going,” I said. </p><p>“Already finished shooting and preliminary editing, and now our little genius is helping our Coach to record some of the lines again.” </p><p>“She’s not a good actor?” I asked. </p><p>“Not even close,” Kim answered as she walked forward, getting closer and closer, her hips dancing wildly. “They still need quite a bit of time to finish.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as she stood in front of me, her lips parted invitingly, begging for my attention. I had no intention of rejecting that invitation, not when I had called her for this in the first place. “So, you’re saying that you can afford a ten-minute break,” I said as I put my hand on her waist. </p><p>As I did so, I watched my guide from the corner of my eye, amused by her lack of attention as she focused on the book, unaware of what was coming. Which was well, as it would make react even more exaggeratedly.</p><p>An attitude that contrasted greatly with her sexy leather ensemble, one that she failed to change no matter how many times she tried, giving me a chance to enjoy her spectacular body. </p><p>“Oh, you think ten minutes will be enough?” Kim said. </p><p>“Considering you still need to walk afterward, definitely yes,” I answered. </p><p>Her lips parted, ready to deliver a scathing remark, but they were simply too tempting to waste speaking. I learned, capturing her lips in a heated kiss. </p><p>Kim’s spectacular moan was enough to get the attention of my guide. “W-what!” she stammered in shock as she gazed at me. “N-not again,” she added as she tried to move away. </p><p>She failed to move away as if she hit an invisible wall. Interesting, especially since she had no trouble moving that much away from me. Still, it was a welcome development, as she disappeared right after covering her face with her hands. </p><p>I felt her presence settle back into my soul. </p><p>Her sudden inability to move away was interesting, which felt rather similar to her inability to change her clothes, both contrasting greatly with her personality. However, I didn’t have the time to explore that. </p><p>With her gone, the presence of Kim had become useless from a strategic perspective — a detail that I chose to ignore temporarily as I leaned forward, intensifying the kiss even more as my hands had free reign over her body. </p><p>A fact Kim had no problem with, told through the way her fingers struggled with my belt to push my pants down. Never one to ignore such an opportunity, I responded in kind, my Agility allowing me to do so instantly despite the tightness of her pants. </p><p>She succeeded a moment later. “It seems that you win,” she gasped, her voice beautiful. </p><p>“It seems that I do,” I answered. “Now, it’s time for the reward,” I added, pushing her against the wall as she tried to come up with an answer. She hit the wall hard, but her only reaction was a gasp of approval. </p><p>She wasn’t the one that would mind a bit of rough play. </p><p>“Try to keep your moans down, we don’t want a scandal,” I warned her before I slid inside her. Normally, I would have teased her a bit more, but it was against the quickie etiquette. </p><p>And, I was a nice guy who would never violate such etiquette. </p><p>“Of course—“ she started bravely, only for that determination to disappear in panic as I pushed inside her, making her bite her lips desperately.  </p><p>“That’s not too much, is it?” I whispered mockingly. </p><p>“Of course — not,” she managed to deliver, choppily with her moans invading her tone. It was impressive that she was able to speak. Unfortunately for her, in her arrogance, she decided to push for more. “I can handle—“ she tried to say, only to die into a beautiful cry as my lips landed on her neck.</p><p>Her back arched in pleasure, hitting the wall hard. Her hands landed on my shoulders, but rather than pushing me away, she pulled me even tighter into her embrace. Her gasps exploded even louder as she grabbed me with a strength that was surprising for her to have in her thin frame.</p><p>“Not bad,” I whispered, which worked perfectly as a key, her hips parting open even more, showing that she was enjoying the situation even more than she was willing to admit. </p><p>Enough to be tamed temporarily. </p><p>She moaned, staying as passive as she could manage, enjoying my reckless assault, each push slamming hard. Luckily, the room was isolated well — which was the reason I picked it for training in the first place. </p><p>And, now, I was enjoying the ancillary benefits of it. </p><p>Her arousal continued to rise, her moans exploding deliciously in the storage room. Lost in pleasure, she didn’t resist even a bit as I pulled out for a moment and flipped her so that she was leaning against the wall, with her ass pointing at me. </p><p>I slid inside her wetness once again, the angle allowing me to repeat my assault even more aggressively. </p><p>“M-maybe a breather?” she asked. </p><p>“Not a chance, sweetie,” I said as I grabbed her beautiful red hair. “I still have to go and run the quarterback selection, so I can only give you five minutes. So, if  you are alright with waiting until the selection is over, we can stop.” </p><p>“You’re a fucking bastard,” she moaned. </p><p>I chuckled as I paused my hips for a second. “Should I take it as a request to stop?” I asked. She said nothing, just pushing her hips back to restart our little dance, her frustrated growl as beautiful as her warmth. “Just as I thought,” I whispered as I invaded her core recklessly, her moans rising to a spectacular degree. </p><p>She said nothing else under the invasion of my hips, each second driving her pleasure to a greater degree. As I continued rocking my hips, my length disappearing repeatedly inside her, it didn’t take long for her to reach the promised land. </p><p>Just I exploded inside her. “What a good way to take a break, right,” I whispered as I grabbed her waist, preventing her from collapsing.  </p><p>She just murmured, though her insults hardly had any power when lost in pleasure. I waited a bit for her to recover and dress back, then accompanied her to the nearest bathroom, allowing her to fix her looks before she rejoined the group. </p><p>I walked back to the stadium, to handle the quarterback selection.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I had no doubt we were displaying a comical view, with me in the front, and fourteen men lined in front of me in a windowless room, apprehension covering their faces despite every single of them being bulkier — especially since they were wearing full pads. </p><p>My reputation was growing. </p><p>The book on the corner was the only thing that looked out of sorts, but luckily, with my reputation, none of them paid any attention to that. Lucky, because if they paid any attention, they would have seen the pages turning with a suspicious frequency that couldn’t be attributed to the wind — especially in a windowless room. </p><p>“Now, I’m sure you know that I’m not allowed to tackle until the hospital report,” I said, which gave some of them a hint of hope, while smarter ones maintained their somber mood. “Sorry, seem to be tackling,” I corrected with a nasty smile. “Lucky for me, there are no windows here,” I said as I put on a helmet. </p><p>“No padding?” asked one of them. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, I won’t need it,” I answered viciously, which was enough to awaken their competitive spirit through the implied insult. Which was good, as for Sunday, my true hopes depended on them. </p><p>There was a reason that not a single newbie was a part of them. </p><p>“Now, the first task, we need to see who will create the offensive line, and who will be defensive linemen,” I said. “Let’s see how well you defend,” I said as I quickly paired them. “Jake, you’ll stand in for the quarterback for the moment, and I’ll attack either from the left or from the right, while the pair of you will be responsible for stopping me,” I said. </p><p>It earned some suspicious glares. Doubling was the simplest way of handling even the most threatening rushes. With the advantage of the padding, it was supposed to turn it into a hopeless struggle. </p><p>Luckily, I was cheating in a different way. </p><p>“Take a position,” I said as I pointed to a pair of starting defensive linemen to take the first position, showing my intention to make a point. </p><p>The structure of an offensive line was simple. It had five standard roles, left tackle at the outermost left position, usually tasked to protect against the attackers coming from the edge, or responding to breaches. The left guard between him and the center, is responsible for the interior attackers. The right side was the mirror image with a right guard and right tackle — though usually treated with less importance. </p><p>And, at the center, stood the center, responsible for coordinating with the quarterback and commanding the rest of the line according to the expected form of attack, as well as handling the vital task of snapping the ball. Not to mention, they were still tasked with handling any interior attack as well. </p><p>A surprisingly complicated role. </p><p>The offensive line was a critical part of any team, yet significantly underrated by anyone but the true experts. Their underrated aspect came due to the thankless nature of their job. Their job was split between two parts, protecting the quarterback during a passing game, forcing open a corridor, and blocking the defensive players during a run game. </p><p>In either case, their success led to the glory of the other player. The longer they maintained the protection, the longer the quarterback had the throw, converting to a spectacular play where he collected all the credit. And similarly, during the run, it was the running back that collected the glory. </p><p>However, things changed when the failure happened. Every failure caused either a spectacular sack, or a painful tackle for loss, highlighting the nature of the failure — even if the failure belonged to the quarterback by holding the ball too long, or a running back, indecisive about which path to take.  </p><p>In comparison, defensive linemen had their glory when they succeeded, which made a much more attractive position for most with no further professional aspirations. </p><p>Still, the selected players didn’t complain as they stood at the left side of the dummy quarterback, prepared to cut my blindside assault — which was the most dangerous direction to attack any quarterback as they turned to throw the ball, catching them unawares. </p><p>I wanted to make sure the offensive line was as strong as possible to prevent our newbie quarterback to collapse from repeated hits. Their jobs would be difficult enough without that. </p><p>“Ready,” I called, though my warning was not about playing fair. I wanted to remove any excuse for their failure. </p><p>Only after they nodded I charged forward, ready to collide with the one inside. But just as they readied themselves with collusion, a footwork trick shifted me toward the outer line, a push enough for them to collapse against each other. </p><p>Ending up with Jake examining the ceiling. </p><p>“You can’t commit to a direction until the last moment,” I reminded them. “Don’t forget, you don’t have the luxury of the initiative as the offensive lineman unless it’s a run, you have to respond to what the defense is giving you.” </p><p>“Understood,” they answered, making me glad for the Leadership trait. Without it, even with my achievements to date, I would have probably had to beat them for hours until I could drive the point forward — linemen were famous for their stubbornness, and for good reason. </p><p>With Leadership allowing me to read them perfectly, a few dozen attempts were more than enough. </p><p>“Good, try to trace their center of weight carefully. The way they position their legs gives more than they want,” I said, displaying a couple stances. “However, when you lean forward like this,” I said, perfectly replicating the position of the player that was playing the left guard, “you’re committing to the inner side early, preventing you from shifting to a sudden change. Even if the linemen had already committed, what happens if they bring an extra edge rusher?” I asked. </p><p>“I see,” he said with a thoughtful nod while the next players took their position, determined not to experience the same problem. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, that was not the only trick I had. I faked a right cut, then a left cut, leaving them indecisive until the last second. They reacted better than the previous pair, the guard focusing inside while the tackle focused outside. </p><p>Unfortunately, after the previous display, they were too zealous on those aspects, allowing me to burst through the middle of them easily, throwing them to the side with a swim move, and reaching the quarterback. </p><p>This time, I didn’t tackle Jake full-force, just tapping his shoulder. “Try not to focus inside too much,” I said. “Next!” </p><p>With that, every single player took various roles on the offensive line while I tackled them again and again, forcing them to adapt to my attack in different combinations, sometimes a tackle and a guard, sometimes a center and a guard. Sometimes, I even made them test as a tackle and a center, trying to simulate how they would react if the protection broke in an unexpected way. </p><p>It was a painful hour, one that I only managed to handle due to my extreme Recovery trait, while every single lineman looked at the edge of collapse. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I quickly split into tasks. Ultimately, I assigned the eight players that could communicate the best, as the offensive linemen, while the remaining six stayed as the defensive linemen. </p><p>Amusingly, Jake, the unlucky dummy quarterback turned out to be the best center among them. </p><p>The team just chuckled. More than one of them was looking at me in shock, but I had no trouble revealing that much of my ability. After all, the constant attack of the shadows revealed that I was already a target, and I would prefer revealing more of my abilities than losing my only steady source of Intent. </p><p>“A difficult game is waiting for us this Sunday, especially since it’s not certain if I could play,” I started, letting Leadership Trait free with its full power. “So, I want every single one of you to work more than humanly possible. We’ll have an amateur quarterback, new running backs, new corners, fresh receivers, everything. Do you think it’s a coincidence that we have no linemen candidates from the newcomers?” </p><p>“No, sir,” they answered together, in a loud voice that would have made a drill sergeant jealous, Even my guide looked up for a moment before turning her attention back to her book. </p><p>“Exactly. Every single one of you is experienced, because this Sunday, we’ll fight on the line, win or lose. Either way, we’re going to fight fast, and fight hard, until we make sure that, even if Coach Bill was here, he would have asked not to take it so seriously.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” they answered, though this time, they followed with a great chuckle. </p><p>“Excellent, now you can disperse,” I called. “Take ten before joining the training.” I watched as they left, intending to check with the girls to see how things were going. </p><p>Since there was no sudden intent flow, I wanted to make sure everything was going alright. But before I could do so, my guide spoke once more. “Why are you bothering that much with this.” </p><p>“Because we need to win the game,” I said. </p><p>“Why don’t you empower them instead,” she countered, and I froze. I didn’t know what she was talking about, but the implications were not hard to decipher. </p><p>Sometimes, I really loved her, but hated her at the same time.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“That’s enough, take ten,” I finally called, calling for a break for the training. “Now, the fun part, anyone that wants to test as the backup quarterback, who’s also likely to play this week.”</p><p>A great number of players, mostly the newcomers,, stepped forward with enthusiasm, very enthusiastic to experience the glory, even if it was only for a game. A quick count showed fourteen players wanted to try out for the quarterback position. </p><p>I glanced at the remaining players, which included every single defensive player that stayed on the team. </p><p>It seemed that their distaste for the offense was yet to disappear. Still, I didn’t prompt them to act, not when I needed every single of them. Almost half of the linemen had to be transferred to the offensive side of the ball, which meant the gap left by them had to be filled with backups and some of the stronger linemen. </p><p>Which, in turn, depleted the cornerbacks and safeties to reinforce these holes. And, that was while ignoring a few like Marcus I would have to play as receivers or running backs. </p><p>Therefore, I had no intention of demanding them to move. </p><p>Though, it didn’t take long for me to realize I might have misunderstood their lack of intention, as they had matched smirks while watching the new players, walking enthusiastically toward the pile of balls. </p><p>They might have some accurate expectations about what awaited the quarterback. </p><p>“Where are you going?” I asked flatly toward the new players. </p><p>“To get the balls,” answered one of the braver ones, though the expression of the others showed agreement. </p><p>“Who told you that the first test would be throwing the balls, follow me,” I said as I walked to the sideline, which had a pile of books, papers, and other stuff. It was not a full playbook but a simplified one, one that had been used for the acclimatization of the defensive players. </p><p>Technically, using that would have created an advantage for defensive players if one of them joined, but that wasn’t exactly the height of my worries. And, since they hadn’t joined, there was no problem. “Your first task is to memorize as much as possible in an hour, and answer the questions I have afterward.” </p><p>“B-but, that’s nerd stuff —“ started one of them, before his friend helpfully poked him to the side, his panicked expression showing he didn’t forget my other identity. </p><p>I just chuckled. “Oh, sweet summer child, you’re in a great misunderstanding if you think a quarterback has to study any less than a valedictorian,” I said. “Unless they played for that idiot Spencer, of course, but as you can see, that’s not the case anymore.” </p><p>“Still…” he started, encouraged by my lack of aggressive response, only to wilt away as my gaze turned angry. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I kept my gaze on the unlucky guy who volunteered. “Now, it’s particularly important this week, as none of you would have the experience to actually call plays in the field. And, if my concussion report doesn’t clear, one of you has to play. Can you tell me what’s the most important thing?” </p><p>“F… for us to know the playbook,” he stammered, hesitant despite the obvious answer.</p><p>I had a feeling he wouldn’t be the one that memorized the most formations. </p><p>“Exactly. I’ll be calling every play from the side, to the progression you have to follow, but even that wouldn’t help if you don’t know the playbook.” </p><p>That earned a doubtful look from more than one candidate, realizing that it didn’t sound smart. The reason the quarterback position was so hard to play was that they — or we — had to process every little change in the field perfectly, to the last second, and even after the game started. </p><p>Orders from the side would only make it more confusing when the same formation could either trigger a blitz that forced the quarterback to target the hot route — the emergency — or deliver a stable three-man rush that would require him to call a last-second adjustment, turning the play into a run. </p><p>Either way, trying to call the plays from the side was madness. </p><p>… or, it would have been, if it wasn’t for the unfair advantage of my traits. Though, even with those, I wasn’t confident that it would work perfectly. Luckily, winning was not an option.  </p><p>As long as I kept the game close, it would be enough to keep Spencer away from the team. </p><p>“Are you sure it would work?” one of them asked.</p><p>Before saying anything, I grabbed another, much thicker book, containing the strategy of the last game. I threw it on the ground, and it made a satisfactory thump. “Anyone is free to memorize this if they want to  run the game as a proper quarterback.” </p><p>Predictably, no one dared to even reach it, and they all obediently opened their books and started reading desperately. </p><p>While they were busy with that, I returned to the rest of the team. “It’s time for the assignments,” I said. “First, the linebacker core,” I said, calling a group of names that was a mixture of cornerbacks and new players, with only one starter and two from the old backups.</p><p>Inevitable, with some of them inevitably moving to linemen, and some moving to offensive tight ends. </p><p>Marcus looked at me, asking whether I was sure silently, but I shrugged.  Our options were too limited not to deplete the linebacker core, no matter how critical they were. </p><p>The cornerbacks and safeties had experienced a similar depletion, part of them moving to the other defensive roles, while a considerable number moved to receiver positions and running backs. </p><p>“Why are we playing offense,” asked one of them. </p><p>“Because I trust you not to fumble the ball at the first tackle,” I said, my gaze dancing on the new players, most of them had dropped the ball at the slightest contact. “This Sunday, we don’t have the luxury of constant turnovers, not if you want the cheerleaders to be in a good mood  when we have an amazing party afterward.”  </p><p>That image earned enough chuckles to disperse the poignant aura of depression that surrounded them, replenishing their fighting spirit. After all, those legendary parties were the only reason most of the players joined the practice squad in the first place, and the idea that they could get the attention the starters got was even more fascinating. </p><p>With that, I started calling the offensive skill positions, namely, tight ends, receivers, and running backs, a mixture of new arrivals, practice squad players, and old defensive players, though with several gaps, pending the quarterback hopefuls to finish their selection. </p><p>“And the ones that remain will be the linemen, both offensive and defensive,” I called. “They can rest for ten more minutes while rest follows me,” I said. </p><p>“Why do they get to rest more?” asked Marcus, though clearly voicing the concerns of the new players, allowing me to answer. </p><p>Such a reliable second in command, I noted even as I nodded at him. “Oh, believe me, they need it,” I said. And, since my reputation was long set in the short time I was on the team,  it was enough to make every single prospective lineman blanch in fear, even if I didn’t use any of my traits. </p><p>I didn’t bother correcting their assumption. After all, their fear was not entirely unjustified with what I had planned for them. </p><p>“Now, the skill core,” I gestured, first separating the offensive and defensive players, then splitting each group into the three; linebacker, cornerback, and safety for the defense; tight end, receiver, and running back for the offense. </p><p>I first identified six experienced players to temporarily lead each group — a factor I had been attentive to while I had been setting those groups — then turned to my effective second-in-command. “Marcus, you’ll be in charge of the overall training while I deal with the linemen,” I said. </p><p>“Sure, what do we have planned.” </p><p>“For the receivers and safeties, let’s start with basic routes. Linebackers will work with tight ends to test their basic blocking, while corners will pair with running backs for tackling practice,” I said. The running backs had started smiling, as theirs was the softest assignment considering the physical limitations of the new cornerbacks. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, their peace was only temporary. “We need to make sure they know how to hold the ball before we replace the corners with the new linemen,” I added, which was enough to erase those smiles, replaced with fearful anticipation as they looked at the hulking group, waiting for their turn. </p><p>“And, add some suicide runs for every ten minutes,” I added, preventing the others to enjoy the upcoming misery of the new running backs, replaced by apprehension and commiserating looks. </p><p>Misery truly loved company. And, speaking of misery…</p><p>“Follow me,” I shouted at the linemen squad as I walked toward the gym, toward one of the studios I wanted to use for assessment. Due to concussion protocols, I was not allowed to do any contact practice. </p><p>But in a room with no windows and no cameras… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Xia’s mouth parted open in shock as she accidentally took a monumental step, clearly for the first time, but I leaned forward to capture her lips before she could moan in shock. </p><p>Purely to make sure she wouldn’t moan in shock and alert the soldiers to our presence, of course. </p><p>The battle continued to rage around us, with explosions ongoing, but after the initial surprise, the captain was able to deflect the attacks. And, since he was doing such a good job, there was no need for me to walk out and help. </p><p>It was what the professional respect from one sorcerer to other looked like. </p><p>And, speaking of professional respect between sorcerers, I turned my attention fully to the other sorcerer, one that was firmly attached to my lap as she tried to manage her shock. I tightened my grip on her hips. “Since it already happened, what do you say about making it memorable,” I whispered. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she whispered back, doing her best to sound annoyed. However, under the circumstances, her best proved insufficient. The forced arousal was barely a hint in her voice, filled with desire.</p><p>Not that I could blame her for that, of course.</p><p> “Try to stay silent,” I warned her even as I directed her hips, depriving myself of an interesting communication as the movement gave her a challenge. She pressed her lips tightly, trying to contain her moan, leaving me to do nothing but enjoy her exotic beauty. </p><p>Soon, her hips started to rise and fall in her volution, picking up speed. Her eyes stayed closed as she lost herself in the enjoyment of the moment, turning herself to everything but the enjoyment. </p><p>As much as I would have loved to do the same, I didn’t have that luxury, and continued to pay attention to the battle that was going on around us. As the enemy ships continued to draw close, I started to feel the presence of three sorcerers in the other ships, sieging our ships from a distance. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the weapons of the secret hold, it would have been a desperate battle, but the constant rain of the ballista arrows managed to balance the issue. </p><p>Of course, it was only temporary. Ballistas and their enchanted arrows were valuable, but not enough to flip the balance of a one-to-three sorcerer fight, especially when the lone sorcerer was already exhausted by enhancing the speed of the ship. </p><p>However, it was the fact that it was a naval battle that changed the balance. The rain of siege arrows didn’t create a big threat to the Sorcerers at a distance, but the same didn’t apply to their ships, forcing them to stay defensive despite their desire to capture our ship. </p><p>After all, they couldn’t capture it with their ship was taken down. </p><p>Amusingly, if all three had moved to one ship, they would have had a much easier time, without one focusing on the defense while the other two were dedicated to offense, but they didn’t do so. I wondered about the reason, but considering their identity, it could be anything from a blood feud between their families to a desire not to share the credit. </p><p>A risky strategy, but they clearly assumed that their victory was inevitable — which proved that they still didn’t know about the true origin of the ship, their neighboring Empire. Of course, they might also realize that, yet rightfully assumed the Empire wouldn’t interfere.</p><p>If they intervened, it would be a declaration of war. And, unlike Republic, the Empire had no idea the treasures the ship carrying, maybe enough to risk a war. </p><p>Ultimately, however, it wasn’t what I cared about. I had long received what I wanted, which was to get away from Rome, enough not to fear the enemy. I could easily throw myself in the water and swim away without getting any notice — especially since Xia was already awake, which meant she would be great assistance rather than a hindrance. </p><p>And, with that assessment complete, I turned most of my attention to the exotic beauty on my lap, rocking back and forth. </p><p>I still allowed her to set the pace, despite my desire to flip her and invade her core recklessly, afraid that she would lose her ability to hold back her moans, especially since the situation didn’t allow casting silencing spell — I couldn’t cast, period, and I didn’t trust her ability to hide the flare. </p><p>Admittedly, it wasn’t a huge chore for me to allow her to take the lead, not when her hips dance with a spectacular passion. </p><p>She maintained her silence with determination even as she gave all the signs of being overwhelmed with pleasure, which was impressive. But maybe I shouldn’t be too surprised. After all, she was still a sorceress, which was not a position that one could easily attain by being weak, no matter how many resources one could access. </p><p>I let myself enjoy her tightness as she moved up and down with a beautiful silence, the environment making it even more delicious. Soon, however, I proved just how much of a nice, helpful man I was by shifting higher and catching her lips in a burning kiss, helping her to stay silent. </p><p>And, I was sure the passionate dance of her tongue was purely about conveying her casual thanks and nothing more. </p><p>Yet, as that dance continued, I was getting more and more confident of her ability to keep her voice down, tempting me to adjust my merciful attitude. </p><p>“That’s enough warm-up,” I whispered as I tightened my grip around her hips, and flipped her, so that she was locked under me.  “Let’s see if you can maintain that silence,” I added, my hips pushing deep into her core. </p><p>She managed to do so, but it was a close call, her trembling lips staying connected. Her body, on the other hand, was much freer to tremble recklessly under my body, each second enhancing the sensation of pleasure even more. </p><p>Yet, suddenly I found myself getting irked with her silence as I pushed my hips even harder, our hips exploding loudly along with a moan from her. </p><p>It was pure luck that it coincided with another fireball, preventing us from revealing our position. I leaned down to capture her lips, helping her to suppress her panic. </p><p>Though, my mind was occupied with that sudden, reflexive action, ordering me to dominate her completely, leaving no doubt that she was mine, body and soul. It seemed that my new instincts would be even more trouble than I expected.</p><p>Suppressing the more violent, animalistic tendencies, I was able to do with ease, at least relative ease, because I was able to recognize them quickly. However, the problem came when those instincts worked like my normal thoughts, only even more intense. </p><p>Having sex while a battle was going on, it was me, but somehow taking her ability to keep her voice down in our risky position was outside that.</p><p>A point to be discussed with Xia once we were on the land once more, I thought as I put my hands on both sides of her as I trapped her against the deck, pushing back and forth as her body continued to quiver with overwhelming pleasure.</p><p>With my lips firmly on hers, and with the constant sound of the battle around us, the risk of being heard was minimal, so I started impaling her recklessly, doing my best to make her first time spectacular. </p><p>It was the least she deserved.  </p><p>I pushed repeatedly, each push making her moan even louder, challenging my lips to maintain her silence. It was still risky even with that, as even the slightest lull would be enough to reveal our presence, but I found myself unable to reject the reckless temptation. </p><p>The sound of her muffled cries, mixing with the constant battle, was simply beautiful. </p><p>The smart thing would have been to slow down to prevent an accident, but at this point, I felt unable to take that choice. I continued pushing forward, each push making her cries louder as we risked a very heated disaster — to my defense, one that I was confident to solve at this point, as we were almost at the point we needed to leave the ship.</p><p>I continued pushing, alternating between enjoying her lips and paying attention to the killer's body on full display. </p><p>Only after she started trembling desperately, I pulled back as a compromise, giving her a moment to recover, curious whether she could handle a second round, one that would bring me to completion. </p><p>However, a development happened at that point, one that suggested that I had to adjust my plans. The sound of the battle suddenly dropped down. </p><p>Not disappeared, which would have been surprising enough. No, the battle sounds started to disperse to a distance, showing that our ship suddenly had allies. Allies that I didn’t expect to appear, because the Empire shouldn’t be willing to sacrifice the ship. </p><p>Interesting, I thought. That meant that they were aware of our presence and importance — which wasn’t likely. </p><p>Or, there was something else on the ship that was precious enough to risk a war breaking out…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I kept most of my attention on my surroundings, and only a portion was still focused on the growth of the small sapling, which slowed even more after the latest adjustment, but I could see many changes in its nature, enough to justify that. </p><p>I sensed it carefully, ready to intervene in case of a weak undead response — and evacuate in case that scary lich that repaired the dimensional wall arrived. I was still confident in myself in a desperate fight, but I had no intention of putting myself to it unless absolutely necessary. </p><p>My latest experience with that corrupted angel was a good way to remind me just how many trump cards an enemy could reveal during a fight. </p><p>I focused on my other aim, slowly digging a tunnel deep underground, one that went almost a mile, opening to a naturally concealed pit — which I reinforced further with several more wards. And, on the way back, I had carefully covered the tunnel with wards as well, split between concealment, and explosive wards that were filled with the purest light mana I could convert through my fake light node.</p><p>A nice present in case the undead discovered me. </p><p>It took more than an hour, and when I returned, the little sapling had grown noticeably — from one inch to two — but its growth had stopped after finishing all the mana that was inside its protective shell. </p><p>Which was not too surprising. What surprised me was that there was a sense of taint in its leaves, the tip of one of them already blackened. </p><p>“Is there something wrong with my ward?” I asked myself even as I started examining the protective shell I had established to protect the little sapling from the necrotic energy. I was extremely focused, and not just because I was worried about the fate of the sapling, which was something between bait and an idle experiment. </p><p>I was more interested in why my ward failed. It might be my failing, or there might be something critical I was yet to discover about how mana worked in lands outside the purview of the system.</p><p>Either case, it had some great implications for the defensive quality of my temporary residence and my future plans. </p><p>However, even after sinking a great deal of time, I was yet to discover the source of the leak. And, before I could go deeper, I noticed a movement at a distance, coming from an upstream direction. </p><p>Another band of undead, though smaller than the first party that was sieging the elves earlier. The limited number of zombies that were brought along suggested that they were just reinforcements rather than ones that were expected to restart the siege — suggesting the undead were yet to discover my little intervention. </p><p>It was clear that the party was not there to understand the unexpected defeat either, as a horde of zombies — even a small one — was hardly something that could be kept hidden. </p><p>Among them, I could see two necromancers herding the rest. I cast two spells. First, an illusion, one that showed a large tree in place my little sapling, growing brightly. The horde to a stop after noticing its presence, and I used my second spell then. </p><p>A wave of light mana, infused with some proto-HP, enveloped most of the horde, taking them down in a single hit. </p><p>A hit that didn’t target one of the two necromancers, who was busy retreating. </p><p>I wanted the seed to work as bait, but with its growth hampered, I wasn’t above cheating a little. </p><p>Only after making sure the necromancer had retreated outside the visual range, I dispelled the illusion and focused on examining the ward once again. </p><p>No matter how much I searched, I failed to find any sign of a problem. Even worse, I could see the leaves continuing to darken slowly despite my attention. </p><p>My frown got bigger even as I decided to turn my attention to my little god-sapling, and created an intense flood of proto-HP, flooding its structure, spending more than a thousand mana in the process. </p><p>Not that it was a problem. I could easily tap into the Aether for more, and the results were impressive. The leaves gained their bright green coloration, and even the growth of the sapling quickened, reaching four inches. </p><p>“So, you can process proto-HP even faster than pure mana,” I murmured idly. I was aware that I was talking to a plant, but it was better than losing my mind in silence. “Now, if only I could find your problem,” I added, watching it. </p><p>Only for the same blackness appearing on the tip of the leaves, even faster this time. I frowned, and was treated with another flood of proto-HP, non-stop until it finally reached the height of a foot, finally looking like a proper sapling. </p><p>Yet, the leaves darkened even faster. “You should be more resistant, little buddy,” I muttered as I cured it once more, unable to understand why it was struggling that much. </p><p>Until I felt a stirring of necrotic energy, centered at the sapling itself. I immediately sent a tendril of mana through its structure, this time pure, carefully examining it. </p><p>Only to realize it had an additional set of roots, in addition to the physical one, made of mana. No wonder its growth was much slower than I expected. Most of the pure mana I provided was used for that purpose. </p><p>And, just like the physical roots were slowly spreading into the ground, those roots were slowly spreading into the Aether dimension, catching the small pieces of Aether, broken down enough that I called them impure mana. </p><p>No wonder it was struggling. The more roots its established, the more impure mana it tried to deal with. And, even worse, the Aether dimension was long tainted with Necrotic energy. I ignored it, because it was nothing against my own purification abilities, but clearly the same didn’t apply to the small tree. </p><p>Maybe it would have been b</p><p>I wondered whether it was a problem for every tree, or if I somehow intensified the problem by enhancing its merging with its Spark. </p><p>An interesting question, but under the circumstances, theoretical enough not to matter. I could always experiment on that the next time I stole some seeds, ideally a dozen or so so I could test impacting variables even more. </p><p>For now, I focused on the more immediate needs. First, I pruned most of the mana roots that were spreading into the Aether. With its limited Divine Spark, its transformative capabilities were extremely limited, and a few points of mana that it could convert every minute would hardly matter compared to the generous flood. </p><p>Then, I flooded its structure with a mixture of pure mana and proto-HP, both its roots and its leaves drinking the mana thirstily, just like a little lamb that discovered a cold spring in the middle of the summer. </p><p>Curious enough to watch its growth with my eyes, I climbed out of my cave, confident in my detection capabilities to catch any interloper before they could notice my presence. </p><p>I was glad that I did so, because its growth was a phenomenal experience, one of the greatest shows I had enjoyed. The little sapling continued growing at a shocking speed. First, two feet, then three. Soon, it was as tall as me, with its branches getting larger and larger, its emerald leaves thick enough to bend them. </p><p>There was only one problem. When it reached double my height, its growth slowed down significantly. It didn’t take long for me to catch the responsible. Its mana roots were continuously expanding no matter how much I worked to prune them, trying to replicate the size of the physical roots. </p><p>“Such a needy little tree,” I muttered as I decided to apply another solution, and encased its roots with wards, hoping that it would be enough. </p><p>It turned into a little disaster. Aether particles were destructive enough on their own, especially against wards I had deliberately designed as soft. Still, I was confident that I could come up with a solution if I worked enough. </p><p>But, my little project decided to react aggressively to the threat of being confined like that, lacking any advanced thought and limited to basic reflexes, and started attacking the ward from the inside. </p><p>Its mana roots weren’t the most excellent tool to do so, but the internal structure of the wards was defenseless as well, easily destroyed. Creating a bigger ward was out as well due to the nature of the Aether dimension, making the distance a confusing attribute. </p><p>“You win, you annoying plant,” I decided, surrendering my attempts to keep its mana roots short, instead of focusing on its growth. </p><p>It wasn’t like I was short of mana. </p><p>I continued to pump it full of easily digestible mana, its limited Spark working wonders to digest it, while my proto-HP worked hard to keep it healthy. Its height reached the mark of twenty feet, when its growth slowed down once more. </p><p>This time, the reason was more obvious. A flare of nature-life mana radiated out of the tree, and suddenly, the dead ground around it showed signs of life, a thin layer of grass appearing to cover the gray earth, pushing for life. </p><p>It was a fascinating view, one that I enjoyed seeing as I continued to pump mana, ready to get the attention of the undead as they sent more of their forces, the existence of the tree an excellent culprit to keep me hidden. </p><p>Unfortunately, this time, the next ward that triggered came from the opposite direction, downstream. </p><p>Elves were coming.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>It wasn’t bad that my plans were ruined. I wasn’t inflexible enough that a sudden change of circumstances that forced me to throw away most of my plans would leave me helpless. </p><p>Though, that didn’t feel me from feeling a deep annoyance, one that I forced myself to ignore to the best of my ability. Redrawing my plans was not a big problem, but redrawing my plans while I was leveraging my short action window was much more annoying.</p><p>Especially since half of the necromancers had already fallen, and their reduced numbers made it even harder for the rest to defend. As they got defeated, elves would return, and I didn’t want to trust my illusion capabilities to hide completely without the assistance of the wards.</p><p>I ignored the temptation of stealing the Divine Spark from the tree. The amount was not as important compared to my reserves, barely as much as I had put into the ward. And while the more Divine Spark was helpful, I preferred to keep the tree intact. </p><p>I had a feeling elves would react negatively to any harm to the tree, and it was not impossible for them to somehow discover I was responsible. After all, I had no idea about their magical capabilities, especially since I could see no mages as a part of the group.</p><p>It was a toss-up whether it was about the rarity of the mages among them, or the intensity of the battle they were suffering.</p><p>Instead, I started examining the Divine Spark in the tree, trying to understand how it was used. As far as I could see, the way the guardian tree used it somewhere between a solid node and a limited free flow, which positioned it right between a Chosen and Demi-God in terms of usage. It was not supposed to work like that, but clearly, being a semi-sentient plant had some impact on it. </p><p>I continued to examine the nature of the tree, measuring the merits of taking at least some of it, to try to create something similar to the fake Chosen node I had created for Light Divine Spark, which had came much more useful than I had been expecting. </p><p>I had no idea just how it could be used, but having options wouldn’t have harmed me. </p><p>Yet, I was about to take the risk, when I felt the tree starting to feed its mana into one of its branches. A branch that was holding a fruit — one that had the smallest, weakest flicker of Divine Spark I had ever felt. </p><p>Still, much better than harming the tree for the first layer of experimentation, I decided as I pulled the small fruit with a simple magical tendril, which looked like an overgrown hazelnut. While I was busy taking that fruit, another three necromancers decided to do particularly convincing renditions of porcupines, telling me that my temporary adventure was over. </p><p>I retreated before elves could return to handling the zombies, but I avoided the hill I  used as a vantage point. I wanted to do some experimentation, and no need to potentially waste such a strategic observation spot for that. </p><p>Pity that, with my limited observation abilities, I wasn’t confident enough to establish a teleportation beacon, or it would have been very useful. </p><p>I left the elves behind as they gathered around the largest tree and shouted, which was no doubt a celebration of victory, traveling back the path I had taken — taking a few seconds to disperse the wards I had created, as the undead didn’t have the chance to pull back after that, and I didn’t want to leave a trapped ward for my potential allies to find. </p><p>Instead, I traced my steps back upstream, staying near to water, wanting to see if there was any undead party that was willing to follow. For a moment, I was split between prioritizing an ambush and experimenting, before I noticed my folly. </p><p>I could do both, especially by creating a very convenient target. </p><p>First, I put my hand on the ground, sending arcana mana underground, using it as a detection. My trusty detection trick wasn’t as useful here, the natural mana interfering with the detection capabilities, but after several attempts, I discovered a natural cave, large enough to be temporary housing, yet close enough to the river to allow me to intervene or observe as necessary, and dug a tunnel.  </p><p>It was a frustrating affair that took a few minutes, the Arcana much less useful than Earth mana to do so, but it was nothing compared to my other aim. </p><p>Creating several tunnels that would allow me to escape without being noticed, deep enough that the interference would keep me from being detected as well. It was supposed to be the priority, but I could feel the throbbing under my fingers. </p><p>The seed hidden in the fruit was slowly losing its life.</p><p>I didn’t want to ruin my only tool of experimentation, so I decided to handle it the moment I finished the emergency escape tunnel. It was the first, and shortest among the tunnels I prepared — opened right under the river, allowing me an express escape path — I turned my attention to the seed. </p><p>I used the original entrance to travel to the surface, warded the entrance for concealment, and then, I planted the seed, right at the entrance, directly on top of the cavern. A risky proposition, but I had a feeling that if my experiment was successful, the seed would show its presence, working as a beacon for both elves and the undead. </p><p>Giving me a chance to observe whichever arrived first from my heavily warded location. And, while it was risky to do so without completing all the escape tunnels I wished, once again I had to choose immediate results over perfect safety. </p><p>First, I purified the ground from any necrotic energy, not wanting the seed to die the moment it touched the ground. Then, I pushed a tendril of Arcana mana into the seed, maintaining tight control over it not to affect the way it worked, but enough to allow me to observe the changes slowly.  </p><p>The seed worked even faster than I expected, a flicker of life appearing in its core as the surrounding protective layer cracked, and a thin tendril, the beginnings of a root, sank into the ground, searching for water…</p><p>And mana, I realized, as it pulled a very minuscule amount of mana from the ground, directing it toward its very small Divine Spark. For the seed, the Divine Spark was much more like a Chosen than a Demi-God, a crystallized core, inefficiently processing the mana.  </p><p>I decided to help it a little bit, using my own abilities to purify mana, softening its structure to the point of uselessness. </p><p>It proved to be a good choice, as the seed devoured that over-purified mana easily, transforming it with much greater speed, the growth of its root hastening rapidly, and soon, another tendril appeared on the opposite side, determined to breach the little layer of Earth that prevented it from receiving any light. </p><p>Though, I doubted that they required light as much as an ordinary plant, especially when compared to their clear need for mana. </p><p>Unlike its grown counterparts, the seed didn’t radiate any of its unique life energy, clearly using it for its own growth instead. Barely minutes later, it pushed its head through the surface. </p><p>I was carefully watching the state of its Divine Spark, hoping that it would get bigger. It wasn’t a big hope, but despite the limited probability, the potential implications were significant enough to make hope. </p><p>With my unique ability to break down Aether and Primordial Aether, I could easily imagine creating an amazing farm. Pity that turned out to be not possible. </p><p>“Even if you can’t give me infinite Divine Spark, you’re still good bait, I suppose,” I muttered as I prepared to move down the cave while continuing to feed the tree from my concealed spot, not wanting to take the risk of accidental discovery, when I decided to test another trick.</p><p>I stole half of the Divine Spark the seed had, only to watch its growth come to a standstill, even starting to lose its life. Yet, that didn’t last long before I ‘softened’ the Divine Spark, replicating the same trick I had pulled with the Headmistress, allowing the seed to bond with its Divine Spark more efficiently. </p><p>Then, I repeated the same trick again with the rest, even sacrificing some of my own Divine Spark to double the initial amount — after all, I could always take it back before leaving — until the sapling had passed the state of the other tree I had observed, handily reaching to Demi-God status.</p><p>I wasn’t surprised to see the tree absorbing the mana with an even greater speed, though amusingly, its growth slowed down. But I could see its structure getting stronger. </p><p>I was supposed to stop there, but sometimes, curiosity was hard to beat. I continued to replicate the trick, allowing the sapling to continue bonding with the Divine Spark even easier. </p><p>Until it turned into a God. An extremely weak one, but still a god. </p><p>What harm could it do, I thought as I continued to feed it purified mana, moving underground.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I used the simple Arcana spell to enhance my vision several times, the first thing I focused on was the cloaked figures, or more accurately, their physical natures, ones that looked human, with one great difference. </p><p>Their ears. </p><p>“Elves,” I muttered, though my shock was not particularly intense after facing another race that was supposed to be a part of the stories and legends. After all, after angels and true dragons that could transform, the existence of elves was not particularly ground-breaking. </p><p>Though my lack of impression was more about the unimpressive battle performance they had been displaying. There were almost fifty of them, trying to put a ranged resistance against the horde of undead that was trying to pass through the river, while about thirty necromancers — in various states of rotting — were sieging them with a number of spells, increasing the speed of the corruption. </p><p>Maybe I was being unfair, as lately I was used to fights of much higher caliber even by the standards of the System-empowered people, but still, I expected a better performance from one of the races that were supposed to be mythical. </p><p>They were barely good enough to be compared to an average level five warrior, with no apparent casting capability — though whether it was an actual lack of capability or strategic concern, I didn’t know. The only reason they were able to resist the necromancers was the constant life energy emission of the guardian trees, battling against the necrotic mana invasion. </p><p>Their luck was that the necromancers didn’t have a significantly higher display of ability, limited to galvanizing and empowering the horde of zombies — a mixture of animals and humanoids, mixed with various skeletal monstrosities impossible to identify — occasionally mixed with sending poorly crafted but overpowered bolts of necrotic energy. </p><p>However, it wasn’t their skills that looked like it would determine the victory and defeat, but the difference in intensity between the energy carried by the river, and the amount of mana generated by the trees. Each second, the central tree lost more of its vitality, and it didn’t take much to guess it would go down. </p><p>Elves had barely an hour, maybe even less. </p><p>I wanted to go and save them, even though their language represented a difficulty in communication. All I needed was to use create an offensive ward slowly from my battle position and take down the necromancers in one spell, before they could react. </p><p>Pity that it represented a great risk to me. I had already seen the lich that had responded to the dimensional breach, who was leagues stronger than anything I could see in this battle. </p><p>And, since the undead was sending a disposable army and set up a complicated mana delivery system to do so rather than just sending the lich to get rid of the threats, it was only reasonable to assume that what I was seeing wasn’t the peak combat capability of the elves. </p><p>Intervening directly in a complicated conflict was not a good idea, especially since I might end up being hunted by both sides. </p><p>“Luckily, intervening directly is not the only way,” I murmured with satisfaction. I might have lost my access to the Subterfuge skill, but at this point, I didn’t need it to have dozens of plans competing in my mind, giving me different ideas to interrupt the battle to the favor of elves. </p><p>The decision to help elves was not a huge overreach. I wasn’t certain that elves had the potential to be allies, but there was little doubt about the stance of the undead. Though, that didn’t mean I would reveal that particular assistance to the elves.  </p><p>First, I had created several wards on top of the hill, enough to hide my presence, as well as moving a few stones to create something that would keep me from being noticed. An illusion spell on top of it, and I was confident that it would keep me from the attention of anything but the most determined seeker. </p><p>Only then, I moved toward the river once again, staying quite a bit away from the battle, and started creating a ward. Essentially, it was a more complicated version of the purifying water bottle, but one that took almost half of the reserves I had collected, as well as some of the mana I had collected. </p><p>The real difference came from the last layer, which was not a ward but twin storage. Onee storage was filled with light mana, slowly adding some light mana into the water, converted by using the fake Chosen node I had created to trick the headmistress.  The other was filled with proto-life energy I had managed to create.</p><p>The results were worthy of potentially revealing my hand. Not only the ward suddenly stopped the flow of the necrotic energy, depriving the necromancers of their fuel to cast spells, but the particles of light also hampered the necromancers. Not particularly efficiently, as the amount was not enough to significantly damage the undead. </p><p>But enough to make it useless for necromancers to use — unlike pure mana, which I expected them to weaponize. And, the light mana made it much harder for them to focus destroying the proto-life energy I had slipped into the mixture, which was even more fragile than the energy the trees were radiating.</p><p>I retreated back to the hill as fast as I could manage once I activated the ward, not wanting to be on the range of detonation — a little gift I had added to the mixture, ready to go off at the first touch of an undead, both to get rid of any necromancer that might come to understand the sudden change in their battle, and to get rid of any evidence of my intervention. </p><p>If no one touched it, it would disperse on its own in five minutes, which I hoped to be enough for the elves to counterattack. Five minutes might as well be an eternity as far as a battle was concerned, and there was little hope for them if they couldn’t convert such a great advantage into victory. </p><p>I preferred to keep my presence hidden as much as possible, especially since there was a risk that the explosion could get the attention of the higher rank combatants of the elves and undead, which was something I was reluctant to face until I could get more information and get used to the magic more.</p><p>Maybe even craft something more useful than a wooden spear.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to play absolutely safely. I didn’t know how far the next defensive line of the elves was, but the undead forces looked determined to continue — why wouldn’t they, when they had no concern for their lives, nor had any logistic concerns. </p><p>And, the deeper we went into the elven territory, the higher the chances of stronger combatants joining the fray, making the situation much more challenging to face. </p><p>Luckily, when I reached my hiding spot, the battle had already shown signs of turning. The sudden lack of necrotic energy had hampered the necromancers’ attempts significantly, their magical bombardment ceasing immediately, their full attention to keeping their zombie horde intact. </p><p>The amount of life energy I managed to add into the water wasn’t enough to demolish the zombies — limited both by the amount, and the purity I could manage without the assistance of the system, which was handling the conversion part. </p><p>The more I stayed away, the more I understood the true challenge of magic outside lay in having access to the correct type of mana.  </p><p>And, with the ability of Divine Spark to forcibly convert mana, no doubt the gods ruled anywhere but the material plane under the System. </p><p>That left an interesting question, I thought as I ignored the elves’ developing counter-attack, instead looking at the guardian trees, each drinking the mana I provided almost instantly. And the largest one, right at the edge, took the most mana, its leaves showing signs of recovery, even as it radiated a great amount of its own unique brand of plant-like life energy. </p><p>The trees could convert my own mixture of diluted life energy and pure mana with much greater efficiency than necrotic energy, it seemed. </p><p>Enough to actually arouse my attention, tempting me to take another risky action. I moved toward the river, though rather than the center, I targeted the edges that were far from the battle, where I could see the tree with little battle that was going around it. </p><p>A few measly zombies were hardly a problem, especially since the attention of the elves was grabbed by the breach they achieved at the center, necromancers falling one by one. </p><p>While they were distracted by their assault, I quickly dashed through the zombies. I didn’t like wielding necrotic energy, but pulling enough around me on top of my shield to temporarily trick the zombies was still within acceptable limits. </p><p>I passed through them, putting my hand on the tree, sending a trickle of pure mana, doing as detailed of a diagnostic as I could manage, compressed in a few seconds. </p><p>Not the most detailed one, but enough to be a treasure trove. The first discovery was simple, yet expected. The tree was a magical entity, though the way the mana infused their nature greatly differed from the nature of the monsters. aLooser and more delicate, but it might be about the lack of an entity dedicated to recycle every single scrap of magical energy from the environment.</p><p>Yet, the limited reaction to the mana that was penetrating its trunk was enough to confirm that it was not sapient — or even if it was, it was alien enough for me to catch immediately. Though, I still sensed a certain … awareness, it wasn’t enough to be called sentience.  </p><p>Interesting, but not as interesting as my next discovery. At the center of the tree, there was Divine Spark. </p><p>Used to treating Divine Spark as the highest level of treasure, I had expected the guardian trees to be something similar to the river, a relay to transfer their transformed mana. The fact that the trees had Divine Spark was a surprise. </p><p>Enough to force me to redraw my plans completely.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Darion Williams was frustrated. </p><p>Which, admittedly, was not an unfamiliar feeling in his life. One didn’t climb out of the ghetto, not with the speed he had experienced, without feeling frustrated by the hand dealt to him by life. </p><p>But, in the place he grew, with his color, there were only two ways of getting out and making something of himself. Sports was one, but Darion lacked that. </p><p>So, he chose the second one, climbing through the ranks aggressively — even if it resulted in an occasional prison visit due to some necessary violence he needed to apply. Luckily, they were able to conceal that as a personal fight rather than organized crime, which meant that, even as the prosecutor did her best, they were only able to give little more than a year. </p><p>He was even able to make the judge ignore his prior, which was only right as he had been sixteen when he was caught stealing a car — but the racist judge was facing reelection that year, and decided to show just how tough she was against the crime by judging him as an adult. </p><p>And, six months later, he was out with prohibition, in an office building under construction, trying to get a janitor job to fulfill the terms of his parole. </p><p>Technically, he could have reached the gang to arrange one, but Darion knew that it was not the smartest idea. Owing more to the gang, even to solve the problems that had been created while working for them, was not a good idea. </p><p>At least, if one had the ambition to climb and become something more than just a street thug. </p><p>Not to mention, maintaining contact with the gang during the prohibition was the stupidest thing he could do. Conspiring with known felons was a parole violation, which would all that bitch persecutor would need to send him back to prison. </p><p>All he needed to be caught in the same building with some more gang members. </p><p>Luckily, he was smart enough to squirrel quite a bit of his earnings to the side, and laundered it through a little coffee shop he opened, freeing himself from the obligation of asking the gang for the money. </p><p>He was even able to bribe a recruiter to arrange a job for him, which was the reason for his current frustration, as he stood in a half-completed office building, about to be interviewed for a janitor position.</p><p>He was sure he would get the job, because a part of the bribe that went to the recruiter — alongside a useful threat — made sure that the recruiter didn’t send any profile that would be actually useful for the last two weeks, making them desperate for a janitor. </p><p>The half-set-up state of the current floor further highlighted their need. </p><p>Technically, he didn’t need to have menial work to fulfill the need, but it would be a more convincing parole story for him. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t prevent his frustration even as he heard the distinctive click of heeled shoes. </p><p>His interviewer was about to arrive, he realized, but deliberately left his back toward that, until he heard the voice. “Are you Darion?” a voice asked. Darion smirked as the voice hit his ear, a vision immediately appearing in his mind. </p><p>It was a young voice, yet it radiated a dismissal, which was enough to confirm Darion that she was a beautiful young woman, the kind that developed that confidence by the number of idiot simps that threw themselves to her feet just to earn a smile. </p><p>Yet, her accent confirmed that she certainly didn’t grow up rich. It wasn’t a domineering accent, but it was enough to confirm she went to one of the poorer public schools. </p><p>Of course, her dismissing confidence fully confirmed that she was white. </p><p>He turned, fully expecting to see another platinum-blonde white secretary, only to realize he had been mistaken. </p><p>She was a redhead. </p><p>A very sexy one.</p><p>“Finally,” she said even as she threw a dismissive glance toward him, one that radiated supreme confidence about her position in life. After all, she was a secretary, while Darion was a poor little black man who had no choice but to work as a janitor. </p><p>Darion smiled in anticipation even as his gaze danced up and down, but he managed to conceal it with a shake of his head. </p><p>Not because he was afraid of being caught leering, but because he wanted to bruise her ego. </p><p>The way she dressed, her short skirt, and her jacket left in doubt whether she was wearing anything underneath in the first place were highly inappropriate for the workplace, even for a marketing agency with a looser approach to workplace rules. It shouted she was supremely invested in the way she looked. </p><p> And, the easiest way to tease such a woman was to act like her beauty didn’t work as intended. </p><p>A lesson Darion learned by interacting with the white rich girls that hang around the gang just for the thrill — well, the thrill and the drugs. The less impressed Darion acted with their beauty, the more they worked to prove their ‘beauty’. </p><p>With some incredible fun potential. </p><p>Of course, Darion wasn’t silly enough to assume the nameless secretary would act exactly like those thrill-seeking women, as the whole power structure around the situation was different, and he was a poor janitor trying to apply for a job rather than a dangerous gangster. </p><p>Still, baby steps he thought even as he opened his mouth. “You’re here for the interview?” Darion asked. </p><p>“What gave you that impression,” she answered bitingly, showing Darion’s little dismissal was just enough to unsettle her. </p><p>“Lead the way, then,” Darion said with a shrug. </p><p>She turned with a huff, though Darion noted her turn was faster than necessary, enough to throw her skirt into motion and give him a glimpse of her underwear. </p><p>A rather impressive sexy piece. </p><p>Too bad for her Darion was quick enough to hide his glance, as she failed to find him gaping as she wished when she threw a glance behind her. “Follow me to the meeting room,” she said as she walked in front of him. </p><p>Her hips swayed excessively. </p><p>He just smirked as he followed her inside, struggling to suppress a smile as he realized his prohibition wouldn’t be as boring as he had first thought. </p><p>“Lead the way,” he said, even though she brought him to a meeting room just a few steps away from what he had been waiting for. </p><p>She sat in front of him, her pose challenging yet revealing, doing her best to highlight her beauty. Darion wasn’t surprised by her attitude… It was exactly how he expected her to react.</p><p>Her tone was contrasting. “Tell me, why do you want to be a … janitor,” she said, her dismissal in her last words rather excessive. She was clearly trying to retaliate against his lack of simping. </p><p>He shrugged, letting his smirk widen. Considering he was doing it just to avoid legal attention for a few months, it wasn’t the cutting remark she thought it was. </p><p>“Well, there’s not much work for someone in my status,” he said, enjoying the wave of unease that passed through her at the mention of my felon status, which was hard to hide. “A fight that went out of control, and my job prospects are ruined,” he added, explaining his status a bit more. </p><p>He wanted to just unsettle her, after all, not make her panic enough to reject her even with the lack of janitorial staff they were suffering. </p><p>The uneasy expression of a smug white bitch was always satisfactory. </p><p>“Good to know, and I don’t need to tell you that we don’t condone anything like that here!” she said sharply. </p><p>“Of course,” Darion answered, letting his smirk widen. “I learned my lesson and I’m ready to be a productive member of society. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, her distaste growing at Darion’s dismissive tone. He had no doubt that, if he hadn’t been blocking the other candidates, she would have already sent him away. </p><p>Not that he put too much effort into that, considering they were giving minimum wage for a job that required a lot of physical effort. Not exactly a line begging in the first place. </p><p>“So, what’s your work, sweetie? You must be a receptionist or something considering you’re saddled with the responsibility of the first interview. Maybe we shouldn’t waste too much time. Just let me meet with someone allowed to make decisions.” </p><p>Darion enjoyed her growing frustration with each word, her fury growing as his words it. </p><p>“I’m not the receptionist. I’m the private secretary of the owner, and I’m the one that would decide whether you’re hired or not. Push your luck, and you won’t be hired.” </p><p>Darion shrugged dismissively, showing her flare of anger was not worked on him at all. It was much easier to push someone after knowing she had no choice but to hire him. </p><p>“Then, make your choice sweetie,” Darion said as he stood up. “I don’t have all day to kill. Yes, or no?” </p><p>He didn’t even wait as he started walking toward the door, enjoying the angry gasp that she let out. “Stop, you can’t go anywhere before I allow you.” </p><p>“That only works if I’m hired, sweetie. Should I assume that I’m hired?” </p><p>That hardly helped her anger, but her answer reached soon after. “Yes,” she growled in anger. “You’re hired.”</p><p>His smile grew as he departed, aware he had just left his new coworker fuming in anger.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Playing with Sapphire was fun, I thought with a slight reluctance as I pulled back from my comfortable position between her legs. Unfortunately, speaking with Valkyrie was more important than teasing Sapphire more. Not only we had a fake-assassination plan, but also I was curious about her findings about the North. </p><p>Considering it was the topic that resulted in my capture in the first place, it was a dangerous oversight — though, to my defense, I was busy. </p><p>And, to be honest, the fact that Sapphire was holding under my playful teasing a bit too well, which reduced the amusement I derived from the situation significantly. </p><p>I might as well move to the next step, I thought, my smirk wide as I suddenly popped under the desk. Sapphire gasped in shock, but while she had many admirable qualities across a great number of topics, from dancing to political acumen sharp enough to make a knife jealous, her reflexes weren’t one of those qualities. </p><p>Nor was her ability to handle sudden changes. </p><p>This was why, as I suddenly rose from under her desk to stand next to her, looking and Valkyrie, her only reaction was a panicked gasp as she froze. </p><p>Valkyrie reacted just like I expected. Someone else might have jumped back in panic, doing their best to open the gap as much as possible, but doing so would mean cutting their link with the ground, which, in turn, would hamper their ability to dodge further. </p><p>She took a half speed back, her hand already on her waist — the fact that she was actually allowed to carry her sword showed the extent of the trust she had — ready to attack and block. </p><p>Even her face was calm, though I was familiar enough to read the tightening of her lips. Anyone else would have been shouting in anger. </p><p>“Oh, it’s you,” she muttered calmly as she looked at me, then the Queen. “I should have guessed a rat like you are not easy to squash. So, your disappearance was planned.” </p><p>I just chuckled. She wasn’t a foul-mouthed person unless she was unsettled, which showed her shock even better than her expression. Her gaze fell on Sapphire, realizing that it was not the right attitude to have against her ruling monarch. </p><p>“Well, not entirely, but Sapphire here proved to be a doll to work with,” I said with a chuckle as I caressed her cheek, making her blush. “Luckily, she also knows the value of a good deal.” </p><p>Sapphire’s lack of objection told a story, enough to make her eyes widen in shock. “I … see,” she murmured, her gaze bouncing between us. </p><p>I chuckled as she fell silent, trying to come to terms with the realization. To her credit, she was handling it better than I had expected, which was why I saw no problems shocking her more. I pulled Sapphire off her seat and sat on the chair instead. </p><p>And pulled her to my lap, with my arms around her waist, lazy yet suggestive at the same time. “Yes, Sapphire here shares your sensibilities toward cooperation, believing that, sometimes titles were best ignored while making a good deal.” </p><p>“And … what’s this situation that requires that deal,” she asked, though her tone carried little curiosity. I smirked. She was a remarkable woman, but that didn’t mean that she was above her prejudices. Seeing her Queen making a deal with a Dark Lord, it was clear that her assumption was that it was a political ploy. </p><p>The kind that she hated most. </p><p>Sapphire was lucky that I was not at the point of undermining her, because that moment would have given me a great tool to do so, finally recruiting Valkyrie more directly. Instead, I resolved it immediately. “Nothing much,” I said with exaggerated laziness. “Just two mystical races, Phoenixes and Elves, appearing again, and looking determined to take us down.”</p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth. Annoyance accompanied it for a moment as she realized I was teasing her deliberately, but she chose not to focus on that aspect. Her familiarity was useful, as she knew that I wouldn’t joke about such a thing. </p><p>Of course, while that didn’t prevent a suspicious glint as she considered that I was the engineer of such a weird situation, engineering a fake crisis, she abandon that part equally quickly. “Exactly, I would have gone with something much simpler,” I answered with a chuckle. Faking two mystical races was not a simple thing. </p><p>Valkyrie had some faults, but luckily, impracticality was not one of them. “The creatures at the North, is this about them?” she said as her gaze tightened. </p><p>“Very likely,” I answered. “We don’t have any evidence yet, but it would be too coincidental otherwise. </p><p>“It might be someone trying to muddy the waters,” she offered.</p><p>“Well, not impossible,” I countered. “Unfortunately, the fact that we have another party aware of it, and trying to create a crisis is even less likely. I’m more inclined to believe that it’s elves, especially since they had already arranged the throne room perfectly to change the ruler,” I said. </p><p>“Wait, what?” she asked. </p><p>“They managed to establish some wards that managed to avoid the attention of the court mages,” I said before giving a quick breakdown of the wards. </p><p>“That useless bums,” she growled in dismissal, and Sapphire nodded, though that didn’t prevent her annoyed glance at me at the ease I was handling Valkyrie, revealing just how far our communication went in the first place. </p><p>“Deal with it,” I whispered into her ear, like trying to suborn one of her most loyal generals was something to be dismissed casually. </p><p>Admittedly, compared to everything else I had done — even the things she was aware of — it wasn’t absurd to categorize that as simple. I chucked at her annoyed glare, gripping her legs tighter to extract a beautiful moan. </p><p>Valkyrie paused for a moment. “Then, what’s the plan. Do we go to the North and handle it directly?” </p><p>“No, we still don’t know if it’s a genuine attempt or just a distraction. We can’t really commit to that.” </p><p>“We can’t leave the North unattended either, the nearest settlement might not be near, but once the defenses are breached, we don’t know what kind of threat will come down. Maybe I should go there—“ she added heatedly, but I interrupted her. </p><p>“No, there’s a reason I arranged your summoning. We need someone we absolutely trust to handle some stuff here.” I smirked. “You can imagine I can’t just go around and make a show. And since Sapphire is going to be dead…” </p><p>“W-what!” she gasped before stopping, realizing my smirk. “That, we can talk later. We can’t leave the North alone, no matter what.” </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said, letting my smirk widen. “That’s why we’re going to send Lancelot there.” </p><p>Her reaction was even bigger than seeing me treat her Queen like a bar wench, keeping her on my lap. “You can’t allow that vainglorious idiot to go there. He’ll just screw up everything. War is not a game.” </p><p>I smirked, amused by her vitriol. I wasn’t the only one that hated that blond idiot. “Don’t worry, that vainglorious moron is actually stupid enough to sell himself to the elves, hoping that they would reward his loyalty. So, we send him there…” </p><p>“And either it’s the elves that are causing the problem, and stops to protect him…” she muttered.</p><p>“Or, it’s a different group, and we leave elves between the choice of abandoning their critical agent or solving it. Either way, we can just open the paths to send reinforcements.” </p><p>“What are the paths?” she asked. </p><p>“Some kind of secret magical transport,” I explained, enough to placate her. “Now, about the assassination,” I said. </p><p>“You’re going to arrange a fake assassination to remove the Queen as a target, and need someone reliable to arrange it.” </p><p>“Half-true,” I answered. “Arranging the assassination is trivial,” I said, which was true, especially if I asked Cinder to intervene. “We need you to be the bodyguard for Aria, while also handling her political activities, to make sure no one could force her into a dangerous position. The farther she could stay away from the mess, the better.” </p><p>“Yeah, she doesn’t have the correct attitude for that cesspool,” she accepted. </p><p>“Exactly,” I said, amused that just how little it took to handle two huge issues as well as reveal several huge secrets. Anyone else would have been catatonic. </p><p>Yet, my favorite knight just took it all in stride. </p><p>There was a reason I liked her. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was putting the last touches on the test setup, when Coach Juana arrived, carrying a large file with her. “Their physical results,” she said. “I’m sure it’ll be very useful.” </p><p>“Oh, it will,” I said, my smirk widening as I flipped through, checking the content. But, as I could check, her phone started ringing. She rejected the call, only for it to start ringing again.</p><p>Then, my phone started buzzing as well. </p><p>“I have made the first declaration,” she said. </p><p>“Really, what exactly did you say?” </p><p>“Any player that doesn’t come to the stadium in an hour will be permanently kicked out of the team, with no chance of playing again,” she asked. </p><p>“Daring,” I said. “I like it. I wonder how much the dean and the sports director would like it.” </p><p>“Oh, they will hate it,” she answered, but her expression was tight, showing she didn’t enjoy that particular fact. Not that hard to understand, considering the two mentioned had the ability to fire her. She sighed. “But they won’t do anything else until the match. Public relations is already a nightmare, and they won’t risk the responsibility falling on them. Just make sure we don’t get humiliated too badly.” </p><p>I chuckled. “And to think that they don’t even know the little gift we’re preparing for them.” </p><p>“Let’s hope they take it in good humor,” she delivered in a deadpan voice before walking away, going back to join Kim and Megan — who were already walking around, documenting the state of the stadium. </p><p>Leaving me alone with the team. </p><p>“That’s enough run, everyone buys red sixteen, start stretching,” I shouted, leaving the player that had mouthed me off to complete his punishment rounds.</p><p>Marcus took over leading their stretching, which gave me enough time to go through their physical records. There, my traits once again proved exemplary, allowing me to get an accurate understanding of their physical capabilities through the numbers on the folders, allowing me to further my already deep understanding.</p><p>With the benefits of Pattern Recognition, the more data I had, the better. </p><p>“Now, to the drills,” I called. “I want to see how hard you can hit,” I shouted, pointing at several players who were considerably larger than the others, playing the linemen — mostly defensive, but a few offensive linemen from the practice team sprinkled around. </p><p>Then, I turned toward the others. “And the rest, we’re going to practice receiving and defending at the same time,” I said. “Line up in pairs. With every whistle, two pairs will dash forward. I want the receiver to run their best route, and the defender to do their best to block the pass. I will throw the pass to one of the two. The one that doesn’t receive the pass would switch to defense,” I said. </p><p>“That’s a bit…” started one of the practice players, only to fall silent when my gaze fell on him. </p><p>“Weird, of course,” I completed his comment. “No coach would use such a training, but then, no coach has to deal with trying to build a team in three days,” I said. I chuckled as I played with the ball in hand. “Of course, I’ll keep a record of successes and failures,” I reminded, then threw the ball, directly to the back of one of the linemen, flying hard enough to hurt. “No half-assed effort!” I shouted, my voice loaded with Intimidation. </p><p>“Yes, coach,” came a frightened shout, and I turned back to receivers, my little display enough to convince them that I would be observing them very carefully. </p><p>“Now, pair up,” I shouted, and watched them line up against each other, though I had corrected a couple pairings to avoid horrible mismatches. “And, don’t forget to bring the ball back here,” I shouted. </p><p>I whistled, making the first pair burst into motion, watching both of them cut inside with sharp angles. Slants, which was the easiest route to run and throw, but also with the most limited gain potential. </p><p>I didn’t blame them, but I also had no intention of making their job any easier. My arm flashed with my unnatural strength, and the ball flew like a bullet. </p><p>Only to bounce off the receiver’s hands, who reacted it far too late. The rest of the crowd was split between gasping in shock and cheering — which was understandable, as I applied even more of my increased capabilities, making a throw that would have been impressive for a professional player. </p><p>I didn’t even wait for the stumbling players to get up before I whistled once more, but this time, the next pair was unprepared for the action. They received their punishment, in the form of two balls flying toward them, hitting them right on the chest. “Next,” I shouted in warning, and the next pair moved to their place, with a significant urgency, realizing that I wanted to run the drill much faster than they had been expecting. </p><p>As they took their position, I threw another ball toward the linemen's drill, once again catching another slacker. “No half-assed effort,” I warned, then blew the whistle once more.</p><p>This time, the receivers decided on different strategies. One of them run a corner route, which was one of the harder routes to throw, working only when the receiver was considerably better. </p><p>Or, when the quarterback had supernatural pinpoint accuracy. </p><p>I let out a touch pass, soaring in the air, and it seemed that the receiver expected that the receiver — a familiar face from the practice squad, the basketball player that had joined the team on the same day as me, even fighting against me during the fateful bet that started everything — managed to time his attempt perfectly, catching the ball. </p><p>I whistled once more, not spending any time in chitchat, but in my mind, I had already identified him as one of the potential starters. With the dearth of offensive talent, we were suffering after the exodus, he was certainly good enough to maintain that position unless he screwed up horribly. </p><p>The next two decided to copy him and run corner routes, only to learn that touch passes were not as easy to catch as they looked when thrown by the sharp arch I preferred, and soon, we had fallen into the rhythm. </p><p>A rhythm that I didn’t disrupt even when some new players come trickling forth. Megan was once again proving her expertise. I didn’t deal much with the new players, pausing only a second to order them to put on pads and start running. </p><p>Not the best greeting, but the combination of leadership and intimidation worked wonders to grind out the edges. Even with that, a few players turned and left, of course, but I lacked the time to cater to their egos, while I was desperately trying to cobble enough to fill a roster in half a day. </p><p>I didn’t have the luxury of spending more time. </p><p>But, as they joined, I started to identify some interesting candidates. One sprinter dashed desperately forward in a simple fly route, yet fast enough to leave his defender back by two feet when the ball hopelessly passed through his hands. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the traits enhancing my vision, I might have assumed that it was just a lack of experience or timing failure, but I could see that it was a more fundamental lack of hand-eye coordination. </p><p>Fascinatingly bad hand-eye coordination, considering he was running excellently. </p><p>“Marcus, take him and work him on how to jam the initial release, he’ll be a cornerback,” I said, assigning him a role immediately. </p><p>“Actually, I was hoping to be a receiver—“ he started, only for a ball to fly toward him, bouncing off his chest, before he could even react. With pads, it didn’t hurt, but it was enough to make a point. </p><p>“I hope you’re not saying that defense is the worst part of the team,” I growled, putting an exaggerated threatening display, enough to look comical compared to my usual attitude, Marcus chuckled while he panicked. “O-of course not,” the new player moved to follow Marcus, and they started working on the cornerback tricks. </p><p>It was important to have good cornerbacks, so I tried to pay more attention to him, occasionally throwing on corrections and warnings toward him, at the cost of paying less attention to linemen's core. </p><p>Soon, I sent a few more new players with little to no hand coordination to join them. They lacked the skill, but they had enough speed to keep the passing windows tight. </p><p>As long as they were not tricked by the footwork of the receivers. </p><p>I hoped that three days would be enough for that particular fact. </p><p>I continued throwing the ball even as I turned to my next, even bigger problem. </p><p>Who the hell was going to be the quarterback if I couldn’t play. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Welcome,” I said as I looked at them, letting my gaze dance over their bodies for a long, self-indulgent moment, appreciating the effort they managed to put the way they looked even when I called them during this ungodly hour as much as their natural beauty.</p><p>Megan skipped her usual preference toward short skirts, instead preferring to wear jeans, though the skin-tight pants displayed her beautiful legs as well as her skirts, combining beautifully with her crop top. Her makeup and hair were perfect as usual, making me wonder if she lived with a team of professionals. </p><p>One had to admire competency regardless of the subject.</p><p>Kim, on the other hand, dressed in her usual leather ensemble, giving a natural look like didn’t even know what makeup was — which was, amusingly, a look that required an equally long time in front of a makeup table to achieve. </p><p>“Let me introduce you to Megan and Kim, coach, the two that would manage our vicious social media counterattack against the corrupt management,” I said. “Assuming you don’t mind, of course,” I said as I turned toward them. </p><p>“Well,” Megan said, stretching the word even as she raised her hand, checking her nails. “It’s not exactly the type of publicity I like to be involved in, but it’s worth for an unrestricted favor,” she said. </p><p>I smirked back. I had many ways to make her use that favor in a way that wouldn’t inconvenience me too much  — while making sure she enjoyed it thoroughly as well. </p><p>I looked at Kim, who just nodded. “Excellent. Then,  operation let’s ruin the dean’s day can begin,” I said. “We need to raise as much stink as we can manage on social media.” </p><p>“Do you want people to hate the dean, or Coach Spencer,” Megan asked, not wasting her time with pointless questions. </p><p>“Equal amounts, but don’t forget to occasionally target the offensive players who chose to betray the team at such a critical juncture,” I reminded her. “I hope it wouldn’t be a problem.” </p><p>Megan smirked. “Oh, believe me, it won’t,” she said. “Anything else?” </p><p>“I want you to reach some of the players in the other teams, preferably sprinters and basketball players that can play the skill positions. We need some receivers and running backs, though a few players strong enough to play blockers wouldn’t be bad as well.” </p><p>“That’s more difficult,” she said. “Especially when the football team is such a mess.” </p><p>“We wouldn’t be throwing around starter positions like candy if things were going well, do we?” I asked.    </p><p>“Good point,” Megan said, already typing some messages. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “Do you want me to be the one to talk?” I asked. </p><p>“God no, why do we put your ugly mug there, when we have the first female coach of our football team, forced into a horrible situation just to make a sleazy rich boy look better,” she said. </p><p>“Is it necessary?” the coach asked, looking slightly worried.</p><p>“Well, there are risks. If we fail, it’ll ruin your reputation even worse, but it’ll make sure they can’t just sweep it out, or make a show of fixing the situation by finding a more competent coach to take over. For good or bad, you’ll be identified with our little resistance.” </p><p>“It all depends on how brave you are,” Kim declared. Juana looked at her angrily, but it was enough to conclude the decision nonetheless. </p><p>The coach looked at Kim angrily, but Kim just shrugged, her beautiful red hair dancing. Silence ruled the room for a moment, but it seemed that Coach Juana had already made her decision. </p><p>“I better go and handle the training,” I said, pausing for a moment to see if any of them had anything else to say. But Megan was occupied with her phone, while the coach was busy glaring daggers at Kim, who was smirking unashamedly. </p><p>I left, not bothering to give detailed commands to Megan. She showed me that she was skilled enough to handle the situation. Not to generate an outright win, of course, but I didn’t need that. </p><p>I just needed enough chaos to operate. </p><p>I grabbed my books once again, my guide floating behind me, uncaring of the mortal concerns I had been displaying. </p><p>I swung by the locker room, and saw the people in varying states of preparation. “You have two minutes to be on the field, and every ten seconds or missing piece of gear is a full lap,” I shouted, the amount of Intimidation I used leaving no doubt about the seriousness of the threat.</p><p>“Yes, Coach,” they shouted reflexively, which would have been a playful statement if it wasn’t for the fear in their tone. Even discounting the Intimidation, they had long learned that I followed my threats. </p><p>It was another lesson I learned in the streets. Earning a reputation for throwing empty threats was the best way of losing all credits. People were much more careful messing with you if they knew every threat you let out would turn into reality…</p><p>One way or another.</p><p>I chuckled even as I swung by the equipment room, only to find it locked. Another little attempt to make our lives difficult. </p><p>“Annoying,” I said, but a kick was enough to break the lock. Even without the Strength, breaking a door wasn’t as difficult as people assumed — especially if the door in question was not reinforced —  and with the boost of the Strength, breaking it down was trivial. </p><p>I moved around quickly, first pushing out a few tackling dummies to the corridor, ready to be picked up by the players, then grabbed a great number of balls, cones, and a great number of other gadgets. </p><p>I needed to design a new team, effectively from the scratch. No teams didn’t deal with that, usually, only a portion graduated, with enough underclassmen to replace the losses, and even then, they had a full year to redesign the team. </p><p>I had less than a week to find players for each role including offense, defense, and special teams, while making sure everyone learned and practiced.</p><p>Even with my supernatural advantages, it was a difficult mission.</p><p>Those fucking shadows, I thought even as I balanced as much weight I could manage while keeping the book open, letting my guide continue reading, not wanting to interrupt her for long.  </p><p>When I arrived at the field, some of the players there, warming up, while the others were still arriving. “You, you, and you, start running,” I ordered the one that arrived a few seconds late — which I had seen from the window while getting the equipment — “and, the rest, go and bring the tackling dummies from the corridor. </p><p>“Isn’t staff supposed to do that,” one of the veterans asked, though he was already walking, meaning it was more of an idle complaint. </p><p>“Which staff, exactly?” I asked with a sigh, commiserating with him. No need to bite his head off just because he displayed some frustration. </p><p>They disappeared even as another group, mostly practice squad players, arrived. “Start running, gentlemen,” I ordered.</p><p>“Why do we have to listen to him,” murmured one of the players, barely enough for me to catch even with my Traits.</p><p>“What did you say, red sixteen, you want to double your punishment run, done,” I called, making him stumble on his feet in shock, realizing he had been caught. He looked at me, and met with my grin that left no doubt about exactly what he had said.</p><p>He lacked the courage to push for more. “Catch up with the group if you don’t want another extra lap,” I warned, and he started running. “Red twenty-two, keep your stance straight, and don’t drag your feet. We don’t want an injury,” I called, followed by several more comments.</p><p>It was good to radiate an aura of superior awareness, both to avoid slacking, and to make sure they put in the necessary effort. The sooner they realized I was not playing around but could actually catch them slacking, the better their efforts would be. </p><p>Meanwhile, the tackling dummies arrived at the field. “Place them to the left side,” I ordered, but walked there to help them after I finished spreading the other practice items I had brought along. </p><p>“Join up the run and warm up, I’ll handle the rest,” I said as I started spreading them around,  my attention on the runners  — particularly the practice squad players, who I didn’t watch carefully before. </p><p>I needed to make a decision on the positions, after all...</p>",

    "content": "<p>“That’s enough, now, go and change, we’re going to have full-pad training,” I said. “You have  five minutes to get ready, or ….” I said, underlining the last word with a subtle threat. “And, the current state of the locker room is definitely not an excuse, understood!” </p><p>“Yes, Coach,” called Marcus jokingly, and the rest of the players laughed, taking my sudden display of authority in good humor. In the current state, even the worst leadership was better than no leadership.  </p><p>And, I was confident that mine certainly didn’t count as the worst. </p><p> Interestingly, Coach Juana didn’t react as badly as I expected her to react to that statement, waiting silently while the players departed, accepting my sudden assertion of authority. </p><p>“So, Coach,” she said, her voice biting, but not angry. “What do you have in mind?” </p><p>“Well, Coach,” I answered, not bothering to hide my chuckle as I pulled a seat. “That depends on what you want. After all, officially, you have the power. At least, that’s what I assume with all other Coaches playing hooky.” </p><p>“With a great coincidence, every single one of them is facing family emergencies, and their leave is approved.” </p><p>“Let me guess, yours didn’t,” I said. </p><p>“I didn’t apply one in the first place,” she said, and I quirked my eyebrow. “By taking command of your team during the show, I find myself inevitably linked to the mess. They decided that I make a convenient patsy for the disaster.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said. Coach Spencer made no attempt to hide his attraction to her, and I had no doubt that, if she wished so, she could use her ‘assets’ to shift sides. But her presence here meant that she wasn’t willing to take that step, so I didn’t bother mentioning that part. “I’m guessing you don’t have the chance to change sides.” </p><p>“No,” she said with a sardonic smile. “The sports directorate already informed that they would treat any attempt to take time off as resignation. And I decided that, a short stint as an interim head coach, no matter how short and humiliating, might be a good addition to my CV, at least to get another conditioning coach role elsewhere.” She chuckled. “Maybe at the other side of the country, where the news won’t reach, of course.” </p><p>“Cheer up, coach,” I said with a shrug. “Things aren’t that bad?” </p><p>She paused for a moment. “Concussion report?” she asked hopefully. </p><p>Her hope was understandable. I had shown enough skill in the quarterback position. A fast quarterback with my tactical capabilities would have been enough to carry the team, especially against the teams we were playing against. </p><p>And, that said nothing about my defensive performance. </p><p>“Unfortunately, it’ll stay in place at least for a match,” I said. Technically, I had a way to remove it, but I didn’t want to go and surrender to her before I could get a better sense of the professor — in particular, making sure that her findings wouldn’t make me end up in a secret government facility. </p><p>“I see,” she answered, her shoulders slouching, her despair clear. </p><p>“Don’t be like that, Coach,” I said as I touched her chin. “Just because I can’t play doesn’t mean I can’t help you ruin that asshole’s plan.” </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she asked, her tone much less enthusiastic than the players. Unfortunately, she was hopeless in the middle of the sea, shipwrecked, not in a position to ask whether it was a shark or a dolphin that was swimming toward her. </p><p>Anything was better than slowly dying. </p><p>“Well, that depends on just how much of a mess you’re willing to create.” </p><p>“Against that asshole, as much as possible,” she declared, answering casually. I noted that her treatment toward me was getting laxer, treating me more as a colleague than a player. Which was useful… </p><p>I chuckled. “No, not just against that asshole, or I wouldn’t have bothered to ask. I have a fun plan in mind, which should be enough for you to get a job elsewhere in the worst case, but it’ll also anger the management quite a bit. Can you handle the heat?” </p><p>Her vicious smile was enough as an answer. </p><p>“Excellent. First, you’re going to put a message out, declaring that any player that doesn’t join the evening meeting would be kicked out of the team, no exception,” I said. </p><p>“That…” she muttered. “None of the offensive players would follow that call. They are firmly on his side.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I know, but it’s not like they will actually be useful even if they come to join us. We can’t trust them not to screw up in a game. It’s better to cut them off from returning and making a mess halfway.” </p><p>“But, sports director would…” she started. </p><p>“Do nothing, because they will have a different mess to deal with,” I said. “I’ll make sure that they will have bigger things to deal with than the decisions of an Interim Coach, especially since they would assume they could simply reverse it once they returned.” </p><p>“You want to rebuild the offense,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “At this point, it’s inevitable. Due to that moron, they are simply too entitled to work with. I could have worked with them if there’s no hope of Spencer returning, but with that hanging above us, it’s a pointless mess.” </p><p>That was true, but only partially. The greater truth was, I was not in a habit of forgiving my enemies, and the offensive team did their best to earn that title in my mind. I had no intention of catering to the ego of my enemies, especially when the benefits were negligible. </p><p>If we win with the offensive team, it would reduce the desperation of our situation, but it would also give another avenue for Coach Spencer to retaliate. I rather lose closely with new players than </p><p>“Where are we going to find new players? Chess team?” </p><p>I chuckled. “I wish that was an option, but you’ll find that the rest of the team is not as hardworking. But I’m sure I can cobble up enough players from the other teams, at least enough to put a full squad,” I said. </p><p>“That still leaves the mess the stadium is in. That would be just another problem.” </p><p>“That’s what I have in mind to solve it,” I said. “I’ll join the coaching staff temporarily, as a play-caller for the defense officially, but I’ll also handle the offense unofficially. You’ll be both the offensive play caller and the head coach, naturally,” I said. </p><p>“You’re going to take the whole workload, then?” she asked suspiciously. </p><p>“Hell no,” I answered. “Have you seen the state of the locker rooms and the rest of the facility,” I said. </p><p>She shook her head, showing that she missed that detail while focusing on the tactical aspects. “Why?” she said.</p><p>“Believe me, if you have seen it, you wouldn’t have asked,” I said. “Coaching staff is not the only one that decided to take a holiday, none of the janitorial or maintenance staff is working, and someone needs to fight with the management about that.” </p><p>“I see,” she said, her eyes widening. “But, if they are doing that deliberately, they’ll just delay my requests.” </p><p>“I have a way of lighting a fire under them, but the heat will be uncomfortable for you as well,” I said. “That’s why it depends on your decision.”  </p><p>“It can’t be worse than the current situation,” she offered. </p><p>“Well, it’ll mark you as a troublemaker to management,” I said, not hiding the risk — especially since it was an obvious one that she would catch the moment I had gone through my explanation.  </p><p>She paused for a moment, smart enough to understand the implications, but then gestured me to continue. </p><p>“The state of the stadium is an excellent opportunity. We’re going to escalate the situation even more, directly blaming the dean for getting bribes from Spencer, just to put him back in the coaching seat, even going as far as to sabotage the stadium operations. And we add some interviews   and other pity pieces, it should be enough to stop management from acting overtly.” </p><p>“What happens if we lose the game this Sunday,” she said, immediately catching the crux of the matter. After all, our little pity piece would point as underdogs, and people loved underdogs…</p><p>As long as the underdog created a good story... </p><p>“Well, considering our record, losing shouldn’t be that humiliating, as long as we put an exciting game. Good defense, and some intense running game to kill the clock should have been enough to push things forward,” I declared confidently, even as I looked toward my guide.</p><p>Worst, I could ask my annoying angel a few tricks to swing the game. A magical slip here and there should have been sufficient to sway even the most unbalanced game, and I was confident in my tactical acumen to keep it close in the first place.</p><p>Especially since I was confident in making the players listen. Leadership was useful in that aspect.</p><p>And, Intimidation was even more useful. </p><p>“What exactly do you have in mind?” she said. “I want to hear all the details before committing.” </p><p>Before I could answer, the door opened without a knock, Megan and Kim walked inside.</p><p>“Excellent, our helpers are here.”</p>",

Said Miss Warrick was still blushing, but it was less intense than her earlier reaction, which was enough to confirm that she had no idea what was going on. </p><p>After all, what was going on under the table was much more impressive than the little kiss she had stumbled upon.  </p><p>Carrie didn’t wait before answering. “This is Chad, Miss Warrick, a transfer student that joined our school the last week.” </p><p>“Oh, last week,” she said with a shy chuckle. “I see that you’re making your best to accommodate him.” </p><p>Carrie froze for a moment, thinking that she realized what was going on. “She’s talking about the kiss,” I whispered to her. “Well, you know how it goes…” Carrie said, relaxed, but not enough to sound calm. </p><p>Miss Warrick chuckled. “Don’t worry, I remember. I was young before.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” Carrie immediately retorted. “You’re still young.” </p><p>She blushed. “I don’t know about that…” </p><p>Sarah didn’t react, still busy trying to contain her moans as my toes landed on her panties, gently massaging her core to push her closer toward the climax. </p><p>I chuckled. “I agree with Carrie, you have nothing to worry about,” I said as I caught her gaze, putting a naughty smile on my face. Admittedly, such a trick was more effective on enthusiastic young women like Carrie rather than a mature woman, but…</p><p>Miss Warrick showed that, while she might be a mature woman physically, her mentality wasn’t too different from Carrie, blushing under my gaze. Never miss such an opportunity, my smirk widened even as I let my gaze down, taking a lengthy glimpse of her body. </p><p>And she just froze under. </p><p>I wondered how long it would take for her to give a reaction. Pity, it was not something I would be able to learn, interrupted by Carrie, in the form of an elbow thrust to my ribs, digging painfully. </p><p>“Do you girls know when Ida will return, or will she stay with Irene?” Miss Warrick asked, clearly anxious to change the topic. “I can’t reach her, again.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” Carrie said with a shrug. “You know them, one distracted by her camera, the other distracted by her costumes.” </p><p>“I know,” she said. “Still, she should be more thoughtful. As long as she’s here, I’m responsible for her. I don’t want to badger her much but…” </p><p>“You’re right, Miss Warrick. I have another talk with her,” Carrie said. </p><p>“Thanks, sweetie, you’re the best,” Miss Warrick said, then turned back and disappeared once again, doing her best to avoid my gaze. </p><p>“Miss Warrick is the host for Ida, since she’s an exchange student,” Carrie explained at my questioning gaze. “Since she plans to continue college here, her family decided it was a good way for her to acclimatize.”  </p><p>I nodded, finding the explanation rather sufficient, and silence ruled the group for a moment. Carrie tried to focus on the books sprawled in front of her, which was harder than usual as I continuously squeezed her beautiful hips, challenging her ability to stay silent.</p><p>Sarah was suffering a more difficult challenge with my foot dancing over her core, her thin panties losing their already limited ability to isolate my touch as they got wetter and wetter. She kept her head lowered, making a show of checking the screen of her phone. </p><p>She could have stood up easily, of course, but doing so would mean admitting defeat. </p><p>But that was not an option she took. If she wasn’t headstrong enough to jump to such challenges — no matter how ill-advised — we wouldn’t have been in this position in the first place. </p><p>As we continued, she had occasional failures, one or two muffled moans escaping her mouth, but Carrie kept her gaze on the books sprawled in front of her, acting like she hadn’t noticed that. </p><p>It was supposed to be suspicious, especially with Sarah’s growing suspicion, but amusingly, it wasn’t, and that wasn’t too surprising. I had seen Carrie showing a remarkable ability to block what was going on around her as she focused on her studying. Once she focused on her book, there was a fifty-fifty chance that she would miss a truck barreling into the store. </p><p>In comparison, missing a few moans was nothing out of ordinary. </p><p>“Any plans for the week, Sarah?” I asked, teasing her. It was a naughty move, but remembering how she treated Naomi when we were together, it was hard to argue she didn’t deserve it. </p><p>She looked at me, her eyes wide. “I plan to — focus on my history project,” she murmured, interrupted halfway by a panicked widening of her eyes as my foot moved, but managing to suppress her moan in the process. </p><p>“I thought the delivery is three weeks later,” I asked. </p><p>“So?” Sarah answered, not comprehending the question. </p><p>I just chuckled, her attitude reminding me that while her attitude might be rougher than her friends, ultimately, she was no less focused on her studies. “Nothing,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>She might have followed that up, but under the insistent wiggle of my feet, she soon gained other priorities like trying to suppress her voice. </p><p>I could see a small smile on Carrie’s face, satisfaction mixing with arousal as she watched her friend struggle, no doubt enjoying the switch of the fates. Before my arrival, Sarah had been the one to push Carrie, trying to understand what was truly going on, and the switch was, without a doubt, extremely entertaining. </p><p>Her smile widened when a beautiful grunt escaped Sarah’s mouth, followed by a beautiful tremble. A bit quick, but considering the public location, I wasn’t shocked by her over-stimulation. </p><p>I pulled my foot back. Sarah looked at me with gratitude, thinking I showed her mercy, but she was wrong, at least about the reason. </p><p>I just didn’t want to destroy the layer of plausible deniability earlier than necessary. I wanted to enjoy the situation as much as possible before the inevitable fallout hit. </p><p>“I need to go visit … the ladies' room,” Sarah murmured a moment later as she stood up, and stumbled to the bathroom rapidly, not waiting for an answer. Meanwhile, I turned my gaze toward Carrie, enjoying her growing smirk. </p><p>Carrie watched her leave, snickering. I looked at her once Sarah disappeared. “I see that you’re pushing your luck,” I said. </p><p>Which earned a shocked glare from her. “Really, you’re saying that?” she countered. I had several answers to that, but I decided against it when my phone buzzed with a message from Ida. </p><p>“Oh,” Carrie said. “I forgot to ask, how did it go.” </p><p>I said nothing as I unlocked my phone and checked the message, which had no words, and just a photo. </p><p>A beautiful photo of a panicking Irene, once again wearing scraps of her costume — which covered even less than before after the challenging process it had gone through.   </p><p> “Not bad,” Carrie murmured, impressed. “I see that Ida is once again a dictator with a camera.” </p><p>“Oh, yeah, the switch is very impressive, almost unbelievable as someone else,” I said. </p><p>“Wh0—“ Carrie asked reflexively, which was quick to die under my gaze. “I’m not like that,” she defended. </p><p>“Oh, I must be remembering a different busty blonde who went from getting shy from a kiss to arranging the seduction of all of her friends in a week,” I said. </p><p>“You better not,” she warned, trying to sound angry, but it came as intimidating as a cute kitten trying to be loud.  </p><p>I chuckled as I grabbed her hair, pulling her for another searing kiss, one that was only interrupted by another photo from Ida, giving us some time to appreciate the bound figure of her redheaded friend. </p><p>I was curious just how far she would push, but before we could make a decision, the bathroom door opened once more. “I need to go back home to continue my research, Carrie, do you mind dropping me?” she asked.  </p><p>“Oh, I thought you said it wasn’t urgent,” Carrie said, amused by her sudden change of attitude. Justified considering Sarah had forcefully intruded into her study session to dig into her secrets. </p><p>“I realized I miscalculated. I still need to finish my application essays, and since I came here with you…” </p><p>“I don’t know, I still need to study,” Carrie murmured.</p><p>“Why don’t I drop you,” I answered, interrupting Carrie. “I don’t have anything to do.” </p><p>“I don’t want to bother you—“ Sarah started. </p><p>“Nonsense,” I cut her short. “It would be my pleasure.” </p><p>Sarah looked hesitant. “I don’t know, a bike is not the safest.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I can borrow the car if you’re afraid of riding a bike,” I suggested. </p><p>The stab at her pride worked excellently. “Nonsense, of course, I’m not afraid,” she declared, her reaction almost automatic. </p><p>“Excellent, then we can go,” I said, and walked away from the table after leaning down for one last kiss, intense enough to add jealousy to the confusing mess of emotion Sarah was trying to deal with. “Let’s go,” I said as I passed her, and she followed me outside…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t even bother casting a spell as the wolf zombie charged at me, ruled by the echo of its worst instincts without control, not even a hint of control. I didn’t even bother casting a spell, just waited until it was near, when my spear flashed. </p><p>The zombies were famous for their abilities to shrug simple damage, but after all the enchantments I had loaded, my spear was far from being counted as simple. An accurate stab into the thickest part of necrotic energy was enough to disperse the cloud, finally sending the beast into the afterlife it deserved. </p><p>“This feels familiar,” I murmured as I continued, aware that, as I continued, I would only face more and more such creatures. As I moved forward, the necrotic energy in the air got thicker, giving a suffocating feeling of oppression, the darkness further enhancing the feeling. </p><p> Luckily, I had my shield to disperse the energy. A gust of wind hit, moving reverse downstream, carrying much thicker death energy. My senses crawled, a deep feeling wanting me to avoid the repulsive necrotic energy. </p><p>Sensible. Too bad the situation forced me to ignore it and continue walking. My skin continued to crawl as I continued to walk, the routine occasionally interrupted by the same type of huge trees, still maintaining a sense of life after death, more than the initial tree I had stumbled upon. </p><p>Maybe it was because of the differing strength, but I was more willing to believe a moving invasion force, using the river as a magical battering ram to repeatedly slam against some kind of magical defensive line as they moved forward. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to imagine those trees as a part of some defensive line — though whether it was natural or by design, it was another question. I lacked even the slightest information to actually guess that. </p><p>I prepared myself for another war, though luckily with enough mana to give me the confidence to escape even against what was supposed to pass as a strong opposition in a random fragmented plane. I was confident to escape Janelor or someone equivalent, and from what she had described — even discounting greatly her arrogance — she was supposed to be a peak combatant. </p><p>At least, she was important enough to be actively targeted through an inter-planar conspiracy, which confirmed that. </p><p>The quality of one’s enemies always gave a good understanding of their capabilities. Of course, the existence of gods and Janelor’s respect toward them meant that while she was a peak combatant, she was far from the true ceiling. </p><p>But such a being would have created enough commotion that would warn me of their presence.</p><p>Hopefully. </p><p>Lost in thoughts, I had paid little attention to the zombies that continued to find my location,  taking them down with a stab each. Some wolves, and others were even smaller critters. One thing I paid for about them was their quality, which didn’t change. </p><p>But more importantly, their numbers stayed limited. Which, ironically, made me tenser than the alternative. With the density of the necrotic energy, I expected to find far more zombies, yet there were none. </p><p>Nor I could find any corpses, meaning someone either pulled back the beasts before the wave, or a necromancer actively raised and controlled most of them, only leaving a few lost scraps behind.</p><p>Either case, it was a sign that I would soon meet a more organized opponent. </p><p>It would be better to meet the opponent of the undead rather than the alternative, but not decisively so. I wasn’t naive enough to think that they would be my allies just because they were fighting against the undead, especially when I was a completely unknown quality.  </p><p>No, either way, I needed to stay hidden. </p><p>The denser the necrotic energy got, the slower I started to move, the shield taking more of my attention. It wasn’t an issue of capability, but I was forced to reduce it to a thinner structure, afraid that it would be detected by another mage. </p><p>The stronger a shield, the brighter its presence shone against the senses of a mage, which was less dangerous than the occasional necrotic energy slipping through the weakened shield. </p><p>Then, I felt a flare in the distance, the thing that I had been hoping, for and was afraid of at the same time. The distinct flare of magical combat. </p><p>“Once more onto the breach,” I murmured as I continued to move, suppressing my magical presence even more as I moved forward, leaning down, a tense frown invading my face once more. Luckily, this close to the battle, there were no wandering zombies.  </p><p>They weren’t scary, but fighting against them would greatly increase the chances of getting caught, so their lack of presence was good. I was ready to fight against the enemy if they noticed my presence, but I certainly had no complaints about their failure. </p><p>And, as I got closer, I was able to get a better sense of the conflicting energies, the life energy battling against necrotic energy  — through the life energy was different than I was used to. </p><p>It had a different feeling, green and immobile. It felt more like plants than animals, but with some difference than a simple biomancy trick I could pull off — could have pulled off when I had access to the System, I corrected myself as I suppressed the reflex of casting it to compare.</p><p>The differences were interesting, but not as interesting to delay me as I moved forward, more interested to see the scene of combat. Though, I first got away from the stream, where the fighting was clearly centered due to the thickness of the necrotic energy, allowing any necromancer to have an easy source of transformed mana. </p><p>A great strategic tool, but also makes their strategic deployment rather predictable. I walked away almost two minutes before I came across a convenient hilltop — the signs of a recent battle showing that I wasn’t the only one that noticed its convenient location. </p><p>The side that was looking at the river was marked with signs of battle, mostly blood and broken pieces of enchanted wood — but absolutely no metal, which was rather interesting. Maybe they had recycled all of it. </p><p>There were no bodies as well, but that was less surprising. Either the defending forces had taken the bodies with them — which was the simplest strategic choice in fighting against the necromancers — or they failed to do so, and their comrades joined the enemy in their battle. </p><p>In either case, nothing outside the expectations. </p><p>I continued climbing, avoiding particularly dense points of necrotic energy until I neared the peak, and looked down. </p><p>Right at the battle. </p><p>The distance was significant yet not too great, almost about a mile, and the high vantage point gave me an excellent view. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was the fact that the stream was split into two, creating a small delta. I noticed that first because of the contrast. The upstream was still filled with necrotic mana contrasting with the delta, filled with that variant of life energy, with two sides filled with fighting figures. </p><p>I first focused on the mana sources first rather than the combatant — because one side was necromancers, which was rather similar to what I had been used to,  while the other side was far too distant to get any proper details other than the fact that they were mostly using bows and cloaked thickly, their numbers few. </p><p>Also, the situation with the mana was much clear, enough to be resolved in a few seconds. The source of the variant of the life energy I was feeling was not hidden. Along the riverbank, there were a great number of those huge trees  — far denser than the occasional dead ones that I had come across, radiating that life energy, which then tried to overwhelm the necrotic energy. </p><p>Too bad it was a desperate battle. One of the trees, the one that was planted right at the split, was almost two times as tall as others, easily a hundred feet, but most of its leaves had already blackened, showing the desperate battle it was giving. Other trees — guardian trees, I decided to call them — further along the bank were in better condition than the vanguard tree, but still, about a quarter of their leaves were tainted. </p><p>Their fate was not too different from the occasional guardian trees  I had stumbled on my way. </p><p>Interestingly, there were no trees I could see on my side of the riverbank, but there were several huge holes, like several trees had been just pulled out several hours ago. </p><p>Maybe they had been uprooted and replanted on the other side to create the dense outlook I was seeing — making the small delta an intentional point of defense. </p><p>Not for no reason, as the guardian trees were still desperately pushing their mana out to fight against the necrotic wave rather than trying to cure themselves — which the energy seemed to be capable of if I was reading the collusion of free mana in the air correctly — which implied a certain strategic thought rather than just instinct. </p><p>It was likely that the cloaked figures were responsible for that, but technically, it wasn’t a certain conclusion. A sapient tree would have been unexpected, but not technically impossible. After all, there were plant monsters back in the main material plane. </p><p>I could have concluded that if I were closer to the battle, or the constant flares of mana blocking any potential spell, but they were rather efficient barriers to my curiosity. Whether it was the decision of the trees or the cloaked figures wasn’t exactly the most urgent issue. </p><p>The imminent victory of the necromancers was much more urgent, inevitable unless I intervened. </p><p>Yet, rather than doing so, I first decided to waste a few seconds examining the cloaked figures, casting a spell that would replicate a working spyglass.</p><p>Curious about what I would find.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I paused for a moment to expand my senses, trying to measure the thickness of the necrotic energy surrounding me, intending to pick a direction opposite of it. I didn’t like venturing into the unknown compared to taking a known quality, but I was willing to make an exception when the known factor was the undead. </p><p>Whatever the unknown party, it couldn’t be worse than the undead. </p><p>Or, I hoped so. </p><p>With a sigh, I started moving, deciding to trust my luck once more. After all, it was only a sign of my luck that I managed to survive after that deadly ambush — though it was easy to argue it was my bad luck that I ended up outside of borders. </p><p>I was tense as I walked forward, the limited range of detection making it a struggle to detect what was going on around me. The sudden loss of my Perception didn’t only impact my crafting abilities, but also reduced the number of details that I could detect in my surroundings, like I had fallen into a dark pit while looking at the sun. </p><p>The difference was remarkable, and not in a good way. </p><p>“Maybe I should be glad for the undead,” I muttered mockingly. After all, it was thanks to their efforts that there was foliage to block my view, giving me a relative sense of security in this unfamiliar environment. </p><p>I moved perpendicular to the dimensional border, still remembering the glimpse I had gotten from outside, with most borders already covered by necrotic energy. I wasn’t completely sure, but it was safer to assume that whatever non-undead beings would have been found deeper into the landscape. </p><p>Fifteen minutes of walking later, I was yet to walk out of the dead remains of the forest I found myself in. Even when I climbed the remains of a particularly tall tree, I failed to see anything but the dead remains of a forest, with no hint of life.</p><p>But, the lack of life once again worked to my benefit, allowing me to notice a small stream that would have otherwise been concealed by the hulking trees. I climbed down and dashed forward, anxious to quench my thirst. Technically, I could stay alive for a long time even without water, relying solely on the proto-HP I could generate from mana for weeks, but it would have been an uncomfortable sensation. </p><p>However, the closer I got to the stream, the stronger my frown got. The stream was radiating necrotic energy, thick enough to drown me even without touching. </p><p>Enough to force me to cast a shield. Luckily, while the radiating energy was strong, it was undirected, easily pushed away by a bubble of Arcana mana. I walked forward, undisturbed, and soon, I was at the riverbank, examining the stream. </p><p>It was cloudy and unappetizing, and not just because it was filled with necrotic energy. With every single living it touched dead, there was nothing to hold back the earth, allowing the water to pull enough particles to be technically defined as mud. </p><p>Yet, as I examined the water,  I could easily feel that the thickness of necrotic energy was not accidental, or just a natural occurrence. The mana inside was packed too thick to be accidental. “The question, is it cast actively, or a ward is responsible,” I murmured.</p><p>The difference was not just technical. It was clearly weaponized to kill the forest — which was a task that had been accomplished with great effect — but it was still continuing. It didn’t matter much if it was just a ward that had been left intact, but was different if it was maintained actively. </p><p>It meant that they had something to destroy downstream, which would give me a potential direction. </p><p>Or a location to avoid. </p><p>Either way, I had a lot of time to examine the flow as I fashioned a large bottle out of the earth, using Arcana and my hands — which was considerably harder than just casting an earth spell to create one, but I was rather reluctant to rely on elemental spells after what I had experienced during my escape. </p><p>I didn’t know if the fragmented plane hold the same intense attraction for the elementals as the main material plane, but it was certainly not something I wanted to test at the current juncture. </p><p>After I crafted my earth bottle, I created a complicated ward, consisting of several layers alternating between Arcana and pseudo-HP, Arcana layers were responsible for getting rid of the mud and the dust particles, Tantric mana responsible for binding and breaking down the necrotic energy, with one last layer of pseudo-HP to keep it clean. </p><p>It was not a cheap structure, but I wasn’t exactly trying to keep the mana spending minimal. The air was filled with mana I could catch easily, and the taint of necrotic energy was ultimately unable to resist the purification. I even tested pulling some Aether from the Aether dimension and breaking it down to mana. </p><p>It was harder to break down than the necrotic energy, but after dealing with Primordial Aether, it still felt particularly easy. </p><p>I had faster ways of cleansing the water, but I didn’t use them. First, it was better to have a tool that I could use continuously rather than a one-off. Back in the material plane, the little delicate structure of interlocked wards would barely survive a few minutes without any external reagents, but here, I expected it to survive for days easily. </p><p>However, the real reason was my time requirements as I observed the river carefully. It turned out to be a useful decision, as after ten minutes, I noticed a sudden dip in the density of necrotic energy, which lasted a few seconds before returning to the earlier intensity.</p><p>I might have assumed that it was just a ward, but the shape of the necrotic energy changed. The function stayed the same, but there were enough structural differences to guess that the caster had changed — just like a letter, changing handwriting halfway.</p><p>It might be a ward, but they were clearly replenishing it, meaning there was a high chance that something interesting was downstream. Leaving me with the question of avoiding it or following it. </p><p>I was tempted to avoid it, and if my earlier lookout gave me any safer clues to follow, I might have done that. Unfortunately, I had no idea just how long I had to walk randomly, and time was precious. </p><p>While I hoped that the weird corrupted angel had bigger priorities than targeting Silver Spires, I didn’t expect that to last forever. The sooner I could find a method to go back, the better. </p><p>I decided to follow the stream,  which was the better of the two clues I had. The other was going reverse, and confronting the undead, which was hardly something I wanted to do as anything but the last resort. </p><p>I continued moving, my senses sharp,  hoping to catch any kind of wildlife, failing continuously for several hours even as I walked forward. As I moved, the sun had set, leaving its place to darkness…</p><p>Which didn’t exactly help me suppress the sense of discomfort I was feeling. I continued walking, using the spear as a walking stick — more of a distraction than a habit, though lessening the energy every step took was not a bad idea as well. </p><p>Not when I had no idea when I would have my next meal.</p><p>I wasn’t exactly idle as I walked. I used my power constantly to tap into Aether, getting more and more mana to purify and store in the wards, until I had more than ten thousand mana in various wards. I could technically store more, but it was the most I trusted myself to control in combat… </p><p>I could just eject the extra, but a huge flare shouting my presence was hardly something I needed intensely. </p><p>The first sign that I was finally going to meet a difference was the changing thickness of necrotic energy, floating aggressively, searching aggressively for living beings, only to fail — with the sole exception of myself, but I had the ability to block it successfully. </p><p>It took another hour for those particles to float toward anywhere but me.</p><p>The target, a large tree, which was, for all intents and purposes, dead, yet the rush of the particles continued. </p><p>I walked to touch it, using my mana to dispel the thick necrotic energy that filled its trunk, to see if there was any sign of life, but the best I could find was remnants of flickers, showing it had been a while since its death.  </p><p>Though, the tenacity of the energy showed that the size of the tree was not its only exceptional feature — which was towering over every other tree by a considerable margin, even as a naked trunk. The fact that even a flicker of energy managed to last despite the intense flow showed an intense magical presence when it was alive. </p><p>I wished I could see it then. No doubt it would have created a fascinating view. </p><p>I continued walking, but not too long after, I noticed the first sign of wildlife, charging forward.</p><p>Though, I quickly amended my thoughts as I looked at the rotting corpse of a wolf. It was certainly wild, but the life part was rather doubtful. </p><p>“Again, zombies,” I thought as I raised my spear, preparing for combat.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I had a smile on my face as I walked away from Cinder’s secret base, leaving her with the task of cleaning up, after several orders to make sure she didn’t do anything without asking me — and several spells to observe the situation continuously. </p><p>I was tempted to leave her in the meadows to make sure any commotion she might create didn’t create a crisis in the capital, but after some consideration, I decided against it for two reasons. </p><p>The first reason was I had decided to leave Isolde there, and leave Cinder to spend any extended time with my magic-hating potential assassin, especially far away that I couldn’t intervene in case of a heated argument. </p><p>The second reason was more functional. I had no idea about the plans of the other parties, from Lancelot to elves, but I preferred Cinder to be in a location where I could go and help her if someone targeted her, or ask for her help if any party suddenly decided to target the palace. </p><p>Not that I was not confident to meet any attack by myself. It wasn’t about any sudden increase of pure power — as while the increase of mana I experienced was nice, it wasn’t enough to make a decisive difference against odds that would have been unsurmountable. No, it gave me confidence, because it gave me a very convenient way of misleading my enemies by using the living fire, giving them the impression that I work for the phoenixes. </p><p>Just the right amount of convincing tricks to create even more confusion. </p><p>As I walked toward the Queen’s quarters, my mind was already on the merits of using the flame to ‘assassinate’ her. It might implicate Cinder, but since she was alone, it was much more likely that the suspicion would fall on the other Phoenixes currently occupying the darklands. </p><p>I pulled the shadows around me as I arrived at my destination, not wanting to reveal myself in case there was a servant inside. The door opened, and I entered sneakily, only to see someone that I wasn’t expecting together with Sapphire. </p><p>Valkyrie. </p><p>Admittedly, considering I had summoned her, my surprise was more about the speed of her arrival rather than her presence, but I expected her arrival to take around a week considering the things she needed to arrange. Even if she discarded everything, which was not in her personality, and rushed forward, it was supposed to take at least one more day. </p><p>Meaning, she was already traveling toward the Capital before Sapphire summoned her. </p><p>How interesting. </p><p>I kept the shadows tight around me as I got closer, curious about what they were talking about. With Valkyrie still wearing her armor — which hid a shockingly beautiful body underneath, as I knew from our previous deals — and standing in front of Sapphire’s desk, her expression serious, the seriousness of the subject was very clear. </p><p>Valkyrie had a reason for her great martial reputation, and she had the senses to detect me during our earlier encounters. However, as I closed in, they failed to react to my presence. One reason was the Blade of Shadows, which greatly increased my ability to stay hidden. </p><p>However, even more, effective was her location. She hardly expected someone to sneak forward while she was with the ruling Queen of the Empire in her private quarters, in a location that was supposed to be absolutely secure. </p><p>“… due to that, I don’t know just how long our defenses can hold. There are simply too many unexpected problems at the forts. If it goes like that, we might lose another fort in three days. We need to mobilize,” she declared. “I know there are political challenges, your majesty, but all evidence shows that it’s an actual danger rather than a political ploy. We need to act.” </p><p>She fell silent, and I started walking closer to them, while Sapphire closed her eyes, thinking, ignoring Valkyrie’s impatient gaze. They were talking about the North, I realized. She looked at the Queen impatiently, no doubt failing to understand how any political concern could hold her back.</p><p>I recognized that frustration. It was her inherent distaste toward politics, that impacted critical decision-making when lives were at stake. It was what drove her to cooperate with me in the first place while I still had my throne, requiring my help to deal with the more aggressive politicians in the army — the kind that would sacrifice an army just to gain some political credit. </p><p>And, while the way she looked at Sapphire was not as bad, it was still alarmingly sharp, no doubt making her wonder if talking to a different party about acting was the better idea. </p><p>Even if that decision had dangerous implications for Sapphire’s throne. </p><p>Sapphire was lucky that I was there to help her. </p><p>While Sapphire stayed still, her eyes closed, I closed in, and sneaked under the desk before any of them could notice. Hidden outside Valkyrie’s view, I grabbed Sapphire’s legs, making her gaze turn down with panic, only to catch my grin. </p><p>“Is something wrong, my Queen,” Valkyrie gasped, alarmed. </p><p>“No, just a cramp, nothing important,” Sapphire excused quickly, her lie very believable. And, more importantly, good enough to excuse her sudden panic as I continued to push her skirt up, revealing her beautiful legs for my hungry gaze. “Are you telling me that you still have no idea about the true nature of the invaders,” she asked. </p><p>Smart woman, I thought, realizing that she wanted Valkyrie to explain the situation once again so that I could hear her. Unfortunately for her, that didn’t prevent me from multitasking, leaning forward to kiss her inner thighs even as Valkyrie started explaining after a soft sigh. </p><p>“Unfortunately so, your majesty,” she answered. “While not all commanders agree with my conclusion, I could see that none of the attacking beasts had been actually encountered before, and while they show some similarities to the stories that had been told, I don’t think it’s evidence that they always existed. Something is clearly sending them. Maybe some mages are creating them, using the stories as the basis.” </p><p>“But why a mage would give so much effort?” Sapphire asked. It was not the best question to ask after that explanation, but to her defense, Sapphire was rather distracted. Still, it was a sign of growing obedience that she had just accepted the challenge without trying to prevent it. </p><p>Clearly, my actions made a mark. </p><p>“That kind of political concern is outside my purview, my Queen. I only know the facts on the field,” she declared dutifully, but I could catch the annoyance in her tone, which wasn’t a surprise. The blonde knight had always been rather dismissive of the nobility and their default stature, and I was only partially surprised to see that extending into royalty as well, especially when she was trying to deal with a serious issue. </p><p>Pity, she didn’t know just how big of a risk her Queen took to solve the problem — albeit she seemed to enjoy the way it imploded — so she was feeling frustrated at the results. </p><p>I started listening to her explanation while I continued leaving a trail of kisses on Sapphire’s thighs, climbing up, but not high enough to touch her wetness, barely restrained by her skimpy outfits. She managed to hide her reaction well as she listened to Valkyrie, hiding what was going on well. </p><p>I was tempted to push for more, but as I listened to her explanation, I decided against it. The reason, the latest information she was sharing was not exactly good news, especially since as she continued to talk about the beasts, it started to contradict the earlier situation — the wild monsters that she was describing could hardly be responsible for the suspicious disappearances of the other forts. </p><p>Though, as I dug into the true nature of the confrontation I found myself in, I wasn’t as shocked at the situation. With the elves and phoenixes intervening directly, either by sabotaging the palace or by taking over the darklands, the suspicious disappearances weren’t as suspicious anymore. From what I had learned from Cinder, it implied that phoenixes weren’t responsible for it — though it might be her lack of information — it still left elves a probable culprit. </p><p>Or another mystic mysterious party, somehow involving themselves with the situation, which couldn’t be simply written off. </p><p>Maybe I should just stop what I was doing and ask her directly? </p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t surprised when everyone turned toward me the moment I walked inside, though the intensity of their emotions — evidenced by the intent that flowed toward me, only to be devoured by my guide, who was still reading the book I held to my side — surprised me. </p><p>It was enough to rival the intensity I received during the most heated moments of the game that I saved. </p><p>“Sorry I’m a bit late, guys, I didn’t have my car,” I said with a casual shrug as I walked toward the center of the room, and took the seat that was usually taken by the starter quarterback. But since he was absent, along with every single offensive player, I doubted that anyone would care to argue against my decision. </p><p>It wasn’t that I missed the great oppressive feeling that filled the room, or the absence of most of the players. The defense was here to the last player, but considering we were gutted by Coach Bill’s aggressive poaching before his departure, it didn’t exactly create an imposing crowd.</p><p>I didn’t need the assistance of the Traits to know that the morale of the team was tethering on the brink. The reason, I was yet to discover, but the state of the stadium, combined with the absence of that many players, didn’t paint a pretty picture. </p><p>It was the reason for my calm and uncaring movement. The team was already tethering on the edge of a collapse, and while Coach Juana was skilled, she lacked the trust of the players, preventing her from handling the mood.</p><p>I was the only pillar they could rely on, making my calm not just a cosmetic choice, but a vital thing.</p><p>It was a sign of the mood of the team that no one said anything as I settled on my seat with deliberate slowness, thinking that I should have checked the news after waking up. A vital thing that I neglected due to another assassination attempt. </p><p>I flicked my phone carefully as I sat, quickly going through the hottest local topics, which immediately revealed the mystery of the situation. </p><p>The first news was about Coach Spencer, a long, heartfelt statement about how he was greatly sorry about his lapse of judgment, and he wanted to step away from the field for a few weeks to contemplate his mistakes, taking a leave of absence to do so. </p><p>It was an excellent piece of statement, somehow managing to show him as a victim, paying for the exhaustion after the sudden resignation of his defensive coordinator, with a long mention of poached players and other problems — mostly imagined, but hard to disprove. </p><p>I would have loved to meet his public relations expert. Whoever was responsible for the statement, managed to handle things excellently. </p><p>Though, the timeline of the declaration was rather interesting, an hour after I had left the hospital, just long enough to pen such a long discussion. It was bad, because I was relying on the fact that Coach Spencer would do his best to pressure the hospital to reverse the decision, not wanting to be blamed for my concussion. </p><p>Instead, he decided to retreat decisively, showing that the professor might be a little harder to deal with than I had assumed — but it was a problem for the future.</p><p>The other news around the issue was more immediate. There were many reports from the offensive players, about the recklessness of the defensive team, and how they had been injured by our viciousness. </p><p>It was ridiculous. Not only most of them — the starter quarterback included — didn’t take the field in the first place, but also they had not been fighting against us but against the practice squad. </p><p>But the truth was a malleable thing, especially when declared by someone like Coach Spencer, whose family — and his fiancee’s family — could put him in a position that commanded great respect and income through sheer nepotism despite his glaring incompetency. </p><p>Compared to that, manipulating a few local newspapers was nothing too difficult. If they were as rich as everything suspected, just the threat of temporarily suspending their advertising would have been enough of a reaction.</p><p>Even at a glance, I could see many tear-jerker pieces about the catastrophic injury a player suffered, but none of it mentioned that it was not a student of our college — or a student period. </p><p>I had to admit, it was an excellent strategy, so much that, I would have actually started to respect Coach Spencer, if, for a second, I believed that he was the one that came up with it, and not just listening to his family’s arrangements like a little bitch, probably while moaning about his undeserved misfortune. </p><p>It was excellent, because, on any reasonable scale, by gutting both the roster and the coaching team, they had consigned the team a few weeks of humiliating defeats, the kind that would earn their place in the record books. </p><p>And after a few such defeats, Coach Spencer would ‘reluctantly’ return to save the team, any detail that didn’t conform to his tragic story already written out thanks to the constant media buzz, unable to be countered long term by social media, which relied on people’s attention, which was a more scarce community that most assumed. </p><p>It was an excellent strategy. It would have taken a miracle to turn things around. </p><p>A divine intervention, even. </p><p>Luckily, said the divine intervention was sitting in a corner, busy reading her book, and her miracle long reached its destination. </p><p>I had no intention of letting that asshole win. </p><p>First, I sent a quick message to an ever-helpful sexy blonde and her redheaded friend. I didn’t want to owe another favor, but things were intense enough to act quick. With that done, I raised my head.  </p><p>“Coach, what do you say if I take the tactics session today, as a change,” I offered. “It would be a fun change, right?” </p><p>“I’m sure your teammates will appreciate it,” she said, quick to get what I was driving at. I stood up, watching the team shuffle in their place, a soft murmur breaking the earlier silence as they started talking. </p><p>I had delivered too many miracles in a short week for them to dismiss my sudden declaration as a pointless bravado. </p><p>I reached for the remote, to turn on the screens, but Coach shook her head. “The network is down, but I have the printouts,” she explained as she showed the huge pile of paper on the desk. </p><p>“I see,” I murmured. The absence of the janitorial staff and the messy state of the locker room were enough to show that the school management was fully behind Coach Spencer. Locking us out of the network to prevent us from using our tech further confirmed it. </p><p>I glanced at the small computer on the side, considering hacking to turn everything on. I had no doubt that they were particularly well-defended, but still, there were many ways to bypass even the greatest security, especially with physical access. </p><p>But after a moment, I shook my head and walked toward the whiteboard instead. I didn’t want to reveal that my computer skills were better than people expected. Not when I had already used them to commit many crimes. </p><p>I pulled the board toward the middle of the room, then spent a moment checking Coach’s printouts. An impressive number of details was included, though with the glaring exception of the last week’s match. </p><p>She probably printed those from the backups she took before Coach Bill left. Though, with Coach Bill’s obsessive security awareness, none of his tactics was a part of the document. They were strictly about the opponent’s capabilities. </p><p>“We don’t have access to our tactical files,” Coach Juana whispered, soft enough to avoid the attention of the other players. </p><p>I shrugged as I grabbed a marker pen. It didn’t really matter. Even if we had access to those tactics, they would have been completely useless. The offensive team was gone completely, and the defensive team had dangerous gaps. Based on those, any earlier tactic was completely useless. </p><p>Not that I cared. With my Traits, I was confident to ad-lib a full tactical book that would rival Coach Bill’s genius strategies. The pure computational power granted by the Traits was not a joke. </p><p>“Silence,” I suddenly declared as I slammed my hand on the table. “We’re at a tactical meeting, act like it!” </p><p>After my achievements, my role as a leader was undisputed. But, empowered by both my Intimidation and Leadership traits, the order exploded like a gun, making every single player freeze. </p><p>I wanted to chuckle as more than thirty men, each near-peak specimen, froze in one simple order, but it would have ruined the mood it created, forcing me to spend time to get their attention. </p><p>And, with the nearest match just a few days away, time was too precious to waste. </p><p>I spend a second, glancing at every single player in the room, their training performance flashing in my mind, the beginnings of a strategy taking root….. </p><p>“Now, let’s first analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing team…”</p>",

I was literally using myself as bait to see whether she would even notice the invasion, yet alone save me. </p><p>Not the safest approach, but it was better than trusting her for the future. </p><p>I waited for almost fifteen seconds, each second hell as the shadows filled the room. Before was forced to ask, she suddenly jerked and turned to the shadows. She mumbled something else in the same unknown language, and waved her hand before turning back to the book. </p><p>A flash of light filled the room, and when my eyes adapted to the sudden flare, The shadows were gone, confirming that she indeed had the ability to protect me — though her attention to surroundings could certainly use some improvement. </p><p>Luckily, my own danger sense somehow reacted faster than her attention, giving me another uncertain layer of safety. </p><p>I just hoped that those two layers would be enough. </p><p>It was almost five, and the football meeting would start at six, so I didn’t want to go to sleep. Without my car, which was still in the stadium parking lot, I would barely be there on time. I wanted to join the meeting to drive my victory to the team, and rub against Coach Spencer’s face. </p><p>What was the meaning of victory if not used to annoy one’s enemies to death? </p><p>Still, I didn’t stand up until my alarm rang, giving her the impression that her short battle against the shadows went unnoticed. I had no idea whether it would actually help me or not, but until she gave me a reason to trust her, I would do my best to pile up advantages. </p><p>She continued reading while I got dressed, and turned to her. “I need to go to the meeting,” I said. “Are you ready?” </p><p>She sent me an annoyed glare. “No, I need to finish this book,” she said. I wanted to argue, but her tone brokered no argument. </p><p>Hiding my frown took everything I had, but my determination to play along with her little concerns was still stronger for the moment. “I can carry the book with me, and you can read it while we walk,” I said, which didn’t cure her annoyed glare. “If I don’t go to the meeting, they will kick me out of the team, and we won’t have any more intent,” I argued, quickly giving her a reason to change her mind. </p><p>After a pause, she nodded, pointing to a few books. “Bring those with you,” she said. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said with a sigh, glad that my reputation as a nerdy football player had long been set, enough not to raise any questions. And even if they asked, I could simply bullshit something about Greek battle tactics and their possible applications to football. </p><p>So, I started running toward the stadium, a duffel filled with books and sports equipment on my back as I covered the great distance with a rapidness that would make a marathon runner jealous.</p><p>Recovery and Stamina were a devastating combination. </p><p>I considered joining athletism events for a moment, but the dangerously curious expression the professor displayed the last night made me write off that option quickly. It was one thing to dominate a lower-division football league. It barely made me a local celebrity, an impressive curiosity, but I wasn’t the first high-caliber player that slipped through the top colleges’ recruitment due to various reasons. </p><p>Competing and defeating the best of the world, especially with a body type that didn’t fit the sport in question, was simply too suspicious. I had enough problems with the shadows not to escalate things further. </p><p>I continued to run toward the meeting, but since I used one of the side roads to avoid coming across the other players, I managed to avoid them. My guide continued to read the book, mumbling more than once about how much nonsense the writing was, but other than questioning Zeus’ identity as the leader of the gods, and her fearful reaction to the name of Persephone, she managed to keep her complaints silent. </p><p>Fascinating, I thought even as I arrived at the stadium, barely in time. Still, even then, rather than rushing toward the locker room first, I went to the parking lot, and checked my car carefully, remembering what had happened with my car the last time I had won a bet against Kevin. </p><p>After five minutes of careful checking, I made sure that it was completely untouched. “Lucky,” I  thought, though it wasn’t me that was lucky. </p><p>It was them. </p><p>The last time they messed with my car, I stole Kevin’s girlfriend, humiliated him in front of the school, and ultimately found a way to defeat him in his own area of expertise. </p><p>It seemed that the offensive team realized that, the next time, I wouldn’t be so nice. </p><p>But, as I walked through the corridor to drop my bag at the locker room, a frown found its way to my face despite the perfect condition of my car.  </p><p>The stadium was too empty. It wasn’t the lack of the players, as I expected them to be already in the meeting room. Coach Bill forced that habit on the team, and I didn’t expect it to be broken in less than a week. </p><p>That still explained the sudden sense of desolation. </p><p>It took a moment for me to realize. A place as huge as the stadium required a significant amount of care, delivered by a large team of custodial staff, to function appropriately. At this hour, they should have already been around, conducting their daily cleaning. </p><p>It was even more necessary due to yesterday’s unscheduled attendance of the fans to my challenge, creating a great mess after our dear coach’s sudden streak of violence. </p><p>Not a good sign, I thought as I continued to walk, noting some of the doors were locked, and some lights that were supposed to be working turned down. Things were even more intense in the locker room, jerseys were thrown around, more than one ripped badly, several lockers were broken, and garbage was everywhere. </p><p>I even noticed a dried pool of blood in a corner, suggesting that the punch I had received from the coach wasn’t the end of the violence. </p><p>Yet, I was more interested in the fact that it wasn’t cleaned than the fight itself. It was an actual health code violation, and it was great outside my expectations. </p><p>“I will see what’s going on in the meeting,” I murmured as I quickly undressed and stepped into the shower, which was an even bigger mess, with wet, discarded towels piled around, smelling bad. </p><p>I carefully stepped around them and turned on the shower, only to be hit by cold water. Freezing cold, carrying the full strength of the winter. I grunted in dissatisfaction even as I showered as quickly as I could manage — even with my Traits, a freezing cold shower was not pleasant. </p><p>I finished the shower and grabbed my own bag, not even checking my own locker. Considering the condition of the rest of the locker room, I wasn’t particularly willing to check my own locker. </p><p>The smell that was coming from that direction was dissuading enough. I didn’t know if it came from my locker or the nearby ones, nor that I cared enough to check. </p><p>Instead, I walked deeper into the stadium, toward the meeting room, and most of the lights turned off. My frown deepened as I continued as I arrived at the meeting room. </p><p>The meeting was about to start, but even from outside, I could see none of the screens were turned on — the lack of flickers enough to deduce that. However, the low rumble of people talking reached my ear, showing the room was completely empty. </p><p>Curious, I opened the door, and stepped into a room that was supposed to be filled with almost ninety players — with all the starters, backups, and practice squad combined — and almost twenty members of the coaching team, only to be greeted with a desolate view. </p><p>Barely thirty players, mostly defensive players, and a few practice squad members to bolster, and only one coach, Coach Juana…</p><p>How interesting…</p>",

    "content": "<p>My guide had an impatient look on her face as I let her appear, which was enough to earn a frown. “What took you so long,” she said, not even looking around to take her surroundings. </p><p>It was bad, because the previous times I had pulled her back, she was not really aware of the passage of time, and it was the sense of headache that had forced me to let her out. </p><p>Looking back, it was possibly the impact of the draining effect she had on me, though whether she was pulling from the System, or directly from me — or a mixture — was still to be determined. </p><p>The fact that she became aware of the passage of time was bad, and not just because it removed a handy manipulation tool from me, but also because implied her abilities might improve enough to observe me from there as well. </p><p>A shuddering thought. </p><p>“It took a while for me to handle the paperwork at the hospital, and I didn’t want to bother you while that many people were around,” I said, giving an excuse. Not a good one, and her tightening face told me that she was very much aware that it was a nonsense excuse — another evidence that her childish silliness had gone — but she didn’t push me further on the topic. </p><p>“Tell me about the assassins,” she ordered.</p><p>“As you wish,” I said, and started explaining, though with one major difference. I didn’t mention the trick I managed to pull with the Intent. </p><p>Despite the necessity, giving a report like that was chafing. I was annoyed with her sense of entitlement, but I was also not willing to push forward to conflict with her directly. I still didn’t know her full capabilities of her in terms of the System, and there was no guarantee that it didn’t include ripping the System away from me. </p><p>I didn’t want to lose those abilities — and even worse, I suspected the cost of such a move wouldn’t have been just returning to my previous state. </p><p>Playing the obedient hero distracted by vices was easier. Her response to the nurses and the delay was obvious distaste but nothing else, giving me a space to operate without directly confronting her. </p><p>Conveniently, it was not too far away from my actual personality. </p><p>“Worrying,” she murmured as I finished describing two attacks in clinical terms. </p><p>I waited five seconds, giving her the opportunity to tell me more about the nature of the attackers, conjectures about their source, anything. </p><p>Yet, she kept her mouth shut, radiating her intent to keep her cards close to her chest, unaware that she had just committed a major infraction from my perspective. </p><p>The information she possessed was precious, but her clear reluctance to take initiative on a topic that clearly worried me was a horrible sign. It was not conclusive as well, so rather than pushing that, I changed the subject. “Can you protect me against them?” I asked, faking more fear than I was actually fearing. “I’m afraid to go to sleep.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I will protect you,” she said in a dismissive tone. Though, it wasn’t a careless dismissal, like the police giving a cursory response, but a big sister promising to protect his five-year-old brother from his bully, completely confident that she could deal with it. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t share her confidence. I still remembered the shock she had experienced as she tried to put out what she called a cursed fire at the ritual site, pushing herself far more than she could, and getting comatose. </p><p>And while she gave a more competent aura, looks didn’t necessarily carry into actions. </p><p>“Get me some history books, I need to have a better understanding of what happened,” she said. </p><p>I nodded, suppressing my desire to bite back and order. Luckily, I had already picked several books on the topic to refresh my understanding of the subject, trying to make sure I had everything, so I didn’t need to bother with a midnight run to the library — especially since my car was still at the parking lot. </p><p>I pulled a selection for her — ones that I found particularly unhelpful, to test her reaction —  and put them into a pile on the table. </p><p>“Put them next to each other,” she added, and I followed her command. She didn’t explain the reason, but she didn’t need to, not when she stood in front of one and waved her hand, and the page flipped. </p><p>Which confirmed to me that, at the moment, she had the ability to interact with the world, but only to a very limited degree. Lifting a book was either too laborious, or impossible for her. Moreover, I didn’t know it was a capability she always had and just didn’t bother to use, or something that developed recently. </p><p>I would have preferred to have a more accurate assessment, but it was still better than nothing. </p><p>Before sleeping, I spent quite a bit of time on social media, responding to the well-wishes of the people on my page — my number of followers growing immensely in the process, showing the signs of touching six digits — and checking the other news. </p><p>I was happy to see the earlier attempts of the school to suppress the fight had utterly and completely failed. And, even better, every piece had me as the poor victim, while positioning the offensive team as annoying bullies encouraged by Coach Spencer’s horrible coaching. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured as I read the news, realizing the extent the which public opinion was shifting. I had hoped to create a big commotion as a last-minute attempt to farm Intent from the football team before I get kicked out, with a possible hopeful outcome of staying on the team if I could create a big enough mess. </p><p>Yet, the punch proved to be more effective than I had expected. </p><p>Location and audience were a part of it. Not only he punched me directly in the middle of the field, but also he did so while teams and spectators, and more importantly, cameras were present. </p><p>But, looking at the videos, I realized that Unarmed Trait had an unexpected benefit, making my fall after the punch extremely realistic, selling the idea that he sucker-punched me while I was just a poor guy that didn’t expect violence from his exalted coach. </p><p>The rumors of the hospital report — coming from my helpful nurses, and fueled further by Megan — had been exaggerated, enough to </p><p>However, I clearly miscalculated the impact of suddenly turning into the convenient victim of the storyline. </p><p>The stories had managed to dig both my orphan status, and my status as a chess player — not that they were particularly hidden in the first place — and combined all of those to make Coach Spencer even a bigger villain than he actually was, positioning him as an evil schemer that deliberately worked to ruin the careers of underprivileged students. </p><p>Rather than the truth, which he was a vainglorious moron.</p><p>Ultimately, I didn’t care much about Coach Spencer’s fate. </p><p>I was not a nice person in the first place, and Coach Spencer certainly didn’t deserve such assistance. </p><p>What I cared about was miscalculating the media reaction, and not just by a fraction. I had been expecting the school to successfully suppress the news this time as well, while assuming, even at its most effective, Megan’s social media push would barely ensure I would stay in the team and continue playing. </p><p>I didn’t expect to be wrong in an order of magnitude. </p><p>Another fortunate detail was the amount of Intent that I was receiving despite the media coverage. It was still generating some, but certainly not as much as I had been expecting considering the number of the news article that was popping up. I would have expected people to feel intensely about the subject. </p><p>Then, it clicked as I continued to read the comments. </p><p>People were angry, but that anger was solely directed at Coach, while people were sending their hopes and well-wishes.  </p><p>That didn’t surprise me after growing up in the streets. Pity was a distant, cold emotion, the kind that people easily ignored. Oh, they did their best to convince themselves that they cared more, but I knew from experience that it was the opposite. </p><p>Most people wouldn’t even bother to give a dollar to a freezing child in the street, but the same people would do their best to chase the same child several blocks just because he swiped a half-eaten pastry off their table and run away. </p><p>Anger was much stronger than pity, both in real life, and it seemed, for the System as well. </p><p>“Bad times,” I whispered as I let the sleep take me. </p><p>I had another big day tomorrow. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Xia tensed at the sudden intrusion. I felt her mana preparing to flare, ready to lash out, but I immediately pressed my hand on her mouth as I whispered. “Don’t cast anything, and don’t make a sound,” I ordered her even as I pulled the fabric around her, leaving her naked. </p><p>She was surprised by her sudden nudity. Luckily, her first reaction to shock was freezing, which allowed me to finish my preparations quickly. </p><p>I had already arranged a nice nook to hide by realigning the weapon racks when I first arrived, so by sitting down and throwing the fabric over the little opening between the wall and the rack, we had enough space to hide by lying down. </p><p>Of course, there was not enough space for us to lie without touching, inevitably making us lie together. </p><p>And, since I was a kind man, I lay down first, my back against the rough wood of the deck before pulling her naked body on me, our lips separated by inches. “Don’t make a sound,” I whispered when I noticed her moving. </p><p>She froze, unable to react as the shouts exploded around us. I felt the magic flaring across the deck as the magically sealed hatches opened with a simultaneous bang, followed by the sound of wheels as the crew pushed the ballistas forward. </p><p>“Attack,” came a shout from above, accompanied by a flare of magic as the ship continued to move even faster. It seemed that the sorcerer was pushing himself to the limit, risking total exhaustion. </p><p>“Aree you sure—“ Xia whispered, which was all she was able to let out before I pressed my hand over her lips, silencing her once more.</p><p>“It’s nothing compared to what we did in Rome, don’t worry,” I said, with all the confidence of a gambler that was confident with his victory just because his earlier crazy bet had succeeded. Luckily, Xia was distracted with other things — such as her lack of clothing, or my very apparent presence — to focus on the fallacy of my argument. </p><p>She nodded hesitantly, her attention taken by the constant orders that were exploding around us. I focused on their orders for a moment, hoping that their words would reveal something about their situations. </p><p>In that aspect, their discipline proved annoying. The captain didn’t feel the need to console them about their upcoming victory, preventing me from understanding their situation. Therefore, I didn’t know that they were doing the last stand, or that they still had a hope of escaping. </p><p>I sighed in disappointment, but didn’t let that distract me for too long. Even if I had to escape, it was better to do so once the Roman ships boarded, allowing my escape to work more smoothly. </p><p>Luckily, Xia was there to steal my attention, preventing me from focusing on useless concerns. She stole my attention with the movement of her hips once more, rubbing against me. It seemed that she took my guarantee about our safety at face value, and focused on her own entertainment. </p><p>How amusing…</p><p>“So, anything you want to do while waiting for the battle the end,” I whispered. She froze immediately after realizing she wasn’t the only one distracted by the battle, avoiding my gaze shyly. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she whispered, though this time I didn’t interrupt as she maintained enough presence of mind to keep her voice soft. </p><p>I said nothing, following her command, but my words weren’t the only thing that I could use to tease her. I put my hands on her waist, keeping them in place for a moment before her next warning came. “D-don’t touch,” she ordered, blushing to invade her tone. </p><p>I chuckled as I followed that as well, but this time, I raised my head slightly and looked at her body. With her breasts pressing to my chest, I didn’t see any more than I had been when she was wrapped by the fabric, but our position changed the impact greatly. “And no looking,” she gasped panicked, this time loud enough to get the attention of the sailors if it wasn’t for a lucky explosion. </p><p>I didn’t pull my gaze away, so she immediately brought her hands in front of my eyes, blocking my view directly. Amused by the solution, it took all I had to suppress my laughter. </p><p>She shuffled in her place, missing the implications of her movement as she searched for a more comfortable position, only to settle directly at my midsection. </p><p>Another man might have felt guilty enough to remind her that, but such a silly man would have missed her beautiful freezing as she realized that. Or, more importantly, the way her hips started to move softly, making her attempt to close my eyes rather useless. </p><p> I said nothing as her beautiful legs tightened around my waist, wondering how long it would take for her to start moving in a position where she couldn’t act like it was an accidental side-effect of her attempts to get free. </p><p> The answer, as it turned out, was not too long. </p><p>It took barely seconds for her hips to start moving, making me wonder if it was a decision despite the constant explosion that was going around us, or actually because of them — afraid that our little fun could be interrupted at any moment. </p><p>I said nothing as her petite hands tightened over my eyes while her hips started moving, rubbing against my hardness, my pants providing the only barrier between us. And, considering the fabric wasn’t particularly thick, the barrier did little to hide the great sensation of her wetness. </p><p>My shaft hardened rapidly to match her arousal. My body was already primed thanks to the recent boost of energy, which enhanced my vitality significantly, and it would be a lie if I claimed the battle that was going around me didn’t make the moment even more delicious. </p><p>Maybe, just maybe, the constant danger I had been facing might have warped my own sense of pleasure significantly. </p><p>Her hips continued to pick speed, while I bit my lips, doing my best to suppress my desire to tease her, afraid that it would make her too self-aware to continue. And, her hesitant first steps were simply too entertaining to ruin. </p><p>I was surprised when she used a spell to cut a large piece of fabric out of my shirt — the mana spent too little to get noticed while the battle raged around us — afraid that she had chosen that to fashion herself something quick to wear. </p><p>But, that concern didn’t last long, because it didn’t take long for her hands away, instantly replacing them with the fabric she had cut, though I managed to get a glimpse of her beautiful body in the process, her nipples erect, a full body blush covering her body… </p><p>“Interesting —“ I said, unable to suppress my desire to tease her, but that was all I was able to say before she used her — now freed — hand to press against my lips, silencing me. </p><p>Her attempts to take control triggered my instincts a bit, though the soft, amusing mannerism she did help to keep it down, allowing me to ignore it with ease. Still, the slight flare was a dangerous sigh, showing that I would once again deal with foreign instincts after spending so much time suppressing them. </p><p>However, while it was a big problem, it was not an urgent one, especially when I felt her hips move, and her fingers start to mess with my pants. </p><p>A problem for another time, I decided as I raised my hips, allowing her to easily slide my pants and free my shaft. </p><p>When she lowered herself once more, there was nothing to hide the immensity of her wetness, her hips moving back and forth slowly. Carefully, even, to prevent an accident as she limited herself to some surface contact. </p><p>Her hesitancy made the moment even cuter.  </p><p>I said nothing as her legs tightened further around my hips, her speed getting faster. Hardly noticeable at first, but the build up started to get more and more, the desperate quality of her pleasure slowly showing itself. </p><p>It took all of my willpower to keep myself from moving my hips away, just a shift enough to earn my victory, wondering how long it would take for her to escalate the situation even more, her pleasure overwhelming her shy, hesitant nature… </p><p>However, ultimately, it turned out to be a question destined to stay without an answer, because, just as she was at the apex of her movement, about to return, a spectacular fireball — one that implied the presence of at least one Sorcerer in a nearby ship, with the possibility of more considering the reckless delivery — hit near the ship. </p><p>The ship stayed intact, but the resulting waves still rocked the ship aggressively. </p><p>Not expecting the impact, Xia sank down, a gasp escaping her mouth as the accident forced her to take a significant step forward….</p>",

    "content": "<p>I felt happy as I drove away from Irene’s house, leaving her very satisfied with our photo shoot. The same didn’t apply to our photographer, which was a pity. </p><p>Still, after her naughty tricks, she had certainly deserved punishment, and a night of suffering was a good punishment. </p><p>I drove a bit as I tried to decide what to do, but a message saved me from making such a decision. ‘I need help, save me,’ the message read, and it was from Carrie. </p><p>Luckily, she was smart enough to attach a photo of Sarah, taken subtly to show her words were an exaggeration, followed by a location notification. It looked like they were in a coffee shop. </p><p>Yet, Carrie managed to be naughty there as well. She took the photo from a low angle, one that showed that despite Sarah’s modest outfit — a blouse and a knee-length skirt — I would benefit from visiting.</p><p>Owing to her daring underwear selection, enough to prove she was still the most courageous one among their friends. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured even as I changed my route, curious of the exact nature of her problem. </p><p>My best guess, it was a follow-up of Sarah’s suspicious glares at the lunch table. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to cover the distance, and soon, I found myself at the destination. It was a beautiful coffee shop, one of those hidden gems in a side street that was hard to notice, not too crowded, and decorated nicely. </p><p>The perfect place to hold a study session when the library was particularly crowded, I noticed even as stepped down the bike, and looked inside. Carrie was sitting near the wall, with her books piled in front of her, most of them already open. </p><p>Sarah was sitting across her, her back toward the entrance, her movements animated as she gestured, while Carrie was slouched, finding it hard to answer her friend. </p><p>It didn’t surprise me. While Carrie could be downright vicious with the tricks she pulled behind the scenes, it did nothing for her meek personality, making it impossible for her to resist a direct assault. </p><p>Sarah didn’t have anything in front of her, nor she had a bag, giving me the impression that she had actually ambushed Carrie. </p><p>As I walked toward them, I made sure to stay silent, hearing her talk. Carrie noticed me, perking at my presence. The change was noticeable, but Sarah was too distracted by her verbal assault to notice it. “… so you’re saying that you don’t have any concerns about his visit to Irene, even if they are alone, changing between her collection of sexy costumes.” </p><p>I had no idea what Carrie would have said if I wasn’t there, but my presence encouraged her to give a naughtier response. “Of course not. She’s my friend just like you. Are you saying that I shouldn’t trust you either?” </p><p>Sarah flinched very noticeably. I might have called Carrie’s words merciless considering the nature of her actions, goading Sarah, but Sarah had taken enough actions to make that well-deserved. </p><p>I decided to alert myself to their presence. “Oh, what do we have here, the most beautiful girl in the town,” I said, as I walked around the table, leaned down, and captured Carrie in a searing kiss. </p><p>All before Sarah could even find words to comment on my presence. </p><p>Kissing Carrie was a weapon to distract Sarah, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t enjoyable. On the contrary, as I slipped my tongue into her mouth, teasing Sarah quickly took secondary importance — especially when Carrie proved daring enough to put her hand between my legs, leveraging the emptiness of the coffee shop. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I noticed Sarah shuffling, her earlier feelings of guilt evaporating rapidly as she watched us kiss. </p><p>I put my hand on Carrie’s back, letting it trail down to cup her ass. With her back toward the wall, it was impossible for Sarah to see the exact location of my hand, but guessing the location based on my shoulder didn’t take a particularly impressive effort, especially since Sarah was familiar with my habits.</p><p>Intimately familiar. </p><p>I continued kissing Carrie as Sarah’s jealousy started to spike, wondering when she would intervene. </p><p>In the end, intervention came from an unexpected direction. A door opened, followed by a cough, making Carrie pull back as I turned toward the sound. “Sorry, Miss Warrick,” Carrie whispered shyly, her voice showing both familiarity and respect.  </p><p>And saw an impressive woman wearing an apron, walking away, her hips moving sexily even despite her clear attempt to hide them. A glance was enough to classify her as a particularly spectacular example of a MILF, yet her lack of an answer and quick steps showed she felt particularly self-conscious after the view she had stumbled on. </p><p>I said nothing as she went behind the counter, staying hidden while Carrie fixed herself. I sat next to her, and put my hand on her ass. “Chad, not with Miss Warrick here,” Carrie whispered shyly, but as I kept my hand on her ass, she didn’t try to push me away. </p><p>She wasn’t silent as she had hoped, as I noticed the woman flinching at Carrie’s words before using another door, this time behind the counter, to get away. </p><p>“No worries, she’s already gone,” I said with a chuckle. I was amused by her, just not as much as I was interested in reversing Sarah’s fun ambush. </p><p>“So, Sarah, I heard you talking about me,” I said. “But as you say, I’m here. Why don’t you repeat your fears about how naughty Casanova I had been when my presence is proof.” I smirked. </p><p>“Yes, she was being ridiculous,” Carrie said as she rested against my chest, her husky tone another sign of what I had been doing where Sarah couldn’t see. “It would have made sense to think about it if it was only Irene, but Ida is there as well.” </p><p>“Exactly, Sarah,” I chuckled as I caught her gaze, letting my smirk widen. “Unless you’re going to claim that I’m such an expert of seduction that I could seduce a girl right next to her friend without her friend noticing… Or even better, seduce two girls at the same time.” </p><p>Sarah froze, her anger flaring suddenly enough to silence her. Admittedly, her anger was not unjustified. </p><p>After all, my examples were chosen carefully, both applicable to her. </p><p>Pity, she couldn’t just say so to her friend.</p><p>“Exactly, I can’t imagine any girl that wouldn’t notice something like that,” Carrie said proudly. Too proudly even, far outside her usual attitude, exaggerated to annoy Sarah. I looked at her, curious why she asked such a question, but Carrie just shrugged. </p><p>It seemed that she wasn’t particularly concerned about Sarah noticing the truth of the situation. Maybe she was aware it was not a trick that she could maintain for long, certainly not when more and more of her friend group get involved, and wanted to tease her friend as much as possible before the truth was revealed. </p><p>Especially as another fun chain awaited us once the truth was revealed. Looking at her experience with Naomi, it wasn’t like Sarah was against some friendly challenges. </p><p>But the sudden flare of anger on her face showed that she had swallowed the bait whole rather than bothering to ask why Carrie would make such a pointed question. </p><p>A rare oversight for such a smart girl, one that I was more than happy to leverage. </p><p>I slipped my foot out of my shoe and brought it to her leg. Sarah flinched as our skin touched, alarmed enough to miss Carrie’s smirk — or the fact that why Carrie didn’t find the weird position of my leg suspicious. </p><p>She managed to suppress her flinch soon, but that wasn’t enough for her to change her focus to a different direction, not when I started caressing her inner thighs. “Sorry, I misspoke,” Sarah said soon, but it was just an excuse for her to lower her head down to hide her expression. </p><p>My foot was not my most agile limb, certainly, but my growing knowledge of Sarah’s beautiful body was more than enough to compensate for that deficiency. I danced upward, teasing every single sensitive spot I had discovered. </p><p>Carrie put her hand on my crotch, gently caressing my arousal, which returned to its raging state quickly after cutting its earlier adventure halfway. </p><p>Focused on that two, I had missed the approach of someone else, which was a cardinal sin to a quarterback. Luckily, in this case, it wasn’t punished by a painful tackle. “Who is your new friend, Carrie,” said a female voice. </p><p>I raised my head, and saw the same spectacular MILF with an apron looking at us from behind the counter… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Finally, the ground once again,” I chuckled even as I enjoyed the sensation of standing, the wind on my skin, the great sensation of dominance. </p><p>So much that, even the subtle smell of decay couldn’t ruin my mood. Nor could the state of the forest in front of me, lifeless and dead, clearly affected by the subtle necrotic energy in the air. </p><p>One problem at a time, and I had one problem that was bigger than everything else. </p><p>I was, once again, fully naked, and bleeding. </p><p>“First, the wound,” I murmured even as I pulled some of the stored mana from my storage, and carefully processed it through my own Tantric. After several repeats, the efficiency wasn’t as horrible as before, though the difference between a thousand to one versus eight hundred to one wasn’t exactly a great chasm. </p><p>It still cost me more than three thousand mana just to stem the bleeding completely, enough to resurrect dozens of near-death victims back when I still had the System. </p><p>I shouldn’t be ungrateful, I decided even as I felt the sting of the wasteful operation. No matter how bad my situation, relatively, it was still leagued better than the times I had lived as the mule. </p><p>With healing done, I turned to my other survival challenges. “Should I try conjuring my clothing?” I murmured, but after a pause, I decided against it. Conjuration was not a simple spell, and I didn’t trust myself to succeed without the system’s assistance. I could experiment, but I didn’t want to do so without creating a ward to block the resulting mana flares. </p><p>I was not in a safe location. </p><p>I walked toward the nearest dead tree, and broke off a large branch, tainted with a subtle yet persistent necrotic energy, more intense than the subtle energy in the air. </p><p>“What an interesting difference,” I murmured. Back in the great area of the material plane, such mana would have been long absorbed by the System, leaving it bare. Here, the mana stuck around persistently. </p><p>It wasn’t only necrotic energy I could feel. I could also feel a great amount of ordinary mana, though its purity was significantly lower than I had expected, enough to make even the simplest mana bolt a great challenge.</p><p>Regardless, it was an interesting challenge to have a great amount of free mana, floating freely. I could even identify floating particles of other types of mana — forms that were different from anything I had seen up to this point. </p><p>“Still,” I murmured as I let some of my mana dance across the surface, easily purifying the necrotic energy back to pure mana, “the difference between here and the System lands isn’t enough to justify calling that place material plane, maybe other than the size difference.” </p><p>I received the answer sooner than I had been hoping, before I could finish even crafting my spear. The dimensional barrier was miles and miles away from my current location — thanks to the violent throw of the barrier — but even with the distance, the sound of cracking was clear…. </p><p>Maybe because it was not exactly a physical sound, but a physical effect. </p><p>At a great distance, a string of Primordial Aether started to invade the plane, distorting and disintegrating everything nearby. I shivered as I watched the scene, everything disintegrating into nothingness with the slightest touch. </p><p>The view itself wasn’t shocking, as I had watched the Primordial Aether invading the Material Plane, but back then, the Primordial Aether only spread for a moment even with the assistance of an elemental. </p><p>This time, maybe because there was no immediate basic elemental mana in the immediate vicinity — as there was no mage relying on that to cast spells, or any mage nearer than me, period — maybe because of differing elemental interest, there was no Elemental trying to widen the gap. So, the breach itself only lasted a second.</p><p>But even without constant flow from outside, the strand of Primordial Aether continued to spread, even growing stronger as it disintegrated everything it touched. </p><p>I was tempted to go close to breach, but I held back. With the rotating nature of the barrier, my own breach was unlikely to be the reason. If there were others responsible for fixing it, I would only come across them while trying to help. </p><p>Reckless assistance was not the smartest thing in a completely unfamiliar situation. Instead, I created a shield around myself, geared to block detection spells. It wasn’t perfect enough to avoid a dedicated search by an expert mage, but it was enough to hide my presence, especially since I stopped my crafting process.</p><p>I stood in place, watching the Primordial Aether slowly swallow anything in its path, but soon, I felt a magical presence at the horizon, before it was close enough to have a visual presence. </p><p>Considering the said presence was radiating necrotic energy, I decided that hiding was the most prudent option. </p><p>I crouched behind a tree to reduce my visual presence as well, getting even smaller as I saw a flying creature appear in my field of view. It wasn’t a bone dragon, but it rivaled them in size, and on its back, several cloaked figures cast repeated spells. </p><p>A ward was around them, its intricacy clear even with the great distance, radiating a mixture of pure mana and necrotic energy. </p><p>Soon, they arrived at the breach, and used the ward to control the Primordial Energy. They threw the ward like a projectile weapon, and the ward settled around the energy, imprisoning it, though it smashed repeatedly against the ward, doing its best to break it. </p><p>I expected them to store it, or at least break it down using all the mana they had. Even if they lacked my ability to break it down rapidly, surely they were not entirely incapable of doing so. </p><p>They solved it differently. A flare of mana covered the ward, and suddenly, it disappeared in a manner that I found very familiar. </p><p>Teleportation. </p><p>They literally dumped the energy into Aether dimension, which was an interesting solution. “Can a great amount of Aether grind down a strand of Primordial Aether?” I asked, though the answer was probably yes. </p><p>The necromancers looked far too interested in maintaining their control of the plane to risk destroying it completely. I stayed concealed for a while as they moved away, even after they disappeared from my senses for a while. </p><p>I didn’t know about their detection range, but I wanted to play safe. I was facing a completely unexpected reality. </p><p>I turned my attention to my spear once more, first making sure that I had erased any hint of necrotic energy — which I was much more reluctant to touch without HP to block its effects. I had invented my own energy that could technically be classified as proto-HP, but it wasn’t exactly up to the challenge of necrotic energy. </p><p>A challenge for another time, I decided as I finished cleansing the spear, and started reinforcing its structure with my mana, applying all the crafting abilities I had in mind. </p><p>It worked much better than trying to copy the healing abilities, because there was no need for nature transformation to craft a good weapon. Of course, some clever implementation of different types of mana would have given the impromptu weapon a lot of extra power, but ultimately, that was extra. </p><p>What was fundamental to crafting was to understand the nature of the materials, and, enhance it appropriately based on the requirements. I missed the intense clarity of the vision granted by Perception, which would have allowed me to comprehend every little flaw in its structure, allowing me to reinforce its nature as needed.</p><p>Still, after spending ten minutes fully focusing on its nature, I had enough sense to understand its nature. </p><p>“Now, to enhance it,” I murmured, feeling excited. It was the first time I was crafting anything without the constant intervention of the System, hungrily draining mana from every single thing constantly, forcing us to focus on durability across all of the structure. </p><p>I started by creating a simple yet intricate scheme to ensure durability, doing my best to create a strong outer shell. Even without the System constantly devouring the mana, it was a rather necessary requirement. </p><p>Then, I turned my back to the internal structure, thinning the purified mana as smoothly as possible as I created a bunch of enchantments inside. My biggest focus was the sharpness, but I also added some spells to enhance ranged accuracy, and some tricks that could be used to trigger an explosion.</p><p>“Not bad,” I whistled as I twirled the spear, listening to the whistle it created. It was not the finest item I had created, not even close, but it took nothing from its impressiveness considering I used nothing but a tainted piece of wood to create it. </p><p>Then, I flared my mana, pulling some leaves and connecting them, creating just enough to cover my modesty.</p><p>“Now, it’s time to explore,” I murmured, determined to find a source of water. And, if I was lucky, even something to hunt.  </p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Unfortunately, finding my way proved to be even more difficult than the recovery, I discovered after a day of fruitless work.</p><p>The problem was that the Primordial Aether was both too chaotic and too confusing, stymying my attempt to find my way. In comparison, the confusion created by Aether was nothing, and even then, I had the advantage of feeling the direction of the other companion nodes. </p><p>Which didn’t work while the System was unpowered — I knew it was a problem with my connection rather than the planar barriers blocking the connection, because I was feeling Aviada’s faint presence up until I had been banished, but I couldn’t feel any of the girls right now.</p><p>Still, I didn’t lose hope, as I had occasionally seen the familiar presence of a planar wall in the distance, giving me a chance to once again step on the ground rather than floating in the emptiness of Primordial Aether.</p><p>I had long prepared a mana chain, waiting for one of the planes to get close enough that I could somehow hook myself, and spend my time practicing the throwing motion. Even as I waited, however, I wondered just how many planes there were, floating in the emptiness, because I was yet to see the same plane twice — the type and shape of energy that surrounded the place to create the planar wall were more than enough to indicate the difference. </p><p> It was also the reason why I had ignored the first real opportunity to actually get in, just treating it as a practice, because I could feel very familiar energy radiating. </p><p>Necrotic energy. </p><p>“Fuck no,” I murmured even as I let the chain disperse, finally catching enough of a sample to identify its nature. The Primordial Aether worked excellently to block my senses to identify the nature of the energy, and only after I pulled myself halfway, I got a clear perception. </p><p>And immediately dropped the connection. </p><p>Dealing with Zokras had been enough of an adventure, and that was when I had the System to help. The last thing I needed was to fight through a world filled with those monsters without my ability to cheat. </p><p>I had to admit, that my determination was tested when I repeated the attempt twice during the next day, only to end up finding two planes filled with necrotic energy. Was I that unlucky, or the planes were dominated by undead monstrosities, that was a question I had no answer to.</p><p>But, considering the chain of events that led me to my current situation, I wasn’t willing to write off the unluckiness as a factor. Maybe I was just near a part that was near a region that was ruled by the undead. </p><p>It was certainly possible. The other option was that neither Janelor nor Mariel mentioned the greater world had been ruled by undead, which would have been a dangerous omission. </p><p>It had to be a bout of misfortune, I decided, but as the days passed while I floated, every attempt hit another undead plane, but either way, it was convincing enough that, when I finally hit one plane that was only partially tainted with Necrotic energy, I actually pulled. </p><p>It had already been more than a week, and I didn’t have the luxury of delaying more. </p><p>Worst case, I could breach the planar barriers and throw myself back to the Primordial Aether.  I continued to spend mana to pull toward the planar wall, squeezing my teeth. </p><p>The reason, the closer I got to the planar barrier, the stronger the sense of tribulation. As I pulled toward it, I had the opportunity to watch the show. Waves of Primordial Energy hit against the barrier, and most of it reflected back, creating a deadly turbulence that threatened to crack the shield and snap the chain, tugging me from all directions.</p><p>“I’m lucky that I had already stored some mana,” I murmured. I certainly didn’t have the opportunity to transform any mana under turbulence, even forcing me to repair the patches I used the get Primordial Aether.</p><p>Either that, or it would have shredded my shield into pieces, I thought grimly as I trudged my way through the great mess, ignoring the patches of void and shattered space. I had no doubt that, without the shield, it would have destroyed me in seconds, even with the assistance of my Divine Spark.</p><p>The difference between calm — if a word like that could even be used to that mess — Primordial Aether and turbulent Primordial Aether was that great. The difference between a lump of metal and a sharp sword. </p><p>Both were deadly, but one even deadlier. </p><p>It took all my preparation to even successfully approach, but luckily, right at the edge of the barrier, the turbulence left its place to a certain calm, enough to allow me to crack open the shield and start working on the planar barrier. </p><p>I paused a moment to identify the mana flow, trying to understand its nature. I could sense that it was little more than raw mana, with little rhyme or control, but it rotated around the plane strongly, with all the strength of a raging river, still achieving a successful blocking effect. </p><p>It was weaker than what was around the Material Plane, but considering the intensity of strength, it didn’t mean much. I could have still shattered it easily if I had the full range of abilities granted by the System, but that was not a possibility with my current abilities. </p><p>No matter how much mana I stored in my shield, because it was impossible to establish a ward in the chaos of the Primordial Aether. </p><p>Luckily, breaching was not the only way. I carefully reformed the shield even tighter before letting it swallow me, and I slowly sank ot the dimensional walls, letting it swallow me just like it was swallowing the Primordial Aether. </p><p>And I started moving even faster than I did with the assistance of my fake elemental mounts, the sensation particularly horrible with the chaotic nature of the movement, which granted me an unexpected challenge. </p><p>Motion sickness. </p><p>I wanted to curse, but despite the emotional release such a thing would bring, I decided to hold my breath and split my attention between keeping the shield stable and keeping my stomach in place. </p><p>What a ridiculous challenge to deal with, I thought, though as the journey continued, I was aware that without the boost of the Divine Spark, the sudden turns would have been enough to kill me.</p><p>Inertia was not a joke.</p><p>Though, I welcomed it even as it intensified while I got closer and closer to the center, the intensity increasing a corresponding rate. It was a sign that the rules of physics were established once more. </p><p>Welcome, even as one strip of mana suddenly breached the shield, leaving a badly bloody laceration on my body. I bit my lip, ignoring the wound, as I didn’t have the ability to actually cure it. Unlike purified mana, the primitive HP I managed to copy was too sensitive to be stored. </p><p>Luckily, Divine Spark still increased my body’s ability of natural recovery, the blood slow stymying slowly. </p><p>I focused on the shield not wanting to experience another such mistake. If that mana flare hit my neck… I shivered, not even wanting to think about it. </p><p>I missed the protective sensation of HP badly, any wound, no matter how bad, recovering rapidly under its flow. </p><p>If there was one advantage to pain, however, the queasiness I had been feeling was completely gone. Nothing like a mortal danger to cure motion sickness… </p><p>I squeezed my teeth and continued deeper into the chaos, doing my best to ignore the constant, painful drain of mana, unable to be replenished — technically, I could steal from the barrier itself, but not without hopelessly shattering my own shield.</p><p>Luckily, my preparations proved sufficient, and quite a bit before my stored mana  had finished, I had felt the trajectory of my movement change, throwing me into the sky like an arrow, before ultimately slamming on the ground. </p><p>I let the shield disperse, pulling its mana back to storage, a wide smile appearing on my face. </p><p>The sensation of the ground under my naked feet never felt that good.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“What a nice, obedient phoenix I have,” I said as I leaned down, my legs on both sides of her while I grabbed her arm. “You earned a proper reward,” I said. </p><p>“R-really,” she muttered, her innocent expression greatly contrasting with the one she wore while looking at Isolde. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I leaned down, capturing her lips in a searing kiss, Isolde’s taste still distinct on her lips as my tongue invaded her mouth, earning her murmurs. I pulled back, looking at her naked body while she panted. </p><p>The idea of a reward wasn’t exactly repulsive. </p><p>I said nothing else as I grabbed her hips, while a flare of magic commanded the chains that still kept her prisoner, pulling her arms to display her body perfectly. She looked good in chains. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to continue teasing her despite her cooperation, entertaining myself more as I entertained her, but, ultimately, I decided to be faster. Our little trip had already taken a great deal of time, and with everything going on, staying away from the capital for such a long time was not the smartest decision. </p><p>At least, not without a sudden change of mind to abandon the dangerous waters of the capital. </p><p>“Take a deep breath, and prepare yourself for your reward,” I whispered. </p><p>“D-don’t I get to pick my reward—“ she said, interrupted by my finger pressing against her lips. </p><p>“Are you saying I’m incapable of picking you the correct reward?” I asked. The shiver she displayed was simply beautiful. She shook her head, fear and anticipation battling. </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered even as I put my hands on her knees, slowly widening them. “You need to take a big breath and relax, so that you enjoy it properly.”</p><p>“As … as you wish,” she whispered as her legs parted, revealing her beautiful wetness. </p><p>I dragged my gaze up, first focusing on her heaving bosom, then her face, displaying her surrender. </p><p>“Better,” I whispered, which added another blush on her face, her lips already parted with desire. It was a beautiful moment, her rebellious aggression melted completely, leaving its place for a desire for endless pleasure. </p><p> She started trembling even as I brushed my finger to her entrance, my lips pressing against her neck for a string of gentle kisses, occasionally turning into bites that would leave lingering marks of my ownership until I let her magic free. </p><p>But the important thing was her memory. </p><p>My hands continued to dance at her entrance, preparing her for invasion. Not that it took a long time. Not when our foreplay had taken long enough to collapse Isolde. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” she gasped as I pushed my hips slowly, invading her once more, the chains shifting their shape to put her in a more convenient position. As the head slipped, and I stopped, she tensed. “P-please,”  she gasped. “I can’t wait anymore.” </p><p>I chuckled. “You’re lucky that we need to return to the capital, or you would have earned a lengthy delay,” I whispered. Her transgression wasn’t enough to lose her reward, but there was no harm in creating borders. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stammered, which melted into a moan as I pushed forward, sliding inside her mercilessly, leveraging her chained position perfectly. </p><p>“So soft,” I whispered, teasing her even as I pushed myself even deeper, enjoying the way she tightened around me in a way that wasn’t supposed to be possible, showing her magical heritage wasn’t only useful for efficient fire magic. </p><p>“Don’t—“ she gasped before a moan interrupted her, as I chose that moment to impale her harshly, followed by a slap into her ass, that, even a day ago, would have resulted in a murder attempt. </p><p>It was fascinating how several amazing sessions of lovemaking and a magical transformation could achieve.</p><p>She said nothing else after the interruption, focusing on her moans. “Better,” I said even as I followed the temptation and slapped her breasts, enjoying the way they swayed. It earned another beautiful moan. Her fiery amber eyes turned to me, clouded with excitement and desire.</p><p>It was always nice to see just how far she was surrendering to pleasure. She let herself go soft, her shivering body a masterpiece. I rammed her even harder, earning another moan as I explored her depths, making my shaft disappear completely with each rhythmic thrust, sinking into her warm depths. </p><p>It wasn’t the first she was stretching under my assault, but her moans were still as enthusiastic, especially after I shifted my grip to her hips, creating an even better angle with the help of the chains. </p><p>I said nothing else, enjoying the sway of her tits under my assault, the angle enhancing their reaction to my relentless fucking even further. I decided to loosen my control over her magic, and immediately, her body was covered with flames. Bright with their new accessory, they danced and tumbled, creating a masterwork of art as she held onto the melting chains. </p><p>Though, even as the chains disappeared and she pressed her hands on the ground to stay in position, her beautiful ass jingled no less impressively with each thrust, her body adapting to my rhythm.  </p><p>She let out a moan, unadulterated with nothing, filled with pure pleasure. “It looks like you’re loving your reward,” I whispered.</p><p>“Oh, the living flame! Yes!” she moaned, her words carrying the slur of exhaustion as I rammed hard. It seemed that, with everything that happened, even her magic was not enough to completely resolve her exhaustion.</p><p>“I don’t know,” I murmured jokingly. “Maybe you can use a break, you sound tired.”</p><p>“No!” she managed to gasp between her moans, her voice filled with an urgency that showed she wasn’t willing to take the risk of treating it like a joke. </p><p>Beautiful.  </p><p>“If that’s your wish,” I said, amused by her reaction as I picked up speed, even more, her legs spreading enough to show the impressive limits of her flexibility... </p><p>I smiled as the sound of our hips colliding filled the meadow, enjoying her total surrender. Her back arched under the pleasure as her tits pointed at the sky, every vigorous slam making her body rock dangerously. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have enough time to see the full limits of her endurance without relying on some tricks. I cast another spell, creating a pair of ice cubes to dance around her nipples. Her flames tried to melt, but I maintained a constant flow of mana to maintain their cold. </p><p>The contrast with her flames made her moan even louder. </p><p>With the assistance of my trick, the steady drilling worked even more effectively, adding another contender for the most erotic moments of my life, her identity making it even more spectacular.</p><p>As I doubt many could claim to have tamed a rebellious phoenix. </p><p>Her tightness suddenly intensified, grabbing my presence even tighter than my chains, warning me that it was time to end it. I slammed into her for one last time, the sound mixing into her desperate cries as the climax hit her hard, leaving her a trembling mess. </p><p>My body responded in kind, filling her insides with my mark. Similarly, our magical connection throbbed with energy, tightening our link even more. It was not as significant as the previous time, but considering it came with some magical improvement, it was hard to write it off as insignificant as well. </p><p>I didn’t expect a reward back, at the end of our session, not that I was complaining. </p><p>Power meant freedom, and more only meant it would be easier for me to protect my destiny. </p><p>I chuckled as I glanced at her, her eyes closed as she was overwhelmed with pleasure mixing with the exhaustion of her transformation.  </p><p>Unfortunately, unlike them, I didn’t have the luxury of sleeping. First, I walked around, reinforcing the wards, which had been strained by our constant efforts, then turned my attention to other aspects, erasing the remains of our presence — particularly any flickers of living flame, my own sensitivity helping to catch those.</p><p>I didn’t want anyone to come here, marking that. </p><p>Yet, as I pulled that mana, a sudden instinct hit me, and I raised my hand, letting the fires cover it for a moment. “A devastating weapon,” I murmured even as I suppressed the flames, immediately feeling the tenseness of pressure after the disappearance.</p><p>A devastating but risky weapon. Still, better having than not having, I decided.</p><p>I turned to look at Cinder and Isolde. </p><p>My little trip had been more useful than I expected. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Finally,” I murmured as I waved the car away, and the driver waved back just as enthusiastically, doing my best not to frown. </p><p>The driver turned out to be a football fan just like the nurses, but that fact was much less fun. He had chewed my ear with a huge monologue about why our offensive strategy was wrong. technically, he was right about it as he focused on Spencer’s horrible offensive schemes. </p><p>If only he didn’t have an actual binder on how to fix those strategies, which was filled with some of the most blindingly horrible strategies I could ever imagine. But since I was riding in pajamas — the only thing I could find in the hospital room during my emergency discharge — I didn’t have the luxury of leaving the car, making the twenty-minute drive into a small torture.</p><p>I was lucky that he didn’t hear about the concussion rumors — I knew it was leaked due to a sudden spike of Intent I had been receiving — as he would have chewed my ear. But it didn’t trigger any new Traits, </p><p>I kept my guide hidden during the trip, not wanting to miss the sudden flow of Intent. I didn’t know if it helped the System, but since it helped my guide to heal, I wanted to test whether more Intent would help the System recover. </p><p>Which would, hopefully, fix the trouble with the upper limit of the Traits. </p><p>But as I left the waving driver behind, my mind slipped back to the recent fame. The intent itself was good, but as the annoying driver showed, being a local celebrity was not all roses, I decided even as I climbed up the stairs of my room, preparing to open the door — I didn’t have the key with me, but the dorm doors weren’t the safest. </p><p>When I arrived at the door, however, I found it already unlocked. </p><p>An intruder, I realized, tensing. I considered for a moment to go back and call security, but another possible attempt by the sender of the shadow assassins changed my mind. I didn’t expect the shadows, mostly because they were incorporeal, but it was likely that they had decided to go with an alternative. </p><p>If my guide hadn’t awakened from her long sleep, I would have turned and left. But with her present — and seemingly much more competent even if she was still as shy — I was more confident in challenging whatever threat that might lie at the other side, whether it was a few offensive linemen to make me pay, or a new supernatural threat. </p><p>I prepared to summon my guide even as I pushed the door open, ready to throw myself to the side in case of a sudden attack — a gun or some kind of fireball — only to lose my tenseness when I found Megan sitting on my bed. </p><p>Her arrival reason was clear, as she had my duffel bag next to the bed. She clearly brought my stuff as she played the role of concerned girlfriend. </p><p>“Oh, it’s you,” she said, losing her subtle tenseness as she shifted. I didn’t miss the fact that she crossed her legs as she turned toward me, giving me a glimpse of her lack of underwear for a fleeting second, perfectly calculated while looking accidental. </p><p>I let my eyes drop, confirming I had noticed it, but limiting my reaction to that. If she wanted to play the teasing game, I was more than willing to do the same — even though I was handicapped due to the beautiful medical application getting cut halfway.  </p><p>“Well, it’s my room, so it’s not a big surprise,” I said with a chuckle, but even as I walked toward her, I pushed my Seduction to the limit, prowling as I closed, my walk wouldn’t be amiss at the climax scene in a romantic movie just before the lead kisses the heroine, charged with sexual energy yet still charismatic. </p><p>Seduction Trait was very, very useful. </p><p>She shuffled in her place as I closed on, but to her credit, the slight tipping of her head was her only reaction as I stood in front of her. </p><p>“Oh, I don’t know. You were at the hospital after that devastating punch from our glorious coach.” </p><p>I was impressed that she delivered that sentence without actually laughing. I didn’t bother with that. “Yeah,” I said with a chuckle. “Maybe he was a heavyweight boxer before becoming a coach.” </p><p>“I heard he was the student of a former world champion,” she countered, this time unable to prevent a smirk from breaking out. Then, she turned serious. “How the hell you managed to convince the hospital to give you a fake concussion report,” she added. </p><p>For a moment, I thought about telling a fake story about a deal, but the story was high profile enough to break out otherwise. Instead, I decided to give the truth — at least, a close approximation of it. </p><p>“It’s magical how easy to manipulate arrogant professors,” I said with a smirk, avoiding mentioning her unhealthy interest in my brain scan. “A careless remark about their youth and incompetency, squeezed between calling them a virgin nerd, and suddenly, they are very enthusiastic to punish you.” </p><p>“And the best way to punish you…” Megan murmured. </p><p>“To prevent me from playing football, of course,” I completed. “Pity it would make Coach Spencer’s life very uncomfortable as he tries to coach.” </p><p>That made Megan’s smirk widen. “Oh, he will be very uncomfortable indeed,” she said. “So, what are your plans next now that you can’t play?” she asked. </p><p>“But you’re wrong, I just can’t play football.” </p><p>“What are you talking about. A concussion report bans you from every single sport due to concussion risk. Even athletism branches wouldn’t allow you to compete.” </p><p>“Oh, but you forget that I’m already the player of another sport, one that was with absolutely no concussion risk,” I said. </p><p>It took a moment for her to connect the dots. “Chess,” she said with a distasteful frown. “That’s not a sport.” </p><p>“Oh, let’s agree to disagree,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>“I can’t believe you’re wasting your time with a board game,” she added, though this time it was clearly an attempt to trigger me. </p><p>“Well, I’ll play that board game as long as it pays my scholarship,” I said. “And don’t you think it’s a good story to show me fighting for the glory of our beloved school, even after I was traitorously sucker-punched by an overpaid administrator.” </p><p>“Yeah,” she nodded as she stood up, leaning forward to give a deep view of her cleavage, showing her panties weren’t the only missing part of her outfit. It was a beautiful, inviting view. </p><p>But the anticipatory expression on her face prevented me from making a move. She was clearly trying to goad me, so that she could reject me, taking revenge for the trick I had pulled together with Kim. </p><p>“So, what’s our next move,” she said, doing her best to hide her frustration as she leaned against my desk. I had to admire the smoothness of her action, making sure her skirt rode up as she leaned back, but managed to make it look like a complete accident. </p><p>I smirked, though it was less about her move — not that I didn’t enjoy it — but about the way she had instinctively referred to us as a team rather than asking my strategy. </p><p>“Well, the first part is the reputation. I’ll make sure to know that while my diagnostic was not as optimistic as I hoped, I’m still a part of the team, and I’ll not only join all the training sessions, but also help the coaching staff train my replacement.” </p><p>“Hmm, isn’t it a bit gambly? You can’t predict what he will do.” </p><p>“No, honey. Not at all.” </p><p>“What do you expect, for him to reject that, or accept?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Honestly, I don’t know, or care. Either he accepts despite making very clear just how much he doesn’t like me, shattering his authority on the defensive side for the year with no hopes of recovering without replacing all the players, or rejects and shows just how much of a small-minded petty person he is.” </p><p>“Either way, you win,” she said. “Just like a casino.” </p><p>“Exactly. Making sure to win at every outcome is the only way to gamble,” I said.  </p><p>Megan nodded as she leaned back, which she used to give another glimpse of her beauty under her skirt, and this time, I let my gaze linger longer. It was a measured trick, convincing her that her tricks were working. </p><p>“It has been late, I have to leave if there’s nothing else,” she said as she half-turned. </p><p>She had a smirk on her face as I stood up, which died with my words. “You’re right, it’s late. And I already bothered you enough for the night.” </p><p>“Right…” she said as she looked at me suspiciously, which was quick to turn into anger as she realized the subtle trick I had pulled, one that left her committed to leaving. </p><p>Of course, my smile left no doubt that I was not kicking her out. All she needed was to suppress her pride enough to give a simple excuse to stay, and she would have a fun night  — a fun that was not in doubt the slightest as she watched me giving a night of ecstasy to her friend just a couple nights ago.</p><p>Her pride proved to be pricklier than her desire. With an annoyed huff, she walked away, her steps hard on the floor, and a while later, I heard the distinctive sound of her engine getting away. </p><p>I chuckled even as I reached for mind space, summoning my guide… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“S-sorry, professor, we’re helping the patient, and he was feeling a bit self-conscious,” Nancy managed to shout even as she grabbed and removed her jersey, and replicated that for her friend, before dragging her stumbling body to the other room. </p><p>“Why is she here, I thought Doctor Williams was responsible for the patient,” Stacy gasped. “She never visits patients.”  </p><p>I fixed my gown, which didn’t help much considering I had a raging boner, forcing me to pull the covers on as well — even if that was mighty uncomfortable with my body still heated after the earlier show — and the two naked beauties disappearing into the other room. </p><p>Even when they returned half a minute later, with their uniforms back on, their sexiness didn’t diminish that much. Their uniforms were back on, but their lack of underwear was even less inconspicuous with the way their erect nipples pushed against the fabric, or the way their hair mussed. </p><p>Altogether, they weren’t exactly able to erase what had been going on. </p><p>Which contrasted greatly with their expression of panic, especially when they failed to fix their outlook as much as they wished. </p><p>Considering the fear they displayed, along with the title, I expected a woman in her fifties, maybe even sixties, which was why I was surprised when the door was unlocked and a tall woman barely in her thirties stepped inside. </p><p>A glance was enough to understand the source of their fear. She was young, but that didn’t impact the sharp aura she was radiating, one that was helped by her tall stature, and the way she gathered her hair tightly on the back like an eighteen-century matron. </p><p>The glasses she was wearing just enhanced the scary glint as she looked at the two nurses, the slight tightening of her lips suggested that she didn’t miss the way they were dressed.</p><p>But she chose not to comment as she turned to face me — but the lack of relief on their face suggested it was not the end. Poor girls stayed on the side of the door, too afraid to even move. </p><p>The professor walked toward me, her steps steady even as she turned toward me, her expression carrying a glint of interest. Unfortunately, it was not a glint of interest, but something different than two poor nurses had on them. </p><p>One that made me feel like an experiment. </p><p>She stood next to me, flashing a penlight to my eye without even bothering to talk, her fingers digging to my chin, which confirmed one thing. </p><p>She didn’t earn her title because of her excellent bedside attitude. </p><p>I said nothing as used the light against my gaze, then pinched my arm to test my reflexes, followed by a plethora of other reactions. “Go and prepare the operation room,” she said to the nurses immediately. </p><p>“Wait a moment,” I called immediately, which stopped the nurses. “What operation?” </p><p>She looked at me, looking surprised that I even talked. “You need an urgent operation,” she told in a matter-of-fact tone. “There’s a risk of brain aneurysm if we don’t intervene.” </p><p>I didn’t need my Traits to see she was bullshitting. Her curiosity, along with the way she approached made me extremely suspicious. Her position as a professor suggested great ambition, combined with the nurses' attitude and the little mention of her habits of not dealing with patients suggested that she was not exactly interested in my health. </p><p>I sighed as I looked at her, wondering if the System somehow affected my luck somewhat considering the people I started to encounter. </p><p>But clearly, she had noticed some kind of interesting thing in the MR. I had no idea what. </p><p>Or more accurately, I had many ideas but didn’t know which one was true, from the possibility of mental Traits somehow changing my brain to Recovery triggering a recovery reaction that didn’t conform with the scientific principles. It might even be the reappearance of my guide creating some kind of mental reaction. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I didn’t trust any authority as far as I could throw to actually consent to such a risk. Not to lie under the knife of a woman that didn’t even bother telling the truth about the situation. </p><p>“It might be, but that doesn’t take away my right to reject the treatment,” I said with a shrug, with absolutely no intention to deal with her. Though, I frowned in frustration, as it was a risk I failed to consider when I was lost in my own cleverness of tricking Coach Spencer, despite my initial fears of ending up in an experiment table when I first received the System. </p><p>Arrogance was a costly trait, though luckily this time, it came along with a curious professor with a horrible personality rather than a SWAT team wearing hazmat suits. </p><p>It was something I needed to be careful about going forward. </p><p>“What do you mean, you reject the treatment,” she said, her voice between anger and shock, like she was trying to comprehend I had rejected her claim in the first place. </p><p>“Very simple, I’m using my legal right to reject the treatment, and I will check myself out of the hospital,” I said as I stood up. </p><p>If there was one thing at the sudden tenseness, it dealt with my anger impressively. Under her tight glare, I started searching the drawers for something to wear — my uniform left behind in the ambulance, and no one else bringing anything with them. </p><p>I didn’t miss her walking behind me, but I forced myself not to react even as she grabbed my arm and pulled, her well-manicured nails digging into my arm. “Who do you think you are, you arrogant little boy,” she started. </p><p>I looked at her, but just as I was about to lash out, something clicked in my mind. “I’m the meathead that can use you, little girl,” I answered, but rather than using Intimidation, which would have convinced her to back up, I used the Taunt to mock her, complete with a leering smirk. </p><p>The gasp of anger that covered her face, thick enough to shatter the matter-of-fact confidence she was wearing was beautiful. “R-really,” she said, her anger forcing her to swallow. “As you wish, come begging to my room once you change your mind,” she said and walked away, fuming. </p><p>But she stopped when she was at the doorway, and turned to the nurses. “Make sure to update his file that he’s forbidden from playing due to serious risk of further concussions, pending a more detailed examination,” she said, then paused for a moment. “And, come see me in my room after discharging him. You have five minutes, or I fire you,” she added. </p><p>One last little annoyance, prevented me from enjoying their long consolation even as the professor disappeared away.</p><p>Leaving me alone with two shocked nurses. “You shouldn’t have done that,” Nancy muttered after a while, her voice grave. “She has a reputation for holding grudges.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Come on, sweetie, the worst, I’ll start going to another hospital. It’s not like she’s the only doctor,” I said, and winked. “It’s not like she’s the only doctor in the town.” </p><p>Their expression tightened even more. “No, but she’s literally the best neurosurgeon in the whole state, no doctor in the state would dare to give a second opinion contrasting hers.” </p><p>“Ah. It might be not as simple as I had assumed, then,” I said, but I didn’t know what to feel. On one hand, a report on concussion risk was very inconvenient, as it blocked me from playing any sports with body contact. </p><p>Meaning, not only I couldn’t play football, but any sport with the risk of collusion was out, which included a wide range from basketball to hockey. I had no idea what the protocol was for athleticism, but I wasn’t really interested in them as well. Athleticism was hardly popular unless they were the Olympics. </p><p>And while it was supremely tempting to collect Intent on a global scale, I didn’t exactly know that it was the greatest idea to be that high profile. The shadow assassins showed that even now, I was being noticed. </p><p>But I didn’t mind that much. I still had chess in short term. </p><p>Yet, it was not all negative. The only reason I faked concussion was to put Coach Spencer on the hot seat after his very public punch, and the report of my high risk of brain damage would ruin his career. </p><p>Which meant he would use his family power to make the professor issue a clean report, and the stronger the professor, the longer their battle would take. Not playing for a couple weeks was a good trade to make myself untouchable to Coach Spencer — maybe even actually convince him that coaching was more trouble than it was worth. </p><p>Of course, since I was a pessimist, I couldn’t exactly write off the possibility that the professor would be the victorious party, but if that happened, I decided to focus on that possibility later. </p><p>But I made a mental note to hack the hospital network first. A little precaution wouldn’t hurt.  I didn’t expect to easily reach and erase my reports without a monumental effort, which was doubtlessly held behind several layers of external security and physical backups. </p><p>But the same didn’t apply to emails. </p><p>“Don’t worry about that, sweetie, I’ll just come and accept the operation in a week if she doesn’t change her mind,” I said as I looked at them, giving them a big smile. I had no intention of doing so, of course, but a little white lie wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>“S-should we try to keep it a secret?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I answered, letting my smirk widen. “Actually, why don’t you wait until I leave the hospital, then do your best to ‘accidentally’ drop the information to some of the gossip?” </p><p>“Why?” Nancy asked, while Stacy just look confused. </p><p>“Oh, it will make the school pressure the hospital, and it’ll quicken my return to the field, of course,” I said, giving a workable excuse. What I wanted was chaos to annoy both the arrogant professor and Coach  Spencer. </p><p>The bigger, the better. </p><p>One that worked well, making their smiles bloom. “Now, why don’t you call me a taxi while I sign your jerseys. You have worked well…”  </p>",

    "content": "<p>\"Y-you’re so rude,” she muttered, though her blush was more of a shy tone than anger — a difference that I had long learned to identify — as she brought her clothes under the fabric she was using as a dress at the moment, doing her best to minimize the flashes of skin. </p><p>Not particularly successfully, giving me a delicious glimpse of her glistening perfect skin, tempting me to drag my tongue over it. </p><p>As I focused on her accidental reveals, another great explosion happened near the ship, showing that the retreat wasn’t going as well as they had been hoping — not that it was surprising. The crime of sinking a ship was significant, but amusingly, it was the suspicion that they had been transporting me — and the dragon hearts I had stolen — that intensified their chase. </p><p>They didn’t know I was a stowaway, but luckily, their armaments were enough to prevent them from stopping for a search. </p><p>Truly a great stroke of luck. </p><p>I ignored another, even louder explosion, even if it made the ship shake horribly, showing that, if it wasn’t for the great protective wards the ship relied on, it might have delivered catastrophic damage. </p><p>Even with the wards, the ship had slowed down slightly. I didn’t let it worry me, as they were yet to return to the hidden deck to use their magical ballista and other weapons, which was enough to show their confidence to escape. </p><p>I didn’t know where their confidence came from, but I chose to trust their expertise, and focus on the task at hand. </p><p>Watching Xia shuffle panicked as she tried to cover herself. </p><p>Unlike me, she lacked the strategic experience to ignore the nearest explosion as insignificant, jumping in panic. And, the fabric was barely hanging on her body in the first place, and utterly failed to stay on when she jerked in panic. </p><p>It slid down, leaving her in a beautiful panic. Her first reflex was to lean down and pick it up, which gave me a glimpse of her beautiful breasts, their perfect shape more than enough to compensate for their modest size.</p><p>I whistled in appreciation, which was enough for her to stop and her breasts with her arms, her legs crossed. It reduced the glimpse I was receiving, but it also stopped her from putting it on.</p><p>“L-look away,” she muttered shyly, making me chuckle as I watched her forget that she was a mighty sorceress, and had dozens of magical ways to solve her problems, instead doing her best to cover her body with her arms.</p><p>“You’re lucky that I’m a helpful man,” I said with a chuckle as I crouched, and she took a panicked step behind me. I grabbed the fabric and raised it, gesturing for her to pick it up. </p><p>She reached, the temporary absence of an arm around her chest giving me another glimpse of her nipple, which was getting harder. Before her hand could touch, I made a show of stumbling backward. </p><p>“Sorry, it’s the ship,” I murmured. “It’s so hard to stand up straight.” </p><p>“Yes, you have such a poor balance,” she replied. “I have seen it during the fight, you’re very clumsy,” she added, biting back in annoyance — though it enhanced her shyness even further.</p><p>It was wrong to do, but watching her stumble due to her shyness, enough to forget her own magical abilities, was simply too entertaining to stop. So, when she reached toward it, I pulled it again, though this time, I didn’t even bother faking a stumble. “Oops,” I said in a deadpan voice. </p><p>“J-jerk,” she stammered, but she neither tried to cast a spell nor used one of the many barriers in the deck to change back to her clothes. Instead, she tried to grab the fabric once again, this time quickly and without a warning, hoping to catch me by surprise. </p><p>She had no chance of matching my reflexes. I pulled back my arm at the last moment, making her fingers brush against the fabric helplessly. I wanted to show her the futility of her action, but she chose to take that as a near victory, and her arm moved again, this time followed by a step forward, in her hurry, her other arm sliding just enough to reveal her treasures. </p><p>If we were in a different location, I would have retreated back, turning it into an amusing chase, to see just how long it would take for her to realize the absurdity of the situation. However, with the constant risk of the sailors coming down, it was hardly the safest choice.</p><p>The other option was to let her grab the fabric and win our little game, but it was almost as unappetizing as an option. </p><p>But that was not the only way of stopping our little game. I had another way, one that would distract her from the battle for a long time. I stepped forward at the same time, passing her even as wrapped the fabric around her tight, trapping her arms. </p><p>Yet keeping the fabric low enough to create beautiful cleavage, one that looked even better as I hugged her from behind. </p><p>“Here, let me help,” I said cheekily. She froze as she felt my arms around her, preventing him from moving. </p><p>“M-Marcus, let me go,” she whispered throatily, her voice colored with reluctance. </p><p>“Oh, really, is this what you truly want?” I whispered into her ear, which was enough to freeze in my arms.  A whimper escaped her mouth, but that was the extent of her complaints, even as I let the silence stretch. </p><p>Her silence turned rather thick as I tugged the fabric down a bit, enhancing her cleavage enough to give a glimpse of her areolas while still keeping her nipples hidden. I could have pulled it more, but it could never rival the excitement of slowly divesting her of her clothing. </p><p>Well, what passed for clothing in her current mode of dress. </p><p>I stayed still for a moment, letting her process the moment, giving her the time to change her mind, but her response was to press her hips against my erection. She did so subtly, trying to hide it as a shuffle, but it was hard to conceal when it was like that when the movement of her hips turned rhythmic in quick succession. </p><p>I wasn’t exactly surprised by that. After all, it was not a mystery that women found power attractive, and Xia had just watched me win several impossible battles in quick succession. And, like it wasn’t enough, she had experienced those deadly situations directly, reminding her of her mortality. </p><p>It was only natural that she wanted to affirm her life.</p><p>I had no doubt that, if it was not for her intense shyness that showed a distinct lack of experience with sexual adventures, she would have turned in my arms and started kissing me — before transitioning into even more entertaining activities.  </p><p>Not that I had any problem with her shyness. Her initiative would have been entertaining, but it would have been intense. In comparison, her clumsy attempts to slip a couple rubbing were still sexy, and extended for a much longer time. </p><p>And, considering we had nothing to do until the battle outside concluded one way or another, there was no need to move fast. It was a rather excellent way to kill some time.</p><p>I kept my arms around her waist, though not as tight as a moment before. She could have easily pulled her arms and fixed the fabric, but she ignored that in favor of continuing her fake struggle, her body rubbing against mine, her blush getting thicker. </p><p>With my loose grip and her constant rubbing, the fabric continued to slip down, revealing her nipples. However, with her eyes closed to fully enjoy the moment, she missed that fact. </p><p>That, or she closed her eyes just to have an excuse to miss that fact, I corrected myself as the fabric continued to slide, leaving most of her torso naked as it gathered around my arms — which were wrapped at her waist. </p><p>I noticed the quirk on her lips, realizing her ploy. She was too shy to take a concrete step forward, but she wasn’t too shy to let herself slowly get naked, hoping to tempt me to rip the cover away aggressively. </p><p>Too bad for her that it only increased my determination to play with her slowly… </p><p>I did nothing but enjoy Xia’s constant rubbing, her apparent excuse of trying to extract herself from my arms getting more and more unbelievable each second. </p><p>However, before I could take the next step, the hatch opened once more, followed by rapid footsteps. </p><p>Horrible timing. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing as Ida stood in front of Irene, her camera lowered as she caressed Irene’s cheek, making her shudder in shock.</p><p>And, it was the full range of her movement. Her hips, in particular, stayed absent of any kind of movement as Irene did her best to look normal, a reasonable reaction as I was fully inside her, and the slightest movement would be enough to make her moan. </p><p>And the poor girl was still under the impression that she was able to hide her trick her friend successfully. She did her best to hide the signs of her growing arousal. It left her even weaker against Ida’s wandering finger as it trailed down her neck to travel between her amazing valley. </p><p>However, as she leaned forward enough for their breasts to press together, Irene wasn’t the only one that was struggling to contain her reaction. The sight of their breasts pressing together was amazing, and the height differential allowed me to get a perfect view of it. </p><p>Making my arousal reach an unbelievable level. </p><p>Letting Ida play around was fun. </p><p>But not as fun as taking back control. </p><p>“Oh, if you want to be a model, let’s put your determination to test,” I said suddenly as I grabbed her camera, pulling off her fingers before she could react. </p><p>The speed with her confidence shattered without her totem to help her was simply amazing. Ida took a step back, her arms jerking to cover her breasts. “Ohh, tables are turned,” Irene said, her fear turning into entertainment as she looked at her friend, but my arm prevented her from taking a step as she tried to take a step forward. </p><p>“Let’s not bother your friend while she models,” I said even as I tightened my hold over her waist, with no intention of letting her go. </p><p>Not when I was so close to exploding. </p><p>Instead, I dragged her toward the seat while I simultaneously raised the camera, and took the first photo. Then, I sat down and pulled Irene onto my lap, accompanied by a moan. “A good way to deal with a barbarian princess,” I said with a chuckle as I slid my hand to her hips, directing her hips to rock back and forth. </p><p>A treatment that she didn’t argue against, though it might be more about the moans she was letting out than actually trying to contain them. </p><p>“Drop your hands to the side,” I ordered Ida, and she was quick to follow that order, like before, unable to resist my domineering tone without her camera, the switch was simply marvelous. </p><p>She said nothing even as her shoulders slouched, which would not do. “Come on beautiful, you’re a photographer, you should know the proper way to pose,” I said, and her shoulders rose immediately as she took a more alluring pose. </p><p>The contrast with her shy expression made her even sexier. </p><p>“Such a shy little girl, right?” I asked Irene, who was busy sliding back and forth on my lap desperately. </p><p>She responded with a soft moan before answering, doing her best to hide the true nature of her rocking, unaware it had been completely pointless from the start. But, I wasn’t surprised by it. After all, she wasn’t the only one in her friend group that strongly overestimated her ability to keep such activities hidden. </p><p>“Oh, she’s always like that,” Irene managed to say with a chuckle. “But take her camera away, and she’s as obedient as a little puppy.” </p><p>“Let’s test it, then,” I said with a chuckle before I turned my gaze to Ida. “Let’s save you from the domineering weight of your clothing, sweetie, drop everything,” I ordered. </p><p>Irene chuckled. “That was a mistake. She’s more shy than obedient, and with that —“ she started, only to be interrupted by a gasp as Ida quickly shed the rest of her clothing, leaving herself in her birthday suit. </p><p>“You were saying?” I said even as I spanked Irene’s ass. </p><p>“I-impossible,” she gasped, though the way I grabbed her hips to intensify her movement didn’t help her to contain her shock. “She is…” </p><p>Her shock was understandable, as I had no doubt that, under tamer conditions, Ida would have reacted shyly. But, there were factors that changed it. One was the detailed explanation she received from Naomi about what could happen. </p><p>Even more impactful was the little adventure we had while Irene was dressing, and her direct involvement in Irene’s loss of virginity. </p><p>Compared to those, a little nudity was nothing. </p><p>“Good girl, now crawl toward us,” I said. </p><p>Irene watched the beautiful sight of the exotic Asian beauty crawling toward us while I took pictures, but only when she passed the halfway mark, she realized what her growing closeness would mean. </p><p>Or, in particular, just how much it would allow her to see her from that angle. </p><p>Irene twisted to face me, her eyes wide. “Stop her —“ she started, only for me to put my finger on her lips. </p><p>“No need to panic, sweetie. Do you really think that you managed to keep what was going on hidden from her?” I said, enjoying her growing panic. </p><p>“You …. You knew,” she stammered as she looked back to Ida, who dipped her head in shame. Yet, her steady crawling didn’t stop. </p><p>I chuckled even as I grabbed her loincloth. “And, since she knows, there’s no need to bother with this, right,” I said, a pull enough to equalize their state of clothing. </p><p>Though, considering I was sliding inside her repeatedly, the impact of the move was greater than she had initially expected. “No,” she gasped as she put her hands on her crotch, the shock of fully revealing what was going on impacting her more than Ida’s information. </p><p>Ida just crawled obediently until she was in front of us. “What a naughty little girl, right?” I said, and Irene nodded reflexively, still busy hiding what had been going on — which was harder than it was supposed to be as I held her legs and parted them wide. </p><p>“Yeah,” she stammered. </p><p>“Not like you at all,” I added, which was enough to silence her while I pulled her to the side, giving an even better view of the show. Then, I turned to Ida. “You deserve a big punishment for tricking your friend,” I said. </p><p>Ida nodded cutely while she avoided my gaze, but she still caught my gesture to get closer. She rose until her head was positioned between Irene’s legs. </p><p>“What—“ Irene started, panicked, but her panic didn’t prevent an instantaneous interruption.</p><p>“Lick,” I ordered, and Ida followed immediately. Her tongue darted out, dancing at her entrance. The movement of her tongue was steady, and not particularly skilled, but after the shocks she had experienced, Irene wasn’t exactly in the mood to distinguish, and chose to enjoy the feeling. </p><p>She didn’t tell me that, not when she was busy covering her face to hide her reaction as her first time transformed from a sneaky adventure into a threesome, which was enough to overwhelm the playful redhead. </p><p>I didn’t have to rely on her words to measure her enjoyment. The intensity of her moans was one indicator, and her sudden tightness was another. </p><p>Ida proved her obedience by focusing on her task, the speed of her tongue only getting faster as I raised my camera and took several photos of her in the process. </p><p>The clicks of the camera only made Irene more concerned with her current state, but the only effect was to make her bury her face deeper into her hands, her hips still dancing, doing their best to milk an explosion out of me before she reached her own completion.  </p><p>“So, do you have any other interesting costume for me to wear?” I asked as I slipped my fingers through her red mane and pulled her head back. I didn’t do it harshly like I would have done against Sarah or Naomi, who enjoyed physical impact much more than Irene did.</p><p>The great speed she followed my gentle pull to reveal her face confirmed that I managed to read her accurately. “Maybe Geniason, the King of Kings,” Irene muttered even as she looked at Ida.</p><p>Ida chuckled a bit without stopping, making me curious. I put a kiss on Irene’s neck, one that turned into a soft, playful bite before I asked a question. “Why don’t you explain to me why it’s funny, sweetie,” I asked. </p><p>Irene shivered. “Well, he’s the evil king,“ she started, then paused. </p><p>“And,” I added, curious about her statement. </p><p>“He’s famous for his harem,” she added. For a moment, I thought that she was already aware of what I had been doing with her other friends, which surprised me as I assumed she didn’t know. </p><p>Then, I noticed she was looking at Ida rather than me, and realized she wasn’t talking about her other friends but Ida, making her comparison about the potential future from her perspective. </p><p>Very near future if her absolute lack of attempt to stop Ida while she licked her. </p><p>“Cheeky,” I said even as I grabbed her hips and push her down, not bothering to mention just accurate her comparison was. </p><p>I had no intention of ruining such a fun reveal prematurely. </p><p>She didn’t complain about my response, too busy moaning under the quickening assault, and soon, she tightened with the telltale sign of a climax. Then, her body turned limp. She didn’t fall unconscious, but it wasn’t a faraway direction either. </p><p>I was yet to climax, but luckily, I had options.  </p><p>“Geniason wants his next bride, then,” I growled even as I lifted Irene and placed her next to me, leaving my lap empty. </p><p>Ida stood up, her beautiful body trembling in anticipation… Pity that before I could pull her onto my lap, Irene’s phone rang. </p><p>“M-my mom, she’s coming early,” Irene gasped in panic. “You need to go.” </p><p>I might have tempted to tease her about that, but I had already pushed her enough for the day. </p><p>Instead, I leaned forward and captured Ida’s lips in a searing kiss,” Geniason will take his bride later,” I said after I pulled back. Ida collapsed against the seat, her legs finally surrendering against their trembling while I quickly dressed and left the house. </p><p>The experience of getting away from cheerleaders’ houses before their fathers — or more than once, boyfriends — arrived made me very proficient in beating a hasty retreat.  </p>",
