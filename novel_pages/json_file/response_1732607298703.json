    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I watched Queen Sapphire walk toward the entrance of my cell with large steps, her hurry unable to be hidden, even though her hurried steps forced me to come to a radical decision as soon as possible. </p><p>The simplest option was to use the concealment assistance of my blade — the same blade she gave to me from the treasury — to bypass her and took my position in the cell, to continue the impression that I was a prisoner. </p><p>However, simple didn’t necessarily mean useful. At this point, Aria and Emma already knew about my state of freedom. Isolde had no idea, but since she was imprisoned below the cells of the Phoenix, she was not a factor until I could decide what to do with her. </p><p>Which meant that, ignoring Lancelot, she was the only one I needed to deal with. I could maintain the illusion of imprisonment, but how long. And more importantly, to what end. Maybe it was the time to reveal the truth to her, I decided even as I continued to follow her. </p><p>Then, a smirk popped on my face as I made another important decision. Just because I wanted to reveal to her the truth didn’t mean that I had to do it in a boring way. So, I stayed hidden as she opened the cell door, only for her to freeze in shock. </p><p>“No,” she gasped as she stood in the entrance, looking at the empty cell. “Where is he!” </p><p>“Where’s who?” I asked as I stood behind her, using the same voice that I used as a merchant. </p><p>“The dark—“ she started as she started turning, only to take a step back before she completed, quick to process her shock. There was a reason she was able to keep the Empire under her control despite her limited power base. </p><p>I could have played the difference between the mysterious merchant and the dark lord for a while more, but at this point, it would be a waste of time, so I was displaying the three artifacts I had received from her on my body, the Shield strapped to my back, the Sword on my waist, and the Tether wrapped around my forearm. </p><p>A lesser woman might have continued to question whether the merchant was a different person or not after the reveal, but for all her faults, Sapphire was certainly not slow. “Why?” she asked instead as she took another step back, but to her credit, she managed to keep that step small, impossible to notice if I hadn’t been watching carefully. </p><p>“Why, what?” I asked, not bothering to hide my amusement, acting like I didn’t understand her question. </p><p>I expected her to react explosively. However, she just looked calmer, showing the aura of a ruler. I let her succeed, confident that my next answer would destroy that aura after I forced her to clarify. “Why continue to stay at the capital after you got yourself free?”</p><p>“You’re assuming that it wasn’t a part of my plans to capture and to be hidden here in the first place,” I answered as I brought one of the most charming smiles on my face while I took a step forward. </p><p>The honest gasp of shock that escaped her mouth was simply beautiful, frozen enough that when I took a step forward to close the distance, she didn’t take a step forward. “No, it can’t be…” she murmured dazedly. </p><p>Her reaction was completely right, of course. The whole idea was absurd. When the attack happened, I had no intention of actually leaving my seat, but they had managed to catch me in complete surprise, overwhelming my defenses at a speed I didn’t expect them to be able. If they wanted to kill me, they could have, but luckily, they were after the artifact I had treated as fancy garbage. </p><p>I had no intention of admitting that at this point, of course. Reputation was always useful when dealing with unreliable allies, and Sapphire, despite all the progress we made in our unique method of cooperation, was still an unreliable ally at best. Ironically, my own reputation as an unusual dark lord was helping me immensely, making even the most absurd possible conclusions plausible. </p><p>“Really, and why do you think so?” I chuckled in amusement as I raised my hand, slowly reaching to her cheek, only for my smirk to widen when I touched her skin. Rather than trying to pull back, she had actually leaned to my touch. </p><p>Apparently, our repeated encounters left an impression my true identity couldn’t erase. </p><p>“You’re the dark lord,” she started, her voice still shocked, but she stopped after noticing my amused expression. She took a deep breath, which made her bosom rise beautifully even with the boring dress she was currently wearing, and continued in a calmer tone. “Why would you leave your post in the first place.” </p><p>“You know, the usual stuff,” I answered. “The politics, intensive workload, the mysterious enemies poking their nose where they don’t belong…” </p><p>“That can’t be, you have just noticed them here,” she said, her gaze accusatory. “Or was that a lie as well?”</p><p>“I wish that was a lie,” I said, my sigh completely honest this time. “Unfortunately, it’s not. There’s a completely unrelated party from the first group that’s operating in the dark lands, intervening with politics in a way that was very unhealthy for any ruling dark lord. I thought to come here to avoid it, only to find myself facing another mysterious group.” </p><p>“Do you have any evidence?” she said, her tone turning rebellious, though she didn’t pull away from my touch still. “Your word is not worth a copper piece.” </p><p>That earned another chuckle, even as I let my fingers drag down, and clasp around her throat. I didn’t squeeze, just kept it there. “Oh, honey? Do you think there’s anything else other than a grave danger that would keep me here, hiding like a rat as I run around, trying to discover who this second party is, rather than staying in my castle and having as much fun as I can manage?” </p><p>“Maybe,” she answered, her only reaction to my fingers was her quickening breath. A few days ago, I might have assumed that it was a controlled fear reaction, but I had enough experience with her beautiful body to recognize the signs of arousal.</p><p>Our dear Queen was reacting to her state of helplessness much better than I expected.  </p><p>“I’m wounded,” I said, not bothering to hide my smirk even as I leaned forward, like I was about to kiss her, When our lips were just an inch away, her lips parted open, her hot breath caressing my lips like tongues of flame. Yet, when she leaned forward, I pulled back. Not much, just enough to maintain the distance. </p><p>Her growl of frustration was heavenly. </p><p>“Is something wrong?” I whispered even as I tightened my grip around her throat just a bit, watching as her arousal climbed even higher. She growled. “Oh, you’re scaring me, Your Majesty,” I said, the tone of mocking even more intense. </p><p>Interestingly, the more I highlighted her helplessness, and the more she was getting used to the idea of my true identity, and the fact that I had managed to defeat her thoroughly, the more aroused she got.  </p><p>How ironic, I thought, barely able to keep my smirk widening even more. The most powerful woman in the Empire, and she had a power fetish to accompany her other inconvenient fetishes. Almost impossible to fulfill. </p><p>She was really lucky that I was willing to sacrifice some time from my gloriously busy schedule to help her specialized needs. </p><p>“Nothing is wrong,” she said, somehow managing to maintain her calm tone despite her desperate breathing. </p><p>“Really, your breathing seems to get harder, maybe it’s the dress,” I said as I reached toward the several very complicated knots that were keeping her top together. They were a mess, requiring several minutes to unravel. </p><p>Luckily, they were weak enough to be dealt with one aggressive pull, creating an amazing cleavage in an instant as her breasts rebelled against their prison successfully after receiving outside assistance. “Isn’t this better?” </p><p>“Thank you, you’re a true knight,” she said, not bothering to hide her sarcasm. But considering not only she made no attempt to fix it, but also subtly pushed her chest forward to enhance the cleavage even further, I was willing to write her reaction off as a bonus. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit more. “Such a radical aggression,” I said as I made a show looking around in my cell. “I don’t feel safe, being locked in with the same Queen who is responsible for my repeated tortures,” I said, not bothering to hide my smirk as I did so, and put my free hand between her breasts. </p><p>She managed to suppress her moan after a fraction of a second, though that didn’t prevent her blush from radiating as I pushed her toward the wall. When her back pressed against the wall, her breathing was already out of control, showing just how much she was longing for my touch, my true identity making it even sexier in her opinion. </p><p>Though, that didn’t prevent her shocked gasp when I triggered the chains on the wall, and they locked against her wrists. I had already managed to crack their protections, limiting their usefulness, but that trick wasn’t a simple one. It required careful analysis of the structure for several hours to discover. </p><p>And Sapphire, just locked in the chains that stripped off her magical power, had neither the time nor the attention required to complete that analysis. Yet, as the chains clasped around her arms, she neither panicked nor got angry. </p><p>Instead, her breathing just got faster, enhancing her already enhanced cleavage even more. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After Olivia’s cousin entered the room, the festive atmosphere changed irrevocably. Even the show I was putting, one against eight while handicapped by the magical chains didn’t help to distract the noble guests as Olivia and her cousin tried to mingle. </p><p>Despite their obvious discomfort, none of them left the party, and if I was reading their gazes accurately, it wasn’t because they were afraid of offending Olivia. </p><p>No, their fear was clearly about Atia, who watched the situation impassively. They were not sure how to handle what they perceived as a sudden change of personality, afraid of triggering her anger. Of course, that was hardly accurate. So, while I tried to defend the coordinated assault of the soldier, Olivia’s cousin started talking with the rest of the guests. </p><p>Curious, I expanded my senses magically to eavesdrop on them. </p><p>“T-Tiberius,” one of the nobles stammered, which hardly helped to hide his shock. Pity I was busy dodging another attack, so I wasn’t able to examine his expression, as it would have been enjoyable. “I didn’t know you have returned. I thought you were still in Africa.” </p><p>“No, there had been a slight change of plans, so I returned early. Luckily, just in time to put my name for the election,” Tiberius answered, his voice harder than I expected considering his weak stature, yet strangely melodic.</p><p>“E-elections,” the noble answered, not bothering to hide his flinch. Clearly, there was a story behind it. “W-will we have the honor of seeing you as a Consul, Tiberius,” he said.  </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,”  Tiberius answered. “Such an honor is not something I can handle. I’ll be declaring my candidacy as a Praetor.” </p><p>The Roman Republic had a complicated structure, but it wasn’t inaccurate to say that two Consuls were the most important people for the year they were selected, responsible for leading the Senate — and in cases of emergency, responsible for defending the Republic, sometimes through extreme measures. In comparison, eight Praetors were selected each year, and their sphere of influence mostly covered legal affairs. </p><p>However, not being as important as Consuls hardly meant that they were unimportant. After all, each Praetor was one of the ten most important active politicians for the year, each with a huge width of power, each decision coming with countless implications. </p><p>Yet, when the noble answered, his tone was visibly relaxed. “That would be the honor of the Republic to have such a capable Praetor,” he said as he leaned forward. </p><p>And he wasn’t the only one whose attitude transformed. </p><p>Their reactions made it clear that Tiberius was a controversial figure in Rome despite his social position, but not enough to make him a total Pariah, as evidenced by the attitude change when he declared he would be running for a ‘lowly’ Praetor position rather than trying to be a Consul. </p><p>An interesting development, I thought even as I observed Tiberius mixed with other nobles, chatting calmly, though several subtle perks were exchanged, along with some weak promises for future financial support. </p><p>The promise of financial support was especially important, as it was hardly a secret that Roman elections were aggressively reliant on bribery. No one could be elected without spending a ridiculous amount of money. However, whatever that made those nobles worry during the initial entrance hadn’t been resolved during the discussion, at least not entirely, as the promises of help were very vogue, avoiding any concrete numbers and hard commitment.</p><p>And I noticed the anger flashing in Tiberius’ eyes occasionally before he managed to hide it.  </p><p>Of course, that left a question in my mind. Why Tiberius, a member of a Patrician house, needed the financial support of the lesser nobles to actually run for Senate. Yes, bribes were necessary, but I doubted the amount that was needed to run for Praetor was enough to turn a Patrician house destitute. </p><p>Clearly, there was something I didn’t know. </p><p>Still, even as I continued to fight, creating a luxurious background to the discussion, the nobles took their seat back on their reclined chairs, the aura of decadence recovering as the earlier fear and shock slowly disappeared. Of course, the fight only continued because it was just a show, as the attacking soldiers pulled back whenever their formation got too strong around me, and never attacked together. And with the magical chains around my wrist, I was hardly in a position to retaliate and get a quick win. </p><p>However, as the discussion continued, I noticed Tiberius’ gaze on me more than once. He wasn’t the only one that was watching me, of course, but unlike others, his gaze wasn’t tainted by anger or amusement. Instead, it was a cold, calculating gaze. </p><p>The kind of gaze a merchant would have before buying a particularly expensive horse, and trying to make sure the horse was worthy of the investment. </p><p>His motives were not that hard to decipher. Even the lowest senators usually had guards with them to protect them from immediate danger, as no matter how strong a mage was, a successful stab to the heart was enough to kill them. Of course, an attack on the senators was not exactly common, nor intense enough to justify the large groups of bodyguards to follow them. </p><p>Of course, with the bodyguards’ constant presence, along with the relative uselessness, in a sense, it turned into a fashion ornament, the kind that highlighted the relative importance of the senator in question. A part of it was the number of bodyguards, of course, with the important ones like consuls and ex-consults sometimes having more than twenty guards. </p><p>Another part of it was was the individual reputation of the bodyguards rather than the capabilities. So, the richer senators loved to buy gladiators to act as their bodyguards, especially from the four great gladiatorial schools. The more famous the gladiator, the more valuable the branding value it brought along. </p><p>It was a cushy job for the gladiators as well, a great salary and eventual freedom without the risk of being eaten by a monster for the pleasure of the others. Even for me, it was a tempting role, as it would allow me to access the patrician estates much easier as my owner was entertained by the others. </p><p>Yet I had no intention of getting that position, as the constant observation it would bring on me was hardly worthwhile. </p><p>It was not a job interview. If Tiberius purchased me, I didn’t have the option of gently rejecting his employment offer. Luckily, it wasn’t the only way of actually doing it. </p><p>If there was one thing that was important for a bodyguard, it was a calm mind, and not all great warriors had it. “Come here, little boy,” I growled as I swung toward the nearest guard, forcing him to retreat. </p><p>From there on, I started acting more and more aggressively, shouting and growling, leaning even harder to the barbarian image, Most of the nobles cheered for it, welcoming the distraction. From their perspective, it was a better show. Even the interested gaze of the ladies intensified, as their attraction to me was about my wild reputation. For them, my growing anger meant that their eventual ‘barbarian’ experience would be even more amazing. </p><p>The only one that was disappointed by it was Tiberius, but the speed he had come to that decision surprised me. I was planning to do some more aggressive stuff to ultimately dissuade him. Him changing his decision just by the initial display of anger was surprising. </p><p>I started acting even more like a berserker for a while for good measure. And when Olivia finally called the show to end, I made a show of breathing hard and trembling, like I was having trouble stopping myself from going forward and killing the guards. </p><p>Just in case Tiberius changed his mind. </p><p>While the audience clapped, Olivia gestured me to take a seat — one that was sufficiently away from the nobles, naturally — while the rest of the nobles continued their entertainment, enjoying wine, fruit, and other delicacies as they discussed politics. </p><p>I continued to eavesdrop on their discussion, trying to get a better understanding of why Tiberius’ presence was such an alarming topic. Unfortunately, that didn’t work particularly well, as their discussion was focusing on very nuanced details of particular political entities, in a level of detail I lacked the context to understand even if they hadn’t been trying to keep things obscure, making it even more impenetrable. </p><p>I still managed to capture a few things, the most important being Tiberius’ political positioning. He was a Reformist, which was not a title that was well-liked in Rome, not when their existence had caused several civil wars. </p><p>Of course, that told very little about what exactly he stood for, as the discussions stayed quite a bit away from the content, but it was enough to clue for me to stay away from Tiberius. </p><p>I had enough problems before involving myself in Rome’s complicated political battles. </p><p>Luckily, as the people’s alcohol consumption heightened, some started to leave, and more than one collapsed, utterly drunk. After their overconsumption, the servants led them to guest rooms for them to rest.  Not every one that left the main area was drunk, of course. Tiberius, along with three that looked the most receptive to his discussion points left the party as well, no doubt to have a deeper conversation about their dangerous political position. </p><p>Their wives stayed behind, their smiles enthusiastically anticipatory. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I let the magical chains over her hands dissipate even as I took the last step toward her bed, laying her on the bed. My initial intention was to take the final step, teaching my mistress the true meaning of pleasure. </p><p>But, as she lay on the bed, her legs parted open readily despite her angry glare, showing that she was more than ready for the next step. Ironically, it made me change my intention even as I lay next to her. </p><p>“You deserve a massage after all the exhausting effort you have displayed,” I whispered to her as I flipped her, making her lay on her face, caressing her shoulders softly. </p><p>“That’s it,” she gasped, unable to keep her protest suppressed as not only a massage was not something that could answer to her burning need, but also I didn’t use any mana to coat my fingers this time, making her disappointed. </p><p>“I’m feeling tired after the great exertion. Can’t you just drain the mana the wards providing?” </p><p>That made her pause for a moment. “It’s not the same…” she murmured. </p><p>“Really?” I murmured, though it wasn’t hard to guess why she preferred my mana to the natural mana. The same skill that allowed me to achieve things that many assumed impossible.  </p><p>Tantric. </p><p>“Too bad I’m too exhausted,” I said. “Of course, I can push myself, but…” </p><p>“But—“ she started, only for a moan to interrupt her as I laced my fingers with some mana, teasing a sensitive spot on her lower back, one I had discovered earlier. </p><p>“I have a research project to finish. Of course, if you can help me answer my questions, I wouldn’t have to fear exhausting myself. Perfectly reasonable, right?” </p><p>At this point, she was not in a position to reject my perfectly reasonable offer. “What’s your research about?” she asked, showing that, despite her pleasure, she wasn’t fully gone. </p><p>For a moment, I was tempted to ask about the details of the deal between her and the headmistress, but I kept myself back, still afraid of revealing the lack of my knowledge at this stage. I needed her even more distracted before I touched that particular box.</p><p>“Nothing much, just a few questions on an area of magic I’m not very competent,” I said even as I thought about the best area to focus on. </p><p>Arcana was certainly out. Not because it would be useless, but I had already displayed a great competency in the area, making it hard to ask more direct questions. In a similar vein, most of the Elemental abilities were also not viable, as I had displayed a great competency in front of her. Earth to open tunnels, fire in combat, and air to travel. </p><p>“I need to increase my competency with water magic,” I said, deciding to focus on one area I was yet to display my competency in front of her, yet the magic was simple enough. Asking her help in more complicated areas, like healing, was also a possibility, but that would have too many variables for me to filter, trying to decide which part was about her personal knowledge, and what was about the underlying difference between the areas. </p><p>Water elemental offered a good balance between complexity and simplicity, all without making her suspicious. “It’s not a problem, right?” I asked, even as I improved my massage service. </p><p>[-295 Mana]</p><p>“Ooh,” she murmured even as my fingers danced along her spine, her moan more provocative than her nudity. And considering her beauty, it was an incredible achievement. “I can do that,” she managed to stammer. “I’m very competent using elemental spells.” </p><p>“I’m glad to hear it,” I answered. “Giving a massage to you is certainly a better alternative to spending my time in the library, wasting my time.” </p><p>Then, she froze for a moment. “Don’t you have skills to teach you stuff,” she asked, suspiciously.</p><p>It was a good question. Luckily,  it wasn’t hard to deflect. “We have, but I didn’t receive a skill for water magic.” </p><p>“Why don’t you just kill monsters until you get one?”  she countered, though it was more of a genuine question rather than a challenge, showing her understanding about the System was very limited. Certainly not deep enough to be aware of the trade-offs included. </p><p>At this point, I didn’t waste time talking about the details. “I have seen the spells you have used, and they are better than the ones the System provides,” I explained. It was not a fully accurate statement, but then, it wasn’t supposed to be. I wanted to coax her pride. </p><p>“Of course,” she murmured even as the pleasure continued to invade her whole being, showing that pride was a lever was as effective as the pleasure she was feeling. </p><p>How convenient. </p><p>“Why don’t you show me a few water spells, mistress?” I asked even as my fingers continued to caress her naked back, making her purr. </p><p>“You’re lucky that I’m magnanimous,” she murmured even as my hands slowly slid toward the side, to start teasing her beautiful curves. Her chest was pressing against the bed, but that was woefully inadequate to hide her beautiful assets. Even facing down, her breasts still managed to shout their presence from the side. </p><p>She didn’t change her pose much as she raised her finger, a small ball of rotating water appeared on the tip of her finger, and she started explaining the basics of elemental casting. “The first thing about casting water elemental spells is the concept of fluidity. There’s no explosiveness in water, but it doesn’t support rigidity either…” she started explaining.  </p><p>Interesting, I thought as I listened, even as I slid my hands toward her ass, enjoying their wide expanse smoothly. The main points of her explanations overlapped with my own knowledge, which was to be expected. After all, if the nature of the elements differed that much, she wouldn’t have been able to use magic here. </p><p>[-460 Mana]</p><p>However, while construction principles of her spells were the same, the actual design of them was significantly more elegant and efficient, through significant stability concerns were apparent even at a glance, once again confirming that the System significantly affected the environment. </p><p>Unfortunately, the excuse of teaching made sure that I couldn’t ask pointed questions about it, at least, not yet, so, even as I listened to her words, I focused on caressing her beautiful ass, the pleasure working excellently to distract her from the absurdity of our situation. </p><p>As she continued to explain, my fingers continued their naughty wandering, until they started caressing the edge of her wetness. Her explanation staggered as she felt her most treasured spot being teased again. “Is there something wrong?” I asked, faking exaggerated concern. “Maybe you want me to practice the spells,” I added as I pulled my hands away from her body. </p><p>“Not necessary!” she exclaimed as she half-turned, revealing her beautiful tits, her body still trembling in anticipation, her eyes glowing with concerns. Though, when she met with my mocking smirk, her panic turned into frustration, realizing how her enthusiasm looked. </p><p>And the fact that she still cared about the impression such a reaction created after our earlier play… </p><p>Marvelous. </p><p>“If you say so, you’re the teacher,” I said, not bothering to hide my mocking tone as she lay on her face once more. But, before she could settle, I put my hands on her hips, and flipped her, her tits jiggling beautifully. </p><p>“What?” she gasped, shocked at the sudden move. </p><p>“Let’s work on your other areas as well,” I explained as I put my hands on her stomach, slowly moving upward. “Unless you want to stop halfway, of course.” </p><p>“N-no, please continue,” she answered, her body shuddering beautifully. “It helps you to focus.” </p><p>I said nothing, not even smirking at her words. Her paper-thin excuse didn’t even need that, if her rapidly spreading blush was any indicator. Instead, I focused on her beautiful body as I caressed her stomach, slowly climbing up as she did her best to stay still and not moan — though, not always successful. </p><p>Soon, I arrived at the border of her breasts, but rather than moving forward to their glorious expanse, I stayed on the edges of it, pushing her more and more, her out-of-control breath making the journey even more spectacular, inviting me for a stay. The excessive amount of mana I was using didn’t make things any easier. </p><p>[-1100 Mana]</p><p>Yet, I bypassed them, focusing on her neck and collarbones instead, each pass making her moan louder and louder, mixed with frustration. I could see that she was getting close to another climax, only to be stopped by the slowness of my hands. </p><p>The biggest evidence was her legs, rubbing against each other. </p><p>“As a teacher, you should provide an example,” I whispered as I parted her legs and put my knee between them, preventing that shortcut. As a bonus, it allowed me to hover over her body, my shaft dangling in front of her, which didn’t help her composure any. </p><p>Yet, I continued to caress her stomach and her shoulders softly, teasing her just enough to keep her aroused, but not enough to allow her to reach climax, her expression tightening with each second. </p><p>At this point, I expected her to start begging, but she proved herself to be tougher, managing to keep her mouth shut. Clearly, despite everything, she had a limit, and that limit was actively begging for my cock. </p><p>It only made it more fun. I continued caressing her as she tried to explain water magic — ironically, helping me to understand more about the unique aspects more as she started to lose her concentration, and her lessons turned into spewing a lot of unrelated, random facts, giving me a better understanding on the differences the System created. </p><p>Yet, I found myself more enthusiastic about pushing her limits, curious when she would crack. My smile widened as she continued to moan in frustration, even her excuse of teaching forgotten as the pleasure and frustration danced. Then, her moans started to turn into growls, growls that reminded me that no matter how tiny and harmless she looked, she still had another form, ready to be unleashed. </p><p>Before I could consider whether I should stop, however, she exploded into action. She suddenly stood straight and grabbed my shoulder and threw me off her. I let her when I realized I would still end up on the bed, only for her to straddle my hips.</p><p>If this was her punishment, I was happy with my crime. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 4364 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I put my finger on one of the emerald horns that appeared on her head, enjoying their texture. “Hmm, they are surprisingly smooth,” I said, only for her to blush even more than I had been fingering her earlier, though it lacked the carnal aura her earlier blush carried. </p><p>I had a sudden inspiration. “How shameful, losing control of your transformation just because of a little massage,” I murmured. Her intensifying blush suggested that I hit the nail on the head. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I realized I had managed to identify the specific source of her shame due to the intensity of her blush. I was getting really, really good on the subject. </p><p>“Such a shame,” I murmured as I caressed her horns. “They are such beautiful accessories of you, why would you feel ashamed of them?” </p><p>“I’m not … ashamed of them,” she managed to murmur, her breathing still quick, showing that she was having trouble handling the invasion of pleasure. “It’s about maintaining my transformation. Partial transformation shows … weakness.” </p><p>I chuckled. “You don’t need to worry about showing weakness while you’re with me, mistress,” I said with a chuckle even as I grabbed both of them. “I’m just a lowly servant, after all. I can’t even imagine commenting on your power and performance.” Even in her state, still lying on top of the table, that earned an angry gaze, and she opened her mouth to answer. </p><p>Too bad that I had no intention of allowing her to succeed. </p><p>I pushed my hips forward, filling her mouth with my shaft even as I grabbed her horns. “And why would you hate them. Look just how convenient they are,” I said as I used them as leverage. And just in case she was dissatisfied, I used our carnal connection to deliver even more mana to her. </p><p>[-1290 Mana]</p><p>Facing a flood she hadn’t experienced, at least from me, the moan she let out was simply spectacular. Coupled with the pleasure she was feeling it immediately pushed her to the next stage, her angry gasps once again underlined with moans. </p><p>And as my shaft started to invade deeper into her throat, her gasps interrupted by her beautiful gagging, I couldn’t help but smirk. While her attempts to make me pay back had been amusing, it would be a lie to say they hadn’t been annoying at any point. Especially the last time, when she interrupted my fun just as the things with Oeyne were starting to warm up. </p><p>Luckily, she was nice enough to compensate for it, I thought even as I pushed my hips forward. </p><p>“Try to wrap your lips around it tighter,” I suggested, and much to my joy, as I continued to pump, her lips tightened around my girth, making it more entertaining as I continued to push forward. </p><p>Her blush started to get more and more intense, a testament to the impact of pleasure on her hedonistic nature. Amusingly, however, her shock also suggested it was an area of pleasure she seldom indulged — if any. Otherwise, she would have reacted to my advances more smoothly. </p><p>I pulled back after an extended merciless pumping, allowing her to catch her breath, but when I took a step to the side, she surprised me with a moan of disappointment. “It’s … finished?” she asked, ready to protest despite the roughness of the treatment she had been receiving, though it was followed by shock as she realized the nature of her own reaction.  </p><p>How very delicious. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said even as I put my hand on her shoulder. “Sweetie, you have a lot of work to do,” I said as I pulled her off the table, her short stature making it very easy to lift her. Although, with my strength, I could probably try to lift it. </p><p>A trial for a later time, I decided even as I grabbed her shoulder and forced her to her knees, not trying particularly hard to limit the impact. I trusted a dragon to handle her knees hitting the floor easily. </p><p>It turned out that I was wrong. “Ouch,” she exclaimed, her pain clear. “Be careful!” </p><p>“Sorry, your dragoness,” I said even as I grabbed her horns once more, the somewhat taboo nature of that act enough to silence her until I could invade her mouth once more. Though, her lack of resistance to pain was surprising. I had watched her fighting against several people without the slightest hint of discomfort even when she was on the edge of death. </p><p>Though, on second thought, maybe her forms differed not only in looks but also in terms of physical resistance. Such a detail certainly needed to be used more, I decided as I roused my mana once more, some of it for her to be delivered through my shaft, the rest of it creating a nice, magical chain to wrap around her arms, pinning them in place. </p><p>[-1645 Mana]</p><p>The moment the chains wrapped around her arms, her eyes widened in protest. Unfortunately, her mouth was adequately filled, preventing her from speaking about it. </p><p>Her magic stirred, trying to dispel her bindings, but our bodies were too close, and with my mana inside her, breaking her attempts was trivial. </p><p>Or, it was supposed to be trivial, I thought even as I realized I had been forced to use more mana than necessary to establish the task, essentially bullying her spell with my excessive mana. </p><p>I continued pumping into her beautiful mouth even as I let my mind wander about the reason for the impact difference. Luckily, she tried to flare her magic several more times until she was discouraged by the repeated failures, allowing me to get a better understanding of the nature of her spell. </p><p>It was the complexity of her mana patterns, I decided. Just like the dress she had conjured earlier, her spell had been based on a much more complicated structure. Even less stable considering it was supposed to be an instant spell. </p><p>But once again, it lacked the instinctual understanding I had been enjoying with any other spell, making it significantly harder to truly understand. I needed a comprehensive lesson from her. </p><p>Naturally, it was a task for a different time. </p><p>Instead, I suppressed her magic as I tightened my grip around her horns once more, pulling her forward harshly. Her beautiful tits pressed against my thighs as my shaft invaded her throat, her emerald hair dangling freely. </p><p>Her head bobbed beautifully under my rough treatment, her moans getting more and more intense even with the obstruction in her throat. Yet, she didn’t lose anything from her enthusiasm as she swallowed more of my shaft, even with her arms tied behind her back. </p><p>Pity, I thought. I liked when she was getting angrier, so I stopped grabbing one of her horns and slapped her breast, only to flare angrily. </p><p>“Hey,” she gasped when I pulled back. “What are you doing?” </p><p>“Sorry, mistress,” I said with a chuckle. “But they are too tempting. Maybe you should make them smaller.” </p><p>“I can’t,” she said in a matter-of-fact tone, confirming my guesses about whether her human form was fixed, or it was something she had created based on her mind. </p><p>“Then you’re going to suffer through it,” I said even as I slapped her breasts once more even as I filled her mouth once more. Then, I grabbed her tits, squeezing her nipple, which made her moans even more intense. </p><p>Another flood of mana was her reward. </p><p>[-480 Mana]</p><p>It proved to be a good decision, as the reward she received, along with the additional mana I used to wrap around my fingers, worked wonders to calm her down even with my disrespectful actions. </p><p>Though, as the treatment lengthened, she started tapping my head, asking for me to pull back. “You didn’t earn it yet,” I said to her as I quickened my assault, enjoying the tightness of her throat. “But don’t worry, you will soon,” I added. </p><p>A cute moan and an angry glare was my answer. </p><p>It was as good as a sign as any to ask me to move faster. I grabbed her beautiful horns, invading her throat, again and again, smirking in satisfaction at the effectiveness of my strategy while the pleasure slowly invaded her hedonistic being. </p><p>And when she started moving in response, pushing forward along with me to make my pushes even more impactful in her own volition. Even her hips started to shake reflexively,  tempting me to escalate my services to a point I hadn’t been planning to bring. Not this quickly, at least. </p><p>Her throat tightened around my shaft, making me focus on the present rather than trying to plan the next steps. Soon, the pleasure become unbearable, and I exploded into her throat, filling it with my seed. </p><p>And, since I was such a kind, helpful servant, my explosion was laced with a lot of mana. </p><p>[-1840 Mana]</p><p>Her moans as she tried to swallow every single bit of my seed, licking her lips to make sure nothing had gone to waste, was simply beautiful. “Such a hungry mistress,” I said with a chuckle as I lifted her in a bridal hold, walking toward the bed in the corner. </p><p>Yet, trembling with pleasure, the only thing she was able to do was to send an angry glare. </p><p>It was a good time to interrogate her. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 4820 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The dressing room wasn’t particularly small, but only in dressing room terms. It wasn’t big enough to comfortably fit two people let alone actually stretching, but considering the other party was a sexy yoga enthusiast with a body to die for, I was willing to suffer that particular challenge. </p><p>“So,” I said as I put one of my favorite charming smiles on my face as I looked at Naomi, whose expression danced between excitement and shock, clearly surprised by her friends’ act. Not too surprising considering they were used to a much more hesitant and shy Carrie…</p><p>And for her, locking her friend with a boy was not exactly in character. </p><p>“So,” she murmured, unable to meet my eyes. </p><p>“We need to test your stretching,” I said, not bothering the suggestive quirk of my lips even as I put my hands on her shoulders. </p><p>“I … You don’t have to bother,” she managed to let out, unable to hide the excitement in her tone. </p><p>“Nonsense, after your help earlier today, helping me to stretch for that long, I’m more than happy to help,” I said. There was no problem reminding her earlier, where she had been rocking on my lap with the excuse of helping me cool down. </p><p>“I guess,” she managed to murmur, shyness battling with excitement as I let my hands trail down the side of her body, contacting her naked skin for a moment before arriving at her tight ass, which I grabbed shamelessly. “Something simple,” I said even as I made her turn before pulling her toward me. “Try to touch your toes.” </p><p>She said nothing, though her blush showed her reaction much better than words could achieve. Even better, that blush didn’t prevent her from following my request.</p><p>She bent over, which, while wasn’t the best move in terms of utilizing her clothing from a functional perspective, worked wonders to create a beautiful view. Her stretchy shorts, already straining while she was just standing, tensed further. </p><p>They looked like they were painted on her. </p><p>And that was only the beginning. The angle also forced her top to stretch and shift, enhancing her cleavage significantly more, the sight enough to turn my erection into a full mast. </p><p>A fact that I had no trouble informing her as I leaned forward, pressing against her bounty. “Um, I think it fits well,” she managed to stammer, but made no move to actually change our position. </p><p>“It’s better safe than sorry,” I countered. “What if they rip after a few lunges and squats. It would be a shame.” </p><p>Even as I said that, I put my hand on the small of her back, keeping her down while caressing her naked skin. I kept her in that position for an extended while before finally allowing her to rise. When she stood straight once more, her skin was slightly darker, like she exerted herself on a long run, but she was too fit for that to actually be the case. </p><p>Interestingly, however, she managed to maintain eye contact despite our closeness, with a beautiful glint in her eyes. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said. “For a start, of course.” </p><p>Her answer was beautifully promising. “Obviously.” </p><p>“Let’s try something more complicated, then. Raise your leg to my shoulder.” </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t even blink as her leg rose, until her foot was next to my ear — though I lowered myself slightly to make it easier for her. “How about it,” she said smugly, the sense of achievement and thrill drowning her shame in quick order. </p><p>“Ten out of ten,” I said. </p><p>She pouted at my response. \"You can't start that high for a simple pose, you’ll have nowhere to go for more impressive poses.” </p><p>“I call it as I see it,” I said with a smirk. “And it seems that you’re missing the real benefits.” </p><p>“What?” she managed to ask reflexively before her mind could engage. </p><p>I pushed forward slightly, but in our position, it was enough for my erection to press against her wetness — a presence that was getting rapidly visible through the thin fabric. “This benefit,” I whispered suggestively as I lowered my head, my lips inches away from her. </p><p>The implications were enough to weaken her strong knees, forcing me to hold her waist to prevent her from injuring herself. Understandable, as despite our physical closeness, it was the first time one of us actually ignored the excuse of helping each other exercise. Not that it was a believable excuse at any point of our dance, but sometimes, just the existence of an excuse was enough to give comfort. </p><p>A comfort that I just destroyed, forcing her to look at the reality, that she was dry-rubbing to a guy while dressed like a fitness instructor in an erotic movie would — at least for the first five minutes of the movie. </p><p>It was the last exit for her to take, before things reached a point of no return. However, she said nothing as her gaze found mine once again. A beautiful way of saying yes. </p><p>An even better agreement came from her hips, starting to move slightly, rubbing against my erection, tempting me to just rip it and take her on the shopping floor. </p><p>Pity that it was far too much for the first time, even if her current outfit was an excellent invitation for it. Luckily, that didn’t mean we had actually stopped. I put my hands on her hips once more, enjoying the tightness of her ass while she quickened her rubbing. </p><p>“Just to make sure it works properly,” she said, deliberately leaving what she was referring to. </p><p>Meanwhile, as our bodies enjoyed each other’s presence, my gaze fell down, enjoying the amazing cleavage she possessed, the compromising angle pushing it even more. Then, my eyes run a marathon down her body, enjoying the smoothness of her exposed midriff, passing her sexy navel with great difficulty, until I reached the suggestive line where her shorts started, which was slightly moving lower under the pressure. </p><p>What an amazing sight. </p><p>“Let’s test the elasticity of the top,” I suddenly said as one of my hands moved up, gently holding her top. I waited for a second, giving her enough time to pull back if she wished, before I started to pull her top toward me, reducing its already compromised capacity of keeping her breasts hidden even further, revealing more of her beautiful skin. </p><p>“Yes, let’s test it,” she murmured, then surprised me by raising her head a bit, just enough to close the distance between our lips. </p><p>I was tempted to keep the kiss gentle and soft at first, but when she didn’t waste even a second before jamming her tongue through my lips, I was quick to change my strategy, meeting with her tongue midway before launching a merciless battle. </p><p>It was a beautiful, heated kiss, more of a fight rather than an embrace as she slowly slipped back to her exercise personality. </p><p>However, the intensity of the kiss didn’t mean that my fingers forgot their tasks, pulling her top more and more, leaving her skin free to my touch, almost her entire breasts on display. Only her nipples were not revealed, though with their current state, pushing against the fabric, hidden wasn’t exactly the right word to use as well. </p><p>It was getting harder and harder to ignore the temptation to push forward, forcing me to consider the merits of pushing forward. Luckily — or unluckily, depending on the perspective — the door of the dressing room clicked suddenly.</p><p>Despite the click, however, it took a couple of seconds to actually open, giving us the time to react, either to fix our pose, or to prevent the door from opening.   </p><p>I barely managed to pull back from the kiss, to give Naomi a hint of plausible deniability about the situation as the door opened, her shocked gaze met with Carrie’s eyes. It was hard to say that her smirk was undeserved. </p><p>Especially since her leg was still on my shoulder, our pose was excessively suggestive. </p><p>“So, you guys finally came to a decision? You seem to have stretched her … clothes well enough,” Carrie said, her smirk wide, not even bothering to hide her suggestive pause. </p><p>Interestingly, Carrie wasn’t idle herself. She had changed into a tight top of her own. With her amazing bosom, it looked simply spectacular — enough to hypnotize me if I hadn’t been excessively exposed to their beauty for the last week. </p><p>Even with that, it had been challenging, especially as Carrie leaned forward a bit as she grabbed Naomi’s hand. “Let me help you,” she said. </p><p>“Help me with what?” Naomi managed to stammer, still shocked about our position. </p><p>“Your leg, of course,” Carrie said mockingly, deliberately leaning forward as her top drooped until I could see a very generous glimpse of her breasts. “Or is there another reason you’re keeping it up?” </p><p>“N-no,” Naomi stammered even as she realized she was still maintaining her compromising position, minus the kiss. As she removed it, however, she glared at Carrie confusedly, like she wasn’t sure whether to thank her or get angry at her for interrupting. </p><p>“So, you’re buying?” Carrie said even as she pushed me out of the dressing cabin, a smirk on her face. </p><p>The door slammed close, leaving me out, I had a matching smile on mine as well. </p><p>As far as shopping trips went, it was one of the better ones!</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, that was an interesting day,” I murmured even as I walked in the crisp cold of the winter night, leaving the convention center behind, walking alone if one discounted the angel that was invisible to anyone else. </p><p>I didn’t feel much joy, not because the runner-up in a chess tournament, even a small one like that wasn’t an achievement to be happy about, but a ceremony stretching for hours worked wonders to sap any joy I felt, only to bury in a sea of boredom. </p><p>Though, I could hardly complain, as their incessant desire to brag was the only reason I actually had a scholarship in the first place. </p><p>Luckily, I was excused from today’s football training. With the sudden extension of my tournament run, and the grueling practice — and even more grueling party — would have stolen a lot of time dedicated to my homework. </p><p>After all, I was still a student, and engineering was a grueling major to go through. I planned to go directly to my room, and study, no matter how tempting the idea of a party was.  </p><p>However, when I noticed my guide came to a sudden stop, her wings and her eyes glowing in with a soft blue light. It was an impressive sight. I imagined that if she had been wearing something more appropriate, a golden armor or an elegant robe, it might have even looked like a holy painting. </p><p>Dressed in sexy leather, it looked like a very successful stripper, wearing a costume with excellent props, about to start her show. </p><p>  A voice on the back of my head told me that going back to my room was not going to be an option. </p><p>“We need to move,” she exclaimed in excitement the moment she opened her eyes. </p><p>“What’s going on?” I asked, trying to stay calm, but her enthusiasm was clearly not good news. </p><p>“I can sense another Divine System activating nearby. We need to meet them!” </p><p>“How near?” I asked, even though a chill hit me, one that had little do with the cold wind. </p><p>“Not too far. Barely an hour with those carriages,” she said. </p><p>Something between fifty and a hundred miles, I corrected in my mind, assuming she was able to measure the distance correctly — which wasn’t a certainty considering she didn’t even remember her name. </p><p>“Are you sure that’s what you’re feeling?” I asked. Enthusiastic was hardly the word I would use to define my mood. </p><p>“Of course I’m sure, I can feel the stirrings of a proper Ritual. Someone is conducting a sacrificial ceremony, trying to empower a Divine System holder. We need to go there.” </p><p>Her selection of words hardly helped me to gain the enthusiasm I was lacking. Sacrifice was hardly the most positive word one could imagine. “Are you sure?” I said, even as I tried to hide my attitude. </p><p>Luckily, she wasn’t particularly perceptive of my mood. </p><p>“Of course, any System holder is an ally against the endless battle against Darkness,” she said with a matter-of-fact tone, but it was the rare hint of sharpness in her tone that prevented me from complaining. </p><p>I wasn’t feeling comfortable enough to push her, not when every second I delayed, the pressure she was radiating increased. </p><p>With that attitude on the surface, even with her erotic leather outfit, she was one scary lady. </p><p>It wasn’t that I didn’t want to explore the mystery of her presence. However, every single reference she had made was not only historical, but also magical. And whatever mystery was behind the existence — and the eventual disappearance — of the mythological gods was not something I could deal with directly. </p><p>I wanted to research it at my own pace, away from any risk, but from her attitude, it was clear that it was not an option. </p><p>“My car is not working. Let me check with a friend to borrow a car,” I said. “We can’t just walk there.”  </p><p>“Okay, but hurry up,” she said, excitedly floating around. </p><p>With that, I raised my phone, but I didn’t know who to call. With my complicated schedule, I didn’t have many friends, at least not the kind I could casually ask to borrow their cars. And my poor car — already on its way to a crusher — didn’t have insurance that would give me a replacement. </p><p>Which meant I had to take the bus to leave the campus before I could rent a car, before she actually forced me to walk. Of course, taking the bus was not an option, because, firstly, I had no idea whether there was a bus route to the destination. </p><p>Second, even if it did, I would prefer to have wheels under me, just in case I needed to escape. </p><p>With that in mind, I walked to the bus stop, waiting for a shuttle so that I could rent a car. As I waited, I tried to think of a way to trick her, but looking at her enthusiastic face, I wasn’t very hopeful. I had a feeling that, if I couldn’t procure a vehicle, she might force me to walk. </p><p>And walking a hundred miles was not on my Sunday night to-do list. </p><p>However, before I could make a decision, I was distracted by the sharp cry of a sudden brake. </p><p>Perfect, I thought darkly even as I raised my head, ready to deal with either Kevin or one of his annoying friends, when I met a smiling face of a blond giant instead. “Teddy,” he exclaimed happily. </p><p>“Hey, Thad,” I said, pushing a perfunctory smile on my face. “What’s up?”</p><p>“The training is just finished, and I wanted to stop by my place before going to the Den,” he said. “What are you doing at a bus stop? Weren’t you supposed to be playing with your dolls?” </p><p>I smiled. Despite the insulting nature of the words, Thad managed to deliver it with an undertone of humor that somehow maintained their good nature. I couldn’t help but smirk “No, that just finished playing with my little wooden soldiers until I got knocked onto my ass by another nerd.” </p><p>“Damn, you lost.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Hey, at least I was able to win a few games at first. It’s certainly better than what we can do in the field with whatever our pathetic offense would give us for the game next Sunday.” </p><p>“Touche,” he said with a chuckle. “You’re lucky that you’re still a backup, and won’t be forced to field early after another stupid interception.” Then, he gazed at the bus stop behind me with slight confusion. “I thought you have a car. What are you doing here?” </p><p>“I had a little accident,” I said with a shrug, not really wanting to discuss it. </p><p>“Kevin,” Thad growled suddenly, surprising me with his perceptiveness once more. His amused tone disappeared, replaced with something darker. “Maybe I should have a talk with him.” </p><p>“I appreciate the sentiment,” I said, and much to my surprise, I was actually sincere. “But leave him alone, I like to handle things in my own way.” </p><p>“Damn boy, that’s a scary expression,” Thad answered, staying silent for a moment. Then, he surprised me when stepped out of his car, and threw the keys to me. </p><p>“You’re lending your car to me,” I said, surprised. </p><p>“No,” he said, and I nodded. Just because I helped him with a bet didn’t mean he should give me a car. “I’m giving you the car.” </p><p>I stared at him in shock even as he walked toward me. “What are you talking about? This car should cost at least twenty thousand.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it’s nothing,” Thad answered. “You saved my precious classic, and a car I use for errands is nothing compared to that,” he said with a smirk. “Not to mention I’ll get another nice classical car thanks to you.”</p><p>“How?” I asked curiously. “I thought Kevin didn’t have a car.” </p><p>That earned an explosive laugh. “He didn’t, but not because he couldn’t afford it. His family is loaded.” Interesting, I thought. Kevin must be really rich if a guy who treated a car like a disposable item defined him as loaded. </p><p>“Then why was he freeloading to use his girlfriend’s car,” I said, before smiling widely. “Sorry, his ex-girlfriend.” </p><p>“Oh, believe me. It’s a detail hard to forget with all the gossip that’s going around on the campus. You three are the hottest topic,” he said as he exploded into another boisterous laughter. “Apparently, after a drunken accident, his mother decided to ground him and forbid him from driving for a few months.” </p><p>“How tragic,” I said. “So, does it mean you have to wait for months before you get your car?” </p><p>“Not necessarily. He will find a way to solve it unless he wants his reputation to go to gutters. My guess is that he’s going to go and have a talk with his sister.” </p><p>“His sister?” I asked, as it was never a bad idea to learn about the enemies one made on the way. </p><p>“I don’t know much, but apparently, she’s an executive or something in their family business,” Thad said with a shrug. “So, do you want to take your new car for a spin?” </p><p>I responded by throwing the keys back. “It’s a nice gesture, but I won’t accept such a big gift,” I said. As much as I appreciated the offer, if I was willing to owe people favors of that magnitude, I wouldn’t be struggling this badly. Thad looked at me seriously, like he was about to force me to accept. </p><p>That wouldn’t have worked, of course, but unknown to my giant friend, he wasn’t the only one looking at me seriously. My guide was looking at me seriously. “Excessive pride is a sin for a warrior. Accept it, we are in a hurry,” she said, her gaze serious once again. </p><p>I decided to relent. “But I wouldn’t say no borrow it for a few days. Until I can arrange an alternative.” </p><p>“As you wish,” Thad said as the keys flew on the air once more. savy enough to realize that I had no intention of compromising. Then, he smirked. “I seem to be having car trouble. Do you mind giving me a ride?” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Taking a nap while spooning my beautiful princess was a unique feeling, affection and arousal, wrapped in a sense of victory. </p><p>Pity that I didn’t have the luxury to laze around all day to enjoy her warmth. “We need to talk,” I murmured into her ear even as I tried to dispel the calm haze that enveloped both of us. Her soft murmur of dissent as she wanted to enjoy her nap more was simply beautiful. </p><p>I was tempted to accept. Too bad that we had very important stuff to deal with. </p><p>Of course, just because we had important things to talk about didn’t mean that I had to be boring about it. My whole life was filled with important, dangerous events, each enough to fill others with worry. If I acted in a boring, serious manner every single of them, ignoring the fun potential, I wouldn’t have a very fun life. </p><p>Maybe it was the reason my predecessor had a reputation for pointless violence and poor decision-making. Anyone would have a poor mood after dealing with such stressful affairs without a mental release. </p><p>“Unfortunately, princess, you need to wake up,” I murmured as I caressed her cheek, only to disguise the movement of my other hand, sneaking toward an area that was much more impactful. </p><p>“Can’t we nap for just ten minutes more,” she murmured back. </p><p>“No, we can’t,” I answered. </p><p>She opened her beautiful mouth, ready to respond, but before she could do so, my sneaky hand reached its destination without alerting her. Her beautiful bosom. I twisted her nipple, earning a beautiful moan instead of her complaint.</p><p>Shocked by the sudden escalation, she started wiggling in place, which resulted in a predictable considering we were still spooning naked. Feeling the sudden hardening against her plump ass, she stopped wiggling. </p><p>She didn’t stop moving, however, replacing her earlier wiggling with a rhythmic movement against my shaft. “Can’t we delay this important discussion a few more minutes,” she asked, but this time, her voice wasn’t colored by a desire to extend her nap. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I murmured, which earned a disappointing gasp from her as I pulled back. I chuckled even as I pushed her down, locking her under my weight. “Of course, that doesn’t mean that we can’t multitask,” I added, which was enough to replace her disappointed gasp with a playful giggle that still somehow managed to sound shy after everything we have done together. </p><p>“M-much better,” she managed to stammer beautifully even as I rubbed my shaft against her entrance, earning a delicious response in the process. </p><p>“But try to pay attention, beautiful,” I said to her even as I rubbed my shaft against her entrance, each rub earning soft yet beautiful moans. </p><p>But when she looked up with her beautiful blue eyes, I wasn’t able to resist capturing her lips in a soft, lingering kiss that made her moan helplessly, assisted by the movement of my hips. When I pulled back, her expression was flickering between amusement and desire. “I thought you were going to explain something?” she asked, which was a rather impressive example of sass coming from her. </p><p>“Cheeky,” I said even as I slapped her tit, making her moan. Then, even as I continued to rub against her entrance, I put a serious expression on my face. “I need you to stay in your room as much as possible for the next few days,” I said. “Things are very dangerous.” </p><p>That had been enough to make her eyes widen in shock, but she didn’t bother pushing me away, even when I leaned for another kiss to disperse her shock. “What’s happening?” she asked in shock, not even questioning the truth of my words. </p><p>Her trust was so beautiful, enough to make me glad I was actually telling the truth and not trying to manipulate her for some nefarious aim. </p><p>Admittedly, I could have done without two mysterious entities threatening everything. I pushed forward, the crown of my shaft disappearing into her warmth, making her moan. Another dose of pleasure to blunt the immensity of my next words. </p><p> “There’s something dangerous going on,” I started explaining. “There’s evidence of infiltration. And they have already managed to make several people turn traitors. Even Lancelot is working for them.” </p><p>A few days ago, declaring that the hero of the Empire who was also her fiancee had betrayed them would have resulted from one of the two outcomes: disbelief, or a catatonic shock. </p><p>However, after everything that happened, her response was much more lackluster. “That bastard,” she growled angrily, but there was no sign of a personal disappointment in her tone. The way her legs wrapped around my waist, pulling me deeper smoothly just enhanced the problem. “Can’t you just … deal with him,” she murmured. </p><p>I chuckled at her request, which, despite her hesitant tone and poor word choice, was very decisive considering her personality. Her request was clear, she was just having trouble with word choice. </p><p>And admittedly, it wasn’t an absurd request despite his glorious reputation, as the only reason they had succeeded in capturing me in the first place was a combination of ambush, numerical advantage, and betrayal of dark families.  </p><p>Assassinating Lancelot wouldn’t be the hardest task I took. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I said even as I pushed deeper, making her tits jiggle beautifully. “Things are much more complicated. I have already found evidence of two different groups trying to interfere, and they are strong. Maybe even stronger than the Empire.” </p><p>“How can that be?” she gasped, this time her shock overwhelming. </p><p>Luckily, I had a very good way to prevent that information from getting too overwhelming. I leaned forward, and pressed my lips against the soft skin of her breasts, covering them with kisses even as my hips moved, replacing her shock with pleasure. </p><p>After the shock lessened, I had given her a high-level breakdown of the Elves and Phoenixes, but I kept her information limited. Not because I wanted to play a trick on her, but at this stage, it wasn’t helpful for her to know the full extent of my theories, especially considering how baseless most of them were. </p><p>“So, I can’t trust Emma as well,” Aria finally murmured after I had informed her about her frayed loyalties, but she wasn’t exactly shocked, as she had a good seat for her previous attempt of betrayal. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I said. “Still, her weakness makes her a good source of information, so it’s better than the alternative. At least, this way, we know we can’t trust her.” </p><p>She nodded, understanding my point easily. She may be trusting and naive, but ultimately, it was more about her personality rather than her lack of information. She had no problems understanding the benefits of a double-agent. </p><p>She just lacked the ability to handle it directly. </p><p>Then, I caught a hint of hesitation. “What about … the Queen,” she said, barely a whisper. </p><p>I kissed her. “Don’t worry, I’m going to do my best to save her,” I said, making her relax. “Still, they’ll definitely target her. You might need to take the throne while I arrange her to disappear, so I want you to be ready,” I said. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smile as she nodded gently, accepting even such a radical decision rather quickly. “Still, we need to make sure you’re defended. I’m going to set up a lot of additional wards after we finish this little discussion, and I want you to find an excuse to stay in your room. You can’t leave, or even allow maids to enter your room.” </p><p>It was not a good move, as such a radical move would definitely alert many parties that there was something extraordinary going on, making my job harder. However, it was a risk I was willing to take to ensure her safety. </p><p>Taking her down in an ambush was simply too easy, and I had no one I could actually trust to keep an eye on her. I wish my trusted lieutenants were imprisoned by the Empire as well rather than captured by the dark families, a location far too distant to actually go and save them, and well-defended enough to make a rescue attempt vain without some reinforcements. </p><p>“I can find a medical excuse,” she said. </p><p>“Good idea. Considering your identity as the best healer in the Empire, not like a lot of people can disagree with your argument,” I said, not bothering to ask the details. I trusted her expertise. </p><p>“What are we going to do?” she asked, unable to hide the tremble in her tone. </p><p>“I don’t know,” I said even as my hips quickened, along with her breath, the pleasure working wonders to dispel the fear she might have struggled under, pushing her closer to climax. “Sometimes, the best move is not doing anything. We’re going to make sure you’re well-protected while I go deeper into the mystery, and decide on our next actions based on that.” </p><p>“I understand,” she said. </p><p>I wasn’t able to say anything else, because she took the initiative to capture my lips in a searing kiss while her hips started moving even faster, doing her best to milk me. </p><p>And she was certainly good enough to achieve her aim once she decided to do her best, I thought in a sardonic amusement even as she pushed me toward the climax. Barely five minutes later, I was filling her insides. </p><p>“Don’t move, give me a pose while I reinforce the defenses of your room,” I said, pulling back after one last kiss, making her beautiful body tremble. </p><p>“As you wish,” she moaned as she sprawled on her bed obediently, turning into a beautiful decoration as I pulled the Tether and started working on the wards of her room. And despite the amazing sight of her naked body, even occasionally playing with her breasts to tempt me despite her lingering shyness, I stayed focused on my work, assuming that I could properly ‘punish’ her once I finished my work. </p><p>Pity that didn’t work, because as I was about to finish my work, I had received a couple of warnings from the wards I had established to the secret tunnel that was leading to my cell. </p><p>“You’re lucky there’s an emergency,” I murmured even as I finished setting up the wards. “I have an emergency to attend, but I’ll make you pay for that teasing.” </p><p>Her beautiful smile was enough to tell me that she was equally enthusiastic about that eventual time. After one last kiss, I dashed away using the secret entrance, leaving my naked princess behind… </p><p>Only to find the Queen walking toward my cell with a determined expression on her face. </p><p>Clearly, I needed to make a decision. </p>",

    "content": "<p>With the exquisite show resulting from my entrance, the party’s atmosphere took a weird, heavy turn. More than two dozen of noble that consisted the audience found themselves unable to say anything, shocked by the decisiveness of Atia. </p><p>Their shock was understandable, as everything I had seen about Atia suggested that she lacked the decisiveness to act such sharply. When she was with Olivia, she had such a low presence that I had been shocked to learn that she was from another Patrician house, let alone one of the strongest, if not the strongest house. </p><p>Yet, she had reacted decisively to kick Marcus out of her party after her friend Olivia finished fleecing him. </p><p>I received the angry gazes of the nobles that surrounded me, but they didn’t worry me for two reasons. First, Atia’s move had displayed that she would brook no attempt to punish me despite my station. </p><p>Second, and more importantly, no one actually blamed me for it. </p><p>They were looking at me angrily, but what could they do. Show their shock by glaring at Atia, who had enough power to ruin their lives if she wished. Combined with her sudden willingness to use that, they didn’t even dare to talk to her, afraid of triggering her before they could get a better understanding of her new temper. </p><p>I hadn’t known Atia for long, of course, but there was one great advantage in a night of unrestricted fun. I had seen a great number of expressions dancing on her beautiful face during the night we shared, allowing me to get a better sense of her emotions. And, despite the sternness on the surface, I could see panic growing in the depths of her heart, clawing to be free. </p><p>She was clearly overwhelmed by her own daring. </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t the only one that was able to notice the small details of her expression. Olivia also noticed it and took a step toward her. “Come on, Atia, suppress your anger, he’s already gone,” she whispered as she grabbed her arm. </p><p>Of course, her panicked whisper was ‘accidentally’ too loud, allowing it to be heard by some of the closer guests, while her touch made Atia turn away from the crowd, hiding her expression as she started to tremble. </p><p>Respect, I thought even as I watched her movements. Not only did Olivia realize that her friend was on the edge of a collapse, but just a couple of seconds she had managed to conceal her nervous breakdown as an overflow of anger. </p><p>I decided to help. While Olivia continued to whisper with a growing display of alarm to distract the guests, I took a step toward Cera, the lady that had gone through a lot of ‘trouble’ during our last party to provide entertainment — before the rest joined, of course — and without saying anything, took her wine goblet off her hand and drank it in one long gulp, letting some of it dribble down my chin. </p><p>Rude, daring, messy. In other words, the perfect way to pull the attention away from the two lovely ladies that had made my previous party such an enjoyable evening. </p><p>The gaze of the guests turned to me even as I threw the glass on a nearby table dismissively, shattering it. Daring, considering it probably cost more than a peasant family would make in a year. </p><p>The exalted party guests hardly appreciated it, of course, especially the male half, and their distaste was hardly about the expensiveness of the glass. More than one of them had been glaring at me angrily, their hands stiff like they want to take action to teach a slave how to behave in an illustrious party. </p><p>Too bad that after what happened to Marcus earlier, none of them felt brave enough to take action. </p><p>The female half of the party had mixed results. Some of them shared the gaze of dismissive outrage of their partners, of course, but there was more than one familiar face from the earlier party, their outrage only a fake layer to hide their anticipation and arousal. </p><p>What could I say, I delivered a memorable service. </p><p>However, interestingly, I could see an expression of anticipation on the face of some of them despite them being absent from the previous party, suggesting the ladies hadn’t been as tight-lipped as I had been expecting. </p><p>Before I could think about the implications of it, however, Olivia and Atia joined the main crowd. “Such a rebellious slave. You’re lucky that you have earned me a couple of coins to keep me in a good mood,” Olivia said, however, the teasing tone she had used was enough to quench the angry displays of the rest of the guests. With her treating it as a joke, no one other than Atia had any right — or power — to complain. </p><p>And since the cute blonde was keeping her mouth shut, there was nothing else to be said. </p><p>I didn’t bother hiding my smug grin as the men that surrounded me forced me to swallow their words. I couldn’t say hiding myself as a slave was the most comfortable fake identity, but it was hard to ignore the perks. Acting like an uncultured swine to annoy the Roman elite while acting unaware of the implications of my actions was certainly one of them, especially for a bastard like me who had grown suppressed and despised everyone other than my grandfather, whose attention could hardly be classified as a positive despite all the skills he had allowed me to develop during the torture sessions he had termed as training. </p><p>For a moment, no one said anything while I grinned at the male half of the party and leered at the female half, before Atia made a simple gesture. The music started again as the servants hidden in the corner started playing their instruments once again, and fun returned to the party.</p><p>Or what passed as fun at the initial stages of a stuffy noble party. </p><p>“It’s time for you to work for your food,” Olivia as she slapped on my shoulder, gesturing me at the center of the room, where I noticed a couple of restriction wards were already set up. Nothing serious, of course. A mediocre mage could easily shatter them, let alone a Sorcerer, so I walked there. </p><p>And acted surprised when two glowing chains appeared suddenly and wrapped around my legs. “What’s going on!” I growled in loud anger, giving the act of an angry barbarian perfectly even as I pulled my blunted sword. </p><p>Even that was enough to make everyone take a step back in fear, who clearly expected my reaction with their familiarity with me. It was amusing to think that just seconds ago, those men were trying to intimidate with their gazes. </p><p>Weaklings. </p><p>Of course, it would be more accurate to say everyone with the exception of Olivia and Atia took a step back, clearly prepared. Olivia looked satisfied, while Atia was already showing signs of arousal. Clearly, my previous ‘services’ left a very good impression. </p><p>“You’re going to give us a little show, of course,” Olivia said without skipping a beat. “My cousin is almost here, and he needs some entertainment.” </p><p>The reaction of the rest of the crowd at the mention of her cousin had been quite interesting. I would have expected a simple acknowledgment from the rest of the crowd, or maybe some pleasant anticipation if the said cousin was particularly famous or important, which was possible considering her position. </p><p>What I hadn’t expected was a thick mixture of fear and shock. How interesting, I thought even as I tensed, curious just what kind of figure that could earn such a response from a bunch of high-ranking yet sheltered nobles. </p><p>Pity I wasn’t able to think about that, because, with Olivia’s mention of entertainment, eight people walked in, holding a variety of weapons, from spears to nets. Luckily, they were not only blunted, but also I could sense a subtle enchantment wrapped around them to further reduce the damage, as even a blunt weapon could be really dangerous if used wrongly. </p><p>Olivia and Atia went through all the trouble to prevent an accident from happening. To me, at least, as interestingly, my own weapon lacked such protection. I wondered whether it was because they didn’t think I could pose a threat with all the handicaps forcing me, or they cared less about the safety of their own guards than my safety. </p><p>It was equally likely. </p><p>“Let’s see if great Peirous could resist such a difficult challenge,” Olivia said as eight guards attacked me simultaneously. </p><p>There was no chance I could actually resist them without resorting to magic, of course, not with one against eight while my mobility was limited with a magical chain that prevented me from moving more than two feet away from the center. </p><p>But the guards didn’t attack me as a group. One of them took the point, and attacked me with a cry, while two others used their spears to limit my already weak mobility further. </p><p>However, one of the spear attacks was mistimed, allowing me to step to the side and deflect it first before parrying the main attack, forcing the raging figure back. </p><p>Only for him to stumble several steps back, two more than my relatively gentle push required. The first could be dismissed as incompetence, but the second was clearly prepared. It was just an excuse for me to create a big show without any risk, even more fake than some of the choreographed gladiator battles. </p><p>Olivia was smart to arrange such simple yet effective entertainment. It was exaggerated, but still, it was a good way to make me show off, which would serve to make a good entrance to the said cousin. And if another noble had sprung that on me without a warning, I would have made them pay by ruining the show, but luckily, when the subject was Olivia, I had more interesting ways to make her pay later, in private. </p><p>So, I focused on providing a great show, displaying my exaggerated abilities as a famous gladiator to the limit, giving a show that would be exceptional even in Colosseum. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t prevent the crowd from looking panicked and nervous, and a couple of minutes later, I heard several soft gasps as they turned toward the entrance of the courtyard, losing all interest in the show. </p><p>I looked there, curious what I would find. A bloodthirsty general, maybe, the kind that wrote his name on the battlefield with blood. Or maybe another Sorcerer, power radiating off them in waves, threatening to drown everyone close. </p><p>So, it would be a lie to say when I wasn’t surprised when the anticipated guest arrived, only to reveal a frail-looking man in his forties stumbling forward, his gray hair underlining his lack of a physical ability even further. Even more interestingly, I couldn’t sense a drop of magic from him. And since there was no point in hiding his strength with the same tenacity as me, it wrote off being a dangerous mage as well. He even lacked the aware, cautious gaze of a military man, making it clear that he wasn’t involved in the military as well. </p><p>Yet, as he walked forward, the crowd slowly shuffled, like they feared to stand next to him. If it wasn’t for Olivia and Atia’s combined political weight, they might as well be running away. </p><p>I couldn’t help but watch him curiously. What could make him such a feared man? </p>",

    "content": "<p>“How interesting,” she murmured as she tried to process my revelation. “I didn’t expect that abominable thing to affect everything to such a degree.” </p><p>I appreciated her mutterings, because it gave me a chance to gather my thoughts, in particular the System’s constant mana devouring and its applications to creating Enchantments. Not permanently, of course, as I had no doubt those implications were not just limited to wards and items, nor it was something I could treat as a long-term, theoretical question thanks to the designs I had noticed in Oeyne’s rooms. </p><p>All I wanted was a few days where I could tease a sexy dragon and a repressed angel for fun. Was that so much to ask? </p><p>However, I managed to pull myself away from those more complicated questions as she took another bite of the food, losing herself in a literal magical culinary bliss, trembling beautifully, her hurry to finish it faster leaving her even more vulnerable against the invasion of pleasure. </p><p>And since I had gone all that effort to reconnect with her dress, a flare of my magic ensured that its destruction quickened even further, to a point that it reduced her dress to a beautiful two-piece. The middle portion was gone completely, leaving her stomach bare for my eventual touch. </p><p>The top remained complete — mostly, apart from some fraying around her cleavage — but the skirt had suffered badly, getting considerably shorter and thinner in the process, forcing her to cross her legs to protect her the most important bastion of her modesty. </p><p>And that was not a move without cost. Crossing her legs while her skirt got shorter and shorter revealed all of her legs, along with a generous glimpse into her plump ass. </p><p>Her conflicted gaze, dancing between her own dress and the food in front of her was simply too amusing, especially since she was doing her best not to look at me while she tried to decide between protecting the scraps of her modesty, and the pleasure offered by the food. </p><p>She was turning out to be even more hedonistic than I expected, which was a great feat considering her reaction to the massage back in the safe house, though it was not without an explanation. After all, the safe house had been a dangerous place, preventing her from enjoying my services properly. </p><p>Of course, the principle of research lay in repeated testing, I decided as I took a step toward her without a warning, using the full extent of my dexterity to keep my presence subtle as I did so, timing it perfectly with another large bite of her, which made her close her eyes. </p><p>Before she could open them, my hands were on her shoulders, my fingers already laced with mana. </p><p>[-317 Mana]</p><p>“What are you—“ she started, only to be interrupted by a delicious moan as my fingers started to dance on her shoulder, caressing her skin with the great skills I had developed as I let my mana inject into her body. </p><p>The resulting moan had been spectacular, even better than I expected, suggesting the combination of the food and the massage was strong enough to blank her mind momentarily. “I’m massaging you to make your dinner more comfortable, mistress,” I said mockingly. </p><p>“I don’t —“ she started, but when I used magic to float another bite of the delicious dinner I had prepared for her, her lips parted open readily, taking it in. Together with the flood of pleasure she was getting from the massage, she was barely able to swallow her food as she moaned. </p><p>She was really weak against pleasure. </p><p>I chuckled at her reaction even as I continued to caress her shoulders, even as my view got better with each passing second, revealing more of her body. “I can stop if you want,” I offered, but only when I was absolutely sure of her answer. </p><p>Or more accurately, the lack of a one. </p><p>She said nothing as I continued rubbing her shoulder, her dress continuing to disintegrate, confirming the stories about the hedonistic nature of the dragonkind. Then, her top got even smaller, giving a glimpse of her areolas, yet she made no attempt to make me stop, focused on her food. </p><p>It was more erotic than our previous adventure. At least, she had the bubbles to hide her beautiful body then. Now, she only had a scrap that mostly displayed her breasts. </p><p>Until I decided to push things and grabbed that part, and ripping it without a warning. </p><p>The sudden movement managed to achieve what the slow disintegration of her clothes failed to achieve. “Hey —“ she exclaimed in panic, only to  be interrupted by a moan when I pushed forward even more shamelessly and grabbed her breasts. </p><p>It wasn’t a soft, gentle touch, not even something that could be mistaken by a massage even under the most permissive definition of the word. I was just mauling her breasts mercilessly, enjoying the smoothness of her skin. Maybe it was the sudden intensity of the pleasure, or maybe my daring as I abandoned the role of a servant, but she said nothing, just stayed in her place, receiving the pleasure of my treatment. </p><p>Even the rest of her food stayed on her plate, untouched. </p><p>It took another aggressive move to make her speak. One of my hands stayed around her beautiful breasts — two glorious globes too big to fit on my hand — alternating between squeezing her flesh and twisting her nipples. Distracted by the treatments of my fingers, she had missed the significance of my other hand moving lower. </p><p>Until I ripped the remains of her skirt as well, leaving her beautiful body completely naked. </p><p>“That’s too much,” she gasped as she jumped to her feet, but before she could make a move, my hands were already on her shoulders. </p><p>I didn’t actually use the full extent of my strength, of course. All she needed to do was to push my hands away, and she could have escaped. </p><p>Yet, she stayed. </p><p>“No,” I said as I waved my hand, and every single dish on the table flew away, colliding against the wall. As their crashes filled the room with a unique symphony. </p><p>Before the pieces could even touch the floor, I touched her back, pushing her on the table. Once again, there was no brute strength behind my touch, but still mewling under the pleasure of my other hand, she just moaned as I pushed her down, her huge tits pressing against the crystal surface of the table. </p><p>For a moment, I did nothing, enjoying the sight of her plump ass, though it wasn’t as important as her slightly parted legs revealing her glistening core. Her body continued to blush as she found herself helpless against the pleasure. </p><p>I didn’t give her time to get her wits back as I pressed on her shoulders harder, stealing her breath in the process even with her tits acting as two beautiful cushions. Her gasp echoed in the room even as my fingers caressed her ass, reinforced with mana once more. </p><p>[-781 Mana]</p><p>“What are you doing,” she gasped, her voice a mixture of shock and arousal. </p><p>“I’m serving you, of course, mistress,” I said even as my fingers danced over her perfectly-toned ass, enjoying the sensation. “You clearly like a constant flow of mana, and I chose to deliver it the best way possible,” I added before a chuckle escaped my mouth. “Well, technically the third best, but there’s no need to spoil the fun by skipping  the sequence, is there?”</p><p>She didn’t answer, which wasn’t great harm, especially since her lips were busy moaning deliciously. It didn’t help the intensify of her voice when my fingers finally found her wetness, dancing around incessantly. </p><p>The gasp she let out was beautiful, almost as beautiful as the lack of protest as my fingers found her knob, teasing it aggressively. I could have taken it slowly, but the moans she was letting out were so urgent, so helpless that I didn’t dare to. </p><p>What if she collapsed halfway? That would be a great tragedy. </p><p> So, my fingers started to intrude around her entrance, enjoying the way she clamped around my fingers, her wetness only overshadowed by her tightness. “No,” she finally managed to gasp, but considering she was pushing her ass back, trying to take more of my fingers into her, it was hard to treat it seriously. </p><p>Her moans got more and more intense, inviting me inside her. And I doubted it was an exclusive invitation, just for my fingers. Letting out my shaft plunging inside her would have been easy and, without a doubt, rewarding, but I had a much more fun sequence planned. Why should I spoil the fun by hurrying up? </p><p>After all, where was the fun of vanquishing a dragon if the dragon didn’t beg for it again and again? </p><p>The dance of my fingers soon yielded the ultimate result, and she started clenching around them as her wetness flowed, her moans filling the room completely. </p><p>However, her climax wasn’t the only surprise. Two horns appeared on her head, not only adding another exotic layer to her already mystical beauty, but also giving me a very handy tool for the next step of the fun I had planned. </p><p>“How kind,” I murmured in amusement as she moaned. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 6491 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s see if the food tastes good enough to justify all the effort,” the dragon said as she turned, and walked toward the dinner table, not bothering to hide the seductive sway around her hips, creating a beautiful sight. </p><p>She certainly deserved some assistance, I decided even as I leveraged the stray piece of mana I had connected to her dress earlier, ready to unravel her magically conjured clothes. Of course, rather than destroying it immediately, I started examining it first. I needed to make it look like it was her mistake, and to do that, I needed to understand the nature of her magical craft. It was a simple affair… </p><p>Or at least, it was supposed to be, but the moment I focused on the details, I met with a completely unfamiliar magical structure. It was supposed to be a little fun prank, only to come to a hard stop as I took a deeper peek into the construction principles. It was a very complicated, elegant design, showing an interesting combination of crafting and mana manipulation, displaying an expertise that wasn’t often found in people who relied on the System. </p><p>However, the elegance wasn’t the source of my confusion. </p><p>No, it was the complete uselessness of it. The mana strings and wards that created the dress were impressively complicated, but there was a point in crafting or casting that such elegant detail stopped being helpful, and started being harmful instead, threatening the stability of the construct. </p><p>It was about the natural movement of mana. Similar to water, mana had a tendency to evaporate, and even tricks applied to the construction of the wards only slowed that down. Of course, it was not a challenge for wards, as their natural spending far surpassed the natural evaporation, but even with a source, going below a certain size was unsustainable. Yet, the mana strings of her dress were far below that practical limit. </p><p>Of course, it was just a dress with no magical benefits, no additional protection, or magical enchantment, creating such a complicated design wasn’t too magically intensive, and it could be refreshed easily. Not that it explained why she was deliberately using an inferior design. </p><p>I wanted to dismiss that track of thought, but it was making my brain itch, telling me that I was missing something obvious. It was a very unfamiliar sensation with my skills and stats. I was used to connecting discrete topics very easily. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t just maintain the connection with the little mana I had left attached to her dress for long without making her suspicious. And despite the elegance of its structure, finding a core node that would destabilize the whole dress hadn’t been too difficult. I destroyed it, and pulled my mana senses back. </p><p>The dress didn’t immediately disintegrate, of course, that wouldn’t be fun. However, I could see a few pieces of fabric losing substance around the skirt, getting slightly transparent. </p><p>Excellent, I thought even as I continued to follow her swaying hips, leaving the mysterious nature of the clothes to the side for the moment. Though, as her skirt got shorter, revealing more of her beautiful, if short, legs. When she arrived at the table, I was quick to pull her chair, which allowed me to get a glimpse of her beautiful cleavage. </p><p>Her back arched as she sat down, a movement that was too exaggerated to be accidental, enhancing her cleavage even more. “I hope you enjoy your dinner, mistress,” I said as I pulled to the side, once again using the same exaggerated tone servant tone, not letting her forget that I was only playing around. </p><p>I was expecting her to enjoy the food I had created. My crafting skills, combined with a very generous amount of mana to serve the special preferences of a dragon, were not something to be dismissed. </p><p>However, I certainly didn’t expect her eyes to close as a moan of pleasure, the kind that I was used to hearing in a different context, escaped her beautiful lips. She trembled erotically, which made her even more attractive, tempting me to abandon my role. </p><p>Her eyes jerked open soon after, showing that I wasn’t the only one that was surprised by her reaction. </p><p>I could have teased her about that, of course, but with her dress slowly unraveling, I had a better idea. “Good try teasing me,” I said, which was a touch excessive. </p><p>“Y-yeah,” she stammered, happy to take my excuse. “I was just teasing you.” </p><p>“I can tell with the way you’re playing with your dress,” I answered, pointing at the right side, where a piece had already gone. The way her eyes widened was beautiful. </p><p>“R-right!” she stammered even as her gaze turned down, noticing her dress was suffering smaller. </p><p>She raised her hand, but before she could cast a spell, I spoke once again. “Too bad you won’t be able to stay like that for too long. You’ll get scared and fix it back, making it pointless posturing.”  </p><p>“I never get scared,” she said as she slammed her hand to the table — which only survived thanks to the numerous enchantments weaved into its nature. Her vehemence at the mention of getting scared surprised me. Maybe I had managed to touch a soft spot. </p><p>“Oh, really. Then why don’t you show it by not casting a spell until you finished the great dinner I had prepared for you.” </p><p>“That’s nothing, of course, but why should I let you do it.” </p><p>I could have raised the favors she owed me, goaded her into a bet, or start flirting. I chose none of those options. “Hey, if you want to be a coward, go ahead and be one. You don’t need an excuse.” </p><p>Her response was to throw a knife, which I deflected using a magical shield. </p><p>[-483 Mana]</p><p>“Hey, be careful,” I said, panicked. Of course, it was also fake, and I used such a strong magical shielding because I wanted to refresh my connection to her dress, and not just to quicken the speed of her dress’ disintegration. </p><p>I also wanted to continue examining the spell structure of her dress, trying to understand why I was finding it familiar. </p><p>“Don’t call me that,” she said, her eyes glowing even brighter, its green taking a threatening sheen. </p><p>“Sheesh, overreaction much?” I asked, but didn’t push her any harder on that aspect. Her strength certainly was not a joke. </p><p>She said nothing else, just took another bite of the food. I noted that this time, it was much bigger. Combined with the speed of her chewing, I could see it was less about her fascination with the food, and more about wanting to finish it quicker, so that she could resolve the issue with her dress without eating her own words. Unfortunately for her, there was a big flaw in her choice. </p><p>The orgasmic joy of eating. </p><p>As she ate her food hurriedly, it impacted her even harder. To her credit, she managed to suppress her shivers, and most of her moans, the remaining subtle enough to be disguised as the reaction for good food. </p><p>Unfortunately, her body decided to disagree with her decision to keep things hidden. Her nipples started to get harder, pushing against the tight fabric of her dress — a view not helped by the slowly disintegrating fabric of her dress. </p><p>I managed to control the disintegration partially, directing the disintegration to safe spots, arms, shoulders, stomach, and the lower sections of her skirt. </p><p>I wasn’t onset by a sudden invasion of charitable feelings, certainly not against a beautiful natural disaster like her. But I could see that the safer spots were already pushing her limits, and I didn’t want her escaping from the table before she finished her food. </p><p>“Make sure to finish your food,” I reminded her. “Because the mana will evaporate in a few minutes?” </p><p>“Why?” she asked. </p><p>“What do you mean, why?” I asked, surprised by her question. </p><p>Her gaze was equally confused. “I mean why the mana would evaporate that quickly, of course,” she said. </p><p>Then, something clicked in my mind. The weirdly flimsy nature of her enchantments that could only last for a few hours, her shock at the possibility that the food would not be able to contain that much mana for long. Even the designs I had noticed on Oeyne’s room flashed in my view, more similar to her dress than anything outside. </p><p>“It’s because of the System, naturally,” I answered with a certain tone, even though it was more of a guess than certainty. My hands were bound by the fact that I couldn’t be honest about my lack of knowledge. </p><p>However, it wasn’t baseless under the assumption that the System wasn’t just connected to people, but also this section of the world in general, somehow affecting it. Together with the clear difference of free mana that was available that she had been complaining about, and the fact that a magical construct she had created habitually was too flimsy to survive under the mana evaporation — something I had written off as a natural phenomenon — I was pretty confident in my guest. </p><p>It certainly explained why the designs I found in Oeyne’s workshop had been so weird that I was willing to write them off as impossible to work. </p><p>There was one important question. Why did it take me that long to actually connect the dots? </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 7838 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>It took an hour for Carrie to reveal what she had in mind, but she did it cryptically once again, inviting me to a nearby mall. I had tried to ask what she had in mind, but she had just sent mysterious smile emojis in return. </p><p>Considering the benefits of my trust the night before — and in the morning — I was more than happy to extend it once again. </p><p>It was a weekend, and I had no reason to hide from the braying chaos of high school, so rather than bothering with the bus, I drove my bike. </p><p>‘I’m at the mall,’ I wrote to Carrie, after I called her, only for her not to answer. </p><p>‘Excellent, we’re at the store, come,’ she said. </p><p>‘Which one?’  asked. This time, she shared the picture of a store, one of those new fashion brands trying to sell the idea that they sold sports equipment, but selling useless stuff instead. Well, at least for the purposes of exercising. </p><p>Thin stretchy shorts and tiny sports bras worked wonders to provide a show. ‘Excellent, I’ll be there in five,’ I wrote even as I parked my bike and made sure the helmet was properly attached before climbing up the stairs rapidly. </p><p>I was tired after a day of exercise, but the idea of a beautiful girl waiting for me at the end of my journey was tempting. However, the moment I arrived at the shop, I realized that I had made a big mistake. There wasn’t a beautiful girl that was waiting for me. </p><p>There were two. </p><p>They were dressed much more understated, of course, sweatpants and loose t-shirts instead of the sexy stuff they wore when they visited me, not that it was a big issue. </p><p>“Hey, Naomi, Carrie,” I said as I waved, letting my smirk widen as I walked forward. Naomi gave me a shy smile and a wave, while Carrie’s smile was much more suggestive. Interestingly, Naomi looked surprised but not shocked by my presence, which implied that Carrie had already warned her, not giving her enough time to get used to the idea. </p><p>“Hi, Chad,” Carrie said before Naomi could speak. “Thanks for dropping by to help us. It’s lucky that you were at that mall as well. I hope we’re not keeping you from anything important.” </p><p>“Nope, I was just running a few errands,” I answered, amused by her words. She was turning out to be a true minx. “So, what exactly do you need my help for?”  I said. </p><p>“I’m thinking of starting to exercise, but I can’t trust the crazy girl here for correct suggestions. She always pushes too far.” </p><p>“Oh, believe me, I learned that today,” I said, chuckling in amusement even as Naomi blushed, which added a nice hue to her milky-chocolate skin. “She’s relentless.” </p><p>“Really,” Carrie said with enthusiasm, even as she poked her ribs suggestively. Clearly, unlike Sarah, she was approaching Naomi much more directly. </p><p>Admittedly, if Naomi’s expression was any indicator, it was working excellently. </p><p>“So, what exactly do you girls need my help?” I said. </p><p>“I need you to pick me a couple of weights and other basic exercise equipment,” Carrie murmured, before raising her hand as she had just remembered something. “And since you’re here, you can help Naomi pick up a few exercise clothing as well. She was talking about needing more.” </p><p>“Was I—“ Naomi started, only to fall silent under Carrie’s gaze. “I was,” she corrected herself. </p><p>“Excellent, maybe a couple of swimsuits even. Chad has an amazing pool, and I’m sure he wouldn’t mind us using it for occasional parties.” </p><p>“Oh, no, a few very sexy ladies, frolicking in my garden. What did I do to deserve such a terrible fate?” I said even as I raised my hand to my temple dramatically. Carrie chuckled while Naomi blushed even more. </p><p>Carrie proved she was prepared by pushing a bundle in Naomi’s hands, before whispering something in her ear, too soft for me to hear. “Why don’t you go and change, so we can get Chad’s opinion on them?” Carrie said. </p><p>Naomi seemed unsure, but she obeyed as Carrie pushed her. While not exercising, she was much more hesitant. </p><p>Before I could say anything, however, Carrie grabbed my hand and dragged me toward the corner, where the dressing rooms didn’t have visible entrances from outside. On the way, however, I grabbed an interesting-looking item. </p><p>Then, Carrie pulled me into a kiss, almost at the same moment she managed to close the dressing door, surprising me greatly with her passion. She was getting more and more daring as time progressed. </p><p>“So, what’s the idea,” I murmured as I pulled from the kiss, enjoying the way she pressed against my body. </p><p>“Well, Naomi was always looking for someone to accompany while she exercises, and I thought you might help her in that.” </p><p>“And she knows that it’s not some kind of the start of an exclusive dating scenario as well,” I asked, making sure. Sarah didn’t earn the same courtesy, but only because she had been willing to push forward even after she watched as I took Carrie on the couch, in all her naked glory. </p><p>“Of course she does, she’s my friend. I wouldn’t want to make her sad,” she said, looking offended, but her anger was easy to quench. Another raging kiss, and my hand dancing over her shirt was enough to turn her fury into flaming desire. </p><p>Extending the kiss was tempting, but we didn’t have a lot of time, not if we didn’t want Naomi wandering around trying to find us, ruining the whole point of the outing. </p><p>I walked to the changing room Naomi was using, waiting for her to leave, but Carrie arrived only after a slight delay, some new stuff in her hands. </p><p>Seeing the size and the thinness of the clothing she had picked, I couldn’t help but salivate at the prospect of seeing them on Naomi. Some of the pieces looked like they had less material than my shoelaces.</p><p>When the door finally swung open, revealing a blushing beauty, I couldn’t help but lose my words for a moment. She was wearing a sleek, forest green set that was, even more, tighter than the earlier clothing she had worn to my house. The tights she wore were long enough to cover her legs, but with their tightness, it hardly mattered. </p><p>Her top was even better. It ended half an inch below her tits, revealing most of her delicious chocolate-milk skin naked for my gaze — well, our gaze, I corrected as I felt Carrie shuffle in anticipation as well. Even better, it had just enough cleavage to make things fun without being too revealing. </p><p>“So, what do you think,” Naomi asked as she did a little twirl, trying to look confident, but her trembling voice was enough to convey her real feelings. </p><p>“You look good,” I said.</p><p>Before she could answer, Carrie interjected. “Nope, it lacks the wow factor,” she said as she took a step forward, dragging Naomi back to the dressing room despite her attempts to complain. I didn’t intervene. After her actions in the morning, she earned quite a bit of trust. </p><p>“I don’t-“ Naomi whispered, no doubt thinking I can’t hear them, only for Carrie to interrupt her. </p><p>“You need to be more forward if you want to impress him,” Carrie said to her. “Remove everything and change into the clothes I picked,” she ordered. </p><p>“Surely not-“ Naomi tried to counter, only to be interrupted again. </p><p>“Everything,” Carrie said. </p><p>Silence ruled the next minute, except the shuffling of the fabric. “I don’t know,” Naomi whispered. “Maybe it’s too much, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Don’t be silly, he will be really impressed.” </p><p>“That’s what I’m afraid of. Maybe we should-“ she whispered, only to be interrupted again. This time, however, rather than speaking over her, Carrie chose to push open the door, revealing the even more marvelous sight. </p><p>“So, what’s the wow factor on this one,” Carrie asked even as she pushed Naomi forward, who seemed a tad self-conscious. Understandable, as the set she was wearing was more or less covered the same area as a bikini. </p><p>A revealing one at that. </p><p>“Wow, just wow,” I said, which put a hesitant smile on Naomi’s face, though it couldn’t match Carrie’s, who was clearly getting a kick out of the little exhibitionist display she was forcing one of her best friends. </p><p>And what a display it was. The top she was wearing was likely designed as a sports bra, but not to actually be used while exercising, but just to look good in photos. There was no other explanation to the spectacular cleavage it revealed otherwise. Her stomach was once again naked, revealing her athletic belly. The bottom was even better, barely more than sexy panties, revealing her long, toned legs perfectly. “Why don’t you turn and give a full view, so he can comment more accurately,” Carrie said. </p><p>Naomi turned, showing off her delicious derrière, which did a very nice job filling out already-limited coverage of her bottoms, stretching it to the limit. I couldn't help but admire the sculpt of her athletic ass, large yet shapely at the same time. </p><p>“Delicious,” I said, which made Naomi blush even more. </p><p>“But she has a concern. She’s not sure whether they are stretchy enough to allow her exercise, why don’t you help her find out,” Carrie said even as she pushed me into the changing room before slamming the door behind us. </p><p>Leaving me alone with a barely dressed fit beauty, breathing hard in anticipation… </p>",

    "content": "<p>A sardonic smile was on my lips as I watched a crowd gather around her, celebrating her victory. A part of it was the natural attention the winner receives. However, most were about the distaste of the other players. </p><p>My sudden burst of ability, knocking out many favorites out earlier than predicted, was hardly appreciated. However, it wasn’t enough to earn all the dark gazes looking at me, happy with my loss. Normally, chess had a cozy, respectful community, and a dark horse victory would have been appreciated. </p><p>I was the exception. Whether my nickname, the assassin  — a well-earned one — or my recently revealed identity as a football player, I stuck out like a sore thumb, making my eventual loss something to celebrate.  </p><p>However, the sardonic nature of my smile was not about their angry gazes. No, it was about the loss I received. Or, more accurately, the failure of my Traits, preventing that loss. </p><p>If I ever needed a lesson that my Traits were not invincible, I had received it. </p><p>Still, even with the loss, it was not a bad day. Losing wasn’t fun, of course, but the second place wasn’t too bad, especially since top sixteen was my best result yet. </p><p>At least, my chess scholarship was safe. </p><p>So, I say on my seat, waiting for the reward ceremony, my surroundings noticeably empty. </p><p>Then, the boring part began. The reward ceremony started several long-winded speeches from the sports coordinator, the dean, and other officials, each boiling their self-importance as they mentioned their great help enabling this ‘historic’ event, before shifting to their other so-called achievements. None of them actually cared about the game, or the victory. They just wanted a platform with an intellectual reputation to sell their pointless victories. </p><p>We stayed in the background, scarcely more than decoration. </p><p>I would have loved to say that listeners were bored out of their minds, but there weren’t many listeners in the first place. Most of the visitors were already gone, leaving a small crowd. More than a few local reporters were there, recording the speeches despite their disinterest. </p><p>They were clearly there as a favor, to write a few pieces trying to sell the intellectual reputation of Sunset College. </p><p>I wouldn’t have been shocked if they were actually paid to be there, to write a fluff piece to celebrate the school.  </p><p>During the third long-winded speech, my victorious opponent, no less bored than me, finally leaned toward me, and whispered. </p><p>“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have played that hard,” she murmured. And the way her shoulders fell down told me that she wasn’t just saying that. She was genuinely felt bad about winning. </p><p>“What are you feeling sorry for,” I said, keeping my tone light. “That was an amazing game, and you did your best, but you were the better player. That simple.” </p><p>“Really?” she said, sounding surprised. “Most guys don’t like to lose to a girl, and with your…” she murmured, only to fade. </p><p>“With my reputation, you expected me to react badly, right?” </p><p>“Well,” she said, blushing. “You have a sketchy reputation…” </p><p>I hit her with another crooked smile, earning a blush. Seduction Trait was really useful. </p><p>“I’m a competitor, and I’m doing my best to win. If intimidating my opponent is going to help me to that, I’m not going to ignore it. That doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate the amazing show you have put in. I don’t always have the opportunity to play against grandmaster opponents.”</p><p>“I’m not grandmaster yet,” she murmured, though rather than the blush I was expecting, she looked sad, her gaze falling down, and she avoided talking to me. </p><p>Apparently, I had poked a wound. </p><p>“Why not?” I asked, curious. “You certainly have the ability to push for it.” </p><p>She stayed silent for a moment while the sports coordinator started buzzing in the background, before a sigh escaped her mouth. “I can’t,” she murmured. “I don’t have the luxury to play as much as I want.” </p><p>It was certainly an interesting statement, but not because of her skills. She certainly had the skills to be a grandmaster, but that didn’t necessarily make her playing full-time a good idea. Indeed, many grandmaster-level players chose to stop playing before they even reached their prime, for a very simple reason. </p><p>There was no money to be made in chess. Oh, top players made millions through tournament earnings and sponsorships, but that only applied a select bunch, maybe a few. Below them, maybe a couple of dozen players were able to make a meager living out of tournament winnings. </p><p>For other grandmasters, a couple of thousand dollars was the best they could make, forcing them to have full-time work, either tutoring other chess players, or other works. </p><p>Altogether, it was a terrible way of making a living, considering the amount of time, mental energy, and focus they had to waste. </p><p>I certainly wouldn’t have bothered with it if it wasn’t for the scholarship. </p><p>However, I doubted that it was the reason for my cute opponent, because, while her clothes were casual, making her look like she was just another student, I had managed to catch a glimpse into her bag while she was digging in for her phone, only to notice two things. </p><p>A platinum credit card that required a very hefty bank account to even qualify, and a room key from the most prestigious hotel of the city. </p><p>Together, it implied a certain amount of money, which made the income potential less of a deciding factor. </p><p>She clearly had a different reason. Normally, I would have respected her privacy, but, after the boring speeches, I wanted to distract myself. “Why?” I couldn’t help but ask. </p><p>“I can get a bit too competitive,” she admitted. “It’s not a good quality.” </p><p>“Says who,” I answered. If there was one thing I despised, it was passive people, not putting the effort to do their best, to extract themselves out of the situation. Growing up in the streets, I had seen too many people that accepted their position in life, afraid of acting even when they literally had nothing to lose. </p><p>Maybe it wasn’t completely fair. I had grown up in the streets, but I wasn’t closed-minded enough to realize that some people had worse than me, occasionally much worse. And constant misfortune had a way of sapping people out of their potential. </p><p>“Says my family,” she admitted. “They think it’s … unseemly.” </p><p>I shrugged, accepting her comment passively. I had no intention of intervening in her familial conflicts, especially since, clearly, said her family was rich. </p><p>Proper rich. </p><p>“Why don’t you play more seriously?” she followed up. “You clearly have the skills, but you lack the depth of knowledge. I wouldn’t be surprised if you can reach grandmaster level easily,” she suggested. “Why are you wasting your time with a barbaric sport instead.”  </p><p>“There’s no money to it,” I said with a shrug. “If I can join a team, even just the practice squad, I will earn more than a thousand dollars a year, easily, and much more if I can make into the roster.”  </p><p>Her expression turned stern at the moment. “Not everything is about money. Chess is a noble profession. I can’t believe you compare it with such a barbaric activity just because it pays more.” </p><p>I sighed, trying to bite my tongue to not to let her what I was actually thinking. “And then what?” I asked. “Dashing tournament to tournament, filling the rest of my time dealing with snot-nosed kids to earn a minimum wage?” </p><p>She said nothing, but her gaze told me that she was not convinced. Even more, I could see a dismissive shine behind them, like she was absolutely convinced of the superiority of her position, and everything I had told was garbage. </p><p>It was a gaze that managed to destroy all the goodwill she had managed to generate with her cuteness and attitude. I hated when people dismissed money when it was nothing, because the only people that could do it were the rich people, somehow believing that the thing that allowed them to do everything was nothing. </p><p>“Interesting, then why don’t you put your mouth where your money is?” I challenged her, unable to hold my tongue.  </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, shocked. </p><p>“Simple, you said that you’re not playing more because you were concerned with your family’s decisions. You’re an adult. Just say them that you don’t want to compromise your principles for money, find a part-time job to focus on your work, and focus on your chess career.” </p><p>The shock on her beautiful face was simply beautiful. She opened her mouth, but she made no sound, her words lost, as she had never even considered that as a possibility. There was no way she would actually do that, of course, but still, it was amusing. </p><p>“Not everything is about money. Chess is a noble profession,” I said, echoing her earlier words with a mocking tone. “I can’t believe you are considering not to follow it just because of a simple thing like your family wealth.” </p><p>“But…” she murmured, only for her words to fade. </p><p>Before I could dig deeper, the Dean invited the winner of the tournament for photos, ignoring me. Clearly, he decided that a beautiful girl was better for the pictures than a student of their own school, leaving me alone with my thoughts. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“As you wish, princess,” I whispered, deciding to follow her direction for once. It wasn’t my usual attitude, but if there was one girl that earned that treatment, without a doubt, it was Aria. </p><p>“Really?” she gasped, her attitude of authority shattering for a second as she was surprised by my words, her shocked glee making her even cuter. </p><p>“Of course, who am I to ignore a royal order,” I said as I slowly moved down, arriving at the level of her breasts. “I have to do my best to handle this glorious mission assigned by my great princess.” </p><p>Aria looked at me, her excitement mixed with the slightest trepidation as  I lowered my head down the glorious valley between her breasts, aggressively devouring the remaining chocolate from those snowy peaks, leaving them squeaky clean while Aria squeaked in pleasure. </p><p>“It’s not a bad start, is it, my princess,” I murmured as I raised my head, catching her beautiful blue eyes, peering deep into their beauty, while she trembled under my fingers, busy caressing her stomach. </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered. “It’s - NOT!” she said, though it turned into a beautiful cry as my fingers moved even lower, landing on her wetness. It was beautiful, tinged with overwhelming arousal as my fingers danced around her knob, bringing her pleasure to the surface. </p><p>Her blush thickened further as her excitement reached a new level. “You can order me to stop whenever you feel I’m pushing my patriotic limits too much, princess,” I offered even as my fingers quickened. </p><p>Her shiver was enough proof that such an order was simply not possible. </p><p>I continued to move, leaving a trail of kisses over her beautiful stomach, each kiss making her moan even louder in anticipation until my head disappeared between her legs, her wet lips just an inch away from my tongue, her delicious aroma begging me to taste her.  </p><p>A shocked gasp escaped her mouth as my tongue brushed against her entrance, her body rising reflexively, her tits jiggling with her sudden move. </p><p>“Just close your eyes, and enjoy the treatment, my beautiful princess,” I murmured before returning to the delicious source of warmth in front of me, my tongue darting out once again. </p><p>The moan that escaped her mouth was heavenly, her chest pushing up, making her beautiful breasts jiggle more and more, almost in a hypnotic pattern. My tongue explored her entrance, quickly turning fast and aggressive, circling her knob again and again. After all, it was still the starter, and we had the main event to focus on. </p><p>She moaned, showing how much she enjoyed me spoiling her. She pushed her hips forward, her beautiful, plump thighs tightening around my head to make me feel even happier. </p><p>I might have reacted aggressively if someone else dared to do so, but if there was one girl that earned a little leeway, it was the cute princess that declared her love to me. I continued to lick her as her hips moved in response, grinding her pussy against my face. Her movements were a touch choppy and forceful, but her inexperience just made it sexier. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she murmured dazedly, adding another moan I grabbed her hips, my fingers sinking into her beautiful flesh, enjoying their softness, even as my shaft throbbed in anticipation. The idea of continuing for hours, slowly teasing her until she had turned into a delicious puddle of joy was tempting. </p><p>Unfortunately, I still had a lot of things to do, starting with a serious talk with her. </p><p>After one last touch, I started moving up, which earned a disappointing sigh since she was yet to climax. “So impatient,” I murmured, unable to keep a wide smirk from covering my face. “Don’t worry, we’re just about to start.” </p><p>She just nodded, still under my touch, while her irises widened as I slowly closed in the distance. But just as the distance was about to disappear into nothingness, she closed her eyes, ready for the kiss. I hummed as my lips pressed against hers, enjoying their delicate softness even as I brought the taste of her juices to her lips. </p><p>It was a soft, lingering kiss, one that she reacted in an instant as her tongue darted out, her pleasure allowing her to act more forward than she might have acted otherwise. Though, after that amazing breakfast show, I had to admit that her shyness had long transformed into its own special erotic version. </p><p>A development I had no problem with, especially since I was determined to keep her with me forever. Even if I decided to retreat from the Empire due to a mysterious growing double threat, I would bring her with me. </p><p>After everything I had done, kidnapping a princess didn’t even register as significant.</p><p>As the kiss deepened, her reaction intensified, while I readied myself to slide inside her. I wanted to tease her a bit more before slipping inside her, building her arousal to the limit before I could deliver the final blow. </p><p>But she managed to surprise me further, this time in the form of her legs wrapping around my waist, positioning my shaft against her entrance forcefully. “Oh, such a domineering princess, violating her subjects with force,” I murmured. </p><p>“You’re not one of my subjects, you’re my prisoner,” she managed to murmur cutely. “It’s only fair if I use some force to interrogate you.” </p><p>“Oh, the horror,” I murmured even as her legs pulled me even deeper, finally pulling me inside, her tunnels tight around my girth just as her legs tight around my waist. “This treatment is inhumane. Abolish the monarchy.” </p><p>“It’s just a start,” she said even as she pressed her hand on my shoulder, and flipped my body with surprising strength, fueled by her enthusiasm. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. Being buried in a soft bed as the princess of the Empire straddled my lap, my shaft buried inside her, her beautiful chest heaving in excitement… There were worse fates in the world. </p><p>Her hands landed on my chest as her hips moved with a rapidness that surprised me, any shyness she might feel about the situation long drowned in a sea of arousal. Her eyes closed as her hips started rocking, moving up and down as her nether lips danced over my shaft with dance too beautiful to describe, sinking and rising much faster than I expected. </p><p>A beautiful treatment, and her hands dancing on my chest just enhanced the sensation, especially with her rough treatment leaving more than one thin red line. Her gasps got louder and louder as she picked up even more speed, her face reflecting nothing but pleasure. </p><p>Enjoying the show passively was fun, there was no doubt about that, but even my patience had its limits. And watching the way her beautiful breasts jiggled in front of me with each jump certainly made it that much harder to resist. </p><p>Luckily, there was no harm in me helping her joy a bit, I thought even as I put my hands on her sides before letting them climb up, arriving at the borders of her beautiful globes. My fingers moved to their expanse hungrily, sinking into their generous depths. </p><p>“H-how dare you, touching a royal person without p-permission,” she stammered, but this time, it was her moans that broke her words rather than shyness. </p><p>“I’m sorry, your highness,” I mocked. “I’m such a bad person. Maybe you should make my punishment faster.” </p><p>“Maybe I should,” she said as she leaned forward, and her lips hovered above mine. </p><p>“Help, I’m being silenced. This is royal cruelty,” I managed to murmur before her lips landed on mine, her tongue darting out readily, doing her best to dominate the kiss. The twirling of her tongue as she invaded my mouth was perfect to convey her burning desire as she stole the control of the kiss, a touch out-of-character, but certainly glorious… </p><p>Then, her hands landed on my head, pulling my hair painfully as she continued to ravage my mouth desperately, trying to find a panacea that would reward her with her climax. A search that was going great, if her tightness was any indicator. </p><p>I sank deeper into her treasure as she reached a speed that was best described as furious, my muffled grunts of pleasure mixing into our flesh colliding, her tits rubbing against my skin to make the pleasure even tighter. </p><p>\"You’re just so beautiful,” I whispered when she pulled for a breather even as my hands moved to her hips, triggering her furious dance even more. </p><p>“You can’t buy your way out of punishment,” she managed to growl, though her attempts to look menacing had failed spectacularly. </p><p>“I’m scared,” I whispered, unable to hide my chuckle. </p><p>“Shut up,” she ordered, her blush getting more intense. When I opened my mouth to add another insult, however, she decided to silence me the best way possible, with another invasion of her beautiful tongue. </p><p>As our tongues battled, her hips gyration reached its climax, tightening around my girth, the sudden rush putting every single inch of my skin to high alert as it triggered an explosion of my own. </p><p>She started to shiver as I filled her beautiful body, bringing our little dance to a temporary end. She collapsed over my chest, her warmth more comforting than all the luxury that surrounded us. </p><p>“Maybe a decadent nap wouldn’t be too bad,” I murmured as I hugged her even tighter, enjoying the moment. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was curious about the identity of the mysterious healer, and not just because of the ease she was able to overcome the magical defenses I had created to trick a healer. I hadn’t been expecting those tricks to defend against a sorcerer, not for a long time, at least. However, the ease she had shown was something else. Yet, she was not only a prisoner, but also she was being forced to work — not entirely willingly as well, if the attitude of her guards was any indicator. </p><p>Forcing a sorcerer to work was not something I expected. House Junia was even stronger than I gave them the credit for. Pity that rejecting the request of a patrician family was impossible to reject for a little gladiator, especially this late. </p><p>So, I followed the guards, who seemed unwilling to talk. Not just with me, a slave from their perspective, but also with each other, their gaze alternating between our surroundings and the carriage, their alertness not decreasing even for a second. </p><p>A shocking level of discipline in a bunch of guards during a routine mission, even for a patrician house. The guards that defended Olivia’s house, for example, lacked that discipline. If they had been even half-alert, I wouldn’t have been dared to sneak into their library. </p><p>I felt the stirrings of disappointment, even when I was about to enjoy the lovely presence of a few very — or several — sexy ladies. I desperately needed the information, and losing the opportunity to visit the library was bad enough, but also I had to deal with someone knowing my secret. </p><p>However, as we continued to walk, I noticed something else. The lack of talking was fine, but their expression stayed blank the whole way, their attention unwavering, to the point that I started to get uncomfortable near them. </p><p>There was something unnatural about them, and a house filled with them was a scary thought.  </p><p>Then, we arrived at our destination. I saw the other guards when we finally arrived at the huge residence — which was closer to the city than Olivia’s, occupying the top of a large hill as if it was declaring its superiority compared to other patrician houses — and luckily, they lacked the tenseness my escorts showed during the journey. </p><p>“Take him to the party,” one of them finally spoke. Two of the gate guards dashed forward fearfully while they moved deeper into the estate along with the carriage. </p><p>“Follow us,” said one of the guards. “The party is about to start, and they want you to be prepared decently.” </p><p>I nodded, focusing on the area that surrounded me, both the layout of the buildings and the magic that was bubbling around, strong enough to almost take a physical presence. Sieging this place by force was near impossible without an actual army — which was impossible considering it was walking distance from the capital. </p><p>This place was as close to impenetrable as it was reasonably possible. </p><p>“I hate those creepy guys,” the guard murmured, though only after they had disappeared into one of the side buildings, surrounded by stronger wards — and unlike other buildings, those wards were not there to prevent people from entering, but leaving. </p><p>It had been easy to find the prison for the healer. All I needed was to break in and learn what she wanted in exchange for keeping my secret. And maybe, just maybe, get her help suppressing my condition from an actual expert rather than trying to cobble together a solution.  </p><p>“Who are those silent guys?” I asked, which earned an angry glare from the guard that didn’t mumble in annoyance. </p><p>“You can’t keep your mouth shut, can you?” he murmured to his friend before looking at me. “Just keep your mouth shut and ignore them,” he said to me sharply. </p><p>That was not ominous at all, I thought even as I nodded. </p><p>“Yeah, people bothering them has a nasty habit of disappearing,” the other murmured, once again earning the ire of his friend, this time a slap to his shoulder. “For the sake of Mars, you moron, keep your trap shut.” </p><p>I just smirked as they led me to the central building, and delivered me to the hands of another servant, this time an old woman with a serious expression. “Quick,” she ordered. “The party is about to begin.” </p><p>She led me to a room that held a huge rack of clothing, with a couple of tailors waiting on the edges to make alterations. “Try this…” she started as she threw a ripped, ruined tunic at me, while another servant already walked to me, putting some warpaint to my face. My smirk widened as I touched the fabric, its texture soft and smooth, the kind that required a great deal of gold to purchase. </p><p>Only the filthy rich would have used that fabric to create a barbarian costume for a party. </p><p>An hour, and a great deal of effort later, I looked like one of the wild kings of old strong enough to threaten Rome, wearing linen and fur, my face covered in war paint. I even had a fancy sword tied around my waist, albeit blunted, completing the view. </p><p>Rather ironic, I thought even as I was led by servants once again, this time to the inner courtyard. The crowd was already there, a drove of nobles, each more self-important than the last, trying to subtly pose against each other even as they watched the dancers in the middle of the courtyard, providing a spectacular show. </p><p>Since the party was already ongoing, I didn’t expect my entrance to be notable, though I still straightened my back and put on a sharp expression, doing my best to look like a dangerous gladiator, even using the same magic trick I had used during my party appearance to add a touch of wildness to my aura, making my presence more domineering. </p><p>Still, I wasn’t expecting Olivia to turn to me the moment I entered, with a big smile on her face. “The vanquisher of a Nemean lion, and more importantly, the savior of my gold twice, the great gladiator Peirous is here, and more importantly, alive!” </p><p>And just like that, the crowd turned to me. Admittedly, their gaze was hardly intimidating after I got used to a hundred thousand people filling Colosseum seats, standing in front of a crowd didn’t even register as a challenge, even with their exalted background, each able to mobilize a small army with a word. </p><p>I was curious about the savior part of her statement, but that didn’t last long, when she turned to Marcus with an amused expression. Marcus, on the other hand, looked shocked as he looked at me, struggling to process my presence. </p><p>I had seen people less shocked after being stabbed. </p><p>“You were supposed to be dead,” Marcus murmured, shocked. </p><p>Olivia’s just smirked, her expression leaving no doubt about the target of her words. “Sorry about that, Marcus. I forgot how much it might hurt you after losing two bets,” she said, not even bothering to hide her victorious expression. And suddenly, I had an inkling about who exactly was on the other end of the bet Marcus had lost after my victory. More importantly, the mention of a double bet, combined with the focus on me being alive, made it easier to guess the second bet. </p><p>He clearly bet that I would be dead after the ‘devastating’ wound I had received, hoping to make up for his losses. I had no idea how big was the bet, but to make Olivia actively happy, there was no chance that it was a small amount. </p><p>And if the mixture of pitying looks and snickers he was receiving from the rest of the crowd, it didn’t seem like a well-hidden bet either. I could see his reputation collapsing in real-time. </p><p>Very pitiful.  </p><p>He looked at me, shock and anger battling against each other, with a generous dose of regret mixed in. An adequate reaction to the death of his social reputation. Clearly, the only reason he dared to visit the party in the first place was that he had assumed I would be dead, which would mean he had recovered his losses and his reputation simultaneously. </p><p>“It’s not a problem, just spare change,” he managed to say, but with his face scrunched like he had been smelling something nasty. </p><p>“Are you sure? It’s not a small amount you have lost. I can’t imagine your father being happy with it. Maybe I should forgive your debt.” Then, she chuckled. “Some of it, at least.”  </p><p>“Not necessary,” Marcus managed to grunt in anger, which surprised no one. Accepting her mercy in such a public location would have delivered a deadly hit to not only his public reputation, but also his family never to be resurrected. “I can handle it.”</p><p>Still, the dynamic between them was interesting.  </p><p>I had assumed that Marcus was just another low-ranking noble, trying to integrate himself into a more important cycle as a passerby, even hoping to somehow seduce Olivia in the process. However, the glee in Olivia’s tone, along with her sharp expression suggested a different balance. </p><p>It seemed that Marcus was closer to his objective than I had first assumed, until I had burst into the scene and ruined his little plan. I might have even pitied him if he didn’t try to arrange for my assassination, making my plans much harder to implement even with his failure. </p><p>Instead, I decided to twist the knife deeper. “I’m sorry to hear that you have lost a lot of money betting on me, master,” I said with a soft tone. “Maybe I should just slit my throat the next time, making your job easier.” </p><p>It wasn’t a particularly good insult. However, the fact that it was a slave, daringly mocking a noble made it much more insulting. The guests looked at me in shock, some scandalized at the slave of a daring, while others were barely suppressing their snickers — and a couple of chuckles reaching my ear suggested that not all guests succeeded in that.  </p><p>Which didn’t help Marcus’ anger any. “How dare you, you filthy slave!” Marcus growled as he drew his dagger. </p><p>I didn’t bother reacting, not when I saw Atia’s anger. “How dare you, daring to pull a weapon in my domicile,” she said, her voice surprisingly sharp, reminding me that, despite her calm demeanor, she was still from a patrician house, with all the training and authority that was implied. “Who do you think you are!” </p><p>It just me more enthusiastic about the private party that would inevitably follow this one. </p><p>“I - I don’t…” Marcus stammered, realizing he had screwed up pretty badly. </p><p>“I don’t care, get out,” Atia said, kicking him out of the party, which, as far as the social reputation went, was a deadly blow, much worse than the spectacle about the bet. Admittedly, Marcus’ actions weren’t enough to make such a radical move necessary, but with her friendship with Olivia, I wasn’t surprised Atia acted a bit too enthusiastic. </p><p>The party started faster than I expected. </p>",

    "content": "<p>A touch of annoyance stirred in my heart even as I stepped into the tunnel that was under the control of the headmistress’ precious dark wards. The fact that it was a part of my plan wasn’t enough to completely dismiss the sting of being summoned like a servant. </p><p>The fact that it stopped me from enjoying the extended embrace of a busty blacksmith hardly helped to maintain my mood. </p><p>I knocked on the door, but there was no response. However, I could sense her mana moving behind the door, with no attempt to keep it hidden. On the contrary, her casting was more obvious than the usual, as if she wanted me to detect her behind the door. </p><p>Yet the door stayed closed. </p><p>A transparent attempt to exert her power. But like most direct applications of authority, or like sexy underwear, just because it was transparent didn’t mean that it was useless. I waited silently for five minutes before a spell finally hit on the door, opening it. </p><p>When I entered, I found her still in her human form, lying on a reclining chair. Still short, with her emerald hair bright enough to get all the attention if it wasn’t for her deliciously amazing curves, the only thing that was different was her clothing, wearing some kind of short nightie rather than a dress. </p><p>If it wasn’t for her beauty, I would have been much less willing to play along with her little games. </p><p>“How can I help you, mistress?” I said, but made sure to add a slightly mocking tone, reminding her that, ultimately, I was just playing around rather than being intimidated into service. </p><p>Sometimes, it was easier to act truly servile, waiting until it was the time to lash out and defeat the enemy. However, the current situation was certainly not one of those, not with the power inequality of our initial meetings, saving her from certain death twice. The </p><p>She didn’t miss that particular detail if her cute frown was any indicator. “I’m hungry, prepare some food for me,” she said, her tone excessively dismissive. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress?” I asked. “Any preference? Maybe some steak?” </p><p>“Something lighter. After spending that much time in the wilderness, I’m not in the mood for something heavy.”</p><p>“How about a salad, maybe some steamed vegetables?” I asked, only to receive a shocked gaze.</p><p>“What are you talking about,” she muttered in shock, and no small amount of anger. “Salad, vegetables? Do I look like a cow to you?”  </p><p>I smirked sardonically, realizing that my menu idea was not exactly well-thought-out. Clearly, vegetables were hardly the most appealing food for a dragon. “Maybe some nice braised dire chicken, then?” I asked. “And some spices to give a nice aroma.” </p><p>“Maybe,” she said, then her smirk widened, like she was about to deliver a dangerous blow. “But I want you to cook it here, yourself, I can’t trust the servants here. What if there were spies, and use the opportunity to poison me.” </p><p>It wasn’t a particularly good reason. The existence of spies was not in doubt, but it was very unlikely for those spies to be aware of her presence. And even if they were aware of her presence and determined to take her down, I doubted that poisoning would be the first method. </p><p>I had a feeling that poisoning a dragon wouldn’t be a simple task. </p><p>I didn’t bother explaining that, of course, not when her smirk told me all I needed to know. It was clearly an excuse to force me to do some menial work. </p><p>Jokes on her. Of all the things she could ask me to do using the headmistress as an excuse, cooking wouldn’t even earn a place on the list of annoyances. It didn’t bother me at all, not when I had to prepare my own meals for a long while, especially after I started leveling up. </p><p> I didn’t tell her that, of course, instead of letting her think that she had pulled one over me. “As you wish, mistress,” I said with a resigned tone. “Just let me go and pick some supplies first.” </p><p>“Sure, go ahead,” she said, waving her hand dismissively, which did some nice things to her skimpy nightie. “But don’t dawdle too much, I’m feeling famished.” </p><p>The supply trip didn’t last long since I didn’t bother talking with anyone, but directly arrived at the storage and took all the ingredients and equipment I needed. I could have used the headmistress’ orders to get them officially, however, but it would be like shouting to the spies in the school that was something extraordinary going on. </p><p>And when I knocked on her door, once again, she kept me waiting, which made her tactic even more amusing and childish, making me actually chuckle. And when the door finally opened, the sight that was revealed was certainly enough to compensate. </p><p>She was still wearing the same nightie, but her legs were crossed, her body leaning forward a bit to enhance her beautiful cleavage even further. </p><p>I still remembered the sensation of dragging my fingers on her soft skin. </p><p>“Mistress,” I said with a nod, making a point not to linger my gaze on her body, not giving her the attention she clearly desired. </p><p>Instead, I moved to the corner, a couple of spells and a ward enough to create a temporary kitchen. I started cooking, which was a smooth process thanks to my Craft skill, which didn’t only help me to create very useful weapons but also prepare meals. </p><p>Once again, generalist skills for the win. </p><p>I started whistling as my knife danced over the meat, mixing the pieces with a spice mixture rapidly, even as the ward structure replicated an oven and started to warm up to the correct degree. </p><p>However, I wasn’t just mixing the meat with the spices. Instead, I was carefully coating every single one with a great amount of mana carefully, not only increased the magic it contained, but also carefully enhanced the flavor packed in it, something that I was able to do before making the meat explode, only because my Tantric ability allowing me to keep mana smooth and calm even outside my body. </p><p>[-842 Mana]</p><p>A costly activity. Pity that the wards blocked the System from improving my skills, as it would have been a nice bonus along with the delicious smell that filled the room. </p><p>However, as I cooked, I heard the distinct sound of fabric being pulled off. A soft, suggestive sound, one that tempted me to look back, but I kept my attention on the preparation. The sound was too loud, too stretched out to be anything but accidental, a part of her teasing. </p><p>The sigh of annoyance that followed certainly confirmed that assumption. </p><p>She followed that with another spell, her mana signature distinct, before footsteps started to move toward me, sauntering slowly, until she was directly behind me. Still, I didn’t look at her until she actually leaned against my body. </p><p>“It smells nice,” she murmured even as her breasts rubbed against my back, her voice soft, suggestive. “You’re a better cook than I expected. Maybe I should actually take you back with me as my servant,” she added, teasing and mocking me at the same time. </p><p>And I had to admit, it was working despite the brief respite I had earned thanks to Oeyne. “That’s not possible, unfortunately,” I murmured, but only after a reasonable pause, one that implied that the determination behind my words wasn’t as strong as the words implied. </p><p>I had no idea to truly be her servant, of course, but giving her the impression that it was possible wouldn’t hurt. She would try to impress me, which would come with a lot of relevant information about the world that was not under the control of the system. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured as she shifted a bit, standing next to me. Only then did I let my gaze drop toward her, getting the first glimpse of her changed clothing. Her negligee was gone, replaced by a tight dress. It was longer than her negligee, reaching to her knees, but its tightness was more than enough to compensate for the loss of sexiness. </p><p>Together with the generous cleavage, she was very beautiful, but that prevent her from looking furious I barely paid her a glance before turning my attention back to cooking, carefully infusing more mana into the water I used to braise the meat.  </p><p>[-381 Mana]</p><p>“You’re wasting a lot of mana,” she commented as she watched me slowly infuse the water with more and more, which, unlike directly reinforcing the meat, was going to be set aside as leftover, while the mana slowly evaporated away. </p><p>“That’s the quirk of cooking,” I answered. “If you want to make a delicious dish, you need to be willing to waste a lot of mana.” This was technically correct, but that didn’t change the fact that the mana-intensive cooking technique was my own invention, merging Tantric and Craft on the fly. </p><p>No one else had used such a technique before to my knowledge, which wasn’t as surprising as it might sound. First, I doubted there were more chefs that had a mana pool reaching four digits in the first place, which was requisite for the technique. Then, those chefs would require a significant Arcana skill, assisted by some very complicated wards to compensate for Tantric — which I suspected something unique to my own situation, as I failed to discover any similar skills in my studies. </p><p>Even if it wasn’t a unique skill, it was likely rare enough that there was not a chef that had it. </p><p>Still, even more importantly, there were very few people that could actually eat such a mana-intensive dish without exploding, and even less that could actually extract the slightest benefit. Even most efficient mana recovery potions were little more than a wasteful luxury, dedicated for the usage of low-leveled rich scions rather than actually used in battles. Most of it was about people’s inability to efficiently consume external mana. </p><p>The only exception, was the sexy dragon next to me, doing her best to get my attention without being too obvious. Her ability to directly extract mana from things she consumed, which, by her own admission, was the only thing that kept her alive without the System and the mana regeneration it provided. </p><p>She was the only one that could really appreciate the complicated dish I was about to finish preparing, after one last touch. </p><p>[-925 Mana]</p><p>Again, I had used a lot of mana, but this time, it wasn’t just to maximize the taste of the meal I had prepared. I had used the opportunity to attach some of it to her dress, one that would allow me to apply some mischievous tricks. </p><p>“Your dinner is ready, mistress,” I said. “Shall we move to the table?” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 6139 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The sight of her beautiful, plump, heart-shaped ass, the light bouncing off from her caramel skin, was simply too beautiful to resist for a long time, especially for denying myself the pleasure for such a long time — a couple of days might as well be an eternity as well as my standards were concerned. </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured despite the temptation, rubbing the head of my shaft against her entrance as I stretched that syllable. “Maybe we should stop. After all, you’re tired after working on the designs for such a long time.” </p><p>The gag in her mouth prevented her from saying anything, but it was impossible to mistake the need echoing in her muffled cry. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her more, but not as tempted to feel her presence around me as I enter. “Loud and clear,” I said with a chuckle as I rubbed my presence against her entrance once more, her moans rising unbidden to match, creating a delicious symphony. “It’s time for the fun to begin,” I said, warning her one last time as I plunged inside her, mercilessly hard. </p><p>Just the way she liked. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 12%] </p><p>My smile widened, though, as delicious as the way she tightened around me as I pushed, the physical aspects played a limited part in it. The sense of improvement was nice, dispelling the growing fear that things were getting too dangerous for me to handle. </p><p>With enough power, nothing was too difficult to handle. </p><p>My hips quickened, filling the room with the sound of our flesh colliding, each slam echoing against the walls. And since her body was still being held by the floating chains, each slam making her swing like a pendulum, her body dancing deliciously. </p><p>She moaned even as I slapped her ass, enhancing her moans even more, forcing the limits of the gag that was supposed to keep her silent. “So loud,” I said even as I quickened my pace even further, uncaring of the loudness of her moans. After all, we were in her room, which was safely reinforced the walls enough to act as a fortress if needed. </p><p>Even then, some of her moans were actually loud enough to make me wonder. </p><p>Not enough to actually make me stop, of course. I continued slamming into her delicious entrance, enjoying her absolute lack of struggle as she accepted my assault — which was a rarity in her case, showing she had missed my touch greatly as well, regardless of the little passed time. Even my spanks, getting hard enough to leave a lingering redness despite her endurance, were only earning louder moans. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 15%] </p><p>It was time for a change of position. I started walking toward her bedroom, a task that was much easier by the floating chains that tied her up, pumping hard into her with each step. Soon, she was shivering beautifully with every touch. </p><p>Only when we arrived at her bedroom I waved my hand, and her chains floated down, slow enough for her to position her legs, allowing her to balance herself on her knees rather than landing directly. I also loosened her gag, finally allowing her to speak. </p><p>“Yes, harder, faster,” she growled, showing that she was already lost in pleasure. “I’m so close!” </p><p>In another situation, I would have slowed down, torturing her with an orgasm that refused to arrive, but I  was feeling too explosive to delay it, not when I was burning with a similar desire. I still pulled out of her, just enough to make her give a quick, burning whisper of begging before I plunged back, making her shift back to her wordless moans. </p><p>However, as I returned the task, I grabbed the remaining chains, which were connected to her arms, pulling back. It forced her body to rise even as her arms bent back, her tits jiggling beautifully with each pump of my hips. </p><p>“It’s fun to take the occasional break from work, isn’t it,” I asked even as I pulled her back even harder, her delicious cries quick to mix in. </p><p>“Only if — every break feels this way,” she managed to answer, but not without her moans interrupting her words. </p><p>“Well, that can be arranged,” I whispered. “Of course, it requires some more obedience from your end.” </p><p>“For what, exactly?” she managed to ask, showing that, even while drowning in pleasure, she wasn’t about to declare her unrestricted loyalty to me. </p><p>Not yet, at least. </p><p>“Nothing too exhausting or arduous,” I said even as I used my free hand to grab her freely-dangling tits, sinking into their large, generous expanse, triggering another beautiful moan in the process. “Well, for the other activities, of course…” </p><p>“That works,” she managed to main even as she started to shudder, the climax she was waiting for finally hitting her wildly. She gasped and moaned, shuddering under the effects of an earthquake.</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 19%] </p><p>Still, just because I wasn’t in the mood to torture her with a delayed orgasm didn’t mean that I tease her the other ways. Before she could recover from the aftereffects, I untied her hands before flipping her, her beautiful tits pointing to the ceiling. Then, I slipped inside her once more. </p><p>“So, about what I need from you,” I said even as I started moving once more, enjoying her tightness even as I tried to come up with the best way to deepen our partnership. Luckily, I wasn’t starting from scratch, which gave me a reasonable basis. We were already cooperating against the Princess and her mysterious requests — though, the latest visit had suggested we might need to adjust our strategy in that area — and I was essentially her supervisor as far as her dependency on the school was concerned, easily replacing the importance of the contact that arranged her stay in the first place. </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned even as I grabbed her legs and raised them to my shoulder, giving me an even more amazing angle into her core. </p><p>“I need a tighter cooperation from you,” I said, before adding with a chuckle. “Not that anyone could blame you for not being tight.” </p><p>“You’re such a charmer,” she said, which was impressive as she somehow managed to sound sarcastic between her moans of pleasure. Her attitude earned a painful nipple twist, which she enjoyed even more. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 21%] </p><p>“I need you to coordinate with me much tighter, and don’t do anything with the Princess without checking with me. She’s very complicated.” </p><p>“More complicated than being a royal that was effectively deposed from her position, hunted by her family, and desperate enough to take very dangerous risks?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes,” I said with a stern tone. “There’s something mysterious about her, raising much bigger complications than I expected. Those designs and the weapon she wants us to forge is clearly a small part of her plan.”</p><p>“Do you know —“ she started before a moan interrupted her. “Do you know what’s her final objective?” </p><p>“Not yet. However, I had a feeling that whatever she’s trying to do, it’s not simple and pedestrian as just trying to take back her throne.” </p><p>I could see a question appear on her face, mixing into her pleasure, no doubt curious about my exact line of thinking, but instead, she chose to ask a simpler question. “Should I try to sabotage her?” she asked. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 24%] </p><p>“No,” I said. “While she has a hidden agenda, there’s no evidence that it’ll harm us, and she has a good relationship with the headmistress. Until I could discover her objective, we need to cooperate. Just make sure to inform me about everything they want, no matter how trivial it seems, like a few theoretical designs that could not be used at all.” </p><p>She nodded, showing her acceptance without even uttering a word, though her mouth opened for a fleeting second, signaling an aborted question. And I doubted it was because her curiosity was sated. Not with her body getting tighter and tighter around me. </p><p>She wasn’t the only one that was getting closer to the edge. One last moan of her was enough to trigger my climax as well. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25% - First Stage Completed +5000 Exp]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Grandmaster Arcana, Master Craft, Master Speech] </p><p>“And here’s your reward for working so well,” I murmured even as I tightened my grip around her hips, marking her insides. “Do you like your achievement?” </p><p>“H-how?” she murmured, the shock managing to find a place for itself even on her face, drowning in pleasure. </p><p>“A gentleman needs a few secrets to keep things interesting, ” I said with a smirk. “But did you  really think that I would leave your loyalty without a reward?” </p><p>“O-of course not,” she managed to stammer, but I could see the shock dancing on her face, one that surprised me for a moment until I could process it. After helping Helga and others not only get achievements but also level up repeatedly, I was used to getting underwhelming reactions. </p><p>Even a miracle turned ordinary after enough repetition. </p><p>I gave her a moment to gather herself, allowing her to process the shock and maintain her shock at the same time, while I picked my newest skill. And since I was not ready to commit the next five levels to one particular skill, even one as useful as Arcana, I chose Craft, to bring my production to the next level. </p><p>After all, I still had to craft a lot of things. </p><p>I turned my attention back to the busty caramel beauty, panting helplessly in front of me, trying to decide between the merits of improving my newest skill and focusing back to her treatment, to see whether I had managed to impress her suitably enough to clear two more stages of Companion Process, which, combined with the experience reward, would bring me at the edge of the next level… </p><p>However, before I could make a decision, I had received a magical message from a certain scaly acquaintance, delivered by the wards of the school, asking for me to prepare a meal for her. </p><p>“That’s enough excitement for today,” I said as I looked at Oeyne, caressing her cheeks softly. “You should focus on using your power-up.

She pulled back from the kiss as she took a deep breath, finally leaving Nancy’s lips alone as she continued moaning. </p><p>That hardly meant Nancy was free, not when Penny’s hands were still on her shoulders, preventing her from standing up — not that she looked inclined to do so in the first place, not with her gaze locked on Penny’s face, examining her expression. </p><p>I couldn’t see Penny’s face from my current position — my very glorious, very enjoyable position behind her — but after all the time we spent together, I could easily imagine the exact face she was making — eyes closed, her pouty lips parted just enough to make her look even sexier, every line on her face contorted with pleasure… </p><p>I caught Nancy’s eyes, smirking widely as I started to speak. “Make sure she doesn’t make too much sound, we don’t want our neighbors to complain and make us lose this beautiful room, do we?” </p><p>There was no such possibility, of course, as no hotel worth its salt would neglect the soundproofing of their best room, not when their whole existence was to give rich and powerful a safe location to cheat on their significant others, usually in very loud and perverted ways. </p><p>By those standards, a sexy threesome was on the tame side.</p><p>Nancy was smart enough to realize that, but desire and hormones worked perfectly to obscure details that would otherwise be obvious. Though, considering the speed she had followed my instructions, maybe she was just happy to have an excuse. </p><p>The speed her tongue darted out, invading Penny’s mouth, certainly supported the latter. </p><p>Even with Nancy’s lips doing their best to block, Penny’s muffled moans continued to fill the room as I pumped mercilessly, her wetness wrapping around my girth with enthusiasm. She didn’t move at first, just maintaining her position as I slid in and out into her beautiful body. Then, her body started to move, pushing herself back to match my movement, making our embrace even more explosive. </p><p>It was faster than I expected with her shyness.  </p><p>It would be a lie if I didn’t feel a hint of surprise. Despite her impressive obedience, Penny had a significant problem taking even the slightest initiative, and seeing her react without order was a pleasant surprise. I rewarded her with a spank on her beautiful ass, and in response, she started moving even faster. </p><p>Our repeated encounters seemed to help her grow as a person, at least enough for her to act to get what she wanted rather than just waiting passively, accepting whatever happened. </p><p>I managed to fuck a hint of the spine into her. </p><p>Not too strong, of course. “Raise your ass more, and leave Nancy’s lips alone,” I ordered. Penny was quick to follow my orders, which left Nancy dazed and surprised, but only until my next order arrived. “And focus on her breasts.” I chuckled. “She has very sensitive nipples.” </p><p>“But—“ Nancy managed to say before Penny’s lips landed around her nipples, attacking with a fervor that reflected the speed I continued to drill her soft insides. “I thought I was supposed to keep her silent,” she managed to say, though that didn’t prevent the blush from climbing up. </p><p>“Well, it’s keeping her quite silent,” I said. “Isn’t she the perfect model, not skipping a second before listening to my orders.” </p><p>“I don’t see any camera,” she murmured petulantly. </p><p>“How daring!” I said, catching her beautiful gaze. </p><p>“What are you talking about?” Nancy said, confused, especially with Penny continuing to work on her beautiful breasts. </p><p>“I’m talking about you complaining about not having a camera in the room, of course. Maybe I should go and get one. Creating an automatic setup wouldn’t take more than—“ I started. </p><p>“No!” Nancy interrupted, her blush getting more and more intense each second. I smirked. </p><p>“Why, can’t you handle it?” I asked, deliberately teasing her. </p><p>“O-of course I can,” she stammered, once again showing that she couldn’t back out from a challenge, even that challenge meant a candid shot of her heated threesome. “I just don’t want Penny to feel self-conscious,” </p><p>Penny raised her head, stopping her task for a moment, but before she could speak and refute Nancy, I spanked her ass to silence her. “Continue with your job, sweetie,” I said even as I caught Nancy’s eye, whose expression started to turn into panic as she realized just how weak her argument had been. Penny certainly didn’t show any inclination she might reject my orders. </p><p>Luckily for Nancy, I had no intention of pushing that particular subject. “You’re a good friend, thinking of Penny’s discomfort,” I said instead, giving her a graceful retreat. I even managed to keep my face devoid of mockery, which was a more difficult challenge than expected. </p><p>“Yes, I’m a good friend,” Nancy said, letting out a sigh. </p><p>“Yes, you are,” I murmured like I had come to a big realization and pulled back, leaving Penny’s core empty, which made her rose, a soft frown on her face. Considering her submissiveness, I suspected that someone else would have been shouting in anger. I winked at her as I sat on the side of the tub, patting on my lap. “So much that you deserve a proper reward.” </p><p>“I … that’s not necessary,” she murmured. </p><p>“No, I insist,” I answered as I patted my lap, calling her closer. Then, I caught Penny’s gaze, and gave her a nod. “Sweetie, why don’t you help your friend to stand up.” </p><p>Nancy shivered as Penny grabbed her arm and helped her to rise, her beautiful legs trembling in fear and excitement, water droplets sliding down with each shiver. “I’m serious, there’s no need—“ she tried to argue, but made absolutely no attempt to pull out of Penny’s grip as she led her toward me. </p><p>“No need to feel self-conscious, beautiful,” I answered even as I grabbed her wrist and gently pulled her to my lap. “It’s not like we haven’t done it before.” I chuckled. “Although, not with a company,” I added even as I caressed her wetness. “Though, you’re very wet, and our previous time was in the living room, where anyone could stumble. Are you sure you don’t have a kink, sweetheart?” </p><p>“I’m not — I’m not an exhibitionist!” she exclaimed in anger, though, considering she didn’t show the slightest hint of hesitance as she lowered herself on my lap, it was hard to take her statement seriously. </p><p>However, I let her enjoy that dubious victory, that was all I could do as my shaft slowly disappeared into her entrance, a gentle moan escaping her mouth. I caught Penny’s expression, which had a rare mischievous expression as she stepped out of the shower. </p><p>I felt curious, but as Nancy started rocking on my lap, I decided to trust her. Admittedly, Nancy’s enthusiastic movement made it much easier to take that decision. She must have been feeling even hornier than I expected all day long if her sudden quickness was any indicator. </p><p>I placed my hands on the small of her back, supporting her as she moved up and down. “Modeling is not a bad job, isn’t it?” I asked mockingly. </p><p>“I much prefer writing,” she countered. “Standing all day while being ogled, I hate it,” she said, though her voice, along with her speed, suggested that she might not be entirely honest. </p><p>“So, should I assume you don’t want to repeat our trick in another convention, even if it allowed you to sell all your books? I respect your principles, turning your back to thousands of dollars, even if you can’t pay back your publishers for the advance.” </p><p>She said nothing, but her silence was more than enough as an answer, especially with her hips moving quicker. I could have mocked her for changing her mind, but it was pointless to brag after a victory. </p><p>Especially when her surrender included a beautiful rocking of her hips, moving faster and faster. “Harder,” she moaned. </p><p>“So demanding,” I mocked, but that didn’t prevent me from wrapping my arms around her waist, keeping her in place, while my hips moved with a renewed fervor, the sound of our slamming filling the room. “Damn, you’re a treasure,” I murmured even as I enjoyed the warmth between her legs unrestrictedly, each pump bringing me closer to an explosion of my own. </p><p>“Of course I am. I’m the best,” she answered smugly, though interestingly, I noticed she wasn’t looking at me when she said that. I followed her gaze, only to find her looking at Penny, who had reentered the room. </p><p>Her declaration was amusing, but I said nothing, letting the girls to battle for supremacy among themselves. Especially after seeing Penny’s expression. It seemed that, unlike earlier the day, she had no intention of obediently accepting the resolution of the day. </p><p>Penny slowly walked toward us with a soft expression on her face, though I noticed that she was holding something in her hand. I suppressed my curiosity momentarily as I continued to impale Nancy, earning a moan every second. </p><p>It was a good reward, especially with the sexy walk of a busty blonde in the background, her curves shivering with each step. We were close to a combined climax.  </p><p>Before that, however, Penny revealed her surprise. A small bottle of massage oil, she displayed as she drenched her fingers with a generous amount of slippery liquid, then stepped behind Nancy, her beautiful breasts pressing against her back. </p><p>“Wait for your turn,” Nancy said smugly, trying to turn that into a declaration of superiority. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” Penny said with an uncharacteristic smugness, fueled with jealousy, even as she pressed a finger in her puckered hole. “I’m just here to help, just as you deserve.” </p><p>At that moment, I cursed that I didn’t have my camera with me, as Nancy’s expression of shock was simply too beautiful… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I felt excited. </p><p>It was the first time I was playing the finals despite many tournaments I had joined, my previous attempts were ruined due to my lacking skills. </p><p>And it would be a lie to say it didn’t hurt. I lacked the passion for chess, but that didn’t make me any less competitive. After a spectacular number of failures, I was excited to sit on the competition seat. </p><p>I decided to take a break to wash my face while they announced a fifteen-minute intermission, changing the table layout to create a better viewing experience. </p><p>“It was a nice victory,” my guide said with her usual chipper tone. Luckily, this time, she managed to keep herself from speaking until we reached the end of the corridor. </p><p>“Thanks. I was just doing my best,” I answered before moving to the main topic, trying to hide my tenseness before I asked my question. However, it was not about the final I was about to take part in. “Did I collect enough Intent to get more Traits?” </p><p>I took a deep breath as she closed her eyes momentarily. I was afraid, because I didn’t know whether she would notice I had managed to trigger the System in her absence, and more importantly, how she would react if she indeed noticed it. </p><p>I still remembered the sudden oppressive aura she had radiated once she was annoyed. </p><p>Luckily, when she opened her eyes, there was no shift in her expression. “Unfortunately, no,” she answered with a cheerful shrug. “There seems to be not enough attention to trigger any new Traits.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured, trying to make my sigh of relief as unnoticeable as I could manage. Luckily, she wasn’t attentive enough to catch the shift in my attention. More importantly, any comment on my increased Traits was suspiciously absent. </p><p>Which meant that, she either didn’t notice it due to a lack of attention, or she lacked the ability to notice it in the first place.  </p><p>I didn’t dare to ask explicitly, afraid to alert her if it was the first case. And if she would react badly, she could do so once I had used the same trick again.  </p><p>Apologizing was easier than asking permission. </p><p>With that resolved, I stepped into the restroom, washing my face, trying to focus away from the benefits I had received — or hadn’t received — to focus on the game, but that turned out to be impossible, not with the implications of the latest developments — and the lack of it. </p><p>Despite the commotion my victories created, there were no traits. No new ones, no improvements. </p><p>I tried to calculate how it worked, which was difficult considering I had almost no direct data point, and the nature of the Intent was nebulous in the first place. However, even with the little data I could gather, I was able to do some simple mental calculations. </p><p>And the results suggested that the cost to improve Traits was more exponential in nature than simply additive. On the positive side, the number of different traits I was receiving suggested that, their relation, at least partially, was independent of each other. </p><p>Of course, it was just a rough analysis I did with no data, making those conclusions suspect. </p><p>The impact of different events on the Intent I had collected, however, was much more interesting. It was clear that the final output was not just about how many people that immediately surrounded me were thinking about me. It also worked remotely. More importantly, the event clearly didn’t have to be real.</p><p>Without that, the campus-wide raging gossip wouldn’t have benefited me significantly more than both the chess tournament where I showed off my skills and the party itself where the commotion that drove the gossip happened. </p><p>And the bonuses I had received from the gossip were even more interesting, particularly the improvements to the Tactics and Strategy, which was unrelated to the event itself. But since my identity as a chess player had been a part of the discussion, they had received a significant improvement.</p><p>Compared to that, the new physical traits I had received were more understandable, despite my guide’s explanation that they were much harder to receive. </p><p>Still, it was ironic that baseless gossip was given me much more than my actual achievements.  </p><p>What a beautiful reflection of life, style over substance. </p><p>However, when the referee called the game to start, I abandoned that track out of thought, instead of sitting in front of my beautiful opponent who was busy fixing her glasses, the glasses she hadn’t been wearing outside. </p><p>“Are you ready, sweetie?” I said, hitting her with a crooked smile that carried the full weight of my new Seduction Trait. </p><p>“S-shut up, don’t call me sweetie when we’re about to play,” she whispered back, trying not to be overheard by the others. </p><p>Her blush was cute, but her cuteness wasn’t enough to prevent me from bringing the full range of my abilities to her. Since she was was good enough to reach the finals — and pretty easily too, according to the snippets I was able to catch about her — I didn’t have the luxury to take her lightly. </p><p>“Well, I have to, considering you’re yet to tell me your name, beautiful,” I said. </p><p>“L-Lauren,” she stammered with a blush, before her anger recovered. “And don’t call me beautiful.” </p><p>“But lying is a sin,” I said, amused by her stammer. I was going to continue as well, but a warning glare from the referee stopped me. They weren’t able to hear our discussion, but they could see Lauren’s face getting redder, and I had just enough of a reputation for intimidation to make them interject. </p><p>With a smirk, I pushed my pawn forward, ready to tease her some more after my first victory… </p><p>Only to be demolished absolutely. </p><p>I had started aggressive, with a variant of Smith-Morra Gambit to counter her Sicilian Defense, a solid approach that not only forced her to react very carefully, but also left a lot of aggressive angles for me to leverage. </p><p>The game started confidently, but by move ten, I was behind two pawns, even as I stretched my newly found abilities to the limit. By the move fifteen, I was desperately sacrificing a knight for a pawn just to have a chance to breathe, but by the move twenty, my loss was absolutely certain. </p><p>Fuck, I thought even as I tried to breathe even for a moment. She was good, definitely good enough to count as a low-ranked Grandmaster, maybe even more. </p><p>Which was certainly unexpected to come across in a third-rate tournament. </p><p>Of course, just because she was much more skilled than me didn’t mean that I wanted to surrender. I decided to rely on what I did best, started to force the game to unusual situations even more, hoping to exhaust her before the next one. </p><p>So, after a very lengthy battle, she finally acquired her victory through an aggressive center push, and the first game was hers. </p><p>She was good, much better than a little college tournament like this deserved.  </p><p>“Damn, girl, that was a vicious game, you’re killing me,” I whispered, just soft enough not to be heard by the audience. </p><p>It was intended as a compliment, but I saw her flinch, as I had insulted her. I didn’t know why, but she was clearly feeling self-conscious about her skills. </p><p>I wasn’t a nice guy, and if I hadn’t found myself in the football team, I would have pushed that particular softness hoping for a victory —  even though, with the skill she displayed, even that would give me a small chance of victory. I could definitely steal a game, maybe even two, but definitely not full victory unless she collapsed completely. </p><p>Though, it would be a lie if I said that the beautiful frown behind her glasses didn’t play any role in that decision. </p><p>She said nothing else, and I didn’t push her, trying to focus on the next game, curious just how good I could play against her. </p><p>In the second game, she started with a soft, very defensive opening, showing that she felt self-conscious about the comment. If she was any weaker, I would have used a traditional hyper-aggressive push to leverage her distraction for a quick victory, but her skills made that an impossibility. </p><p>Instead, I responded with a confusing, unorthodox move, attacking from the sides even as I let her expand into the center, creating an unbreakable defensive formation. </p><p>She responded to the confusing layout with a decent speed, despite the challenges of responding to a confusing layout even with the format, giving her to have only a few seconds to consider each move. </p><p>We continued fighting over the left side of the board, while my occasional bursts prevented her from developing a strong presence on the center. She attempted to cut me off, but I managed to use my Queen defensively, cutting her attempt down even as I continued to batter her defenses, again and again, extending my control over the board. However, she still played very defensively. </p><p>Which, in the end, managed to be her downfall. Her passivity allowed me to set up a very complicated attack pattern — one that was only possible with the assistance of my Traits — which allowed me to deliver a lengthy, merciless attack that finally managed to bring me the victory. </p><p>When the game was over, both of us were sweating. </p><p>However, I didn’t have the time to pity her, because, despite losing the game, she didn’t look broken down. Instead, she had a vicious smile on her face, one that reminded me of myself.</p><p>“Let’s play,” she said widely. </p><p>I would have loved to say that it was the start of an amazing, very competitive game that went back and forth again and again until I managed to eke out a victory. </p><p>Unfortunately, the reality was crueler. For the next two games, she attacked mercilessly, the chess equivalent of a berserker, not even giving me a chance to set up a counter-attack, dominating me thoroughly. </p><p>I expanded every little trick in my bag of tricks, but even then, I was barely able to extend the games a few moves. </p><p>“Good game,” I said, leaving the table gracefully after shaking her hand before moving to my seat, while the referees and the well-wishers gathered around her to celebrate her victory. </p>",

    "content": "<p>With Emma collapsed in exhaustion, I was tempted to crawl next to her in her soft bed, getting some more sleep. The nap I had while waiting for her was far from enough to completely get rid of my tiredness. </p><p>Ultimately, however, I decided against it despite the temptation, for one important reason. Even after dominating her so thoroughly, I didn’t trust her enough to sleep next to her, not with her latest alliance with the Phoenixes. My instincts wouldn’t have allowed it to be enjoyable. And, after the exhausting day I had, I certainly didn’t want to go back to sleep in my uncomfortable cell. </p><p>Today’s string of successes deserved a better celebration. </p><p>Luckily, there was a comfortable location with no problems of trust. I changed my destination to the room of my favorite princess, once again using the convenience of the secret entrances to arrive there without raising any alarm. </p><p>I found Aria in her bed, her sleeping figure, surrounded by the white silk of her bedding, beautiful enough to qualify as a work of art. If I was less exhausted, I might have watched her for hours, enjoying the way her beautiful bosom softly rose with every breath, straining her cute nightie’s ability to keep them hidden. </p><p>However, I was still tired, so I decided to react more directly. I shed my clothing and slipped into her bed, spooning her from behind, the softness of her curves superior to her bed. I felt her stirring, her beautiful blue eyes opening blaringly. “Go back to sleep, love,” I murmured as I closed my eyes, but not before seeing a huge smile bloom in her face as she stirred in my arms, setting even better. </p><p>The sleep was much more comfortable than the quick nap I had got earlier, her warmth contained under her soft blankets, and I woke up to the delicious smell of some kind of pastry. </p><p>Pity that my arms were empty. </p><p>I cracked my eyes, and looked at the open door, which allowed me to see the small, connected kitchen, where Aria was bustling around, wearing an apron. </p><p>And only an apron. </p><p>“Okay,” I murmured as I stretched in the bed, enjoying the softness, luxury, and the lack of exhaustion, though the beautiful sight of my blonde princess walking around, better than naked as she did her best to prepare my breakfast. </p><p>The picture of total decadence. </p><p>I was tempted to stand up and join her, but the warmth of the bed was stronger than the cell that was supposed to keep me locked. Instead, I continued to lay half-asleep, dazed, watching as my naked-apron princess bustle as she filled plate after plate, fruits, pastries, and other delicious food, turning the late breakfast into a spectacular feast, amazing enough to match the spectacular beauty of her mostly-naked body. </p><p>“You’re awake,” she murmured as she finally finished the preparations, and brought the large tray to her bed, though my attention was on her breasts, her nipples peeking through her frilly apron. </p><p>“I am, beautiful,” I said even as I gestured for her to walk closer. She placed the tray on the bed and leaned for a kiss, giving me something even more delicious than the great breakfast she had prepared. “And with this amazing sight in front of me, I’m wide awake.” </p><p>Her blush at my compliment, despite her nakedness, just underlined her cuteness. </p><p>“I thought … you might use a good breakfast,” she murmured. </p><p>“I certainly do, and so do you. That energy will be very helpful for other activities I had planned for us,” I said, which hardly helped her blush. Unfortunately, that energy wasn’t going to be just used for some fun naked times, like a lot of spell casting I would have to do to explore the palace and reinforce the defenses of her room, but I didn’t want to tell her that right now, not wanting to ruin the mood yet. </p><p>“Come, sit, so that we can enjoy the amazing breakfast you prepared for us,” I said. She grabbed the ribbon of her apron, about to remove it, when I gestured for her to stop. “No, keep it on,” I said. </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured, her blush beautiful. She tried to sit next to me, something I prevented by wrapping my arm around her delicate waist, and pulling her on my lap instead. The resulting beautiful moan was hardly an indication of distaste. </p><p>Since the apron didn’t cover anywhere other than a little line around her waist, our naked flesh connected. Although slipping inside her was tempting, I decided to enjoy the breakfast she had prepared first. </p><p>In a manner of speaking. I grabbed a piece of fruit, but rather than eating it directly, I chose to feed it to my princess while I busied myself by softly kissing her neck while she enjoyed her food. When I pulled back, she had already grabbed a piece of pastry, combined with some cheese, ready to be enjoyed by me. </p><p>I started chewing, an explosion of flavor hitting my tongue. “Delicious,” I murmured. “I didn’t know you were such a good cook.” </p><p>“It helps me to relax when things get too hard,” she murmured. “It’s a secret stress relief.” </p><p>“Your secret is safe with me,” I whispered, followed by a kiss to her soft cheek, enjoying her soft tremble. “And, as far as the secrets that only I know goes, it’s not exactly a big one. There are others. For example, I know that there’s a particularly sensitive spot under your chin.” </p><p>I continued with the practical display of it as I sneaked a soft kiss under her chin, triggering another beautiful moan. “I can stay like this, forever,” Aria murmured. “Maybe we should just run away and find a nice cottage.” </p><p>“Tempting,” I murmured, and much to my surprise, I found myself actually tempted by the idea. Pity that the sudden appearance of Elves and Phoenixes made even dreaming about such a world impossible. </p><p>Not when I had no idea about their objective in the first place. </p><p>Still, the amazing massage of Aria’s naked butt as she shuffled in place was a perfect trigger for me to focus back to reality, momentarily ignoring the upcoming disaster. I slipped my hands under her apron, caressing her naked stomach as she slowly fed me the delicious dishes she had cooked for me, each more delicious than the last. Slowly, I was getting full, marking the time to enjoy a different kind of dish. </p><p>“You’re as good as a cook as you’re beautiful,” I whispered, the compliment working wonders to add a little more speed to her movement. Her hips started to rock over my lap faster, making my shaft grow in the beautiful valley it was currently buried. </p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured. </p><p>“But there’s missing, I need some milk,” I said. </p><p>“We have some,” she said, pointing at the glass. </p><p>“Nope, I don’t like that glass,” I answered as I suddenly flipped her, and she found herself laying on her back. A tug was enough to get rid of the apron, leaving her completely naked. I grabbed the milk glass, dripping some on her breasts, before licking them clean with slow, methodical care. “This, however, a much better presentation.” </p><p>She said nothing as her shyness battled with her arousal, allowing me to enjoy my drink slowly. “Hmm, not delicious enough,” I said, which earned a gaze that could almost be classified as angry, though that only lasted until I grabbed some of the delicious chocolate and spread it on her breasts. “Much better,” I murmured as I enjoyed my dessert. </p><p>I could feel her desperate gaze on me as I stayed focused on her breasts, using them as the most extravagant food delivery surfaces I ever had the pleasure of using. </p><p>Her back arched as the pleasure hit, making the sight even more beautiful, especially when her legs parted, wordlessly begging for her final meal. But, enjoying the sight of her trembling and stretched-out body, I had no intention of hurrying up. </p><p>A feast deserved proper savoring. </p><p>“Who is a naughty princess?” I whispered as my lips clasped around her beautiful nipple, making her tremble helplessly.  </p><p>“I’m not … naught,” she managed to moan as my tongue danced over her hard nipple, triggering a flood of pleasure. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, unable to hide my amusement as I pulled back. Lying on her bed, naked, her back arching to push her chocolate-stained breasts even higher to display them perfectly, she wasn’t exactly radiating innocence. Especially when the treasure between her legs sopping wet. I slipped a finger in, enjoying her wetness while simultaneously triggering a moan. </p><p>When I pulled it back, my finger was glistening beautifully. “If you’re not naughty, how are you going to explain it?” </p><p>“It’s your fault,” she answered immediately, though her legs, widening even further, didn’t seem to be displaying great acrimony for my fault. </p><p>“Hah, just like royalty, blaming others for your own faults,” I said as I lowered myself over her body once more. </p><p>Surprisingly, rather than continuing to lay, she put her elbows on the bed and pushed her body up — which made her look even sexier. “I’m a princess. My word is law, and my judgment is final. I’m not naughty, and it’s your fault. And you’re sentenced to fix it.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk salaciously as she tried to be authoritative. Even discounting the beautiful sight that would have destroyed any authority, she was as threatening as a cute kitten trying to intimidate a lion… </p><p>I wondered which would be more enjoyable. Playing along, or reminding her about the dark and sexy authority of a dark lord? </p>",

    "content": "<p>For more than an hour, I lay on my bed, squirming helplessly as the poison rocked in my veins, doing my best to suppress my natural instincts to heal it. </p><p>Technically, I could have faked it, but the healer was sitting on a chair next to me, observing me nervously as he carefully monitored my condition, healing me whenever I was too close to death, and injecting some poison whenever I showed the signs of recovery. Suffering the pain was easier than interfering with every single diagnostic spell he had used.  </p><p>Then, I felt a strong magical presence from the corridor, but it was different enough to get my attention. The aura was not weak, not at all. It was enough to challenge a peak mage, which meant either the source was straining themselves to the limit, or I was about to meet another sorcerer. Yet, despite the strength, the mana, for the lack of a better term, was soft, malleable. If ordinary mana was made of steel, this mana was made of soft cotton… </p><p>My healer’s sudden reaction, injecting me another dose of poison hurriedly, was enough to confirm my suspicion. The healer from House Junia was here. </p><p>I reacted in an instant, healing the poison aggressively, but not completely. I wanted to leave some signs of poison, suggesting most of it had been already cleansed, but I completely erased any remaining signs of the berserk potion. </p><p>If the healer discovered the berserk potion, it would trigger a big mess, and as amusing as imagining the patrician house descending on the gladiator school because they dared to lie, it would be very inconvenient for my plans. I neither needed their attention, nor their help. The situation was already complicated enough without throwing another confusing source. </p><p>“Where’s he?” asked an unfamiliar voice, a woman by any indication. Her voice was soft, but carried an expectation to be obeyed. Understandable, as she was most likely a Sorceress, one dedicated to healing. A sorceress, technically. “Bring me to him.” </p><p>Though it wasn’t the only interesting thing about the voice. She also had an accent that I had never heard. </p><p>“Of course,” Antonius answered, his earlier confidence long shattered, replaced by smarmy obedience now that he wasn’t facing a slave or a healer under his command. “My healer is already working on him to keep him alive, and I trust him completely,” he said. “He’s a very good healer, and nothing would happen to the gladiator unless he makes a mistake.”  </p><p>The healer understandably flinched as he looked at me with regret, realizing that Antonius never had the intention of forgiving his screw-up in the first place, but threw him under the raging elephant. He raised his hands, healing energy gathering to cure me, but before he could cast a spell, the door opened, revealing a robed figure, surrounded by four armored warriors, each much more tense and alert than I expected, like they were not in Rome, but in a battlefield. </p><p>She was foreign-looking, though not in a way I recognized from first-hand experience. She was short, with black hair and fair skin, but her slanted eyes reminded me of the descriptions of the mysterious lands of Asia. That was the limit of my information, as there was little communication between the Great Lands of Cathay and the Roman Republic, as the route itself was blocked by two great Empires, Persian and Roman. The information trickled down from the trade caravans was limited, little more than legends and myths. </p><p>What an interesting development. </p><p>“Pull back, amateur,” she ordered to the healer, her order supported by a flare of her mana, which, despite the softness, was enough to mark her sorceress identity. The header pulled back in panic, his gaze dancing between the healer and her guards, his face rapidly paling as he realized just how bad his situation was. </p><p>He tried to slink, but Antonius was ready, and grabbed his shoulder, not bothering to hide his vicious smirk. </p><p>Meanwhile, the mysterious sorceress from Cathay pulled a box from her belt, and suddenly, about three dozen silver needles floated over my body. </p><p>It took all my presence to suppress my instinctual reaction, and that was only possible because the energy that was surrounding the needles could only be used for healing. And then, they sank into my body. </p><p>The healing energy easily destroyed any remaining scraps of poison, far quicker than even I could manage, renewing my stamina in the process as well. However, my eyes widened in panic as she easily bypassed the layers I had established to trick her, far more skilled I expected her. Not only I could have replicated that trick, and I doubted any other sorcerer could easily do it. </p><p>Fuck, I thought even as her powers started to explore my body, focusing on my right arm and my heart, in particular, her eyes growing wide to match my reaction. </p><p>Okay, that was the end of my little adventure, I thought even as I started gathering my magic, while her needles pulled away from my body, no doubt to switch to a more aggressive formation. </p><p>I let my eye wander over the targets as I stood up, trying to decide whether taking the sorceress healer, or her guards was the better idea, my mind already on whether I could hide with Theodora, or just running away was the better option. </p><p>Before I could take an action, however, she started to gather her needles, and spoke. “He’s healed, we can leave,” she said with a calmness that surprised me, even as her gaze found mine, as if she was begging for my silence. </p><p>Despite her face, her tone was calm. </p><p>“He’s healed?” Antonius asked, his eyes widening in shock. “Already!’ </p><p>“Yes, he was already mostly cured. Your healer must be even better than you gave him credit for,” she said as she looked at the healer. </p><p>And she wasn’t the only one that looked at him. Antonius looked at him as well, but unlike her, his gaze was tainted with anger. I could easily read his expression, one that promised a lot of pain and suffering. Unfortunately, since he had been trying to poison me to death moments ago, I wasn’t feeling merciful enough to explain there wasn’t a great betrayal that screwed up his plan. </p><p>However, he didn’t keep his gaze on his healer for long, and turned her gaze to the healer sorceress. “Maybe we should make sure he’s well enough to move,“ Antonius said as he walked toward the healer. “I want to make sure his long-term health is not in jeopardy. </p><p>As he walked, he subtly managed to raise his arm, which, incidentally, revealed a very big money pouch. The implication was clear, that she would receive a big payday if she played along. </p><p>“He’s fine, let’s go,” she said, giving him no place to argue, and at this point, Antonius lacked the angle to argue against. One of the guards grabbed my arm and pulled me up. </p><p>Antonius ordered the servants to bring me new clothes, realizing that, at this point, he didn’t have a leg to stand on. His plan was in shambles. </p><p>Pity I wasn’t in a mood to enjoy his despair. Even as I dressed quickly, I observed the foreign sorceress, trying to understand why she was keeping her mouth shut despite knowing my hidden abilities. Still, I played along, because, even if the worst came to worst, attacking them on the forests between the patrician estate and Rome. </p><p>It was much easier than trying to escape from the fortified capital. </p><p>I followed them, thinking the escape would be trivial, only to stall when I realized they were leading me to a carriage covered with wards. That stopped me, because even with a glance, it was clear that those wards were not there for protection, but imprisonment. </p><p>They had come more prepared than I expected, preparing myself to an explosive last stand. Entering a mobile prison was a worse bet than trying to escape from a fortified city. At least, in the city, the crowds would help me hide. </p><p>Once again, before I could act, another surprise waited for me. One of the guards poked the shoulder of the healer. “Go into your cart, lady,” he said tensely. That made me realize that I had missed one very important detail in my panic. While we walked, the guards were not observing me, but the healer. </p><p>And not because they wanted to make sure nothing had happened to her. </p><p>She passed next to me on her way to the carriage, but not before leaving a soft whisper. “Find me tonight, heretic,” she whispered. She didn’t risk adding anything else, clearly trying to avoid the attention of the guards. </p><p>She didn’t need to. Her status as a prisoner — or a slave — along with the fact that she kept my secret — was enough to convey the deal. She wanted my help. Interesting, but not as interesting as the fact that, apparently, she was a prisoner. </p><p>It was daring to keep a sorceress prisoner, and it was even daring to actually use her as a servant, sent to work.  </p><p>Ultimately, I didn’t spend too much time thinking about that, because ultimately, I could just ask her how she was being kept as a prisoner despite her power. Not because I was curious, because I had no other option. She didn’t even need to threaten me with violence, or try to implement a dangerous spell while trying to heal me to force my compliance. </p><p>I wished that was her leverage. That, I could resolve easily. </p><p>All she needed to do was to reveal that I was a mage, and things would be over. Still, making a deal with her was just tempting enough to make escaping the less palatable choice despite the unknown. </p><p>Helpless, I joined the guards as we walked away, wondering why she called me a heretic. </p>",

    "content": "<p>With the little game with the princess over, I decided to pay a visit to my favorite blacksmith, not just to have a detailed discussion with her about today’s findings and possible ways to optimize tools to store Divine Spark, but also to finally add her as a companion. </p><p>Our relationship had progressed significantly from the days I was afraid that achievement might alert her that I wasn’t completely normal. At this point, even discounting the physical aspect of our relationship, I was her only reliable ally. Also, more importantly, I finally had enough Divine Spark to actually fuel the companion process. </p><p>I still had doubts whether Divine Spark was actually fueling it, or it was a complicated trick to force me to work for the System, but that was an issue for a future time. </p><p>At this point, sneaking through Hall of Crafting was trivial, especially since the place was crawling with unfamiliar faces, helping the usual workers. After the battle, the school required a lot of supplies, weapons, potions, and much other stuff. </p><p>When I arrived at the warehouse deep underground that Oeyne appropriated as her residence, I was already smiling with anticipation. With a flick of my wrist, I opened the door, revealing the beautiful, caramel-skinned beauty on the other side of the door, busy scribbling something on her work desk. </p><p>When she turned to check the door, she was alarmed. Understandable, as the feeling of losing the protections around one’s residence wasn’t a comfortable feeling, but her fear was replaced by a coy smile when she has noticed it was me who broke in. </p><p>I said nothing, just smiled as I walked forward, enjoying her enthusiastic expression even as the door slammed behind me. </p><p>“Hey,” she murmured as I stood next to her. </p><p>I was planning to focus on her body, to jumpstart the fun process of improving the Companion Process, when the designs on the table caught my attention, one, for some reason, felt very familiar, but I failed to pin the exact source. “What’s this?” I asked. </p><p>“Just another order from the Princess,” she grumbled in annoyance. “They have a lot of harebrained designs they want me to work on. They have too much time and money on their hand if they want to waste my time with those.” </p><p>“Are they that bad?” I asked even as I cycled through her designs, trying to pin why it was feeling that familiar. And the fact I wasn’t able to pin the source of the familiarity despite my System-boosted Intelligence was weird. </p><p>“Technically, no,” Oeyne admitted. “As far as I could see, the theory behind them is solid, but their initial assumptions for those designs are simply ridiculous. It simply assumes a very different environment. It’s like assuming rocks are is replaced by air. Most of the designs are too fragile, simply leaking mana.” </p><p>“How interesting,” I whispered. “And do they want you to fix the leaking issue?” </p><p>“That’s the interesting part, no. They want me to ignore the leaking issues, and focus on other aspects.” </p><p>“And how many of those designs have you completed for our glorious princess.” </p><p>“A few,” she gasped, which might be about the sharp nature of my voice. Although, it might be also about my wandering hand, landing on her shoulder. A subtle, gentle touch, but I didn’t blame her for reacting with a gasp. Not with her previous experience, well aware of how it would progress. </p><p> “Be more accurate, sweetie,” I murmured even as my fingers slid down. “You’re an artisan, I expect you to be more accurate.” </p><p>She paused for a second, her breathing getting labored, though it was more excitement than nervousness, her impressive bosom swelling even more. While she considered the question, my hands cupped the fullness of her breasts, softly squeezing them. </p><p>“They have given me a lot of initial designs, hundreds,” she answered even as my fingers found her nipples, teasing them slowly. “However, most of those designs have similarity, a dozen or so categories if we group the similar ones.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said as alternated between mauling her breasts and teasing her nipples, interrupting her explanation with moans. “And you have delivered any result to them?” </p><p>“Just the initial conjecture, nothing useful. Not that any of them could be used in the first place.” </p><p>“Never do that again without talking to me,” I whispered in a playful yet threatening tone. With the mysterious levels Delia gained, I would prefer to maintain control of the information flow, just in case. She nodded. “Good,” I whispered.</p><p>I could have asked her more questions about the design, but I decided against it. It was clear that Oeyne was treating them as a thought experiment, suggesting she didn’t have any worthwhile conclusions. More importantly, I was on the edge of leveling up, which would make it much easier to analyze those designs.  </p><p>And, speaking of leveling up…  “Though, it still leaves your punishment…” I growled softly even as I waved my hand, once again creating a set of magical chains that wrapped around her limbs from the silver ingots lying around, and forcing her to fall on her knees. </p><p>[-782 Mana]</p><p>“You’re a harsh taskmaster—“ she gasped, unable to hide her enthusiasm before I silenced her, with the appropriate motion of sliding my shaft into her beautiful mouth. </p><p>The dance of her tongue around it was simply heavenly, especially since I was feeling backed up after the extended, yet ultimately fruitless sexy massage sessions with the dragon, my new mistress. </p><p>I watched in enjoyment as Oeyne started working on my shaft, well aware of how to handle it well after our repeated fun adventures. I wrapped my fist around the base of my cock, pumping up and down, giving her momentary help. </p><p>Not for long, of course, as my hand soon moved forward, sliding through her thick hair instead before I pulled her closer, forcing her to devour more of it than she could immediately handle. Her resulting groans were simply delicious. </p><p>Meanwhile, I pulled my dagger with my empty hand, using it to slice her top off. Someone else might have reacted in fear, but Oeyne reacted to my aggression with increased enthusiasm with growing excitement. When she looked up, her chocolate eyes shining with desire, I met her gaze with a roguish smile, even as I cast a spell to disintegrate her leather pants and boots, leaving her panties as the only piece of clothing responsible for hiding her busty body. </p><p>And with her growing wetness, her panties hardly a paragon of effectiveness. </p><p>Oeyne continued her devouring, her hips parting to the limit as she struggled to take the whole length, the crown invading her tight throat. Her eyes widened as she pulled on the chains that were holding her motionless, failing to react against my forceful yet welcome treatment, moaning happily as her throat was forced to take it completely.  </p><p>“Take a deep breath, and just keep swallowing,” I whispered, my grin widening each passing second as the pleasure reached a new level. I could have continued until it reached a delicious conclusion, but that would mean I was missing a valuable opportunity to progress the companion process more. </p><p>[-64 Mana] </p><p>A simple spell was enough to change the alignment of the chains, until Oeyne was prone, floating at waist level as the chains held her up, providing me with the spectacular angle enjoy to partake the feast her beautiful body represented. </p><p>My grin widened further as I positioned myself behind her, ready to slip inside, her plump ass pointing at the ceiling. A stiff tug was enough to rip her panties, leaving her entrance naked. </p><p>She struggled against her chains, her moans mixing into the cracks of the conjured chains, forcing me to reinforce them to keep her. Once again, she was happy to be chained, but only if I could actually keep her chained with my own abilities. </p><p>[-591 Mana]</p><p>“Such a needy slut,” I whispered as I spanked her ass with my hand, earning a delicious moan. “Maybe I should punish you before the main event.” </p><p>“No —“ she gasped in shock, desire dripping down her voice, only to be interrupted as I conjured a ball gag on her pretty mouth, silencing her complaint. </p><p>My hand landed on her ass in a spank once more, and she flinched in desire, her wetness getting even thicker. </p><p>“Feel free to tell me if you have any complaints,” I mockingly even as I grabbed another piece of metal before flooding it with my mana, converting it to a paddle, and impressing Oeyne with the increase of my skills in the process. There was no harm in impressing her with my abilities, especially since their fascination seemed to impact Companion Process progression significantly. </p><p>[-318 Mana]</p><p>The newly-created paddle landed on a beautiful, plump ass, leaving a small bruise despite her spectacular Endurance. Even as she moaned, she tried to use her own mana to break her chains, only to fail spectacularly against the potency of my mana. She might be more skilled than me, but in a direct magical confrontation, she had no choice of victory. </p><p>Though, if the excitement in her muffled moans was any indicator, she clearly didn’t mind the rough treatment, enjoying her submissiveness. Not for the first time, I wondered she always had her submissive tendencies, or she developed them only after she had passed the level-twenty mark. It would have been ironic if the letter was the case, realizing that she had gotten off by physically dominated only after her physical abilities reached a point that made it nearly impossible. </p><p>After all, to dominate someone, it wasn’t enough to just be stronger than someone. One needed to be stronger by a wide margin, especially counting her blacksmithing expertise, making most of the magical items useless as well — even if someone risked the destruction of an expensive magical item just for a night of fun in the first place. </p><p>“You’re so lucky I’m here to give you what you want,” I whispered as I caressed her ass gently before another spank landed. “Are you ready for the main event?” </p><p>With her gag, she was only able to let out a muffled moan, but it was clearly a yes. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured as I positioned myself to her entrance, ready to slide in… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 494110 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 6923 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, what is your exact plan to repair the spear?” Delia asked, unaware of the groundbreaking, shocking detail I was trying to process after discovering her precious secret, or if she noticed, she had written it off as a reaction to her sudden hug. Though, when she kept her hand on my shoulder, her body close enough for my arm to rub against her chest, I started leaning toward the second case. </p><p>She was clearly using it to distract me further as I explained it. </p><p>Luckily, I had no problem using her strategy for my particular needs, especially with the System fueled by Divine Spark once more. I put my arm around her waist, equally casually, and pulled her closer against my body. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>“It’s going to be a complicated affair, are you sure you want to exhaust your pretty mind with such useless stuff,” I said patronizingly. </p><p>Considering she had acquired several magical skills just to receive a more accurate explanation, I doubted my deflection was something she wanted. </p><p>I had no idea the method she had used to increase her level in such a radical manner, even changing her skill configuration in the process, but I was certain that it didn’t have a trivial cost. If it had been easy, she wouldn’t have reduced her level. </p><p>“I know,” she murmured sensually, letting me hug her even tighter, showing her determination to use the seduction route, making it a delicious twist to my usual operating principle. “Still, Her Highness asked me to get a detailed explanation, and I can’t violate her orders. You wouldn’t let me get scolded, would you?” </p><p>“Of course not,” I said as I touched her chin gently, examining her pouty lips that formed a smile that begged for a long, lingering kiss. “It would be a pity for such a beautiful face to show sadness.” </p><p>My flirty sentence didn’t affect her in any way, of course, as I delivered it deliberately badly. A little pause between words and a slightly misaligned emphasis was all that needed to destroy the charm of a cute sentence. </p><p>She reacted as it did. “Thanks, you’re my savior,” she said, exaggerating even more. Meanwhile, her fingers were dancing on my arm softly, selling the idea of closeness. I leaned forward just to test her, curious how far she would push herself. </p><p>She waited until inches separated our lips before turning her head, letting that kill land on her cheek, a convincing seductive smile on her face, promising much more in a near future. Of course, I had no doubt that that near future would turn to a nebulous destination that would get far away more and more. </p><p>A true challenge.  </p><p>“Of course I am,” I said, pushing my chest proudly, leaning hard on the pompous, vain personality I had created for them. “I’m always the best.” </p><p>“So, about the way you would repair the spear?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, it’s not a final strategy, as the new tools give me some interesting options I need to consider,” I murmured. “However, the core strategy is similar. First, I need to align the fragments of its internal arrays…” I started, giving a complicated explanation, once again relying on a lot of obscure theories just like I had done before, but this time, I tried to be as accurate as possible. </p><p>Unlike the last time, she had the skills to understand what I was talking about, forcing me to be even more careful. I didn’t have the option to blame her for misunderstanding some basic concepts, or lacking fundamentals. </p><p>Not that it was a big problem for me. It would have taken me less than five minutes to concisely explain every single detail, but one thing stopped me from doing so. I noticed a slight tightening on the corner of her mouth, suggesting she was feeling a strain. </p><p>Maybe maintaining those high levels was even harder than I assumed. </p><p>So, rather than going directly, I deliberately kept the explanation long-winded, mixed with long breaks where I bragged pointlessly about my own genius to kill even more time. She asked me clarifying questions, but they didn’t help her as much as she hoped. </p><p>Posing as a pompous, self-absorbed idiot with the sensibility of an unwashed piece of rock worked wonders in the current situation. </p><p>I didn’t waste that time, of course. Even as I explained, I started walking around the room, checking and testing the tools, though I avoided paying attention to the wards, not to her presence. </p><p>However, even as I examined the tools, most of my attention was on her. I observed her throughout my explanation, watching the outward signals of her tenseness to understand how the strain was affecting her. </p><p>When we hit an hour mark, and she was still listening without an explicit attempt to stop me, I decided that whatever she was using could easily last hours, though whether she could last more than a day was hard to guess. </p><p>[+700 Experience] </p><p>Her occasional flashes of skin bequeathed me with experience kept the long-winded explanation entertaining, at least for me. I was tempted to push for more experience, at least more than glances on her intentional flashes and casual touches, as I had missed the sensation of rapid leveling, </p><p>“I think that’s enough,“ she said as she stood up, declaring her surrender against my delaying tactics. I wondered whether the strain of the process or the boringness of my bragging finally broke her patient resistance. </p><p> “But I was just going to explain how I solved the interference problem between rotating arrays when —“ I said, doing my best to look disappointed. The expression of shock on her face was very amusing. </p><p>“No need!” she answered in panic, only to realize her mistake when she noticed my — fake — frown. “I mean, I need to talk with the princess, and your explanations are more than enough to satisfy her. We can talk later.” </p><p>And with that, she left, but not before hugging me one last time, and whispering her thanks. </p><p>I was tempted to follow her, curious about the mystery behind her sudden power-up, but I was surrounded by too many wards to make sneaking away from a viable option. Staying hidden was much hidden when people didn’t simply dismiss my presence as a servant. </p><p>Luckily, I had a lot of things to go, I thought even as I grabbed a magical chisel, using it to get a sliver of metal from the spear. </p><p>[-63 Mana]</p><p>I had enhanced the strength behind my hit with a spell, because there was no chance that wards in the room weren’t examining my activities, one way or another. And even if there was none, there was no harm in acting safely. </p><p>Then, I threw the metal sliver into an alchemical crucible, throwing as much as fire mana the item could handle to melt it, so that I could properly analyze its material composition. </p><p>[-430 Mana]</p><p>Using almost a thousand mana in the process was excessive, aggressively so, but it wasn’t something I had decided randomly. No, it was the perfect excuse to fill the room with my own mana, which gave me an innocent reason to directly interact with the wards without alerting them. </p><p>And just like that, I started a combined analysis session, splitting my attention between examining the nature of the wards that surrounded the room very thoroughly along with the alchemical analysis of the structure of the metal of the spear. </p><p>Neither task was simple, and together, they were enough to strain my Intelligence and Wisdom to the limit. Especially since I was analyzing the wards, again and again, to make sure I had missed nothing critical. Minutes turned into hours, and I started sweating. </p><p>[-1291 Mana]</p><p>For once, it wasn’t a fake reaction. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t a waste. In terms of analyzing the nature of the spear, I had made significant progress, especially identifying the nature of the metal that had been used. While it wasn’t complete, I was confident I could create some more of that magical alloy. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same luck didn’t apply to the wards around the room. It seemed that, by using the excuse of creating the best room I requested, they had used an impressive number of wards to check the room. Voice detection, mana sensitivity, movement… Some were there to make sure the spear was never removed from the room, the others designed to observe the movement of the occupants, each designed with several redundancies. </p><p>It didn’t mean they were unbreakable, of course. I could dismantle them in less than an hour without triggering any of the embedded traps, but it wouldn’t work if there was anyone that was actively observing the room. </p><p>Simply brute-forcing would have been easier. </p><p>When the end of the day reached, I felt a touch annoyed about the waste of time. The great number of equipment reduced the time I needed to analyze the spear, but not as much as it would have been if I was able to freely spend my mana without alerting my observers.</p><p>Especially since it was my request that forced me into this situation.  </p><p>Still, it was not a complete waste, as the mysterious condition of my escort was much more interesting to resolve. I opened the door and gestured to the guard. “I’m almost finished. Can you call Lady Delia so I can give her a report?”</p><p>“As you wish, sir,” the guard said and walked away, leaving me with anticipation. However, a minute later, the guard had returned, a stiff expression on his face. “I’m sorry sir, but it seems that Lady Delia has to join a very important meeting, but I had been informed that she would love to have lunch tomorrow.” </p><p>I just nodded as I followed the guard outside, wondering whether it was just a seduction ploy, maintaining the distance, or she was dealing with the aftermath of her power-up. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 494110 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 7750 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“M-maybe we should wait until she’s finished with the bath,” Penny whispered, but did nothing to prevent me from pulling down her pants and underwear, leaving her curvy body completely bare. </p><p>“Nonsense, there’s no need to waste time, it’s big enough for all three of us. And we all deserve a long, relaxing soak after the day we had,” I whispered back. Luckily, her whisper was too soft to be heard from the bathroom, especially with the interference from the running water. I dragged my finger across her stomach, pulling back just as my fingers caressed the edge of her core. “Now, undress me.” </p><p>Her verbal reluctance was nowhere to be seen when her hands landed on my body, helping me divest from my clothing with great urgency. And if there was one thing that could energize a tired body after an exhausting day of work, it was the touch of a naked blonde as she hurriedly divested me of all my clothing. </p><p>Especially with the sight of a redhead undressing in the other room. Nancy was doing her best to look nonchalant, but I didn’t miss her beautiful trembles in the process. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I whispered to Penny after she finished removing my clothes, and grabbed her waist. The sight of a naked Nancy hardly helped Penny to calm down after their little adventure on the lakeshore, but she was far too submissive to extract herself from my grasp. </p><p>Nancy was quick to slip in the water, and I followed her a moment later, sitting directly across her. Penny moved to sit next to me. “Sit here, otherwise we won’t fit,” I said even as I pulled her on my lap, earning a beautiful moan as she landed on my lap. </p><p>Nancy shared a frustrated glare, but that didn’t prevent her gaze from lingering on Penny’s beautiful tits. The water was deep enough to reach Nancy’s shoulders, but Penny was sitting on the elevated platform of my body. With her decent height, her breasts stayed out, giving Nancy a constant reminder. </p><p>With my shaft under her, teasing her core from outside, Penny didn’t need any additional visual aid. </p><p>Still, even with the comforting weight of the sexy Penny, I gave myself a moment to relax. The warm water was an excellent way to sap away our exhaustion, and the girls looked incredible their naked bodies were barely hidden by the constant bubbles of the hot tub. </p><p>“So, Nancy, how was your first day as a professional model,” I asked teasingly. </p><p>“Boring,” she answered dismissively, but the exaggeration was enough to reflect her discomfort. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said. “Are you telling me you didn’t enjoy being on display for the whole day, making little boys mad with desire?” </p><p>“Clearly,” she grunted. </p><p>“I see,” I said as I leaned forward a bit, bringing my lips near Penny’s ears. “It’s your fault, you know?” I asked, though I was unable to resist the temptation of looking down even as I whispered, enjoying the sight of her floating breasts. </p><p>“W-what do you mean?” Penny stammered, still spectacularly shy after everything we have done. </p><p>“As the more experienced model, it’s your job to keep the first day entertaining for your partner, of course. But you didn’t even notice she was not engaged. You could have entertained her … somehow, right?” </p><p>Penny failed to answer, somehow managing to blush at my words even more than her activities. </p><p>Nancy snickered. </p><p>“Look, you’re making the amateur laugh at you, you need to be better,” I admonished, adding just enough sharpness to my tone, which was enough to make Nancy look down in defeat. “What are we going to do with your shyness?” I murmured, while Nancy’s smirk widened at Penny’s perceived misfortune. </p><p>“Maybe you should make her walk the corridors naked,” Nancy offered smugly. “It’ll cure her alright.” </p><p>I stayed silent for a moment, which was enough to make Penny tremble in fear. “A touch too excessive,” I murmured, then hit Nancy with a smirk. “But maybe you should help her, since you’re the brave one.” </p><p>“Help her, how?” Nancy answered tense, realizing where I was leading, but once again, her pride prevented her from responding properly. </p><p>“Penny, go and kiss her,” I ordered, then turned to Nancy, who looked ready to bolt out of the bath. “If you can handle it, of course.” </p><p>Nancy’s eyes widened, but that didn’t affect the sudden stubbornness, once again pride ensuring her fall. She said nothing, and, despite her shyness, Penny was quick to follow my orders, and leaned forward, vacating my lap. </p><p>Normally, it would be a sad turn of the affair, but considering it presented me with the sight of two beautiful, naked girls kissing, it wasn’t exactly a disaster. And the fact that she lunged forward, giving me the sight of her glistening ass, water drops sliding down slowly, was even better. </p><p>Amazing, I thought as I leaned back, enjoying the luxury of the moment. Here I was, in a very expensive hotel room, enjoying the hot tub accompanied by two beautiful models enthusiastic to prove themselves. The only thing that was missing was the huge salary I was receiving, but even that was slowly being resolved. </p><p>Their lack of experience made the moment even more charming.</p><p>Penny completed covering the small distance, and her hands landed on Nancy’s shoulder to keep her balance as she leaned forward, which had the added benefit of pinning her in place. As she got nearer and nearer, Nancy started to get nervous, realizing that, despite her shyness, was not going to stop. </p><p>Ironically, her surprise was the thing that surprised me. After everything that happened in the morning, the fact that After the morning, the fact that Penny had the courage the kiss her despite their deficient clothing shouldn’t be something new. </p><p>“Maybe—“ Nancy murmured, but that was all she was able to let out before their lips met. The kiss itself was soft and lingering, one that would have been boringly tame if they weren’t beautifully naked. </p><p>“Good start,” I whispered even as I touched Penny’s beautiful ass, caressing its expanse to give Penny some extra encouragement. “Now, some tongue.” </p><p>The widening of Nancy’s eyes was enough to signal that Penny was quick to follow my order, carrying the kiss to the next level. And I rewarded her with the movement of my finger, dancing around her wetness. </p><p>A beautiful gasp escaped Penny’s mouth, only to be suppressed by Nancy, who was starting to respond to the kiss hesitantly, her confusion and shyness apparent. </p><p>There was one thing I liked against Nancy, that she had a tendency to lash out when she faced something that ashamed her, especially when said emotional distress was caused by someone that she treated as her lesser, a category that definitely included Penny. </p><p>This time, her reaction came in the form of wandering hands, landing on Penny’s beautiful breasts, squeezing. Quite hard, if Penny’s pained gasp was any indicator. It was clear retaliation for Penny’s daring, enhanced further by the shame she was feeling for her own reaction — something that was clear since the morning. </p><p>The sight of her fingers disappearing into Penny’s oversized bust made the moment even more spectacular. </p><p>Penny’s obedience deserved a reward, which came in the form of a finger slipping into her wetness. She stilled for a moment before exploding into faster action. She grabbed Nancy’s hair as she deepened the kiss, her hips rocking, trying to devour my fingers in the process. </p><p>“Faster,” I said with a chuckle even as I added a second finger. “I can see that Nancy likes that immensely.” </p><p>My words earned an angry yet muffled growl from Nancy, but not enough to stop making her back from the kiss. Whether it was her pride that was keeping her there, or her pleasure, was a question. Though, from her naked body flushing with excitement, it might be inferred that it was the latter option. </p><p>I maintained my position for a fleeting moment as my fingers continued to dance inside Penny’s tight entrance, enjoying the sight of their erotic embrace, getting sexier each passing moment. </p><p>“Do you think you had enough of a show?” Nancy growled when Penny pulled for a momentary breath, trying to sound sharp, but clearly, she was lashing out. </p><p>“Nope,” I answered shamelessly as I spanked Penny’s amazing ass, which was all that was required for her to kiss her once again. </p><p>However, this time it wasn’t the only thing she had to deal with. I had decided to punish her earlier disobedience by repositioning my leg. She trembled as my foot sneaked upward, teasing her inner thighs as it moved upward before arriving at her core. </p><p>The soft caress around her knob hardly helped her to contain her pleasure, especially when one of Penny’s hands disappeared underwater, assaulting her less generous — yet still spectacular — breasts in revenge. </p><p>My initial intent was to push them until they had been overwhelmed by their shyness. However, watching Penny’s sensuous body dancing inches away from me, it was hard to stay true to that particular decision. </p><p>So, I stood up on my knees, water dripping down my shaft. It didn’t earn any reaction from the girls considering they were busy with each other’s lips, but Penny realized something changed when I pulled my fingers out of her. </p><p>She moaned when I pressed my shaft against her entrance, showing that she understood what was about to commence… </p><p>And she was very happy about it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Are we going to walk again?” my guide asked as we left my room. “Shouldn’t we take the carriage?” </p><p>“No. My car had a little accident,” I answered, dismissing the nature of it. I wasn’t in the mood of explaining my teammate’s little temper tantrum was the cause of it. </p><p>At least until I make him pay. </p><p>“Your smile is really scary.” said my guide. “Is something wrong?” </p><p>“The weather is a bit chilly,” I deflected letting myself enjoy my revenge fantasies. </p><p>Still, it wasn’t all bad. The long walk between the tournament and my dorm was an excellent way to test the impact of my newest Traits, the first physical ones I had received. </p><p>And, after a fast jog that brought me to the tournament building, I was ready to call the first test a success. My conditioning was good enough to run that distance in the first place, and it was too cold to get sweaty, but my breathing wasn’t as fast as it would have been. </p><p>And, to make it better, the exhaustion I had managed to accumulate disappeared quicker. My newest Traits were working well. </p><p>As far as I could tell, at least, as a gentle jog was hardly the most precise measure of endurance, something that was difficult to measure without some very complicated equipment.</p><p>My guide made no mention of my increased performance, though whether she didn’t realize my extra Traits, or she didn’t mention them because they weren’t worthy of her attention was difficult to determine. I didn’t dare to ask her, not wanting to reveal my ability to trigger the developments without her attention. </p><p>With her spotty memory and dubious intent, keeping her information limited was the best idea. </p><p>“You’re here, again,” said someone, a familiar voice even, pulling me out of my thoughts.</p><p>It was the raven-haired girl that had tried to kick me out of the tournament, thinking I was there for a prank as well. </p><p>“I have games to win,” I said, not bothering to hide my attitude, and testing the other Trait I had received in the process. Seduction. </p><p>“Of course I’m here,” I said as I smirked at her, trying to look attractive. I wasn’t a blushing virgin when it came to ladies, but I wasn’t exactly classically handsome. Combined with my less-than-stellar personality — something I could admit to myself — I wasn’t the type of man that could charm women with a suggestive smirk. </p><p>The subtle blush that spread on her face suggested that, with my newest traits, I might have more success impersonating James Bond going forward. She raised her hand to fix her glasses, using them to calm herself down. Even then, when she tried to speak, she stuttered. </p><p>The Seduction Trait was working even better than I expected. Despite her initial distaste toward me, I managed to earn a good blush. Of course, it wasn’t all the Trait. I might not be very handsome, but I was tall and muscular, which didn’t hurt. </p><p>“I didn’t mean it like that. I was talking about why you’re here, playing chess?” she managed to say after a moment. She raised her phone, which showed a picture of me — with a surprising amount of likes, showing me at the party, being thrown around by my teammates. “You told me you weren’t a football player.” </p><p>Normally, I would have reacted badly against anyone that was trying to push into my deal without any reason, but like many other things in life, cute girls received certain advantages others didn’t. “I said. And yesterday, I wasn’t a player,” I said. </p><p>“Do you expect me to believe that?” </p><p>I shrugged, hitting her with another crooked smile. “Believe whatever you want to believe, beautiful,” I said as I continued to walk, leaving the stuttering cutie behind me, the smile working especially well with her obvious inexperience with being flirted. </p><p>When I entered the building, however, I realized I was at the center of the attention, even worse than the day before. Yesterday, the attention was limited to dirty looks. Today, it was filled with shocked whispers, giggles, and angry glares. A glorious cacophony. </p><p>I was having my fifteen minutes of fame. </p><p>Before, I would have hated the attention. Yes, messing with a rich boy at the party had been enjoyable, but the sudden celebrity status destroyed my carefully crafted dark, mysterious persona. There were a lot of envious gazes, but none of them carried the hesitation they had the day before. </p><p>Of course, with their jealous gossip fueling my supernatural powers literally, I was willing to sacrifice the nebulous benefit of the intimidation — especially since it didn’t work against the better players in the first place. </p><p>I ignored the whispers and checked the schedule, while the other players moved around. I visited the bathroom to wash my face before arriving at the table. </p><p>My opponent was already on the table, watching me with narrowed eyes, though I could see the confidence in his gaze, along with clear dismissal. Someone leaned toward him to whisper something, and while he answered, I saw him mouthing an answer, reading his lips enough to realize he mentioned me being a football player. </p><p>The dismissive scoff that followed perfectly conveyed his feelings. </p><p>I smiled, happy with being underestimated as always. It wasn’t as good as the opponent falling in pieces in fear, but it was better than a calm opponent. </p><p>Especially with mutual prejudice between nerds the jocks, somehow helping me in both cases. </p><p>I sat down, enjoying the tense atmosphere, even as my opponent tried to glare at me oppressively. Though, the lack of effect didn’t seem to bother him in the slightest. </p><p>“Ready for a fun game, little boy,” I said, talking louder than my usual, even making sure to hold the pieces a bit incompetently. </p><p>“I’m ready,” he said. “I’m not going to lose to a jumped-up bully, you can’t scare me like you did the others.” By those words, he proved that not only he didn’t watch my games before, but also, hearing that I was a football player, he clearly developed a misunderstanding about what my reputation meant. </p><p>I shrugged. “Whatever you wish, nerd,” I said, having absolutely no problem using it as an insult I had been the target just the night before. </p><p>The insult killed the conversation, until the referee arrived and started the game. </p><p>For the first game, I was the white, and started with a kingside opening, with a challenging approach in mind. One of the Traits I had received was Strategy, and while I didn’t have the time to test and understand how it differed from Tactics, the name itself suggested that it was more about managing the general flow of the game. </p><p>Of course, Strategy wasn’t the only trait I had received. The Tactics had been increased by a point as well, making it much easier to adapt to my opponent’s counter-plays, making the game much easier. </p><p>Twenty plays into the game, my opponent had long lost his smugness, replaced by the growing irritation. I wondered if he realized I had been sacrificing a few pawns for little value, just to extend the game. </p><p>He still believed he would win, unaware of the complicated trap I was setting. A trap that included six pieces spread across the board, one that was too complicated for me to implement the day before. </p><p>The new Trait was really paying for itself. </p><p>When I finally launched the trap, I didn’t neglect to look shocked, like I had just come across a happy coincidence. “Lucky win,” he growled as he realized the first game was gone. </p><p>He started the second game, confident in his ability to reverse the flow. </p><p>“Enough playtime,” I said mockingly, which was technically deserved a penalty if he called a referee, but he was convinced in his ability to reverse the game. He ignored my move, taking a deep breath before pushing his knight forward, determined to acquire a quick victory, before the game bogged down, giving me another ‘lucky’ victory. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, despite my mocking tone, I was quite determined to actually take him down, a change he realized barely ten moves into the game. </p><p>But even that was too late. Three more moves, and he found himself in a deadly fork, losing a rook for nothing, and from there, it turned into an avalanche, burying him under it. </p><p>“How?” he murmured, but in his eyes, I could see the defeat settling in. He had already lost before playing the third game. And it turned out to be a formality, barely lasting twenty moves before he surrendered, stumbling away from the table. </p><p>“The assassin struck again,” I heard one of the observers murmuring, and as I walked to the restroom, there were significantly fewer mentions of football and more mentions of my annoying style of play. </p><p>It was hard to argue with the results. </p><p>The semifinal game went in a surprisingly smooth manner, as the player I was facing was even weaker than the one I had just defeated, so I didn’t bother with the mind games. I just played a standard game, testing my extended chess abilities, taking an easy victory. </p><p>Then, it was time to final for the tournament. However, when I noticed my opponent, I couldn’t help but smirk widely. </p><p>It was the same girl that accosted me at the entrance twice. </p>",

It would be hard to be noticed by anyone that wasn’t looking into my eyes. </p><p>Even as a kid, I was never the one that was quick to explode when angered, punching and shouting. Nor I was the forgive-and-forget type. No, I was the little vindictive shit one that pushed the desire to take revenge down, let it cool down until a suitable opening appeared, before the responsible pay. </p><p>It might not be healthy, but it was certainly cathartic. </p><p>Still, my habits didn’t make suppressing the initial flood of anger any easier. A hot shower and a cold beer, however, made it easier. Though, easier didn’t mean easy, I realized. </p><p>I found myself laying on the bed, tossing and turning, sleep proved elusive. Whenever I closed my eyes, the ruined memories of my car popped into my sight. It wasn’t that I loved my car. It was little more than the garbage that miraculously managed to work. </p><p>But it was my garbage. It was not for a rich asshole to destroy. </p><p>With sleep proving elusive, I decided to call back my guide, deciding that if I was going to struggle to sleep, I might as well listen to the annoying buzz of the mysterious being that threatened my whole understanding of how the world worked. </p><p>And her leather-clad beauty was always a bonus. </p><p>“You can come out,” I said loudly as I shifted in my bed. Unfortunately, that amazing, genius plan didn’t work. “Miss angel?” I said, followed by a few alternate statements, but none of them worked. I wondered whether she was ignoring me, or she lacked the ability to hear me in the first place. </p><p>“Hey, it is Zeus, inviting us for dinner,” I tried. If she was able to hear me, it was enough to anger her, or at least, earn a reaction. </p><p>Unfortunately, silence followed. </p><p>Oh, how I wished to dismiss everything as a bad dream, that there was no angel forcing me to follow a nebulous objective. Unfortunately, the notable jump in my skills went a long way of confirming otherwise. I tried to think of several phrases to bring her forward, they failed as well.</p><p>“Maybe meditation would help,” I thought. It worked in movies. It wasn’t something I made a habit of doing since I wasn’t a bored housewife, but extreme times needed extreme measures. </p><p>So, I sat down, doing my best to cross my legs, taking deep breaths, trying to be introspective. The lingering anger hardly helped, the sight of my ruined car popping on my sight. If I was able to sleep, I would have stopped the attempt and slept, to be fresh and ready for the tournament. </p><p>However, since I wasn’t able to sleep in the first place, I might as well spend it on something useful. Thanks to my — forced — patience, several minutes later, I managed to feel … something. </p><p>Two things, I was forced to be accurate. It wasn’t a clear feeling, a weird mix of trying to remember a slipping dream and identifying the source of a glow in a thick mist. </p><p>Two sources felt different, though explaining their difference was even harder than touching them in the first place. The best I could distinguish them was by classifying them as living and mechanical. </p><p>I took a wild guess, and assumed the living one was my absentminded guide, and the mechanical one was the System. </p><p>I decided to reach the mechanical first, which, interestingly, worked much easier than I expected. After a minute of concentration, something clicked, like finding the light switch in the darkness. </p><p>And suddenly, some more writing popped into my view. </p><p>[Seduction I, acquired]</p><p>[Taunt I, acquired]</p><p>“Okay,” I murmured, more than a bit surprised by the sudden flood of writing. I certainly wasn’t expecting to trigger the System that easily, considering that the whole reason I had a guide in the first place was to help me. </p><p>And that was not the only surprise. The name of Heroic trait had given me the impression that they were about grand achievements, amazing deeds, and the impression they left on the audience. The inclusion of seduction proved that it wasn’t some residual from the tournament. </p><p>I certainly didn’t expect the events of the party to qualify to grant me Heroic Traits. </p><p>It wasn’t an exaggeration to say it changed every single plan that was dancing in my mind in embryonic form. </p><p>I didn’t try to reach the other light in the mists of my mind, which, at this point, was sure that it would awaken my scatter-brained guide. I wanted to think about the implications without actually getting distracted by her chatter. </p><p>Maybe I should just try to be a reality TV industry, if a scandal suddenly gave me some bonus. A laugh escaped my mouth as I lay on my bed again, my anger disappearing in the amusing idea of somehow becoming an ancient Greek god by dominating third-page news. </p><p>Though, it might not be as ridiculous as it sounded. Maybe there was a reason for the stories about Zeus’ endless scandals. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t just run it through my guide — and not just because she wasn’t here right now. I had a feeling she wouldn’t react well to my plan to copy Zeus’ playbook.  </p><p>With my mind on the implications of my latest discovery, my anger was quick to take the backseat. I fell asleep thinking plans… </p><p>Something I only noticed when my alarm blared, waking me up for the second and the last day of the tournament. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as a splitting headache hit, the kind that I never felt before, even when I decided a bottle of cheap vodka was the perfect pre-bed drink. It was easy to guess the source. The headache gave me the same weird sensation I had felt when I achieved while meditating. </p><p>Only a hundred times worse. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to reach the same space, but with the pressure acting as a guide, it was much easier to find that mental place. It was the same blurred reach, like the lights through the mist, but this time, one of them, the one that didn’t trigger the System, was glowing like an out-of-control forest fire. </p><p>It confirmed one thing. It wasn’t that easy to get rid of her. </p><p>However, before summoning her back, I touched the System part again. Not that I expected anything to happen, just for practice…</p><p>Which was why I was surprised when it was triggered again, only to receive an endless wall of text. </p><p>[Seduction II, acquired]</p><p>[Stamina I, acquired]</p><p>[Recovery I, acquired]</p><p>[Tactics II, acquired]</p><p>[Strategy I, acquired]</p><p>“What the fuck,” I murmured even as the text flood filled my sight. What had happened when I was sleeping? </p><p>Unfortunately, the horrible headache I was feeling prevented me from thinking about it. I mentally reached the out-of-control glow of my guide, and a touch later, she appeared. </p><p>She looked around in confusion while my headache started to go down, but didn’t disappear immediately. “Is it morning already?” she asked, confirming one important thing. She either didn’t have a perception of time when she disappeared, effectively freezing her, or she had a warped perception of time. </p><p>“It took me a while to discover how to call you,” I said, and before she could say anything, I dashed into the bathroom, knowing she would be too shy to follow. </p><p>Under the warm flow of water, the pain started to disappear slowly. And as soon as I was able to focus on my thoughts. Unlike the last night, I didn’t understand where the improvements came from. After all, I was sleeping. Hardly the time to deliver great achievements. And two Traits, Stamina and Recovery, made it even more confusing. </p><p> However, I received my first clue when I stepped out of the bathroom — already dressed not to freak out my guide. My phone screen was filled with hundreds of notifications, and when I checked it, I realized my social media pages, which might as well have been a desert as far as a number of friends and followers had concerned, had turned into a circus. </p><p>Dozens of tagged photos from the party, each with chains of comments, and hundreds of new followers. Okay, I thought with a murmur. Maybe my poorly-thought plan of being a reality-TV star wasn’t as bad as I first assumed. </p><p>Still, there was one surprising thing. I could understand where the seduction boost came from, and even the boost for Tactics and Pattern Recognition was understandable, as a great part of the social media buzz was about me being a super-smart chess player. </p><p>Hardly accurate, not that I was going to bother about abusing that misconception once more. </p><p>However, the sudden Stamina and Recovery Traits had surprised me. They hardly made sense. Yes, I had done my best during the training, but it had been about that, I would have received that during the earlier boost. </p><p>“Are you ready for the tournament?” my guide asked with her usual enthusiasm. </p><p>“Sure,” I murmured even as I put my shoes on, ready for a long walk, going through the posts to catch up. </p><p>Then, I came across one post that explained it. This time, it was not a photo, but a screenshot of Megan’s message to a friend. </p><p>A long, rather descriptive message that went into great detail about how amazing in bed I had been for hours and hours, and how Kevin couldn’t even hold a candle to my performance. </p><p>“Damn, that’s merciless,” I murmured even as I read through the message, a smile popping on my face. It was just sinking the dagger even deeper. </p><p>Despite the amazing benefits it gave me, I felt a little sorry for Kevin. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, that only lasted until I remembered the horrible death of my car, replaced with cruel satisfaction. </p><p>“Did you say something?” my guide asked, which incidentally confirmed she didn’t have perfect hearing. </p><p>“I said I’m feeling anxious to win a tournament and get some more traits,” I explained, a smile on my face. </p><p>I had work to do. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The interrogation was finally over, though it didn’t mean that Emma’s pleasure-filled ordeal was over. They were two distinct things. </p><p>“Let’s have some fun, stand up and walk toward the window,” I ordered as I pulled back, watching her attempt to follow my order with a smirk. </p><p>“N-now?” she managed to ask, her voice trembling with exhaustion. </p><p>“No, tomorrow,” I said even as I slapped her ass, which was enough to make her tremble. It took a while for her to follow my request, but I didn’t warn her. Her trembling legs were enough to show that it was more about the effects of her latest climax rather than a desire to rebel against my orders. </p><p>We were well past that point. </p><p>I could have ordered her to move faster, but I didn’t. Watching her stumbling among her fancy furniture, occasionally holding to maintain her balance, her pride — well, the scraps she had managed to maintain since her latest betrayal — destroyed under the assault of pleasure and shame. </p><p>It allowed me to enjoy the sight of her beautiful legs. </p><p>She said nothing when she finally arrived at the wall, pressing her hands against the wall, pushing her beautiful ass readily. Only then, I walked toward her, each step bringing me closer to her while her beautiful body continued to tremble with each step. </p><p>“Sorry to keep me waiting, honey,” I said as I leaned forward to whisper, my hand landing on the small of her back. A soft, tame touch, especially considering the circumstances. It even earned a surprised look from Emma. </p><p>A look that only lasted until she felt my mana invading her body, in particular her back door, lubricating and cleaning. “No-“ she gasped, though that didn’t last long, aborted by the finger that I slipped into her tight ass. </p><p>“Oh, honey, aren’t we well-past that in our beautiful relationship,” I said even as I added a second finger to the first. “Unless you want to force my hand and change my mind about being merciful about your latest slide. I’m sure you don’t want to go and screw things up.” </p><p>“No,” she gasped, quick to nod, which was a beautiful indication of her willpower, drained to nothingness after her betrayals put her in an even worse position. She didn’t say anything else, but her breathing, soft and deep, was the perfect accompaniment of the dance of my fingers. </p><p>Her earlier anger was nothing more than a momentary flare, long extinguished by the dance of my fingers. Meanwhile, my other hand danced on her other leg, gently squeezing. She let out a moan, pushing her ass out. </p><p>Giving me the perfect angle to push against her puckered hole, I removed my fingers, replacing them with my shaft in an instant. My fingers clasped around her hips as I pushed forward. She tried to say something, but it only came out as a pained muffle. </p><p>“Do you want to say something, doll,” I said even as I squeezed her breasts hard, extracting another cry. </p><p>“N-no,” she managed to stammer even as she squeezed her teeth. </p><p>“Rude,” I said mockingly as I slapped her ass. “I appreciate a full answer when I asked a question.” It was a halfhearted tease but I had more important things to focus on, like the way the sexy redhead was bent over in front of me, being invaded by my presence in her tight hole. </p><p>A moan escaped my lips as her presence tightened around my shaft, reaching a glorious level. “Damn, you’re delicious,” I murmured as I took her from behind mercilessly, picking up more and more speed. </p><p>She chose to say nothing, too occupied by suppressing her cries — an attempt that was rapidly getting impossible. Her cries exploded soon, filling the room. </p><p>“Delicious,” I repeated even as I tightened my grip around her hips, plowing her from behind, her legs forcing her to tiptoe just to keep the balance. I leaned forward a bit, enough for me to comfortably grab her tits again without losing any pacing. </p><p>It earned another set of muffled cries, mixing into the sound of our flesh, slapping and clapping. </p><p>Her cries intensified even further as I grabbed her shoulders, forcing her to stand straight, but not bothering to pull out. Thanks to our height difference, she was forced to stand on her toes, the angle forcing my shaft even deeper into her hole. “I didn’t expect you to take all in, impressive,” I whispered. “You should have been a dancer.” </p><p>It wasn’t exactly a question that required an urgent answer. But in her shock, she answered it nevertheless. “I have received some training, for more than a decade,” she answered, almost automatic. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured, surprised by her answer. “Why did you stop?” I asked. </p><p>That time, no answer came, so I slapped her bottom, hard enough to echo in the room. “I have discovered my magical talent,” she whispered softly. </p><p>“Really?” I murmured, surprised. “That late?” </p><p>“I was a late bloomer to get my magical talent,” she murmured, her shame was clear, far more than she felt being rammed repeatedly while being challenged for her betrayal. </p><p>“Interesting, I didn’t know that,” I said, which, shockingly, was actually true. That wasn’t a detail I knew, and I had used my agents to compile detailed dossiers on every single person that mattered, and Emma, as one of the strongest magical offensive talents, was a priority target. </p><p>Them missing such a detail would have earned my agents a horrible punishment if I still had my position as the Dark Lord. </p><p>Still, the fact that her family — a reasonably rich merchant family with no noble ties — decided to focus her on dancing training rather than focusing on abilities that would help her more. It only made sense if they were trying to groom her as some kind of concubine to a noble family, hoping to create a connection. </p><p>Because, a rich merchant family certainly wouldn’t need the money a dancer could make — though I didn’t miss the irony of the strongest woman in the Empire taking her position due to that exact need. </p><p>Maybe it was the reason for her ridiculously weak sense of loyalty, I realized with sudden enlightenment. It wouldn’t be easy to grow up with the realization that she was important to her family only as a marriage chip. </p><p>The dossier included a more detailed report on her after she had debuted as a young, genius mage — although their assumption that she had been being trained privately, not just discovered her talent late. With her talent, she had managed to get herself a place in the nobility, her family getting a reasonable bonus in the process. </p><p>However, the development was late enough in her life, which was enough to leave a lasting, bleeding impression that she could be abandoned if she wasn’t good enough — and the Queen, sidelining her the moment she wasn’t needed couldn’t have helped her insecurities in any way. </p><p> Ironically, however, that information still changed one thing. </p><p>Her importance. </p><p>If she had discovered her talent that late, yet reached to this level of power, her potential was even more exaggerated than her current achievements suggested — though I wondered if the others, like the Queen, was aware of that particular fact and deliberately suppressing her on that aspect as well, or they missed the importance of it in the first place. </p><p>And, unfortunately, the second case was also very likely. If there was one benefit in raiding the resources of many magical families, that I had access to more training resources than any single of them had, giving me a more comprehensive understanding of magical development. </p><p>Especially since I didn’t treat traditions as unbreakable tenets. </p><p>Of course, just because she had a reason for her betrayals and hid a potential even bigger than her potential didn’t change the fact that she was a serial betrayer. If it wasn’t for her particular habit, I would have talked to her about her true potential and started training her. </p><p>However, ignoring the implied potential grated my sensibilities worse than actual torture — and not the weak kind they had employed when I was first captured. I hadn’t earned my position by ignoring the potential upside of dubious resources. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t something I had to decide immediately, I thought even as I picked up speed, terminating our conversation with a fresh flood of pleasure. </p><p>“Naughty girl, dance for me,” I whispered. She looked at me, her gaze glazed with pleasure. Locked between my body and the wall, she didn’t exactly have the space to dance, but luckily, she wasn’t in a position to argue against the inaccuracies of my teasing. </p><p>Not when her face was invaded with a beautiful mixture of pleasure and resignation, joining her exhausted, battered state, almost enough to get my mercy. </p><p>Almost. </p><p>Instead, I chose to explode into her bowels mercilessly, triggering her climax along with it. Which, along with everything else, finally consumed her last scraps of stamina, and she collapsed against my body, already sleeping. </p><p>Filled with betrayals — and being filled — it had been a tough day for her. </p><p>For me, a new one was just starting. </p>",

And to his credit, he managed to look like he was happy with my victory, at least until I made a show of collapsing on my knees. </p><p>Before I could say anything, two guards arrived, carrying a stretcher with them to carry me.

I wasn’t the only gladiator he ‘owned’ and it would hardly help if the others realized their Lanista was not above actively plotting the death of his gladiators. </p><p>However, that expression of geniality was erased when he was in the infirmary with me, along with the healer. “How is he?” he asked in a stony tone. </p><p>“Very exhausted,” the healer said. “He needs at least a couple of days to recover even with my full focus.” </p><p>“Are you sure, because I remember you guaranteeing that he wouldn’t survive the potion?” Antonius said, his expression stony. The healer trembled, realizing the underlying threat. </p><p>“It was supposed to, but his body is stronger than I expected. Probably something about his barbarian heritage, maybe they had some kind of monster in their lineage. Otherwise, he couldn’t have survived, not with those wounds,” he said as he pointed at my still-bleeding wounds, still making no attempt to actually cure me, or even bandage me. </p><p>I wondered if Antonius decided to pull the plug, a decision that made me tense. Not that I was afraid of actually dying, but if they decide to do something like that, I would act, probably lethally. </p><p>Escaping from the capital as a slave after killing my so-called master was hardly the easiest thing, not to mention I would have to abandon everything I had worked for.</p><p>“How confident are you?” he asked. “Because your mistake already cost me a lot of money. Even your uncle’s favor can’t save you from another mistake.” </p><p>“I … I’m sure,” the healer managed to stammer even though he trembled in fear, clearly afraid of the implied threat. I might have even pitied him, if he wasn’t actively conspiring to kill me. Meanwhile, it was interesting to know that Antonius was actually betting against his own gladiators, adding an interesting twist to the game. </p><p>It would have been a shocking and unacceptable thing if it was known by the other Romans, as Colosseum was the center of the cultural activity, affecting the joys of every citizen, from plebians to patricians. The fact the Lanista of one of the four great gladiatorial schools was actually sabotaging his own warriors and putting bets in the process was enough to create a scandal that would rock the social structure for months. </p><p>Not that it surprised me. Growing on the edges of the noble society, I had met with a similar scenario with a surprising frequency, people exploiting so-called traditions for their benefit without even blinking despite all their grand-standing. </p><p>“Still, it’s good if we can get a couple more shows from him. It’ll help us recoup today’s losses. Can he fight?” </p><p>“I doubt he could ever put a decent performance unless we dose him again. The potion had left some significant damage.” </p><p>“If we dose him with stronger potions?” </p><p>“Hard to say. Two, maybe three times if we’re lucky enough.” </p><p>“And what if we overdose him for one fight?” </p><p>“Then he’ll collapse in a few minutes as his heart gave out, but he’ll put a good fight beforehand.” </p><p>“G00d—“ Antonius said, relaxing me as he accepted the healer’s comment, delaying his plans for a while, which allowed me to plan accordingly. Before he could finish his sentence, however, the door opened without even knocking, and someone burst in. </p><p>“How dare—“ Antonius started as he turned around, only to fall silent. Meanwhile, I barely maintained my exhausted state as a surprising familiar figure burst in. </p><p>Marcus, the unlucky suitor of Olivia that had found himself on the other end of the glass during the party — along with the rest of the men — left me free to entertain the rest of the girls. </p><p>“Why is he still alive?” he growled in anger as he looked at me, his fingers already around his knife. “You promised me that he would be dead today.” </p><p>“I’m sorry, my lord, but unfortunately, he was too lucky,” Antonius said, but even as he turned his back to me, I could see his unwillingness as he referred to him that. While technically, as an heir of a noble Equite family, Marcus was superior to Lanista of a gladiator school, in practice, the difference wasn’t big enough for Marcus to act as he wished. </p><p>He didn’t belong to a patrician family, after all. </p><p>“I don’t care, you promised me that he would be dead,” he growled. I wished I wasn’t acting unconscious so I could shake my head in amusement. The sight of him acting as the poster child of spoiled nobles hardly helped me to take him seriously, even with the fact that he was trying to arrange my death. </p><p>“I should kill him right now, you can say that he died of his wounds,” he growled as he pulled his dagger, unknowingly about to sign his own death warrant. Just because I was amused by his incompetence didn’t mean that I was willing to lay obediently as he stabbed me. </p><p>Luckily — for him — Antonius was quick to intervene. “I’m sorry sir, but we can’t do it like it,” he said as he grabbed Marcus’ waist. Marcus looked dissatisfied, but facing Antonius’ sharp gaze, he fell silent. </p><p>I might not like Antonius, but there was no doubt he was strong enough to intimidate a spoiled noble. </p><p>“Why?” Marcus growled, but only after taking a couple of steps back. </p><p>“I’m afraid that if he dies out of sight, they might get suspicious, and my school is not strong enough to actually handle the attention of a Patrician house,” Antonius said. “Especially one as grand as…” </p><p>He trailed off, but I didn’t actually need to hear him finish his sentence to guess which house they were talking about. Even among the patrician houses, there were only a few that would awaken that level of respect and fear just by the mention, and there was only one that I was linked to. </p><p>House Junia.</p><p>“You better keep him here tonight then. I would be very angry if he’s at the party tonight.” </p><p>“Tonight,” Antonius suddenly stammered, shocked. “There’s a party tonight? Are you sure that they would request him?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” Marcus growled. “But I can’t risk him being there to be a distraction, not when I almost seduced her. Tonight’s party is very important.” Pity I had to fake unconsciousness, because I would have loved to explode in laughter. Meanwhile, Marcus looked down on me, satisfied. “At least, he won’t be able to join, even if they call for him.” </p><p>However, his words didn’t make Antonius any calmer, especially when the healer intervened in panic. “Unless they send a healer of their own,” he said. </p><p>“Didn’t you just say he was certainly going to die?” Antonius growled, for the first time showing the signs of actual panic rather than just annoyance. </p><p>“Not if an actual healer from a Patrician house intervenes. If they are really determined, they could send an expert. Those that can create actual miracles. I doubt that a few internal wounds and a berserk potion could stop them.” </p><p>I wouldn’t want to be the healer’s place as Antonius looked at him with his piercing gaze, promising pain, and torture. He flinched, while Antony was lost in thought. However, despite the shock he felt, Antonius was quick to come up with an answer, showing that it wasn’t an accident that he was the leader of a business that made a spectacular living out of death and violence. </p><p>“Poison him,” he ordered to the healer calmly. “Use the poison from the snake, but don’t use an excessive dose. It shouldn’t be so much that our failure to notice is an admission of failure. And don’t forget to use the fangs to create a small wound in somewhere hard to notice, like the edge of his bleeding wounds.” </p><p>Smart, I thought in respect, despite the fact that he was trying to arrange my death. His plan was simple, but its genius lay in its simplicity, as it was easy to explain even if they dug deeper. At worst, he would just throw the healer to the mercy of the Patrician house for their failure. </p><p>I smirked even as they left the room, leaving me alone. Antonius and Marcus were convinced that their plan had succeeded despite the initial setback, and the healer was dashing to get some poison from the carcass of the beast I had just defeated, determined to kill me with the poison of my own victim. </p><p>It would have been poetic irony. Too bad that I had no intention of complying with it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked toward the temporary residence of our Royal guests, my mind was already on how I could leverage the direct access to the artifact, to deepen my understanding of how to handle the Divine Spark. </p><p>Though, it was interesting a ruined piece of an ancient artifact, with its broken handle, cracks, and more rust than metal, had such a great impact on my development path. </p><p>However, when I found myself at the separate building assigned for the Crown Princess, I focused on the presence. “May I ask you to send a message to Lady Delia,” I said to the nearest guard. Interestingly, rather than asking a reason or an explanation, he just nodded before sending a message. </p><p>They were clearly instructed to do so. </p><p>Even more interestingly, rather than leading me inside to meet with Delia, the handmaiden responsible for arranging my services — and seducing me to a betrayal in the process — the guard asked me to wait. </p><p>A moment, I thought that to be a subtle power play, trying to keep me waiting at the entrance to remind me that I didn’t have the luxury to go around as I wished, especially this late. To my surprise, however, Delia appeared at the entrance less than a minute later, an apologetic expression on her face. “Sorry to keep you waiting,” she gasped as she came to a stop from her hurried walk — the speediest she could move without looking like a peasant. </p><p>“No worries,” I said with a wave of my hand. </p><p>She turned to the guard. “It’s a scandal, how can you keep such a valuable guest of us waiting,” she admonished. </p><p>“But … the Princess ordered that —“ he tried to argue, only to be cut off. </p><p>“I know what her Highness ordered,” she cut him off. “That doesn’t apply to honored guests,” she added before continuing with several choice admonishments, mixed with warnings and threats. </p><p>Good show, I thought even as I watched them, barely holding back a smirk. She was a good actress, I had to admit, but not enough to fool me. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” she murmured after finishing the punishment of the guard, and gestured me to walk. For a moment, she was silent, her hands dancing on her hair to deflect anxiety, trying to fix it. </p><p>Another part of her little ploy, I noted as I let my attention wander on her dress, which was ruffled and skewed, like she had put the dress on hurriedly. However, considering it enhanced the cleavage of the dress more than intended, but not enough to actually reach a level that could be defined as obscene. </p><p>Her beautiful blonde hair, damp and slightly mussed to give the impression that she just stepped out of a bath, sold the impression even better — despite the fact that a simple spell would have dried it properly. </p><p>Altogether, combined with her attitude, she sold the story of an enthusiastic greeting. </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed by her attention to small details. Manipulation was much more effective through subtle details than grand declarations, and I could always respect a consummate professional. </p><p>Not enough to actually stop my own manipulations, of course. </p><p>As we walked, I made a show of glancing down her enhanced cleavage, blushing softly as I did so — which was hardly a chore as I enjoyed the delicious walk of the busty blonde while she made small talk. </p><p>“You weren’t around for a few days,” she finally broached the subject, slipping the question like it was just another casual comment. </p><p>“The demands of my boss, unfortunately,” I murmured, with an enhanced focus on the distaste, making her eyes brighten for a moment. “But with the recent attack, I had a lot of other things to deal with.” </p><p>“So unfair, making you work that hard,” Delia said, probing lightly. </p><p>“Someone in this school has to, or the place would collapse,” I countered arrogantly, adding another layer to the fake pompous personality I was selling to them. “If it wasn’t for my great wards, this place would have long collapsed under the weight of the undead.” </p><p>“They are lucky to have you to put things together,” Delia said with a sigh, as she grabbed my arm thankfully, and ‘accidentally’ dragging my arm until it was momentarily buried in her glorious bosom before letting it go. </p><p>Nice touch. </p><p>“Yes, they are,” I said smugly. Though, it was ironic just how close my fake personality was taking credit for my actual achievements, yet somehow managing to disguise them as fake in the process. She nodded in agreement, but didn’t say anything else. </p><p>Because we have arrived at our destination. The research room they had prepared for me. </p><p>“You guys decided to go with the most expensive option, nice,” I murmured, not bothering to hide my shock as I said so. The research room they had set up for me was definitely opulent, extremely so, which almost felt me guilty for asking such a detailed request. It was just supposed to be an excuse to allow me to create my own wards, allowing a more throughout the observation of the Princess.</p><p>Though, having access to a well-equipped research room was much better than the alternative, especially since I was confident to block any magical observation they might leave in place. </p><p>“Nothing but the best for the best,” she said even as she rubbed my arm suggestively. “Her Highness ordered that everything that you require should be readied for you immediately, especially if it might achieve our goal faster.” </p><p>“Everything seems to be in order for the moment,” I said as I examined the room, including the mana-laden forge, several tables with supporting arrays to make the analysis easier, piles of materials — both monster parts and minerals — carefully categorized on shelves, tools forged from magical metals, and even a small box including three Mana Gems. </p><p>A truly impressive preparation. Just the materials were enough to bankrupt most families. Ironically, it was also a statement from them, saying that, even diminished, Crown Princess had access to deep and mysterious resources. </p><p>“How much do you think it would affect your projection,” she said, unable to hide her nervousness. </p><p>“Don’t worry, with all this, I’m confident that I could replicate it no more than two weeks of work, especially since my work will keep me in the school for a foreseeable future,” I said. If it wasn’t for the sudden appearance of the dragon, adding much more interesting leverage to apply against the headmistress, I would have used the opportunity to highlight just how unreasonable the headmistress’ requirements were, trying to use the Princess’ weight against the headmistress. </p><p>“Oh, such good news,” she gasped in happiness as she hugged me. Her happiness was real, though, the seemingly impulsive move was certainly not, especially when she was doing her best to rub her chest against mine as she rocked up and down. </p><p>A move that had rather radical implications on the movement of her dress, making it slip lower and lower, until it gave a glimpse of her nipple, giving me an amazing view, and a notification. </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>I tensed the moment I read the notification, while she stumbled back, a blush on her face, assuming that was a reaction to her nudity, which wasn’t. </p><p>It was the reaction to the fact that I had received experience without any reduction, proving that her level was higher than mine! </p><p>It was shocking, because, the last time I had checked, she was only supposed to be level twenty, which was too low to give me experience. </p><p>So, either she managed to gain more than twelve levels in a few days, or I had fucked up my initial assessment greatly. </p><p>Either way, yet again, I found myself in a much more complicated deal than I expected. </p><p>“I’m so sorry,” she gasped as she tried to fix her dress in fake panic, messing it even more in the process, giving me an even better view of her naked tits for a fleeting moment. She even managed to stumble toward me in the process, forcing me to hold her to prevent her from a painful fall — pressing her naked tits against my chest in the process. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, it also gave me an excuse to slip another string of mana to her, allowing me to examine her soul space. I was lucky that she was busy giving me a show, giving me an excuse to look shocked. </p><p>I was shocked, because her soul space was markedly different. </p><p>She was not level twenty anymore, but thirty-five, a huge difference from before. But compared to other details, it was not even important. The fact that she had several more skills, or some stats were markedly higher was not shocking as well. The selection of the new skills, most magical and some crafting, while curious, wasn’t entirely world-shaking, though almost as suspicious as her sudden power-up. </p><p>What was shocking was the absence of skills that was there the previous time I had checked, like dagger skill, or sense motive. Similarly, some of the stats, like dexterity, were lower, and the whole distribution was completely skewed. </p><p>Yet another mystery, I thought even as she managed to fix her dress. </p><p>Like the situation wasn’t complicated enough with angels, dragons, and mysterious organizations… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 7750 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I dashed out of the tunnel the moment their meeting concluded, as I expected the headmistress to send me a message the moment she was back at the office, and it would have been better if I wasn’t under wards when she did so. </p><p>Especially since these wards were under her direct control.  </p><p>It was good that I did, because, a few seconds after I had left the wards, I had received the message, a message that would have failed to pass the protective wards without triggering. </p><p>Close call. Unsurprisingly, she was asking me to visit her in her office immediately. Knowing the severity of the situation, I rushed. A minute later, I was knocking on her office door, the oppressive feeling of the wards not even registering after the repeated exposure. </p><p>The door once again opened wordlessly, revealing the headmistress sitting behind her desk, wearing her dark robe, but the hood was down, revealing her beautiful face that contrasted greatly with the rest of the dark decorations of the room. </p><p>She did her best to look impassive, but even without watching her fateful meeting, I would have noticed the panicked expression on her face. It was a pity that I missed half of the meeting, as I would have loved to see the exact reason why she had been unsettled to such an unbelievable degree, probably relating to the faction the dragon belonged to. </p><p>“I have another mission for you, a very important one,” she said, fully confident that I would accept despite the mental crisis she was going through. It would be a lie to say that I wasn’t tempted to reject her, just to see her confidence shatter even more. </p><p>Too bad that the cost of doing so was too heavy for momentary entertainment. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, accepting the mission before she even gave the details. Ironically, spying on my own boss was very helpful to sell an image of devotion. </p><p>She accepted that move readily, confident in my loyalty after observing a decent amount of Divine Spark, not aware that it was safely locked in my body behind several complicated, ever-changing wards, preventing it from even slightly affecting my mind. </p><p>“I need you to spy on her,” she explained, once again economical in her words, though there was no doubt who she was referring. </p><p>“How, magically, or physically?” I asked. </p><p>“I arranged you as the servant for her. It’ll give you an excuse to stay close. You can observe her in detail, and record anything valuable,” she explained, acting like it was her own idea rather than a request she was unable to resist. </p><p>Her attempts to be sneaky were simply cute. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said. </p><p>She stayed silent for a moment, before adding. “It’s good that you survived,” she said, complimenting me about the mission. Since I had already included a report of the mission with the message I had sent earlier, she didn’t ask any follow-up questions. </p><p>Interestingly, her lack of follow-up questions about the move suggested an interesting detail. Because, while I had explained the challenges I had experienced during the event, I had deliberately avoided mentioning anything about my speculations about the Eternals’ movements, in particular to its possible function as some kind of training program, not wanting to reveal to her how much information I was able to collect under the restrictions of the wards. </p><p>The fact that she didn’t ask a single question either meant that she didn’t care about it at all — which wasn’t likely for someone that managed to last two centuries as the head of a political entity — or she had a good idea what was the point all along. </p><p>“Is there any specific thing you want me to do? Interrogation, maybe some torture—“ I offered, only to be cut off, a beautiful panic appearing in her face. </p><p>“No!” she gasped, her face covered with emotion the second time — the first being the suggestion about her nakedness under her robe during her first reveal. To her credit, it didn’t take long for her to suppress that panic, and continue with her usual monotone tone. “Try to keep her happy. She is an important connection.” </p><p>“How nice?” I asked, deliberately pushing the headmistress a bit. </p><p>“Within reason, but check with me if she asks anything extreme,” the headmistress answered. </p><p>I nodded, barely holding back my smirk. I didn’t know whether she didn’t realize or she just didn’t care because she thought of me as a loyal soldier, but she had just given me a huge opportunity to do a lot of things, using my new ‘mistress’ as an excuse. </p><p>Before leaving, however, I decided to ask another question, one that was very important. “What if she wants that…” I said, looking up to where her room was, implying that she might ask for the Divine Spark. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” she said, surprising me with the quickness of her answer, so much that it showed on my face. “Dragons have no use for it. They only use pure mana.” </p><p>Another interesting detail. </p><p>“Do you think you can handle another transfer?” she asked. </p><p>“It might be safer to wait another day, the struggle to keep her safe exhausted my body too much,” I said, both selling an idea of loyalty that forced me to push my limits just to defend someone for her — and a struggle that was much harder than the actual events — but also subtly implying that, while I was strong, that strength wasn’t without a significant cost. </p><p>Being underestimated never hurts. </p><p>“As you wish,” she said as her gaze fell back on her desk, dismissing me without even mentioning it. </p><p>I left her office, and went back to the basement, to the room of my new mistress. I knocked on the door. </p><p>“Come in,” called a familiar voice, and I entered, only for my gaze to capture the beautiful sight of my new boss for a foreseeable future. </p><p>And what a sight it was. Unlike the previous dress, she was wearing a light green dress, half-transparent as it wrapped around her body, tantalizingly displaying her amazing curves despite her petite body. It was not a dress, but a nightie, the type a concubine might wear to seduce her Emperor. </p><p>Her pose was even more interesting than her dress. She sat on a chair, her legs crossed, showing a great deal of her smooth skin through the slit that cut through her nightie’s skirt, enhancing the eroticism even more. The subtle leaning of her body enhanced her cleavage even more than her nightie had done in the first place. </p><p>Yet, despite her seductive look, clearly, it wasn’t the message she was trying to give. She was partially facing the door, but not directly looking, even as I entered, like I wasn’t important enough to actually pay attention. The platform under her chair — one that was not there earlier — elevated her seat almost like a throne. </p><p>Her words hardly disagreed with the impression. “My servant … you’re finally here,” she said, hardly managing to hide the glee in her tone. </p><p>Ironically, the obvious glee in her tone turned what might have been an insulting attitude into something amusing. The glee she felt over having power over me was so obvious that, ironically, it weakened her hold. </p><p>Though, the fact that I had been fondling her naked body a few hours earlier hardly helped her attempts to look authoritative. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” I said, giving her a rebellious, frustrated gaze. It was fake, of course, but it was easier to fake resentment rather than looking impervious and forcing her to ramp up her attitude until she actually become annoying.  </p><p>“Yes, what?” she said smugly as she looked to me, her earlier impervious attitude forgotten the moment she got the slightest victory, suggesting my — hopefully short — time as a servant wouldn’t be too difficult. </p><p>Her next order just reinforced that impression. “Wash my feet,” she ordered as she gently shook her crossed foot, which in turn moved her dress more, giving a short yet delicious glimpse of her beautiful inner thighs, with a tantalizing — but unfilled — promise of giving a glimpse of her core. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said with a defeated sigh, giving her the thing she wanted more than the actual massage as I walked toward her. </p><p>As I walked toward her, however, I did more than appreciate her sexy body. I started examining the room, in particular, the mana regeneration capacity of the room even as she happily devoured it. It must be another part of their arrangement, because the intensity was much higher than what I first saw, something that was about half of my regeneration. </p><p>Which meant it was more or less as intense as a dozen level thirty mages’ regeneration, hardly something to dismiss, even for something as vast as Silver Spires. </p><p>Though, it also highlighted just how ridiculous my power, in particular, my mana regeneration was getting. </p><p>As I arrived in front of her, I conjured a crystal basin, another spell filling it with mana-induced water, costing me a significant chunk of mana. </p><p>[-2375 Mana]</p><p>Then, I crouched down in front of her, grabbing her foot, ready to give a massage, deliberately ignoring the amazing sight I would receive the moment I would glimpse up, at least at the moment, and instead, stayed deliberately focused on the massage the full extent of the duration, even though she started to let out frustrated growl repeatedly as the arousal clearly build-up while my mana penetrated through her skin. </p><p>Meanwhile, I was testing just how crazy I could drive her with another foot massage…</p><p>[-1394 Mana]</p><p>With great success. Yet, even as she started parting her legs ‘accidentally’ I resisted the urge to peeking, driving the impression even higher. </p><p>“Is there anything else, Mistress?” I asked when I finally finished and stood up, only to catch a beautiful expression on her face, a mixture of arousal and annoyance, accompanied by the shock that I resisted the implied invitation to push more — therefore depriving her the opportunity to slap me down. </p><p>“No, you can go, I want to rest,” she answered as she waved her hand dismissively, chasing me away. “Make sure to be ready here in the morning to serve, though.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I gave her an exaggerated bow, once again not reacting to the glimpse of skin as I walked away. </p><p>But when I finally left the room, the smile on my face was erased quickly. Playing with her was fun, but I had a lot to do with our royal guests. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 5197 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I watched Naomi walk in front of me, the tightness of her body apparent despite her loose clothes  — which was a touch of pity. I examined her as she looked around the house. Still, it was a disappointing development. </p><p>But then, she did something to renew my hope. </p><p>“Where can I change?” she asked. </p><p>“You can use the downstairs bathroom,” I said. “I’ll be in the garden.” </p><p>She nodded, her cute light chocolate skin gaining a lovely hue as she blushed, though the fact that my torso was naked paid a good role on that. Then she turned away and walked toward the bathroom with a speed that was almost on the edge of being classified as a dash. </p><p>“So cute,” I murmured as I went back to the garden. My exercise schedule was complete, but there was no harm in subjecting her to an impressive view once she came. </p><p>Naomi stayed in the bathroom for almost ten minutes later, which was excessive just to change into another loose t-shirt and sweatpants combo — something I had expected her to consider the way Carrie usually dressed. </p><p>Sarah had dressed more revealingly, of course, but that was a combination of Sarah’s self-appointed role as the group leader and the importance of the last night, contrasting with her idea of she was the most outgoing one between her friends — and she responded by revealing more and more of her body in a misguided effort to prove she was more ‘progressive’ than Carrie. </p><p>Then the door opened, giving me a big surprise, the nice kind. </p><p>She was wearing nothing but skin-tight yoga pants and a tight top, leaving not much to doubt about her body. </p><p>Not that she had any reason to hide her body. She looked delicious as the sun shone on her skin, revealing the hidden muscles behind a soft layer of fat. </p><p>Damn, I thought, barely able to suppress a surprised exclamation. What was going on with those nerds, each with a body more beautiful than the cheerleaders I had been wasting my time with their annoying entitled attitude. I had no idea whether it was something unique to their group or I had been wasting my time ignoring such a wondrous world. </p><p>But that was a topic for a different time. Instead, I focused on the way her deliciously curvy ass danced even as she walked casually, her stomach contracting to give the impression of strength under her soft skin. Her top was tight, and the sports bra underneath prevented her top from jiggling, but not tight enough to conceal the great treasure that lay underneath. </p><p>I let the weight I was lifting fall on the ground with a great commotion, making her flinch, but not enough to pull her gaze away from my muscles. She was clearly as impressed with the sight she met, even without the shock value. </p><p>So impressed that, she said nothing for half a minute as she looked at my body, blushing more and more, affected by the sight even more than Carrie and Sarah had been. </p><p>“Shall we start?” I said with a smirk. “It’s better if we do some stretching before I start to cool down.” </p><p>“R-right,” she said as she quickly walked closer. “Have you ever practiced yoga before?” </p><p>“Once or twice,” I answered. </p><p>“Maybe we should start with a few basic poses,” she offered. “Try to follow my instructions.” </p><p>“No,” I said with a smirk, which surprised her. I explained quickly. “I learn better by watching. Why don’t you give me a quick rundown for me first so that I know what you expect from me.” </p><p>“Sure,” she said with confidence, but at this point, it didn’t surprise me. I had seen the same flip on Carrie and Sarah several times now, their shy and hesitant personality melting away the moment they faced an area that they were confident in. </p><p>And clearly, yoga was Naomi’s area of expertise. </p><p>She started moving, her muscles contracting beautifully to reveal the surprising power her otherwise gentle body was holding, though I was equally interested in the way her already tight yoga shorts stretched further, revealing every line of her body. </p><p>As she moved, her earlier shyness was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>I stayed back, enjoying the show she was providing, shuffling just enough to keep my body warm after my exercise. But my focus was on the light perspiration she was developing, highlighting the beautiful contours of her body, from her pouty lips to her shapely calves. As she bent for one of the downward poses, enhancing the tenseness of her hips even further, tempting me to cut this little game close. </p><p>I managed to ignore that desire, though the lengthy morning gift I had received paid a big role in it. “Do you think you can do it?” she asked, a surprising cadence in her tone, one that reflected authority expecting obedience. </p><p>“There’s only one way to test,” I said as I took the first form to the best of my ability. </p><p>“Slide your foot further,” she said, walking behind me and pushing my foot to the correct position, launching a painful and excruciating yet thrilling episode. </p><p>She certainly didn’t pull any punches. After a few stretching exercises making sure I was flexible enough, she forced me more and more difficult poses, which challenged me more than I was expecting, not helped by the fact that she turned out to be a true slave driver during the training. </p><p>If it wasn’t for her beautiful slender fingers curling over my shoulders and pressing into my back to push me further into the poses, I might have called the exercise short. But her soft caresses, lingering over the contours of my muscles quite longer than strictly necessary was a good enough reason for me to do otherwise. </p><p>“You’re nimbler than I expected,” Naomi said even as she ordered me to change pose. </p><p>“I take my workouts seriously,” I said. </p><p>“It’s so nice to have a friend that does so. Carrie and the others always find excuses not to join my sessions.” </p><p>I chuckled. If she was pushing them half as hard as she was pushing me, no wonder they were determined to avoid her. Even for me, it was a true challenge. But before I could inform her of my opinion, she spoke again. </p><p>“That’s enough warm-up, let’s start with real exercises,” she said, forcing me to another position, even more difficult. But that difficulty didn’t come without its own benefits. She leaned against my back, the sensation of her chest gloriously soft as she helped me to lean. </p><p>That, I was writing it off as an accidental move, done when she was distracted by her own movements. However, when the next move also kept our body in unnecessarily close contact, followed by again…</p><p>Yeah, she was flirting with me. Rather badly, I had to admit, just like Carrie had been doing at the start of our relationship. If another boy was in my place, especially one of the guys that seemed to gravitate around them due to their social status, they would have been long intimidated under her aggressive teaching, ruining any chance of taking the next step. </p><p>And from there, a retreat was the only outcome. It was rare for a boy, especially an insecure one, to accept being the physically inferior one, especially with the way Naomi seemed to push that angle aggressively. Luckily for her, I was confident in my own physical skills enough to be amused by her aggressiveness. </p><p>Which meant, I was able to resist the pain and discomfort enough until she had reached the next stage of her flirting, her body mashing against mine more and more. However, even as her movements got more confident, her expression was getting hesitant, like she was breaching an area that she never reached before. </p><p>I was suspecting that while her approach was something she felt comfortable in, the level she was pushing was goaded by someone else, eerily reminding me of my first study session with Carrie, where she was doing her best to touch my arm with her friends goading. </p><p>A minute later, Naomi confirmed that indirectly. She reached her phone, quickly typing something, only for her phone to buzz immediately. It must be an interesting reply, because her eyes widened as she read. </p><p>“L-let’s try something different,” she murmured immediately, too shocked to actually delay a bit to hide the fact that she was getting instructions from her phone. </p><p>“Lay prone,” she ordered suddenly. It must be something really excessive, because her confidence — which had been eroding slowly — shattered completely, leaving its place to a cute hesitance. </p><p>I followed her request and lay on my chest, a smirk on my face as I waited for my sexy volunteer trainer to act. </p><p>“It’s going to hurt, try holding it as much as possible,” she said before I felt a weight on my back. And without only thin yoga shorts in between, it wasn’t hard to guess exactly what part of her body was pressing against my skin, wriggling with a suspicious frequency. </p><p>Though, it was hard to focus when she was pulling my leg hard enough to hurt very much. An interesting way to flirt, even as her fingers slowly trailed down my leg, getting higher and higher on my thigh, carefully caressing dangerously close my length. </p><p>If her pinky finger had dragged along it a couple of times as she continued to torture me, I was sure that it was completely accidental. The same went for the expression on her face when we finally finished our pose. After all, nerds were famous for their shyness and their avoidance of sex. </p><p>And I could certainly not think of an example on the contrary. Not at all. </p><p>Her treatment lasted ten more minutes, falling rightfully in between pain and pleasure, before she finally called a stop. </p><p>“Thanks for your help,” I said as I stretched, which also gave her a perfect view of my glistening muscles, loosened excellently after her long treatment, as well as my erection straining against my short. “I definitely some help.”</p><p>“Not a problem. It was a pleasure for me as well. The girls don’t like to work out with me,” she said, her gaze bouncing all around the garden, her shyness back now that we got away from her area of expertise, like she hadn’t been caressing my body aggressively to stretch me for the last thirty minutes. </p><p>Though, if the earlier intensity was what she brought to her workout sessions, one that I found challenging me despite my ambition to be a professional athlete, I could see why they were trying to avoid her. </p><p>However, before I could make a comment, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Carrie. But when she read that, her blush covered her face explosively. “S-sorry,” she stammered. “I need to go. E-emergency.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said, but she was already dashing away. My phone buzzed a moment later. A message from Carrie. ‘I think I scared her, sorry,’ she wrote, followed by several sad emojis. </p><p>‘Not a problem, sweetie,’ I said. After all, not only Carrie was the one to arrange it in the first place, but also her amazing performance in the last twenty-four hours was enough to compensate for much bigger screw-ups. </p><p>‘But don’t worry, I’ll make it up to you,’ she replied, leaving me wondering what kind of trick she had in her surprisingly dirty mind. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“That was a fun adventure,” I said even as I was about to slip to my side of the car, when Megan threw the cars to me. </p><p>From the way she drove, I knew that she had no problem driving herself, but looking at her face, I didn’t reject it. Clearly, she was another part of her revenge against her ex. </p><p>I didn’t try to give them back, as driving a delicious red convertible was hardly a chore. However, since she was pushing that much, I decided to push my luck. “So, do you want to give that lap dance now, or later?” </p><p>That earned an angry glare of her, but that didn’t affect her smile, nor made her shout. “Ah, the bet,”  she murmured, her smile gaining a dangerous quality. “May I interest you in exchange? Maybe I can pick the bill for your car repair.” </p><p>I was tempted, dangerously so, but ultimately, it was her tone that annoyed me. Like it was a given, that I was going to surrender just because she was willing to help me financially. That touched my pride, and I had a tendency to overreact when that happened. </p><p>Luckily for her, I actually liked her merciless nature, so rather than doing something more drastic, I decided to attack just back. I shrugged. “We can’t forget it altogether if you don’t think you can handle it,” I said, with a smirk that explained the teasing was intentional. </p><p>“Oh, you think I can’t handle it?” she said, her tone just enough to trigger my danger sense. </p><p>But just because she was being dangerous didn’t mean I was going to let her slip that victory. “I call it as I see it. We had a bet, and now that you lost, you don’t want to do what you promised. I’m just giving you the card you’re looking for.” </p><p>Her smile tightened, making my neck tingle. “Oh, you think like that,” she said even as she put her hand on my shoulder and pushed me on the driver’s seat. “I’ll show you how well I can handle it.” </p><p>Before I could even answer, I found her on my lap, her blonde hair spilling against my chest. Interesting, I thought even as she dared to do it, right in the middle of the party, where anyone could stumble on it. I wasn’t expecting her to get that committed proving me wrong. </p><p>Then, I noticed the glance she threw toward the party, with absolutely no hint of hesitation, and adjusted that train of thought. She was much more deliberate than I thought, and her objective clear. </p><p>If she was going to give a lap dance for a bet, she was going to use that to twist that knife even deeper into the reputation of her ex. </p><p>Her dance started with an interesting note. She leaned, whispering to my ear. “Try to touch me, and I break your finger.” </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said, her angry growl giving it as much pleasure as the way her hips started to rub against my lap. </p><p>She moved according to the beat of the music blaring at the party. Her hands landed on my shoulders, her soft touch enough to earn my full attention, her movement steadily. </p><p>Which was another surprise. With her earlier reluctance, I would have expected her to do the sheer minimum, maybe a few pumps, before vacating my lap. Instead, she pressed her weight down, just enough to send shivers of pleasure through my body. </p><p>Her hips followed the rhythm of the music, getting faster and slower as needed. Her hands slipped into my hair, leaning down sensually like she was about to kiss me, her breath dancing over my lips, but she didn’t connect. </p><p>Meanwhile, I could see more than one person outside, pointing toward us, even taking some pictures, no doubt enhancing the already raging gossip landscape even further. </p><p>“We’ll have a lot of pictures of us running around,” I said. </p><p>“I know,” she answered even as she leaned back, arching her body to push her tits against my face. “Aren’t you a lucky bastard? It’ll help your manly reputation very much. Once our little game stops, you’re going to beat the cheerleaders with a stick  to get a moment of rest.”</p><p>I had several stick jokes I could make even as she danced on my lap, hardening a certain part of my body to resemble a stick, but there was something to be said about tasteless jokes, at least targeting the girl responsible for said hardening. No need to kill the mood. </p><p>“It’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make to help my newest friend get her revenge,” I said, not bothering to hide my sarcasm. </p><p>“Such a big sacrifice,” she commented just as the music picked up the rhythm, and her hips responded with a great rapid movement. Her hips undulated back to forth relentlessly, pushing me toward a climax much faster than I expected. </p><p>“Yes, such a big sacrifice,” I said.</p><p>Her hands traveled down, cupping my balls over my clothes with a surprising aggressiveness. “I hope that you’re smart enough to delay it until we break up officially,” she whispered, even though, for an outside observer, she was whispering like sweet nothings to my ear. </p><p>“I’m yours for the next week, sweetheart,” I answered with a chuckle, ironically, appreciating her threat. She was clearly coming from a well-off family, and she had seen my car as well. There were a lot more effective threats she could have tapped that were more convincing, but she stayed on the physical side of it.</p><p>Just like her not bothering to push the money aspect for our earlier bet, she kept the threats at the same playing level. </p><p>It was surprisingly considerate of her.  </p><p>Of course, that consideration didn’t mean that she wasn’t extremely vicious, because just as my body was starting to tremble in anticipation, the song changed once again, and she deposed my lap. “That’s enough, right,” she whispered smugly from the passenger seat. “Two songs for a lap dance.” </p><p>“Well played,” I said even as I started driving, earning a small cheer from the party, which, unsurprisingly, once again started by Thad, who definitely didn’t miss an opportunity to twist the knife any deeper. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” Megan chuckled even as I started driving. </p><p>“Of course you don’t,” I said, making no comment on the way she had left a couple of buttons unlocked to extend the torture, just to keep my boxers uncomfortably tight. </p><p>Such a vindictive little vixen. </p><p>We drove silently for a while before I realized I forgot something important. “Do you mind if we drove to my car? I think I forgot the keys to my dorm there.” </p><p>“Sure,” she said even as she flicked down another button, revealing more of her lacy bra, and the amazing breasts barely hidden by them. “I don’t have anything to do.” </p><p>I chuckled as I pressed the gas pedal, showing her that she wasn’t the only one who knew how to drive. However, that didn’t mean much, not when we found ourselves in front of my car. </p><p>More accurately, remains of my car… </p><p>Someone had smashed it, and not just one window trying to see if they could hotwire it. Every single window was broken, the tires slashed. The hood was open, revealing the engine, or more accurately, the shambles of an engine, as every single pipe was broken, and most of the cables were cut. </p><p>“Give me a minute,” I said with a deadly silent tone when Megan tried to say something, and left the car, only for a noticeable smile to hit to my nose. They didn’t just ruin my car, but thoroughly ruined it, making sure it was a deliberate insult. </p><p>I said nothing, just made sure that I got a good glimpse of the car before turning back, not even bothering to pick the key. </p><p>I had no doubt who was responsible for it. </p><p>When I returned to my car, Megan looked at me with a solemn expression. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know they would go this far-“ she started, but before she could explain further, I raised my hand, silencing her. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said, keeping my voice soft. But if the way she flinched was any indicator, my tone missed the mark. </p><p>I just drove toward my dorm, my bone-white fingers white around the wheel. Megan said nothing even as we arrived at my dorm and I left the driver’s seat, leaving it for her. “I can make sure-“ she started, but I raised my hand to silence her. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I can handle my own revenge.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>While Kevin and the others moved back, Thad took a step forward, gesturing the DJ to lower the volume again. “And, ladies and gentlemen, say hello to the latest addition to our vicious Pirates,” he shouted as he raised his arms, like he was a wrestling announcer. “Terry!” </p><p>He slapped my shoulder, but whispered to my ear. “You have two seconds to give your phone to your girlfriend,” he said. </p><p>Realizing what he had in mind, I immediately passed my wallet and phone to Megan, who was quick to slip them into the small, stylish bag on her shoulder. She wasn’t surprised by their poor condition —  she had seen my rust bucket of a car — but that didn’t mean she wanted to announce that to the crowd. </p><p>Thad and three other linemen lifted me without any other warning, along with the cheers of the crowd. “Terry, Terry, Terry!” they shouted repeatedly even as they threw me up several times with all their strength. </p><p>And considering hose guys were defensive tackles, each easily lifting near four hundred pounds while benching, I was flying quite a bit of distance, enough to make it actually dangerous if I hit the floor </p><p>Luckily, when they finally threw me into the pool, it wasn’t one of their full power throws. I landed on the pool, unable to suppress my laughter. The warm hug of the water told me that my earlier guess was correct, that the pool was heated, but it wasn’t the only thing that was keeping me warm. </p><p>As I forced myself to the edge of the pool, more than one girl drifted near me by complete accident, not only showing their bodies clad in lingerie — wet lingerie — but also accidentally, putting their hands over my body. Most caressed my chest or my back, enjoying my muscles, but the daring hands that actually measured my bulge were more than a few. </p><p>The party was much more entertaining than I had expected. </p><p>When I arrived at the side, rather than letting me struggle helplessly, Thad helped me out. </p><p>“Welcome to the Pirates, little sailor,” he shouted, earning another set of cheers from the party. Then, he looked at Megan. “It’s a pity you found yourself a girlfriend. There is more than one cheerleader that would enjoy the first ride.” </p><p>I smirked, enjoying the banter. Thad was turning out to be a nice, yet simple guy. Not simple as in stupid — people often underestimate the players, and Thad’s type made it much easier  — but simple as direct. So, despite knowing him for less than a day, I was confident to bet that he had said that intentionally. </p><p>And his grin, targeting Megan rather than me, was more than enough evidence. </p><p>A nice wingman moment. It was his way of supporting me, reminding Megan that she had to work hard to keep her new boyfriend in hand against the enthusiastic competition. </p><p>A slight tenseness on her lips was all Megan displayed to show that she understood his point. Then, she turned to me, giving me a pointed look, as if she was asking me to side with her against Thad, maybe a grand declaration of love or something similar. </p><p>My answer was a sardonic smile. The alliance to take down Kevin was amusing, but it wasn’t enough to make me abandon the benefits of the Den. Not just because I wanted to have fun — which I did — but also doing so would actively affect my standing in the team. Seduction capabilities were one of the currencies. </p><p>I didn’t say even a word to Megan. She had dated another football player, and she was smart enough to realize the dilemma I was facing. </p><p>Well, more accurately, the dilemma she was facing. </p><p>She was the one who decided to kiss me in the middle of the crowd to make a great show. Now, it was her job to clean it up. </p><p>Her display of initiative didn’t surprise me. Without even a word, she leaned forward, her arms around my neck, and stole a short, yet heated kiss, something I had responded to very enthusiastically. She might be acting, but it didn’t make her lips any less delicious.  </p><p>“They have to work very hard if they want the first ride,” she said as she pulled back, but kept her body pressed against mine despite my wet clothes — another smart detail. “Especially since I’m not above asking help from a friend to reward my man.” </p><p>That earned a laugh from Thad as he slapped my shoulder, but before he could help me any more, he was dragged away by two cheerleaders, wearing skirts that might well be stylish cotton belts.</p><p>“So, should I expect this mysterious friend to actually arrive, or was that just a way to distract our lovable blonde giant?” I whispered into her ear even as I wrapped my arm comfortably around her waist, and she leaned against my chest. From a distance, we probably looked like the newest power couple of the college, gossip exploding around us, not even bothering to conceal their curious gazes.</p><p>Or the speed of their fingers as they danced over their phones, typing endless posts. I even noticed several of them trying to take photos in a manner they assumed was hidden. </p><p>If I were to bet, I would say we were already trending on whatever social media app of the week for the college students.</p><p>After a small break where I changed into some spare clothes — which I luckily had in my sports bag just in case — we started walking around the party. </p><p>Megan kept her arms around me for the next hour as we walked around the party, drinking and mingling, while Megan did every little thing a new — and slightly airheaded — girlfriend was supposed to do, like she was going through a checklist. </p><p>Then, we hit a little snag. </p><p>First, a little tangent. Trying to match the consumption capabilities of a hulking man, nearly seven feet, weighing more than three-hundred pounds, with a habitual drinking ability enough to impress an AA meeting, was simply madness. </p><p>And unfortunately the guy in front of me, Clark, one of the defensive power tackles — a.k.a the big man of the defense whose job was to easily push two people at the same time — was the perfect embodiment of every single of those features. </p><p>“Come on, Terry, don’t be a wuss,” he laughed even as he carried a large tray, filled with an impressive number of shot glasses. And, the number of players that were following him, not bothering to hide their snickers, suggested that I was about to face a hazing ritual. </p><p>As far as the hazing rituals went, that was pretty mild — and I suspected humiliating the backup quarterback went a long way to ensure that — but once again, simply didn’t mean effective. </p><p>“Oh, I guess you won’t be up to meeting with my friend,” Megan whispered into my ear, before pulling back. “I can do that, honey!” </p><p>I smirked at her little ploy. “Thanks, sweetie,” I said, leaning for a quick kiss, but using the opportunity to whisper into her ear instead. “Do you want to bet?” She caught my eyes, like she was asking for the details. “Simple, I finish the game, you don’t interfere. If I win, you help your friend to reward me.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m feeling jealous, already aiming for my friend,” she said with a smirk. </p><p>“You’re right. I shouldn’t think of anyone other than my beautiful girlfriend. How about a lap dance my beautiful girlfriend instead.” That stopped her for a moment. “If you can handle it, of course.” </p><p>Her frown at my dig was beautiful. “You can’t just make them stop, the tray has to be emptied.” I nodded, trying not to smirk at her wording, trying not to alert her to her mistake. She was in for a surprise. </p><p>I ignored her victorious smirk as she no doubt imagined how to leverage the bet where she conveniently didn’t raise a stake for a future favor. </p><p>I had a nice surprise for her.  </p><p>I turned to Clark, and indirectly, the rest of the defensive team. “Are you sure, Clark? It’ll be difficult for the guys to carry you,” I said, loud enough to be heard by anyone. They exploded in laughter, before gathering around us, shouting for us to drink. </p><p>“Oh, you’re brave, little guy,” Clark answered, which, as someone above six feet, was not an insult I had been on the receiving end before. But in this case, it was completely accurate. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said even as I reached and grabbed two glasses. I drank the first one smoothly, despite the burning sensation enveloping my throat. The laughter exploding around me suggested that it was intentional. </p><p>Well, it wouldn’t have been a hazing if we were drinking aged whiskey rather than the disgusting stuff that could strip off varnish off the table if spilled. </p><p>However, when I raised the glass to my lips for the second time, there was no such pain. </p><p>The reason, a little sleight of hand, owing to my childhood. Before settling on a career as a chess hustler, I had experimented with street magic — and maybe, just maybe, some pickpocketing — before setting on chess. </p><p>I still remembered how to do some simple tricks. And subtly flipping two glasses, one empty, the other filled with a clear liquid, while grabbing the glasses in such a way that it wasn’t immediately visible was one of the simplest possible tricks. </p><p>Especially in a college party, where the dim lights and a drunk audience helped immensely. </p><p>So, while I made a show of drinking the shot, I tipped the other one to the floor. At this hour, with more than one person bombing into the pool, the floor was sufficiently wet so the spilled alcohol was nicely blended. </p><p>I laughed even as Clark reached for the next set of shots, repeating the move, but I only used one hand to pick two glasses, the other still holding the empty glass, switching before it reached my lips. </p><p>“More, more, more,” the audience shouted. Clark did his best to drink, but as the tray got emptier, he was starting to stumble. I faked my movement to match him. I wasn’t an excellent actor, but I was certainly good enough to convince a drunk cheering crowd. </p><p>One important member of the crowd wasn’t drunk, and she was watching me with an increasingly grim expression. She wasn’t quick to notice my trick, but she managed to see through my drunk act. </p><p>And after that, it didn’t take long for her eyes to drop down my hands, her frown getting even tricker. </p><p>To her credit, she actually stuck to our agreement, and didn’t try to tip off the other players, watching me as we drained the tray filled with shots two by two, only to earn another small celebration when I managed to stay conscious, where even Clark was stumbling badly. </p><p>“Bring another tray, boys, we have a strong boy here,” Thad cried. </p><p>“That’s enough, boys,” Megan said, her voice just loud enough to cut through the cries of the crowd without becoming overbearing. “I still need him for the rest of the night. I can’t have him passing out.” </p><p>“If you want to be boring,” Thad answered from the crowd, but followed by laughter, it was hardly a serious statement. Not that Megan cared about that. She had already grabbed my hand, dragging me to her car. </p><p>I followed her, even though it needed me to leave the party that was going on my honor. </p><p>I still have a tournament to play in the morning. Maybe even win, if my traits continued to work like that. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I looked at the beautiful redheaded figure, lying prone on the bed, her beautiful bottom quivering helplessly as my fingers invaded her core once more to push her dangerously close to the edge, but not allowed to push forward. </p><p>Despite the seriousness of the situation, and the preciousness of the information she held, I was tempted to stay silent, testing just how long she would be able to stay on the edge before collapsing into a helpless heap of moans. </p><p>Unfortunately, even with the beauty of her form, I didn’t have the luxury of fully focusing my attention on that kind of stuff, not when I had to get more information about the mysterious organizations that were doing their best to infiltrate not only the palace, but also the dark factions. </p><p>All that I needed to decide was which side to focus on first, Elves, or Phoenixes. </p><p>A momentary consideration later, I decided to focus on Elves first, for three reasons. First, I already had a rudimentary understanding of the Phoenixes, making the incremental information less valuable, especially since I had direct access to one of them. Second, I could focus on Elves while letting Emma think that she had managed to trick me about her real employer, which would have been useful. </p><p>However, the most important reason was that Emma only knew about one Phoenix, who, clearly, was not aligned with the real faction, which was currently with dark families. </p><p>“Tell me everything you know about Elves,” I ordered her even as I pulled my fingers out once more, glistening with her juices. </p><p>“I - I don’t know much—” she stammered, only to be cut when she received another spank. </p><p>“I didn’t ask you how much you knew, I ordered you to tell everything you know,” I said, squeezing her reddening flesh — just slightly, as too much pain could easily trigger her climax as well thanks to her growing streak of submissiveness. </p><p>“Elves are the rulers of an Empire that spans over many worlds,” she spilled. “However, they don’t rule most of those worlds directly, but through puppets, and they want to make Empire a puppet as well.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said. “And how strong they are?” </p><p>“They are supposed to be much stronger than us, but other than that, I don’t know,” she answered. “They are experts of magic, however.” </p><p>“How interesting,” I said, impressed by the confidence that radiated from her tone as she shared the information. I guessed she learned those details from the Phoenix, which, ultimately, making the accuracy of the information doubtful. </p><p>Still, it was much better than anything I had before. And, seeing the wards they had left in the palace, I had no doubt about their individual strength. However, the strength of their nation, especially when combined with their already existing access didn’t make much sense. </p><p>Unless there was something that was preventing them from bringing their full power, or even a decent fraction of their power, against our world. I wondered whether Emma knew about the reason. “And, pray tell, why don’t they just come and attack us if they are that strong?” </p><p>“I - I don’t know, but my guess is there are other races in similar strength, helping us to resist their invasion,” she suggested. </p><p>I barely held back my laughter as she said those words. She was clearly insinuating that Phoenixes were responsible for defending us without actually telling me so. Luckily for her, I could recognize the sudden shift in her tone, marking that as a lie. </p><p>At least, she wasn’t stupid enough to actually believe Phoenixes were some kind of benevolent force to counter Elves. That level of stupidity would have made her a big liability, rather than her current self-serving traitorous instincts, making her easy to predict. </p><p>Stupid was impossible to predict. </p><p>“I see, we might be lucky, then,” I murmured, letting her think that I had believed her argument. There was no point arguing about the intent of the Phoenixes, especially since Emma was in no position to know what really drove those two giants. </p><p>However, as she answered my questions, she was slowly getting used to the weight of the pleasure, her answers turning more coherent. </p><p>Unacceptable, I decided with a smirk, even as I let my fingers caress her body, slowly climbing up. When I reached her chest, however, my hands slipped under her body, my fingers landing around her beautiful breasts, massaging them softly. “Good girl,” I whispered into her ear, combining it with a strategic squeezing of her hard nipples. </p><p>The moment the combined assault of my whisper and my fingers hit her, she started to tremble, helpless under the deluge of pleasure as the climax I had been denying her for the last several minutes hit her. </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to recover, and even then, it was just her gaze as she managed to turn just enough to catch my gaze while I hovered over her body, positioning myself strategically. </p><p>Despite the trembles that were holding her hostage, she managed to raise her hips, prepared for my invasion. “Good girl,” I whispered again even as I slipped inside her, enjoying the way her wetness wrapped around my girth. </p><p>A moan escaped her lips as I pushed deeper into her core, wet enough to easily swallow my presence after the earlier treatment. Her hands landed on her pillow, squeezing them hard as the pleasure of my movement hit her. </p><p>I grabbed her shoulders, tightening my grip before I suddenly exploded into motion, drilling her without a warning. The sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room as I rammed her as fast as I could manage. Her moans were quick to rise, mixing with the clapping sound, despite her attempts to bury her face to her pillow to muffle her cries. </p><p>“No, I want to hear your voice, slut,” I ordered even as I grabbed her beautiful hair, pulling back painfully, which only enhanced the intensity of her pleasure-filled moans. And just to drive the moment even deeper, I conjured a mirror in front of me, allowing me to make eye contact with her. </p><p>Her beautiful emerald eyes met with mine for a fleeting moment before she avoided my gaze, dazed, not knowing where to look. It was amusing that despite everything, she was too shy to maintain eye contact at the moment. </p><p>“So, where were we?” I asked suddenly, not reducing my pace even slightly. </p><p>“Where we, what?” she managed to stammer. </p><p>“About this Elvish Empire that was about to invade us, of course,” I said. “They clearly want to invade us, but other than another, mysteriously altruistic, inter-dimensional Empire, what’s stopping them from directly invading our lands?” </p><p>“I don’t—“ she started, her expression shouting a lie, so I spanked her ass preemptively, warning her. “There’s something about some kind of path, they need to be open for them to enter.” </p><p>That caused me to stop for a moment, a chill spreading through my heart, remembering Sapphire explaining to Aria how she needed Eternal Core to open the Pathways, so that she could deal with the crisis at the North. At that moment, I was ready to dismiss that as a part of her political struggles and nothing else. </p><p>After all, the sudden silence — and possible destruction — of a few tiny forts was nothing too important for me.</p><p>A chill filled my heart as I realized that, without noticing those wards in the throne room, I could have easily lent the Core to her at one point for her to handle — or more likely, might have used it myself to access to North, hoping to use the information as leverage against Sapphire. </p><p>What a fucking close call. </p><p>Luckily, I was more experienced in suppressing my emotions than Emma was able to detect them, so, after a fleeting second, I started moving with a renewed heat. </p><p>And I would be lying if the pleasure helped me to suppress the fear of a close disaster. There was no guarantee that her claim about the Pathway was correct — she believed that she was telling the truth, but her source was doubtful — but sometimes, interrogation and spy work was more about instinct than certainty. </p><p>And the possibility that the Pathways were a great trap, waiting to be strong was threatening enough as a possibility. </p><p>“How interesting,” I murmured instead. “And do you have any idea about what this path is?” </p><p>“N-no,” she moaned, struggling as the pleasure invaded her being whole. Unfortunately, I believed her, which essentially ended the interrogation. </p><p>Well, the functional part of the interrogation, I corrected even as I sped up, enjoying her moans.  Just because I was out of questions to ask without spooking her didn’t mean that I had to stop, after all… </p><p>x</p>",

    "content": "<p>Three days after Theodora’s visit, I was once again preparing to step into the arena, this time with an exhausted expression on my face. The reason for it was simple, yet complicated at the same time. </p><p>After that particular victory, my arena schedule suddenly exploded into a new level, forcing me to fight multiple times a day, feeding me a great number of potions to keep me in fighting shape. </p><p>Master Antonius was next to me, looking at me with a kind expression. “Are you sure you can fight again? The last few days had been really exhausting. If we push for it, maybe we can cancel it. Of course, it would not help your reputation, and delay your freedom significantly…” </p><p>“No need,” I answered, pushing my chest proudly, acting like I was too prideful to notice his weak manipulation. “I can handle it.” </p><p>“If you think so,” Antonius said, a kind expression on his face, but despite his superficial smile, I could see the coldness in his eyes. “Again, I’m sorry about the schedule, but the pressure coming from the other schools is very difficult to counter.” </p><p>His gaze reminded me of my uncle, which would have been enough to break all the trust I had felt toward him… </p><p>If I had an ounce of trust in him in the first place. </p><p>Technically, we had a deal, but a deal between a slave and an owner, especially when the said deal was verbal, had less weight than a breath, and that was before he suddenly decided to force me to a very intense schedule for the last couple of days. Clearly, he didn’t appreciate dealing with his ‘lesser’ no matter the circumstances, or the immensity of help he received. </p><p>Not that his entitlement surprised me. </p><p>“Go through one last check-up before the fight, just in case. We don’t want anything to happen to you, you’re important,” he said before patting my shoulder, while a healer walked toward me, and a glow appeared around me in an instant, his healing energy infusing into my body. </p><p>Or at least, that was what I let the healer think, as tricking his magical diagnosis was ridiculously easy for a Sorcerer. My body had too many secrets for someone else to access. The diagnostic only showed the normal body of a warrior that’s on the edge of a breakdown, running on fumes. </p><p>And the healer just nodded with a smile. “Everything is in order, just the energy levels are a bit low. Maybe a potion before the battle.” </p><p>And that was the other reason I didn’t trust them. With the information his spell provided, any half-competent healer would have immediately called for a week-long bed rest coupled with a strong potion regiment for recovery, because I was faking that my vitality was burning up to keep me on my feet. </p><p>Of course, considering he pulled a bottle filled with a glowing potion, one that would overdraft my potential to keep me upright for a few more days, the reason he didn’t follow with the correct treatment was obvious. </p><p>The glint in Antonius’ eyes even as I drank the potion was all the evidence that the earlier talk was nonsense. The pressure from the other schools was a good excuse, of course, but their intentional drive to kill me — slowly, and not before profiting from it completely — clearly indicated something different. </p><p>Then, I felt the impact of the potion, and barely prevented a frown from invading my face. The potion was stronger than I expected, forcibly trying to awaken my potential even more intensely. However, this time, something was different, because, with such intensity, there was no guarantee that I could even last until the end of the fight — if I had been just a barbarian slave, of course. </p><p>Suppressing the potion was as easy as tricking the healer, even as I gave them a show of perking of, ready for an aggressive battle. </p><p>Unfortunately, resolving their trick didn’t bring me any closer to understanding their sudden change of attitude. I wasn’t naive enough to think that, just because I managed to help the owner by killing one of their opponents and defeating the Nemean lion, they would be grateful to me. Expecting gratitude from a man using another’s death for entertainment was simply stupid. </p><p>What he was doing was clear. He was clearly killing me slowly in an effort to maximize his own benefits before he got rid of me. Even his betrayal to our agreement was not surprising, as I expected it to happen ultimately. </p><p>That still left the question of why. Why, instead of trying to use me for a few months, maybe even a year, he was trying to use me explosively, risking my burning. </p><p>What had changed? </p><p>Unfortunately, cheers rose from the arena, suggesting it was the time for my match, making me abandon that track of thought. “Are you ready?” Antonius said. “This battle is very important.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, Lanista. there’s no one that can defeat me,” I said as I slapped my chest proudly, once again playing my role as a barbarian. </p><p>“Good to hear. Then go out, and handle your fight, but try to take down your enemy slowly. If you show signs of exhaustion, it would be easier for me to stop them forcing this many battles for you.” </p><p>“As you wish, Lanista,” I said, only a lifetime practice of hiding my homicidal emotions thanks to my dear uncle preventing me from stabbing the asshole with the spear in my hand. Of course, his desire for extended battle was clearly about something other than my wellbeing, like the wanted me to give an amazing show, before collapsing helplessly. </p><p>His old face wrinkled further with an ugly smile despite his best attempts to look fatherly. “Go and make me proud,” he ordered. </p><p>As I walked through the tunnel, I barely prevented myself from shaking my head in dismissal. It was unbelievable just how easily he was able to convince himself that I had swallowed every bit of his lies despite just a few days ago, I had explicitly told him that I was more complicated than just another barbarian. </p><p>And I thought people had been underestimating me just because I was a bastard. It was nothing compared to the underestimation I received as a barbarian and as a slave. Not that I was complaining. It made it much easier to screw them up in the end. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until the day he learned that particular lesson by my hands. </p><p>The cheers exploded around me as I stepped into Colosseum, as each victory increased the number of fans. My eyes run through the crowd, only to notice some familiar figures on one of the most important seats. Olivia and Atia, two high-class beauties, were looking at me. Olivia had a smug, confident expression on, while Atia’s gaze was a mixture of shyness and concern. </p><p>Interestingly, Marcus was still with them, looking down with a smug expression on his face, no doubt enjoying his lofty position, looking down on me like I was a bug. Since I had already taken what he wanted — not that he was aware of that little fact — his gaze didn’t bother me. </p><p>Instead, I turned my gaze to the other end of the open sand field, where several beasts were jumping out of the tunnels. It was a huge snake, easily twenty feet long, thick enough that I couldn’t wrap my arms around it. </p><p>I didn’t recognize its species, but with the obvious magic that was radiating from it, it was clearly magical, though, luckily, not enough to actually be classified as an ethereal beast. </p><p>Even then, I tightened my hands around the spear even as the beast opened its mouth, revealing two large fangs, glistening with drops of venom. It was surprising for a beast of this size to actually have venom, and I had no intention of testing it directly. </p><p>One good thing about fighting beasts almost exclusively — a perk I earned by making an enemy out of a Gladiator school famous for raising beasts — was that I didn’t have to think too deep about other unlucky slaves just to make a show. </p><p>And if there was one bad thing, it was the reckless aggression that came with their training method. The snake barely wasted any time coiling before moving forward with an impressive speed, fast enough to catch me surprised as I managed to roll away only barely despite my reflexes. </p><p>Luckily, that great speed was not without its cost, as it hit against the wall with a great crash, accompanied by panicked cries of the nearest observers, but the magical protection was enough to negate the damage. </p><p>It still left the snake dazed enough for me to sneak toward it.</p><p>I delivered a stab to its tail before it react. It barely left a scratch, and I managed to roll back — but not before its tail jerked, delivering a painful hit to my ribs. Which was a surprise. The weapon they gave me should have been strong enough to actually penetrate through the scales. The mystery was getting deeper. </p><p>I spent the next couple minutes, doing my best to dance around the snake as I delivered some shallow wounds that barely impeded the beast. Then, I reached the point the potion would lose its effectiveness. </p><p>The snake lunged again, and I rolled back, making a great show of stumbling away even as the audience gasped in shock — though quite a number of them cheered as well. I had generated many fans during my short yet fancy career, but not everyone liked heroes to succeed. </p><p>Some enjoyed their destruction, and the sudden hit of the beast gave them hope. </p><p>I tried to stumble away, like my strength was completely drained. It charged forward again, I only avoided the hit halfway, sending me rolling away, making the audience even louder. Meanwhile, my gaze turned to a special place in the audience, catching the expression of one important person. </p><p>Master Antonius, who was watching the fight with a small smile on his face, gave me exactly what I was looking for with my slow show. </p><p>“Just as I expected,” I murmured even as I stood up. His earlier actions were already suspicious, and the fact that he didn’t give me an appropriate weapon that could cut through its scales was worse. </p><p>All that was needed to be determined was whether he was actually rooting for my death, or he was just uncaring of the consequences. Luckily, that was an easy mystery to solve. </p><p>The next time the snake coiled before jumping toward me, I didn’t try to dodge, but waited still until the last moment, and stabbed my spear through the roof of its mouth, and its momentum handled the rest, the perfect desperate last stand of a collapsing gladiator. </p><p>Oh, it wasn’t without a cost, as while the spear prevented it from biting me, it still managed to slam me against the wall, which hurt despite all my physical prowess. </p><p>However, it was a worthy exchange to see the sudden shock on Master Antonius’ face, whose mood was destroyed by my sudden victory. Apparently, my dear owner wanted me dead very determinedly… </p><p>How very interesting, I thought even as I rose to my feet while the audience cheered, making a show of wounded exhaustion. I just needed to decide how to react… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Using the platform rather than one of the usual elementals I preferred to use, the journey to Silver Spires took more than two hours rather than the usual minutes, but at least, it was a more comfortable ride. </p><p>Pity that my reluctant guest was not in a mood to experiment, and kept her mouth shut other than occasional attempts to probe me about my employer, and I didn’t do anything other than deflecting her. </p><p>Then, Silver Spires entered our field of vision. “And we’re at our destination,” I said, even as I noted her distaste while she looked at the school. It was clearly below her mysteriously high standards. </p><p>Though, it might be also about the battle damage on the walls, still being repaired. </p><p>She said nothing even as I drove the platform to the ground before I let it dissipate. She looked at me questioningly. “I’m afraid we’re going to cover the rest of the distance by walking,” I said. “And before you ask, no you can’t transform unless you want to shout your location to our lovely adversaries.” </p><p>“I know,” she growled in annoyance, the rumbling it created enough to remind her that she was a dragon. </p><p>The rest of the walk passed silently even as I led her to sneak through the defensive wards, their damaged state making it even easier to pass through. The moment I entered the school, however, a magical message from the headmistress arrived, telling me to bring the dragon to a special basement building, rather than her office. </p><p>Interesting, I thought even as I guided her toward the location the headmistress suggested. It was the first time she arranged a meeting outside her tower, which forced me to reevaluate a few assumptions about her location. Maybe I had misread just how dependent she was on the coverage of her tower. </p><p>With that in mind, we passed through the specified entrance, only to find ourselves in a dim tunnel going down, the route itself confusing. </p><p>“What a weird tunnel,” the dragon murmured as we moved deeper. “Those wards feel familiar…” </p><p>I said nothing, though I could easily understand her concern. The sensation of the wards was rather irregular, making us lose the sense of direction as we walked. I had no doubt that, if I hadn’t saved her life twice, my guest would have been rebelling against the idea of following deeper into a mysterious tunnel. </p><p>As I moved deeper, my sense of direction started to disappear, forcing me to stretch my Perception stat to the limit to maintain it. However, it was when I felt the partial block on the system, once again preventing me from communicating efficiently, I recognized the source of the ward. </p><p>She was using Darkness Divine Spark to create the ward. </p><p>Interestingly, while the tunnel had several twists and turns, ultimately, we ended up under her tower, forcing me to revisit my assumptions once again, including why she would spend all that effort just to hide the fact. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t answered immediately when I finally reached the destination, directly under the tower. It was a huge room, with an unnecessarily high ceiling — unless one planned for a dragon to reside there in the first place. </p><p>However, despite being a basement, the room wasn’t poorly furnished. On the contrary, there was a nice living room on the corner, mostly using the same crystal for the construction, but also using very expensive-looking blue and black fabrics. But that part was just a detail compared to a huge crystal pool, large enough for a dragon to rest comfortably. </p><p>One thing that surprised me was, however, was the mana density of the room. The air was thick with mana, and the pool was even thicker. Though, a glance at the wards that supported the process suggested that the process wouldn’t deliver as much mana as I had been transferring, which was a benefit. </p><p>Of course, my guest didn’t glance around, looking at the hooded figure that was standing on the other end of the room. “You can go,” the headmistress said, gesturing me to leave. </p><p>The dragon glanced at me, but didn’t comment, even as I turned and left the room. </p><p>Not permanently, of course, as I was far too curious about listening to the discussion. And since I was able to sneak into the headmistress’ private room, sneaking to the basement was hardly a challenge. There was only one problem, that if I suddenly disappeared from the wards, the headmistress would have been suspicious. </p><p>Meaning, I had to leave the tunnel first before coming back. The process had been rather smooth, though it cost me several precious minutes, especially on the path to return, where I had to carefully sneak through the wards without alerting the headmistress. </p><p>When I arrived at the room, creating a tiny hole in the wall, the view surprised me. </p><p>The headmistress had long removed her robe, revealing her armored state, with a sword on her back. However, despite her pose, she was sitting on a chair. And the dragon, still in her human form, was sitting across her, a chair between them. </p><p>However, the interesting thing was their expressions. Considering the relative power balance of a headmistress with a school under her command, compared to a lost dragon that was cut all kinds of support, hunted by a faction of the Eternals. </p><p>Their expressions told a different story. The dragon leaned back, confident, while the headmistress was lost in her thoughts, her eyebrows creased. It was the most worried I had ever seen her, even compared to when she was alone. </p><p>“It’s not like you have a lot of options, little bird,” said the dragon, her mocking tone surprising me. “It’s not like you can just go back and ask the assistance of the God of Light, not after your little grubby fingers reached something you shouldn’t have.” </p><p>How interesting, I thought. There was no doubt about what she was talking about. There was only one reasonable probability considering the speed at which she had been discovered. </p><p>Divine Spark of Light. </p><p>I had already been suspicious of the headmistress’ attempts to absorb the Divine Spark, as it was clearly something above her power level, but, looking at their relative attitude, it was not only deeply forbidden, but also clearly not going well. </p><p>“Still, asking me to change sides…” the headmistress murmured indecisively. </p><p>“You should have thought of that before trying to devour something you can’t handle,” the dragon cut in, smugly. “But I shouldn’t be surprised by it. For all of your supposed loyalty, you little birds are always quick to rebel at the slightest opening. Just like-” she continued, only for the headmistress to cut her off angry. </p><p>“I’m nothing like her!” she shouted, power radiating off her in waves, Divine Spark mixing with her mana. </p><p>“Calm down, I’m joking,” the dragon said, taking the headmistress’ explosion in stride. “Though, with the ease you’re willing to use a spark of darkness…” she added, her words fading as the headmistress tensed like she was about to attack. </p><p>The dragon stopped, because, luckily, despite her arrogance, she was smart enough not to excessively antagonize one that controlled her current residence  Instead, she looked around, examining the mana in the room, including the small pieces of Divine Spark her opponent slowly pulling back. Interestingly, she didn’t make an attempt to devour them. </p><p>I wondered if it was just about her respect — or fear — or it wasn’t something she could handle in the first place. </p><p>The dragon continued talking after taking a moment to calm herself. “You don’t have a lot of time to decide. You’re already leaking Divine Spark. A year at most, and you’ll lose the ability to control it and it’ll burn you.”</p><p>“Are you sure your master could help me?” the headmistress said hesitantly, after a long pause. </p><p>“She has achieved much more challenging activities than that. And more importantly, she’s not a miser like that old codger. She’ll only ask for a very reasonable payment.” </p><p>I had no idea who the dragon was referring to, but I was sure that whoever she was, she wouldn’t be that generous. People in power never were, especially when one reached them was utterly helpless. </p><p>The headmistress must share my opinion, because rather than answering immediately, she decided to delay, though, the delay itself was enough to show just how big her need was, so much that she didn’t even try to threaten the dragon. </p><p>And, compared with the sudden change of her earlier ploy and her current attitude, it suggested that the dragon had an extraordinary identity, much bigger than the headmistress had been expecting. </p><p>“It’s a big decision, I need time to think,” the headmistress finally admitted. </p><p>“Take as much as time as you need,” the dragon answered with mocking laughter. “It’s not me under the risk of exploding a year.” </p><p>The headmistress stood up, like she was about to leave, but the dragon spoke again. “Not before arranging some amenities for me, of course,” the dragon added. </p><p>“As you wish,” the headmistress answered between her clenched teeth, barely able to spit out her words. “But we don’t have a lot in this dimension, not with the system constantly devouring any natural treasure.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it,” the dragon said with a chuckle. “You just need to arrange more mana flow to my residence.” </p><p>“I can do that, but there are limits. We can’t weaken the wards too much, or the defenses will fall, and you’ll be revealed,” she reminded. </p><p>“Don’t worry, just as much as you can arrange. And one other thing,” she added, her playfully vicious smirk giving me an idea of what was going to follow. “I just need a servant to handle mundane activities for me. Cleaning, preparing my food, and other mundane activities. The boy that helped me earlier looks like a good worker. Arrange that for me, please?” </p><p>“But—“ the headmistress started, only for her words to fade when she caught her opponent's expression. “I’ll arrange it,” she resigned, adding another role to my already complicated resume. </p><p>How fascinating… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 7750 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I felt weird as I prepared to leave the tunnels, relaxed, which was a great contrast to my earlier feelings, especially when those wards suddenly appeared. </p><p>Sometimes, it was easier to avoid the combat than pointlessly seeking the challenge, even though it earned a dismissive glare from my reluctant companion. “Turn your back,” she ordered. </p><p>“Why?” I asked. </p><p>“I need to transform.” </p><p>“No,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean, no?” she said. “Do you expect me to walk?”</p><p>“An emerald dragon soaring through skies is hard to miss. So unless you want to get caught for the third time…” </p><p>She let out a frustrated growl, but luckily, she didn’t continue with the transformation. Her confident expression, however, twisted when I started walking toward the entrance, not even bothering to talk to her. </p><p>I smiled when I heard her footsteps, hurried as she followed me. “W-wait,” she stammered as I started to move away. I turned, doing my best to look surprised and hiding the satisfaction I felt. I needed her to follow me, but asking her directly would have given her the initiative, something I wasn’t entirely willing to. Not because I wanted to succeed for the headmistress, but because a talk between the two would resolve a lot of my questions. </p><p>“Yes?” </p><p>“Are you going to just leave?” she asked, clearly surprised that I didn’t offer to accompany her.</p><p>“Well, since the wards are gone, I can retreat,” I said, acting ignorant of what she was implying. </p><p>“Are you going to leave me alone?” she said, crossing her arms in an entitled manner. It was an annoying attitude, but her arms crossed under her tits, pushing them to an amazing level, especially with her short frame. </p><p>“I’m not heartless, you can come with me if you want, I’m sure my employer would appreciate meeting with you,” I offered, though I kept my tone simple, like I wouldn’t be affected by her decision either way. Her eyes glowed even more with fury, clearly not appreciating my dismissive attitude. </p><p>She said nothing, but as I continued to walk, she followed, which was better than any acceptance. </p><p>Her silence didn’t last long as she noticed the direction I was taking, using the tunnels to go even deeper rather than going to the surface. “Aren’t we supposed to leave?” </p><p>“We will,” I said even as I reached to the edge of the tunnel, using my wards to make sure there was no one nearby, and I started casting a spell, summoning one of my fake elemental mounts, this time an earth elemental, to allow us to travel underground for a while, at least until we were reasonably away from Mount Doom, in case they had spies observing the mountain despite the fake dragons that flew away. </p><p>The reaction of my guest, however, was completely unexpected. “What are you doing, you madman!’ she exclaimed even as she raised her hands, her mana gathering into a mana spike, dangerous enough to send shivers over my skin. </p><p>Interestingly, she was not targeting me, but my spell. </p><p>“Are you mad!” she gasped after my spell was destroyed. </p><p>“About what, exactly?” I said. “I was just creating us a mount.” </p><p>“And you decided to summon an elemental to do it! There are easier ways to kill yourself!” </p><p>“It’s just a fake elemental, what’s the big deal?” I said. </p><p>“There’s no such thing as a fake elemental!” she growled. “Any physical body you create is just an invitation for them to possess. Who even taught you it’s a good idea!” </p><p>Considering the number of times I had used that trick to travel, it was clearly not a problem, especially since no one that saw me commented on it. Meanwhile, her reaction suggested that doing so was a certain disaster. “I have used that trick many times,” I explained. </p><p>“Impossible!” </p><p>“It’s a difference due to the System,” I said, making a wild guess, though it was a confident guess. </p><p>If the System could prevent Gods from appearing in its domain, why should it allow true elementals to appear? </p><p>“Really?” she murmured, her earlier fervor immediately turning into hesitation. “It even prevents intervention of Elementals? How?” </p><p>My answer was a simple shrug. I had no idea how the System worked despite my experiments, and I had no problems admitting it. “It prevents Gods from intervening. Is it too surprising that it blocks Elementals as well?” </p><p>“I guess not,” she murmured, looking thoughtful for a moment before her determination came back. Though, from her tone, I got the impression that Elementals weren’t too far below gods in the totem pole, which was a scary thought. “Still, I have no intention of riding an elemental back.” </p><p>However, even as she delivered it petulantly, I noticed she was having trouble suppressing her trembles. She was clearly having trouble suppressing her instinctual fear. </p><p>“As you wish, as long as you are willing to walk the distance like a peasant,” I countered, curious which one she would pick. </p><p>“I will walk,” she said, not even spending a second on the insult. Maybe she was afraid of the elementals even more than I assumed. What an interesting nugget of information. </p><p>“I was joking,” I said, quick to answer even as I conjured another vehicle, this time a simple arcana platform with two chairs. It was not only slower than the elemental mount, but also it cost much more mana.</p><p>[-2692 Mana]</p><p>Luckily, I had the luxury to waste mana.  </p><p>“But it’s going to be much slower,” I warned even as I gestured her to take a seat after sitting, and started moving, without bothering to wait for an answer, the platform creating a brand new tunnel as it moved. </p><p>“Why didn’t you use it earlier?” she asked. “It’s clearly easier than creating the tunnels directly.” </p><p>“Platform has a bigger magical signature, so it’s easier to detect magically. If I tried to use that, even with the intervention of the wards, they would have discovered our location.” </p><p>She nodded, but said nothing as we continued to travel underground. It took several minutes for us to finally get out of the mountain, and since I wasn’t using the most direct route toward Silver Spires, I wasn’t afraid of having observers that would detect us. </p><p>I still send a wave of detection magic just to make sure, of course, but luckily, there was no one else around. “Ah, fresh air,” the dragon murmured as we pushed out, a smile appearing on her face. </p><p>As a dragon, she clearly didn’t appreciate staying underground. Understandable as she could fly with her own power. </p><p>“Yeah, it’s a nice change,” I said. </p><p>“Really, I could have sworn you’re part-rabbit, with the ease you are having underground.” I shrugged at her juvenile insult, amused by her effort more than anything. Silence stretched for some more before I sent a magical message to the headmistress — well, to her office, but essentially the same — saying to her that despite some challenges, I managed to save the dragon from a surprise Eternal presence, and we’re coming back. </p><p>“What was that?” she asked the moment I sent the message, not exactly trying to sound mysterious. </p><p>“I informed my employer about our unexpected guest, of course. It’s not something you want to surprise.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured. “Who is your employer?” </p><p>Once again, her tone was calm, but I didn’t miss the undercurrent of hesitancy. Despite her attitude, she was smart enough to realize that meeting with the headmistress was an action that was hard to come back from, losing the initiative completely. So, she was trying to interrogate me subtly, without making me alert. The fact that she waited until I had sent the message, giving her an excuse to talk about it, was the best sign of it.</p><p>“Don’t worry, the headmistress is a nice woman, if a bit ambitious. I’m sure you two can come to an agreement,” I said. </p><p>“How nice?” she asked, trying to sound nonchalant, but after being captured twice, her hesitancy wasn’t surprising. The interesting thing was the casual attitude she was trying to force despite the importance of the question. Clearly, she prioritized her pride over her safety. </p><p>“Well, she likes to show off, but ultimately, she’s a fair leader. Not to mention there’s no love lost between her and the Eternals or the undead, so I’m sure she would appreciate helping another enemy of theirs, as long as you approach the cooperation with an open mind,” I suggested, knowing that those stock words were completely useless. </p><p>I wasn’t well-intentioned in my assessment, as a seamless cooperation between them was hardly to my benefit. I wanted both of them to dance around each other, hesitant, reliant on me to facilitate the cooperation. </p><p>At this point, the headmistress was reasonably convinced of my loyalty. And I had saved my current passenger’s life twice, from almost-certain death, which should be enough for her to trust me more than the headmistress unless there was a much stronger connection between them — which I doubted, as if that had been the case, the headmistress would have given me a much more detailed assignment. </p><p>Manipulating two to maximize my benefits was not the nicest thing to do, but, considering neither of the two mysterious ladies respected me enough to actually tell me their names, I wasn’t exactly concerned about it. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 5293 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After I passed the keys to the valet, I turned, my gaze on the faces of my two beauties, enjoying their matching hesitation. The lakeside adventure left its mark on them, and following that with a day where they had to give an impressive variation of suggestively sexy poses hardly helped to reduce their tenseness. </p><p>Especially since both of them were too hesitant to talk about it in the first place. </p><p>“A good place to spend the evening, right?” I said as I gestured to the building that looked over the city just like the name indicated. Admittedly, it wasn’t the most tasteful architectural structure, but the luxuries hidden inside were enough to compensate for that little blunder. </p><p>Penny said nothing, just looking at the hotel, fascinated. Coming from a small town, she was unfamiliar with the siren call of luxury. </p><p>“Are you sure you can afford it?” Nancy mumbled, though her gaze was no less fascinated. She might not have come from a rural area, but she never had the income that would allow her to enjoy any kind of luxury. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, I have already arranged it,” I said, neglecting to mention that it was the reward points that earned us the momentary glimpse into the luxury. No need to diminish the awe they were feeling. </p><p>Unprepared for a night stay, we didn’t have a lot of luggage, but the bellboys were still quick to swarm over and pick them up. Not too enthusiastic considering the car I was driving, but still. </p><p>“Why don’t you girls go for the elevator, and I’ll be there the moment I pick up the key,” I said. They nodded, and I started walking. </p><p>I had sent them beforehand, because of the receptionist. A cute brunette. Normally, I wouldn’t be bothered, but the longing gaze she had as she looked at the camera that was hanging on my shoulder. </p><p>Recognizing the longing gaze of an aspiring model was an elementary skill, and without the girls, I was sure to swing an upgrade at least. </p><p>Maybe something more… </p><p> “I’m here to check-in,” I said, making sure to sound tired even as I flicked the camera. </p><p>“Tough day?” she asked. </p><p>“Definitely. You can’t imagine how exhausting it is to herd a couple of entitled models all day,” I said, sounding fed up. </p><p>“Oh, you’re a professional?” she said, trying to sound nonchalant, but failing to do so. Meanwhile, I passed her my ID, and after a few clicks, her eyes widened, no doubt realizing just how many countries I had been to for the last year. </p><p>Of course, they were all for the job I had been fired from, but that was hardly the thing to share with her, right?</p><p>“Unfortunately so,” I answered, and she looked at me questioningly, shocked at my vehemence. “It’s a nice job, but after a long day of work, it gets a touch exhausting, especially with the professional models. I really miss working with aspiring models,” I said, throwing a hook at her. </p><p>Her voice was considerably higher as she answered, unable to suppress her enthusiasm. “Oh, really?” </p><p>“Of course. The aspiring models, at least ones that recognize the opportunity and work hard without a complaint rather than doing their best to copy the smugness of a diva, are a delight to work with.” </p><p>“I’m actually trying to be a model as well,” she said, trying to sound serious. </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured, examining her face carefully for half a minute, until her enthusiastic smile started to disappear. “I can definitely see it,” I said even as I pulled a business card from my pocket. “Actually, why don’t we have a test shot, I should have a free slot in two weeks. Unless one of the divas suddenly decided to change the date, we can work it. As long as you’re open to travel, of course.” </p><p>“I might,” she said, her enthusiasm hitting back, only to disappear just as quick as she processed just how non-committal my recommendation was. She typed a few seconds before raising her head once again. “Maybe we can have a test shoot tonight?” she whispered. “If you’re not too tired, of course.” </p><p>“I would have loved it,” I answered, doing my best to look regretful, and her smile fell, realizing her opportunity was slipping. Perfect time to drive the dagger, I realized. “Unfortunately, I have been in those regular rooms before, and they are too small to have a proper shoot. I need a higher ceiling to properly set up the light.” </p><p>She took a deep breath to suppress her brewing excitement, thinking she had just found her big break opportunity. She typed her keyboard a couple of times. “It’s your lucky day,” she suddenly murmured. “We have an upgrade for you.” </p><p>“Oh, what a nice coincidence. Which one?” I asked despite being fully aware of which one was the target. I had been to the hotel, and there was only one floor with higher than the usual ceiling.  </p><p>“Our grand suite, actually,” she whispered as she leaned forward, trying to keep her voice whisper. I understood the reason for it, as no doubt she was pushing for that upgrade. She was important, but not that important. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “You have my number, and send me a message. We’ll arrange a meeting time.” With that, I turned and left, leaving an excited cute brunette behind me. </p><p>I didn’t feel guilty, because the offer wasn’t even a lie. Due to the loose clothing she was wearing, I wasn’t able to make a good judgment on her body, her face was certainly beautiful enough to get some success. </p><p>If she was willing to put the time, of course.</p><p>I walked to meet with the girls, who were waiting for me in front of the elevator. Luckily, the elevator area wasn’t directly visible from the reception. I didn’t want my latest model candidate to realize I had two models accompanying me. </p><p>I wanted to keep that part as a surprise. </p><p>“Which floor?” Nancy asked as we stepped into the elevator. </p><p>“The top floor, of course,” I said, smirking widely. </p><p>“Really,” Penny interjected while Nancy sent a suspicious glare, aware of the price such a location would go. “Three rooms on the top floor? How did you afford it?” </p><p>I chuckled even as I wrapped my arm around her waist. “Who told you that there would be three rooms.” </p><p>“We have only two rooms?” Nancy said, though her tone betrayed that she realized where I was driving at. I chuckled. “Just one,” she said, her panic growing. </p><p>“Is it a problem, after everything?” I asked, which put a huge blush on her face. </p><p>“One room for three people? I’m afraid it won’t be comfortable,” she said, quick to find a different explanation. Before she could comment further, the elevator stopped.</p><p>I quickly moved to our room, unlocking it with a flick, gesturing them to walk forward. “Do you think it’s enough,” I said, enjoying the simultaneous gasps as they took the view of the room. </p><p>“It’s amazing,” Nancy gasped as she walked around, taking the sight of the luxury room. Nancy clearly shared the same approach, but she reacted by freezing in shock. </p><p>Their reaction was understandable, as the grand suite definitely lived to its reputation. It was a touch too gauche for my tastes, going more for a showy classical approach rather than a more understated modern style, but they compensated that by embracing that extravaganza perfectly. And with a large bedroom, a connected living room, a huge bathroom, with a tub large enough to almost classify as a pool. </p><p>I watched them walk around the room, almost in a daze, before chuckling. “So, do you think we’ll be able to fit comfortably? </p><p>“I guess,” Nancy murmured, not happy that her excuse had been destroyed spectacularly.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I slapped her ass. “Why don’t you be a dear and start preparing the bath, we definitely need one after everything. </p><p>“W-we?” Nancy suddenly stammered, though Penny’s expression showed she shared her attitude. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I pointed at the bath. “Look at the size of that thing, it can easily comfort all three of us.” </p><p>“Size isn’t a problem.” </p><p>“And what is the problem,” I said mockingly even as I took a large step forward Penny, closing in the distance as I slipped my hands under her costume to caress her naked stomach for a moment before slipping them down, quickly unbuttoning her pants and pulling them down, revealing her suspiciously-damp panties. “Don’t tell me you’re worried you can’t handle a touch of nudity, after everything today.” </p><p>Nancy’s rebellious streak didn’t disappoint. “Of course not,” she assured before she could even realize what she had said, and her pride, preventing her from taking her words back, preventing her from saying anything else. </p><p>While she moved to her task, I turned to Penny. “Let’s prepare you for the bath,”  I said as I pulled off her top, which, thanks to the absence of a bra, left her spectacular breasts free for my attention… </p>",
