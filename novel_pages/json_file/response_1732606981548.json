    "content": "<p>I didn’t particularly hurry to rush forward, as the bathroom lock was conveniently broken thanks to Carly’s earlier pointless explosion. Nor I bothered to delay. </p><p>Not like I wanted her to undress before I walked on her. </p><p>That part was already handled.</p><p>When I took a step inside, she was yet to step under the shower, because she was busy looking around herself with an annoyed expression. </p><p>I would have loved to blame her for being a snob, but considering even after a year I found the bathroom pointlessly small, it was hardly her fault. Worse, the bathroom was currently a mess after Maria’s long shower. </p><p>Just a glance at the careless mess that was left behind, I could tell that Maria was someone who lived with at least half a dozen servants, maids, and other attendants cleaning after her, enough to actually get my attention for a fleeting moment despite the beautiful sight in my field of view. </p><p>I wasn’t even exaggerating. The level of the mess she created in the tiny bathroom with almost nothing inside was approaching miraculously. </p><p>Yet, as Carly turned toward me, I abandoned that train of thought, making a note to have a talk with Maria about cleaning after herself before dedicating my full attention to the naked blonde whose panic was returning as she realized she wasn’t alone. </p><p>“C-can I help you?” she stammered beautifully. </p><p>“Yes, you can,” I said as I grabbed the edge of my t-shirt and pulled it free. I paused for a second, letting her devour the sight of my muscular torso. It might be developed more due to my attempts to battle boredom than anything else, but I couldn’t say I didn’t enjoy her gaze. “You can share your shower with me.” </p><p>“S-share,” she stammered. “Why?” </p><p>“Because your friend wasted too much water, and we need to share if we both want to start the day fresh, of course.” Not the greatest explanation, nor the easiest solution. Luckily, she was more interested in the view that was created as I pushed my pants down, her gaze stolen by my naked shaft. </p><p>Her shock was palpable, and I let her get locked for a moment, enjoying the silence that followed. </p><p>I had my own amazing view to keep me busy. </p><p>“I-is this the best solution?” she stammered. </p><p>“Of course, I’m a scientist,” I said, unable to keep myself from delivering a jab. “And it’s not good to waste water,” I added as I took a step forward, but not before wrapping my arm around her waist and dragging her along. </p><p>She might not be convinced by the idea, but that didn’t prevent her from following my pull obediently, and just like that, I was sharing a shower with one of the greatest models in the world. </p><p>The sight of her blushing face was enough to put a big smile on my face, especially when she spoke with a stuttering tone. “Are you sure it’s a good idea…” she said, but when I touched her chin to raise her head, she was quick to abandon her arguments. </p><p>It was simply marvelous just how obedient she was being under the shower, especially when I let my expression tighten once more rather than showing my arousal on my face. </p><p>My body was handling that part excellently. </p><p>When I let her chin go, her gaze fell down, focusing on my midsection. I turned on the water, slowly letting us get damp while rubbing my own body, getting rid of the sweat I worked, and doing my best to act like it was something ordinary. </p><p>Though, I made sure to position it in a way to block the shower exit, preventing her from just escaping. She actually had to ask for permission, and to do that, she needed to handle my sharp expression. </p><p>Yet, I tried not to escalate too quickly, still remembering her earlier reaction to burst into action the moment I touched her wetness. Instead, I let her soak under the water while she constantly looked down — avoiding my sharp expression and taking note of my erection at the same time. </p><p>It was good that she avoided my gaze, because it was hard to maintain that expression while I shared a shower with her, her sexiness growing like a hurricane as her skin got wetter and wetter, making my blood go crazy with growing excitement. I would have certainly failed if I tried to maintain that expression all the way. </p><p>I let the silence stretch, broken only by the loud sound of the shower head, too loud to be actually comfortable. I had no doubt that she would have complained about that if she didn’t just receive an attitude adjustment — not to mention being appropriately distracted. </p><p>Too distracted, even, I noticed as I shuffled a bit, only to notice her gaze following my erection, almost like hypnotized. It took everything I had to contain my chuckle, amused by just how lost she was getting. </p><p>She shivered under my touch, slowly getting more and more distracted. </p><p>“Turn back,” I said without a warning as I put my hands on her shoulder, and make her move. </p><p>“W-why?” she stammered beautifully under my touch, one that was nothing to do with the potential cold considering the warm water flowing around us. </p><p>“I’m going to help you with your back, of course,” I said even as I grabbed the shower gel, but bypassed the loofah and directly poured into my hand, before I started working on her back. “No need to waste the opportunity, right?”I said. </p><p>She said nothing, but considering the direct touch, it didn’t take long for me to understand just how tense she was. Yet, it was nothing compared to an earlier encounter, so she allowed it without complaint. </p><p>Caressing her elegant shoulders with my soapy hands would have been an amazing experience even if I was back in civilization. Considering I was alone in a scientific outpost for a full year, it was literally one notch below heaven. I suppressed my desire to tease her as my fingers moved along her spine, dipping dangerously close to her beautiful ass. </p><p>Still glowing with my latest spanks. </p><p>I enjoyed her flinch, yet even as I drove close, I didn’t complete the touch. </p><p>I had a different idea in mind, but not for now. </p><p>Instead, I let my fingers climb up, cleaning them up for a moment before shifting to shampoo — one that was clearly substandard for her preferences, but she didn’t have the luxury to choose — and slid my fingers through her hair, slowly washing her hair with surprising gentleness, contrasting her earlier punishment. </p><p>She said nothing as I made her turn once more, and she leaned against the wall. With her eyes closed to avoid shampoo in her eyes, she had no idea about the view she was giving to me as the bubbles dragged down her body, creating a maddeningly erotic sight. </p><p>It took everything I had to keep myself back. I still kept my gaze pinned on her body, giving me amazing eye candy as I continued to work on her. “You can open your eyes now,” I said. </p><p>She opened her eyes, only to realize I had already turned my back. “Now, do my back,” I said. </p><p>“Sure,” she whispered, but an almost nonexistent delay between that order and her touch showed that she was not particularly unenthusiastic about doing her parts. She replicated me, and bypassed loofah, caressing my back with her hands, her touch beautifully soft as she caressed my muscles tenderly, starting from my shoulders. </p><p>Yet, she didn’t stay there, and after working on my back for an extended time, she took a step to get closer, pressing her amazing tits against my back while started caressing my chest. Her fingers soon drifted down to my stomach, spending an inordinate time on my abs, especially the lower parts. </p><p>She was clearly trying to gather enough courage to touch a certain part of my anatomy, only to fail. She might have ultimately succeeded if we had a long time, but unfortunately, while I had exaggerated slightly, my excuse about limited hot water was not just an excuse. </p><p>So, before she could gather the necessary courage, I turned without a warning, and took a small step forward, enough to press my shaft against her stomach. “W-what are you doing?” she stammered in shock. </p><p>“Giving you a chance to work on my front easily while I payback, of course,” I said as get some more gel, and pressed my hands against her breasts, dancing over them. My earlier experience already showed just how sensitive her breasts were, but the assistance of the shower gel, along with my naked shaft pressing against her stomach, was all I needed to push her to the next stage. </p><p>I leaned forward, stopping just an inch from her lips before delivering the next part. “Are you saying you have a problem with that?” </p><p>“N-no,” she whispered gently, her tongue darting out to moisten her lips. Completely unnecessary considering we were still in the shower, with hot water blasting over our bodies. </p><p>But I appreciated the intent even as I leaned forward, to finally take the step my arousal was begging me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The Aether dimension was much calmer without the constant flow of the Necrotic mana pumping toward the planar shell. Interestingly, the connection between the dead tree and the shell persisted…</p><p>No, not just persisted, I realized as I felt a small flicker of nature mana flowing toward the shell.  </p><p>The tree was still functioning.</p><p>Fascinating, I thought as I followed the connection back to its source, and soon, I realized the tree wasn’t as dead as I had first assumed. I had no idea from where, but there was a little Divine Spark possessed by the dead tree. </p><p>Then, a notification popped, warning me about the source. </p><p>{-1 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>The delay was rather suspicious, but before I could pay attention to that, I had a more important thing to do. I dashed inside, using the same tunnel I had used earlier, to the underground cave with the spring. </p><p>Only to see one of the roots of the border tree already burrowing against the first tree, taking control… It was definitely not good news, and I was ready to cut the connection … but not before a little experiment. </p><p>{-199 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>A bit wasteful, maybe, but after the great haul I had attained, a few hundred points looked like a much more acceptable amount. After that, I destroyed the tree I had created in the underground cave, only leaving the ward to assist the tree. </p><p>Then, I went outside once more, leaving the tree to recover. The carved sections were already recovering as the tree devoured most of the mana. Once outside, I tapped into the Arcana dimension once more, creating a similar ward around its magical roots to fasten its conversion rate — this time, with several traps of light mana in case any undead might decide to fiddle with it. </p><p>Once that was done, I turned my attention back to the outer defenses, creating a layer of trees to conceal the wards. Once that was done, I started adding several beacons, some inside the defensive line, some hidden away, ready to give me the mobility I needed. </p><p>The lack of constant mana drain was certainly useful. </p><p>However, as I started establishing the detection wards, I noticed a trigger. Not from here, I realized, but back from the God Forest. </p><p>It didn’t feel like the undead, but still, I teleported immediately, right into my basement outpost. </p><p>Seldanna was gone, but I could sense her outside, and the rest of the camp was reacting to her movement as well. Curious, I went to the surface, confident my invisibility would hold up without a problem. </p><p>The great improvement in my stats made me feel much more confident in the situation. </p><p>On the surface, I met with a surprising sight. A great flock was flying toward the camp, consisting of large rocs, and the elves had gathered to greet, with the priestess at the center. The leading bird was a bit different. At first, I assumed it was another roc, but further examination revealed that it was not the case. </p><p>No, it was some kind of majestic bird I failed to recognize, but somehow radiating nature mana.  As they got closer, I could see a dozen or so elves on top of that majestic bird, each wearing gleaming golden robes, and the rest wearing silver metal armor. </p><p>Altogether, there were almost a hundred elves split along a dozen beasts. A great response. </p><p>However, I didn’t need to hear the suspicious glances the elves throwing toward the birds to know that it was a bit excessive for reinforcements — especially since, even at a distance, I could feel their strength. </p><p>It was hard to perfectly identify the power of the elves from such a great distance, but it got easier once they passed the second layer of detection wards I had established for this exact purpose, allowing me to check their mana potential. </p><p>Of course, it was a cursory assessment, difficult to pin down, but still, I could make an educated guess. The silver-armored elves were more or less as strong as a death knight, though since I had no idea about their true combat potential, it was hard to pin their exact combat potential. </p><p>Still, at least they were solidly in Chosen territory. </p><p>Golden-robed figures were stronger, but it was hard to guess just how strong they were. For the sake of safety, I would assume that they more or less had the combat potential of a regular lich, but that was hard to make sure. </p><p>A dangerous force, and certainly not a casual amount of reinforcements. If the elves had enough forces to reinforce each defensive position with such forces, the undead would have a much harder time getting a beachhead in this plane, let alone making such great progress. </p><p>Even with my new stats, the power they represented was scary enough that I wouldn’t dare to fight against them in an open field. Luckily, I had long turned my forest into a veritable fortress that I could use from a distance. </p><p>Not to mention, the trees were just as capable of draining nature mana as pumping it, which would limit their combat capabilities significantly. If it came to a fight, I was confident in taking them. </p><p>It wouldn’t be an easy battle, but it was a winnable one. </p><p>Soon, the birds landed outer edge of the camp. First, the silver-armored figures jumped down, their weapons raised, pointing at the other elves, their dismissal easy to read. </p><p>And not just for me, if the reaction of our camp was any indicator. The relationship between the outer tribes and central tribes was even worse than I had expected … though, based on the detailed style of their armor and their refined attitude, I was starting to think that the inner tribes were less wild and more urban. </p><p>Interesting distinction, though they had hardly cared about it. </p><p>“Disgrace!” </p><p>It was the first word that left the mouth of the golden-robed figures, though, unlike the warriors, they didn’t even bother leaving their seats — luxurious-looking seats, more of a carriage than a saddle. </p><p>The camp fell silent. Well, that was not entirely accurate. The more accurate statement would be that no one in the camp had spoken. The silence was cut by the bows being raised. </p><p>“Stop! Lower your weapons,” Saldenna ordered before one of them could actually use their bows. I just watched as she sent a  scary glare to the camp commanders, who started working to calm the camp. </p><p>Good call. The newcomers were outnumbered one to fifty, but without my assistance, the camp would lose, and even with mine, it would have been a bloody affair. And, a few smirks I could see on the silver-armored figures told me that they were more than happy to start such a massacre. </p><p>“We have reached you in the hopes of an alliance between our tribes against the undead—“ Seldanna started, only for one of the golden-robed figures to raise their hands. </p><p>“Stop, wildling,” the old man declared. “What kind of dreams of grandeur you’re living in to think that  you can ask  the alliance of our glorious city.” </p><p>That was enough to challenge Seldanna’s control over the camp. She couldn’t retaliate against them directly, afraid of their power,, but her lack of an answer was already impacting the rest of the camp, which was shuffling in panic. </p><p>The golden-robed figure was brash and antagonistic, but I had a feeling that it was not a reflex, but something calculated. The whispers of the others behind him reinforced that idea. </p><p>Probably a politically expedient reaction, unhappy with the sudden gathering of the outer tribes. Understandable. One by one,  they were hardly a threat, but together, they might have some impact. </p><p>Especially when supported by a mysterious forest. </p><p>“Hurry up,” one of them whispered. “We still need to go to the boundary to assess the changes,” one of the golden-robed figures said, unaware that I was listening. </p><p>“I don’t know, this forest gives me a weird feeling. I don’t want to leave this place as well. Maybe it’s linked to whatever that was going on.” </p><p>As they argued, I quickly sent a magical message to Seldanna, telling her to accept whatever they had in mind unless they started killing. She didn’t say anything, waiting for their discussion to end, aware that they were outnumbered. </p><p>“Enough, we don’t have time to waste,” their leader suddenly bellowed, and a magical pressure radiated off him, which relied on his Divine Spark, which was still in Chosen form, but almost about five hundred points. </p><p>A fascinating amount, enough to scare all elves — except Seldanna, but I was quick to send a message to her, to act shocked. </p><p>“As per the rules of the silver city, we declare this patch of forest ours. All of you, disperse!” he ordered, then, pointed his finger to Seldanna. “And since you’re the leader of this rebellious band, you’re going to go to the capital for trial.” </p><p>Even as they gave the order, two of the golden robes stepped down, staying in the forest with ten soldiers, while two other was already moving to arrest Seldanna. </p><p>A fascinatingly quick reversal.</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 16</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 16</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 2392}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 4140}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 1809}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000] </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Good, now you should be ready,” he said, and Lily found herself trembling in fear … and anticipation. She didn’t know how much time had passed … just seconds, or maybe hours. </p><p>Either way, she was too wet to argue against his point. She was ready… Though, that readiness didn’t help against his nonchalance, or the fact that he once again flipped her like a toy. “Wait, we should in —“ she started, only to be interrupted by a moan.</p><p>“No, I should be inside, and that’s enough,” he said. A horrible pun, Lily thought. Unfortunately, her lips were busy with other things, like moaning desperately as he slid inside mercilessly, pulling her hair. And, unlike her past boyfriends, he wasn’t very careful avoiding hurting her as he pulled her hair. They did so, because they watched a porn movie. </p><p>Darion did it, because he owned her… </p><p>She said nothing, so he continued to push further, disappearing deep inside her, each push making her tits dangle freely. </p><p>“Too … much,” she gasped, which was the extent of that. </p><p>“Could you repeat that, please,” he said even as he sank deeper into her. “I didn’t think I heard you correctly. </p><p>“I said-” Lily started, but her words cut halfway once more as he pushed in hard, testing her limits. </p><p>“Good, nothing important, then,” he flipped her and she found herself sideways. He held her hands, harder than the handcuffs she once wore as a prank, telling her that she had no chance of getting away. It was a good thing that she had no intention of doing so in the first place… “For a moment, I thought that you were unhappy with our arrangement. If that’s the case, I can always walk away…” </p><p>“Yes, arrangement,” Lily muttered, trying to remember what exactly that arrangement was. Unfortunately, she was having significant trouble as she tried to remember what exactly was that arrangement. The monster that was buried in her was enough to steal her thoughts about that subject. “All for it.” </p><p>“Good,” he answered. “For a moment, I thought that you were actually enjoying it. It would be against our deal.” </p><p>“Of — course — not,” Lily managed to answer, each hit interrupted by a loud moan that gave her true feelings about the issue. </p><p>“Good, then you’re going to hate this a lot,” he said before he flipped her once more, this time her leg ended up on his shoulder, helpless and immobile. She shivered helplessly. </p><p>But she didn’t answer, not that she needed to. Her moans were all he needed as he drilled into her with the attitude of a jackhammer, giving her a new taste of dominance and desire, her insides wet enough to be magical. </p><p>A yelp escaped her mouth as he pushed her leg up, but even that only last for a moment, showing she was more flexible than she had first thought. She felt herself relaxing as they changed position, and was about to bring her leg down, when he spoke. “Keep it like that,” he ordered before she could lower her leg, unwilling. </p><p>She just followed his command, even though his fingers around her ankle were barely helping, each push making her tremble wildly… </p><p>“Good girl,” he whispered even as he slid in and out mercilessly, another minute that was enough to drive her crazy. Only when he flipped her once more and pulled down, she was able to remember what was going on. </p><p>“Mary—“ she gasped, which was all she was able to say before he leaned and captured her lips…</p><p>He kissed like he fucked, hard and mercilessly like he was conducting war, but everywhere he invaded filling with desire and pleasure. </p><p>“Well, you must work hard if you want to finish before she comes,” he said as he changed his position once more, this time laying on his back, and for once, he didn’t drag her with her. </p><p>But the inviting nature of his shining shaft was impossible to reject, so she didn’t lose a moment before climbing on his lap, for once, taking control. </p><p>She would show him how that was done… She climbed on his lap, her hips dancing even as her moans rapidly climbed to an overwhelming level…</p><p>Then, a voice interrupted her. “Holy hell, what’s going on.”  </p><p>It was Mary.</p><p>***</p><p>Mary was rather concerned as she took a turn, as she had never heard her friend shouting that loudly. She didn’t run, as it was clear those were pained cries, but she didn’t know what was… The only thing they sounded like. </p><p>No, that’s unbelievable, Mary convinced herself even as she took that turn — only to freeze as she came to the sight of her friend being desperately fucked. Not for a moment, Mary doubted her eyes. For once, they were just a yard away from her. Also, with her friend’s body bent backward and her hands on the floor like she was trying to complete a particularly difficult yoga pose, it was hardly the most difficult position to understand what was going on. </p><p>“Holy hell, what’s going on,” she found herself gasping after watching a moment…</p><p>“You’re a clever girl, why don’t you take a guess,” Lily’s bodyguard answered, his voice calm like he wasn’t just drilling her bestie like a jackhammer. “I’m sure you can guess if I give you three chances…” </p><p>Initially, Mary had been planning to leave once she truly processed what was going on — and maybe, made sure to capture enough of the event to keep her warm during difficult winter nights — but his mocking voice made her decide her mind. </p><p>It was a challenge, and Mary didn’t back away from challenges. </p><p>Even if the challenge looked impossible, if Lily could handle it, so could she.</p><p>“Let me guess, you’re helping her do yoga,” Mary answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“Wrong,” he answered, even cheekier. “One chance lost. Another attempt?” </p><p>“I don’t know, don’t I have a joker,” she said. </p><p>“Hey—“ Lily shouted, but Mary ignored her, fascinated by the way his lips curled in a smirk as he looked at her, somehow fascinating even with … what he was doing. </p><p>“Hmm, you have a good point,” he said as he stood up. Which might have helped, if he didn’t lift Lily with him as he did so, buried deep in her. “How about that, red, do you think it’s enough as a joker?” </p><p>“S-shut up,” Lily gasped before turning to look at Mary. “Leave — now,” she gasped. Mary just smirked. As she would listen to anything Lily said at this moment.  </p><p>“Oh, really, you’re kicking me from my own garden,” Mary chuckled as she took a step forward. Well, technically it wasn’t her garden as she was just an exchange student, but it was close enough… She took a step forward. “Still, I’m having trouble identifying it. Maybe another joker?” </p><p>“Unfortunately we’re fresh out. Unless you can pay, of course?” </p><p>“Well, how about this as payment?” Mary said as she got rid of her top, displaying as well as she could manage as she closed in. “Do you think this is enough?” </p><p>“Good, come and get a better view,” he said. </p><p>“Mary, go away or I—“ Lily started, which only lasted until she put her arm on Lily’s shoulder and pushed down, forcing her bestie to take even more of his monster. Her moans showed that it worked just as it was intended. </p><p>“Still, maybe another joker,” he said as he flipped Lily down, forcing her to bend over, not stopping his merciless assault even for a  moment. Lily definitely appreciated that if her moans were any indicator… </p><p> Mary walked behind him, wrapping her hands around his waist, enjoying the way his hips moved, each push mercilessly and explosive. He felt like a cannon, attacking again and again.</p><p>“Oh, almost,” she whispered throatily, in a way that could be impossible to be understood as anything but an invitation. “But, just to make sure, maybe you should show it directly…”</p>",

    "title": "Icy Discipline 5",
    "content": "<p>As I left the recreational room behind, I was in a weird mood, one that was a mixture of anger, desire, and frustration.</p><p>Anger was rather understandable, as their appearance had ruined a ploy I was struggling to put together for almost a year, and what had just happened was certainly not enough to compensate for that great crime.</p><p>Even a woman ass amazing as Carly.</p><p>The desire and frustration, on the other hand, were easier to understand, especially considering I had to cut that amazing experience short halfway, leaving me an uncomfortable hard-on, enough to strain even my loose exercise shorts to the limit.</p><p>I wanted nothing more than to go back to my room and finish the job. I might lack any porn after that idiotic joke, but after what happened during the last several minutes, that was not something I was in particular need.</p><p>Yet, I hit a little snag before I could arrive at my room. I came across Maria, who just finished her shower, and walking to her room. “Someone is happy to see me,” she said with a beautiful, crystal chuckle as she glanced down, a teasing smirk appearing on her face, one that conveyed that she was more than happy with seeing that. “Should I assume you were using the broken door to your benefit? How naughty,”</p><p>It was clear that her tone of seduction was completely artificial, filled with a smug superiority more than anything. Which was why it annoyed me immensely to realize it still worked on me, pushing the stirring inside me.</p><p>I looked at her, doing my best to look uncaring. I didn’t say anything, because I was absolutely sure that, if I did something like that, I would have fallen apart, stammering.</p><p>Moreover, I certainly didn’t want to show her just how effective her subtle teasing was, especially when she was just wearing a bathrobe after her lengthy shower — one that was significantly looser than the time she was going to the bath, her glistening caramel cleavage a thing of wonders.</p><p>Luckily, before she could realize just how amazingly effective her seduction trick was on me, the door to the recreational room opened and Carly stepped out, only to freeze as our gazes turned to her then dashed back.</p><p>“Well, let’s just say your friends like to leave things halfway,” I said, glad that her naked body, along with the clear bruises on her breasts and her ass was more than enough to make further explanation unnecessary. “She’s such a tease,” I said.</p><p>“Oh, she certainly is,” Maria answered, though I didn’t miss the sudden shift in her tone. Earlier, her tone was soft and seductive, yet ultimately fake enough that even I could notice. The sudden flare of anger that followed my dismissive words — supported by Carly’s unintentional show — invading her beautiful chocolate gaze, on the other hand, was certainly not fake.</p><p>Especially since it soon turned into a smoldering gaze as she glanced at my arms and shoulders, taking a measure of the muscles — muscles that I only cultivated due to sheer boredom of living in the middle of nowhere, lacking even a proper Internet connection.</p><p>Apparently, the situation Carly’s nudity suggested made her revisit her impression.</p><p>“Yes, teasing is certainly a bad habit,” she whispered as she took a step forward, passing me. The corridor was not particularly large, but still, there was more than enough space for her to pass unimpeded. Yet, as she turned her back and passed, she was unnecessarily close to me, her amazing, world-famous booty rubbed against my shaft.</p><p>Rather slowly as well, which didn’t help the frustration I was feeling in the slightest. Luckily, to pull that trick, she needed to turn her back, meaning she missed the way I was biting my lips to restrain my reaction.</p><p>Or my desire to push her against the wall and teach her the risks of teasing a man who was already on the edge.</p><p>It was a close call, but not only I was able to suppress that desire, but also I managed to hide the amazing feeling of dry-humping against arguably the most famous ass of the twenty-first century.</p><p>“Sorry about that, the corridor is a bit small,” she started as she turned to look at me, only to be greeted by a casual nod and shake. It took all I had not to peek at her cleavage, one that was significantly enhanced due to her earlier trick — though it was doubtful whether it was intentional or accidental.</p><p>Either way, she made no move to fix it, showing she had a little problem with it. To make things worse, her closeness and our height difference enhanced the impact of her cleavage even more, filling me with an amazing temptation.</p><p>Luckily, after being tempted by an even more beautiful one moment ago, I managed to find the strength to keep my gaze locked on her eyes.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said, trying to hide just how hard it was to hide my reaction. Luckily, she was too busy with the anger that awakened by being dismissed to care whether my dismissal was genuine or barely held together fiction. “But try to use less water during showers. There’s a chance that the storm might last longer than two weeks, and we don’t want to be restricted in terms of resources.”</p><p>“R-really,” she said, though, the speed of her earlier anger disappeared, replaced by pure terror, thick enough to devour anything else. “T-they told me that it’ll only last a week. And it doesn’t sound particularly loud.”</p><p>I chuckled, more than happy with the change in attitude, as, despite the great visual interest their appearance brought to lighten up the solitude I was suffering, it was still not a good trade-off for ruining the opportunity I was gunning for the last year.</p><p>She was clearly afraid of the storm, and I had no problems stroking that fear. “Oh, yeah, this is just a start,” I said as I pointed at the walls, getting her attention to the subtle yet constant noise of the wind. “And it’s only this light because of the isolation, but it’s at capacity. It’ll get louder once the storm really starts.”</p><p>Which was not entirely true. The storm might get a touch stronger, but it was already at full power. However, her fear gave me a chance to make her pay, and I had no intention to miss that opportunity.</p><p>There were ways to compromise the sound insulation of the outpost — something I knew due to the horrible sense of humor the old German professor, deliberately removed one of the noise-canceling tiles in one of the storage units, creating a horrible noise without actually placing cold.</p><p>Who knew his annoying tricks would come useful one day.</p><p>“Oh, really,” she said. “Do you have any sleeping pills here, then?” she asked, her voice trembling with sheer terror at the thought of a stronger storm. To her credit, she managed to keep it subtle enough that I would have missed it if I hadn’t been looking for it deliberately.</p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I answered. “This is a scientific outpost, and the number and types of medicine they allow here are strictly limited. And pills with addiction risks are definitely now allowed.”</p><p>Amusingly, that was even true.</p><p>“Good, good, good,” she said, though the constant repetition showed just how badly she was reacting to the possibility. With fear infecting her tone, she dashed away, leaving me to watch her beautiful disappearance.</p><p>She slammed her door, and I leaned against the wall, breathing hard, finally letting the impact of her little show display. Discounting her panicked reaction to the storm, Maria was much harder to handle than Carly, whose submissiveness gave me a chance to modulate my actions whenever I felt overwhelmed.</p><p>On the contrary, Maria wielded her sexiness like a sword, elegant and deadly at the same time, a few seconds of discussion already working wonders to break my defenses.</p><p>As I leaned against the wall, breathing hard, the door of the recreational room opened once more, revealing Carly once more. Though this time, she was not naked, holding a pillow in front of her, one helped her to cover her breasts.</p><p>It wasn’t enough to prevent her blush when she saw me, of course, but it was still enough to prevent her retreat. Yet, she was even more hesitant than before, her accidental reveal weakening her already weakened will once more.</p><p>“S-she’s gone,” she stammered.</p><p>“Yes, you can use the shower,” I answered as I gestured for her to walk closer. “And drop the pillow, you look ridiculous,” I answered, once again channeling a careless dismissal, one that worked wonders on her.</p><p>Her eyes widened at the order, but that didn’t prevent the flick of her wrist as she threw the pillow away, leaving her beautiful chest naked. And this time, she didn’t cover them as she walked toward me, every step creating a beautiful ripple, one that tempted me for much more.</p><p>Her hesitancy didn’t prevent her hips from shaking attractively at each step, her habits as a model show, elevating her already amazing beauty to the next level. And the existence of pink marks on her body, evidencing my earlier touch, pushed the sexiness she was reflecting even more, watering my mouth even more.</p><p>I said nothing as she walked past me, and I pulled to the side, leaving her enough space to walk without touching me if she wanted to.</p><p>Yet, she surprised me, by not only taking that opportunity, but also choosing to stumble just as she passed me, letting her touch linger on my raging arousal for more than necessary, her eyes widening as she got acquainted with the size more accurately than our earlier position.</p><p>Which was certainly nothing to be ashamed of, even though it did make a kind of stereotype of my complexion — one that I had no problems enjoying the benefits of. After all, the subtle discrimination of my heritage hurt my scientific career sufficiency, and a bit of compensation in terms of female fascination was always a nice trade-off.</p><p>She gasped for a moment as her fingers lingered on it, but that lasted only for a second. Then, as if she was trying to compensate for her delay, she dashed to the bathroom, and slammed the door behind her.</p><p>The door didn’t close, which, amusingly, was her own fault.</p><p>Just the way the throbbing of my shaft was.</p><p>One that I decided to make her pay after her latest adventure. I would have let her go if it wasn’t for that trick.</p><p>But with that, she earned another punishment.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, let’s discuss your punishment,” I said, enjoying the way she shivered intensely under the word, far more intensely than I expected. “Since you have acted like a spoiled brat, I think we need to have a corresponding punishment.” </p><p>“L-like what,” she said, her arms tightening around her naked torso in a defensive effort, missing the fact that it only made her look more beautiful. </p><p>“Spanking, of course,” I answered, aware that taking a big risk. Looking from a rational perspective, her only reaction should have been a dismissive scoff, followed by a lengthy explosion about my daring. Yet, I was unable to resist the temptation, as there was nothing rational in her standing in front of me, naked and helpless. </p><p>Fortune favored the bold.  </p><p>“P-please, no,” she gasped beautifully, the desperate melody in her tone making my shaft harder and harder. </p><p>“I’ll give you a chance,” I said, enjoying a soft hope blooming on her face as she raised her gaze, almost as much as I would receive from squashing it. “Why don’t you give me an alternative method I could use to teach a spoiled brat about how to behave in a sensitive location where her next burst might kill us all.” </p><p>“Surely—“ she started, but I raised my head to silence her. </p><p>“We’re lucky that it was the bathroom door, if you did that to anything else, you might have damaged something vital, killing us.” Of course, I didn’t mention that, unlike the bathroom door or shitty furniture, anything actually vital was much better protected and had several backups. </p><p>The designers might be cheap, but they certainly wanted to avoid the news of a bunch of scientists dying — though I had a feeling that they cared more about the PR than our lives. </p><p>No need to explain to Carly that, of course. I knew enough of her type — rich and spoiled kind, not internationality famous kind. A privileged raising meant that she had been sheltered from the impact of her actions as far as possible, and she would seldom think about those unless it was spelled out to her. </p><p>“So, any alternative punishment?” I asked, but she left that without an answer. “Then, you know what to do,” I ordered, once again the best authoritative voice I could use, but expecting her to slap me before leaving. </p><p>Or at best, continue bargaining, which was why it was shocking enough to destroy the expression I was doing my best to maintain when her lips stayed closed and she moved forward. </p><p>And lay on my lap without further protest. </p><p>I said nothing for a moment, trying to process the shock. I had always been proud of being a cold and rational man, but even for my willpower, there were limits. </p><p>Having a naked supermodel lying on my lap, waiting to be spanked was certainly enough to break those limits. Luckily, she was not looking at me, and missed my slipping expression. </p><p>As I tried to suppress the sudden shock and elation, my hand decided to work automatically, and landed on her bottom, fulfilling my promise even as it rang in the room.</p><p>It wasn’t particularly hard, but that didn’t prevent her from moaning in pain. “It hurts.” </p><p>Her needy moan and her obedient acceptance allowed me to control my mood, at least enough to control my voice. “Good, it’s supposed to. Otherwise, how will you learn how to act like a proper lady,” I said, spanking her again even as I did so. </p><p>A grin appeared on my face as I continued to spank her glorious booty — which, amusingly, was not even the best booty in the outpost, that honor going to the Latina beauty currently taking an extended shower, her fame intrinsically linked to her hips. </p><p>Cathy’s ass was still amazing, of course, but the greatest source of her fame was still her spectacular breasts. And they were too tempting to ignore, so even as I delivered the third spank to her beautiful ass, my free hand sneaked under, and grabbed her breast. </p><p>“What are you—“ she started, only to be cut off as I twisted her nipple. Admittedly, it didn’t interrupt her like I wanted. I expected her to cry in pain, so the moan she let out, filled with almost pure pleasure, was certainly a surprise. </p><p>Clearly, her breasts were not just beautiful, but also sensitive to an unbelievable degree. </p><p>“A part of the punishment, of course,” I said as I slapped her ass once more, earning a pained gasp to contrast with her earlier moan. </p><p>I didn’t know whether she disagreed with that statement, because that was the extent of her complaint as I let my fingers disappear into the amazing texture of her breasts, her reaction thick and beautiful. </p><p>Yet, it was filled with a kind of surprise, like she seldom felt such a thing. Almost like she was very inexperienced when it came to sex. </p><p>A thought I was quick to dismiss. It was just ridiculous for a global supermodel in her early twenties not to know the touch of a man. </p><p>Instead of pondering on that question, I continued enjoying the beautiful sight in front of me, particularly the way Carly’s bottom was shaking after each second, or the intensity of her moans. </p><p>“Try to keep your voice down,” I had to warn a moment later. “You don’t want your ‘friend’ to come and see you while being punished, do you?” I asked. </p><p>“N-no,” she answered, finally twisting her neck enough to catch my gaze, her beautiful eyes filled with equal amounts of shock and desire. “She can’t see me like that!” </p><p>Yet, just putting my hand on the small of her back softly was enough to stop her attempts of standing up. She continued to obediently lay for my next spank, but this time, her hands were pressing to her lips to suppress her moan. </p><p>It would have been fun to tease her about her inability to hold her moans, but pity doing so was getting riskier. The combination of the door of the recreational area and the sound of the shower was loud enough to most of the voice Carly was making, but with the bathroom door broken, I didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>So, while Carly was busy trying to suppress the delicious voices she was creating, I continued to deliver a focused assault of caresses and spanks on her curves. </p><p>Suppressing my desire to push for even more took everything I had, and I found myself focusing on different aspects of her beauty just to ignore the temptation. Facts like surprisingly strong muscles underneath her amazing curves, suggested it wasn’t just genetics that was responsible for her figure, but also a strong regimen of diet and exercise. </p><p>Though, that aspect failed to keep my attention for long as I continued to spank her ass, her moans getting loud enough to bypass the presence of her hands. Her skin was softer than silk under my hands, begging for me to push more and more. </p><p>It turned out that my willpower was not as strong as I thought, as I found myself putting bigger and bigger breaks between the spanks, and filling the gaps by caressing her beautiful ass, each second pushing changing the quality of her moans more. </p><p>Yet, she didn’t complain, making me wonder whether the absence of pain, or the intensifying pleasure that was more responsible for that particular aspect. </p><p>However, under the great sensation of touching her, I felt that, even for a scientist, suffering that mystery was an acceptable trade-off. </p><p>So, I focused on the amazing texture of her soft breasts as I worked on her, each second enhancing my pleasure even further. </p><p>Yet, her reaction, getting more and more intense each second, surprised me greatly. The reason, her surprise, grew along with her pleasure, confirming my earlier guess about her relative inexperience when it came to carnal affairs. </p><p>What a fun discovery, I thought as I stilled my fingers on her bottom, letting them slip to her wetness for the first time. </p><p>A move that, unfortunately, proved to be a mistake even as it further confirmed her shock. She jumped off my lap in shock, her beautiful eyes wide. She looked like she wanted to run away, but unfortunately, her body chose that moment to betray her. </p><p>My touch and the shock that accompanied it finally pushed her over the edge, triggering a beautiful climax that made her legs tremble so bad that she had to lean against the small table in front of the sofa to prevent a painful collapse. </p><p>The view she created as she leaned forward was simply magical. Her whole body was on display, her tits, marked by my aggressive touch, swaying freely, and her ass carried the signs of my aggressive spanking, and the sight of her arousal, dripping down her legs to the floor, only made the view even more. </p><p>It was a sight beautiful enough to be worshipped, but I didn’t miss the fact of just how she reached my earlier lack of approval. Instead of falling on my knees and worshipping her beauty, I threw her a small bundle of paper towels. </p><p>“Clean up the mess you made, then go and take a shower,” I said as I turned and left, leaving her alone in the small recreational room. </p><p>Alone and naked, with absolutely nothing to wear. </p><p>The whimper she let out as I closed the door was simply beautiful.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t waste much time in the bedroom, just played around a bit with the central management system, one that was designed for the admin to manage every aspect of the outpost, and temporarily cut the hot water just in case they decided to poke around and see it was just an angry bluff. </p><p>I considered cutting off the internet as well to drive my revenge further, but then decided against it. Not because of any sense of mercy, but because the storm was going to hit in less than thirty minutes. </p><p>And with the storm, there would be no communication. </p><p>After making a few smaller changes, I changed into a shirt-shorts combo, and went to the small corner of the office I arranged into a gym. Nothing particularly fancy, a space for pushups, a mat, a couple kettlebells and dumbells, and a bar for pull-ups. </p><p>That was all I could arrange with the limited personal weight allowance they gave us. </p><p>I was halfway into my exercise when Cathy stepped out of her room, still wearing her cold-resistant shirt, but her pants were gone, revealing her spectacular legs for my pleasure. It was not my habit to do catcalls. I thought of them as crass. </p><p>So, if someone asked whether I was almost about to deliver one, I would simply lie and felt no inclination. </p><p>Even sadder, the only thing that allowed me to pull my gaze after a glimpse was the layer of smugness behind her innocent gaze, showing that she was very much aware of the impact her naked legs would create, counting on them as revenge. </p><p>And, I was just vindictive enough to avoid the beautiful sight just to make her little objective fail. </p><p>The confirmation of success came quickly as I watched her from the corner of my eye, frustration invading her beautiful face.</p><p>Which, against my expectation, made her even sexier. </p><p>Not exactly the most amazing things to experience after living alone for several weeks, without even porn to make things fun — as the internet connection was severely limited and constantly observed, considering that the data we collected was precious enough to make espionage a possibility. </p><p>And, I didn’t think about bringing a flash disk filled with porn, a fact that the old man mocked me ceaselessly even as he waited for the medical extraction. </p><p>The pain was, as always, a good distraction, so I grabbed the bar and started doing pull-ups even faster, the agony invading my arms and back. “How … can I … help you?” I asked. </p><p>“I need some clothes,” she said. “I don’t have anything with me, and it doesn’t help that this ridiculous undershirt is annoyingly itchy,” she murmured as she grabbed the side of her shirt and lifted a bit, enough to give a glimpse of her panties, enough to confirm that, unlike the rest of her clothing, they were quite sexy. </p><p>A lacy dark red piece that contrasted greatly against her skin, more optimized to enhance her beauty rather than coverage. </p><p>A masterful performance, I thought. If I hadn’t seen her earlier expression, I might have been convinced that it was an accidental performance, and that she was as silly as she was trying to convey. Yet, analyzed under the light of her earlier performance, it was clear that she was teasing me intentionally. </p><p>Noticing her trick didn’t suddenly turn it ineffective, as I learned in the form of a stirring in my core. After one last pull-up, and threw me on the floor, and started doing push-ups to hide a certain part of my anatomy from her, not willing to give her the satisfaction. </p><p>“Give me fifteen minutes for me to finish my workout,” I said. </p><p>“Fifteen minutes,” she murmured uneasily, reacting intensely at my rejection, shocking me. </p><p>It wasn’t the intensity of her rejection that surprised me. After all, she was a beautiful model at the height of her career, which meant that rejection was not something she faced often. What surprised me was the nature of her reaction, the sudden disappearance of her confidence, the tremble in her tone. </p><p>The display would have been enough to make me pity her if her appearance didn’t ruin the experiment I was doing my best to set up, making the rest of my work pointless.</p><p>“Yes, fifteen minutes,” I answered brazenly instead, not even stopping my push-ups. “Why, do you have an event you need to catch up on?” </p><p>I expected her to react to my anger hard, but instead, she stammered softly. “S-sure, I’ll wait,” she stammered as she looked down, shocking me with her obedience. That expression didn’t last for long, soon replaced by a frustrated expression as she turned and left, but it still left me with a curious impression. </p><p>One advantage of her retreat, it created an excellent view, one that I had no problems watching considering she was looking at the other side, the current angle as I was doing push-ups only enhanced the view. </p><p>Interestingly, I was fascinated by the way she was walking, almost as much as I was fascinated by the beautiful sight of her naked legs. At first, her steps were soft, and hesitant, like she was a student that had been just admonished by her favorite teacher, but their nature changed halfway, gaining a sharp quality, one that somehow gave me a sense of danger. </p><p>She clearly wanted to make me pay. </p><p>Though, as she went to her room and disappeared behind the door, only to leave the door open, only for the top that she was wearing a second ago to fly into my field of view, landing on the floor. </p><p>Beautiful, but not as beautiful as the bra that followed, red and lacy, this time landing on top of her bed, her panties joining a second later.  </p><p>Or the sight of her beautiful body, hidden behind a poorly-wrapped towel as she lay on the bed soon after her provocative strip. The towel barely hangs on her body, looking one wrong move away from turning it into a scandal. </p><p>I bit my lips as I struggled to keep my gaze limited to occasional glances, recognizing that it was a ploy for payback. </p><p>And, I was just stubborn enough to focus not giving her that satisfaction. </p><p>Of course, if I tried to tell someone else, they would just assume that it was all in my mind. After all, why would one of the most famous fashion models work hard to tease a poor post-doc? </p><p>I might have even agreed with their hypothetical counter-arguments if it wasn’t for her next move. As she failed to notice my gaze, she started shuffling on the bed ‘carelessly’, each move straining the hold of her towel even more…</p><p>Yet, not once failing to dislodge completely. </p><p>Almost like a professional, I thought before I corrected my thoughts. She was a professional model, and teasing the people with pieces of clothing tethering on the edge of the collapse was literally her job description. </p><p>A job that was probably allowing her to earn somewhere between a hundred and a thousand times my own job, it occurred to me with a sudden realization, ruining my good mood. </p><p>I started pushing myself harder and harder, adding claps to my push-ups, each echoing in the room as I looked at the floor, determined not to catch her gaze, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of success. </p><p>The ridiculous nature of our societal priorities was not her fault, of course, but at this moment, I wasn’t in a particularly charitable mood. My intellectual frustration with my ruined experiment, combined with my physical one, enhanced by the show I was receiving, screwed my mood intensely. </p><p>I channeled that frustration to my exercise, pushing myself harder and harder despite the pain gathering around my arms.</p><p>As I shifted back to pull-ups, I noticed Cathy was not on the bed anymore, and instead walking toward me with steady steps, each step making her towel slip down a little more, enhancing her already spectacular cleavage further, enough to give a small glimpse of her beautiful areolas. </p><p>It took all my willpower not to bite my lips, which would reveal just how much I was enjoying the view. I was a competitive man, not enough to give her what she wanted. </p><p>“Do I still have to wait for long?” she whispered throatily as she stood in front of me. “After today’s excitement, I need to relax a bit.” </p><p>“Unless you can magically make the water warm, you’re going to wait,” I said. I wasn’t trying to sound angry, just loud, but considering I was in the middle of an intense exercise routine, it came out like an angry growl. </p><p>And, just like that, her confidence shattered once more, replaced by cute obedience. I particularly enjoyed her flinch, mostly because of the great impact it had on her spectacular breasts.  </p><p>Still, I had to admit, I was shocked by her response. </p><p>I was not a virgin, not even close — as people wildly underestimated the amount of sex that happened in the science community. The college itself housed a surprising number of affairs already. </p><p>The number of doctorate students or professors that ‘accidentally’ misplace their wedding rings during scientific conferences would be enough to shock any outsider. </p><p>No, I was shocked, because for better or worse, most of the women that were adventurous enough to leverage such opportunities during conferences had some shared qualities, confidence being one of them, despite usually lacking what people might describe as an amazing physique. </p><p>Especially compared to the beautiful supermodel in front of me, but none of them withered like her at the slightest hint of rejection. </p><p>How interesting, I thought, a dark whisper asking me to test just how deep her insecurity ran…</p>",

    "content": "<p>While the coordinator explained my new ‘guests’ about their situation, including the fact that they would be staying here for at least a week — maybe more depending on the storm — I walked around the base. First, I went to my room, and quickly removed my snow equipment, the bulky set of hardly appropriate indoor clothing. </p><p>Then, once I started walking around in a t-shirt and shorts combo — the interior was sufficiently warm thanks to the ridiculous quality of the isolation material they used for the building — I started walking around, doing my best to remove the scientific equipment lying around.  </p><p>My aim wasn’t to make the place nicer for my guests, as their comfort was hardly my priority. </p><p>They should count themselves lucky that they were alive in the first place. </p><p>I just didn’t want them ruining some priceless scientific device just because they were feeling curious, or wanted to act out. </p><p>So, I bustled around while they continued to shout at the walkie-talkie in the other room, the occasional word enough to be heard despite the thick walls. </p><p>I felt lucky that when the door opened, I had managed to remove most of the sensitive devices. I turned to greet my unwelcome visitor.</p><p>Only to freeze when I met with a familiar face, one that it took a fraction of a second to recognize. </p><p>It wasn’t something I knew personally, but that didn’t prevent me from putting a name to the face. Carly … something, I recognized, having trouble remembering her last name. </p><p>The same didn’t apply to where I recognized her. She was one of the hottest models on the planet, currently going through a meteoric rise, with popularity high enough that even I knew about her, not only being active as a model, but also playing in movies and other events. </p><p>I was never one to care much about models. First, I didn’t have a lot of time to waste to kill on social media and other useless endeavors.</p><p>Second, I was a firm believer that the beauty of celebrities was an illusionary factor, created by expensive clothes, photoshop, makeup, and a plethora of other intervention factors.  I had no reason to believe that it didn’t apply to Carly as well. </p><p>Yet, I was a scientist, which meant I was ready to admit when I was wrong. And, looking at her in real-time, I was willing to admit that, the second part turned out to be completely inaccurate. </p><p>Seeing her in real-time, there was certainly no photoshop adjustment. And, after a long trip on the snowmobile, her makeup and hair were mussed incessantly, reaching a point that harmed the presentation rather than helping. </p><p>And, she had already gotten rid of all outer layers, leaving only a thick underlayer that covered her legs completely, and a loose t-shirt, neither the peak fashion. </p><p>If my second assumption had been correct, under the circumstances, she would have looked ordinary under the circumstances, maybe even ugly. </p><p>Yet, even now, with her mussed blonde hair, her lovely face, and her body curvy enough to show its presence despite her loose clothing, she was nothing short of striking, enough to steal my breath for a moment despite my anger. </p><p>“Where’s the bathroom,” she said as she looked at me, her beautiful blue eyes widening as she did so. “I certainly need a long bath after everything.” </p><p>Her voice was soft and lovely, the kind that caused a primal stirring in me. </p><p>Yet, something about her tone just fueled my simmering anger rather than any kind of kindness. Maybe it was her tone, despite its lovely nature, that carried an expectation to be obeyed, like she was talking to a servant. Or maybe it was the fact that she started requesting something rather than thanking me for saving their life, or apologizing for the intrusion. </p><p>“You have to wait for an hour for the water to get warm,” I answered tersely, even though that was not the case. It was petty, certainly, but after their appearance delayed my experiments for at least a week, which meant extending my stay at least a week more, maybe even more, I felt particularly petty. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, her eyes widening like it was the first time she had been rejected. </p><p>“What’s going on?” asked the second voice as my other guest stepped into the room, this time, an even more familiar face. Carly was, while familiar, still an upcoming global celebrity. The other woman, on the other hand, was a famous Latina actress and singer in her early thirties, and had been a constant presence in the mainstream for the last decade, as famous for her acting capabilities as her spectacular ass. </p><p>Maria Lontana. </p><p>Yet, the extent of her fame, along with her annoyed tone just fueled my fury further. </p><p>“Your friend is unhappy with the service quality in this five-star hotel,” I said. </p><p>“Don’t be arrogant,” Carly murmured petulantly as she looked around, her distaste at the smallness of the place rather obvious. “This place would barely earn a star.” </p><p>“Oh, really, sorry about that,” I growled, unable to contain the stirrings of anger as I pointed at the door. “There’s the door, feel free to go stay with one of our competitors. I heard that the penguin palace is running a promotion.” </p><p>“No need to care that much about her,” Maria intervened. “She’s just being needy as usual.” With that, Carly immediately turned to Maria, the anger on her face much stronger, suggesting that their relationship was hardly friendly. </p><p>Why they were on the same snowmobile if they didn’t like each other was a good question, but not one I was feeling inclined to explore. </p><p>“Oh, really —“ Carly started to argue.</p><p>“Enough, I’m not in the mood to listen to the bickering of two strangers,” I said. </p><p>“S-strangers,” Carly said, her shock so thick that if someone just listened to her tone, they might have assumed I stabbed her. “Don’t you know who am I?” </p><p>I knew her identity, of course, but her tone not only suggested what answer I needed to deliver, but also demanded an apology along with it. </p><p>“Was I supposed to?” I answered, putting as much dismissal as I could manage in my tone, the raging anger I was feeling working wonders to annoy them. </p><p>Ironically, even with the anger burning in me, a part of me squealed at the opportunity of spending my isolation with two sexy celebrities, but that excitement only intensified my fury. </p><p>“H-how dare —“ she started, only to be interrupted by Maria’s chuckle. </p><p>“This is the problem with the newcomers, expecting everyone to recognize you,” she whispered, yet her tone was vicious despite its softness. Then, she turned to face me, expecting me to say her name. </p><p>A silent request that I had no problem squashing, but I decided to do so viciously. “It was Jenny, right? The singer,” I said, mentioning the name of another singer, a newcomer that literally copied her style and looks, yet gaining some popularity. </p><p>A fact that she clearly didn’t appreciate if her anger was any indicator. “No, it’s Maria,” she corrected. </p><p>“Sorry about that, I don’t care much about that kind of stuff. I’m busy with important things that actually matter,” I said, gesturing around the scientific base. My tone was excessively arrogant, one that my position as a lowly post-doc certainly wouldn’t justify, but I was angry enough to not care about being fair. </p><p>The matching affronted expression they put on at my great sin of not recognizing them was enough to somewhat soothe my anger. </p><p>Yet, it was clearly so out of their expectations, neither was able to say anything for a moment, busy swallowing their anger. </p><p>“Let me show you where you are going to stay for the next week,” I said as walked, and they followed, only after a delay. I opened two doors, revealing matching bedrooms, each barely as big as a small dormitory room, with low-quality furniture to match. </p><p>“What’s this?” asked Maria in shock. “I have a bigger closet for my shoes.” </p><p>“Then go and live there with your shoes,” I answered, not feeling particularly charitable at their distaste, especially since she was right. While the research base was expensive, the geniuses who designed it decided to cut the budget for the living spaces to the bone to make the project more manageable. </p><p>After all, who cared about poor experimental physicists that needed to live in the middle of nowhere for six months. </p><p>Despite her anger, Carly chuckled at my outburst, their relationship clearly acrimonious enough to enjoy each others’ misfortune. </p><p>“And this is yours,” I said to Carly, showing an almost identical room. “And as I told you before, it’ll take an hour for the water to get warm, get comfortable inside, and don’t touch anything!” I said before I walked to my room and slammed the door behind me.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I had revisited my choice of making a career in the field of experimental physics many times in my life. </p><p>Admittedly, looking back, picking a career due to sheer passion was not the smartest decision I had ever made. I studied for the master's degree and the doctorate passionately, only to realize, most of the time, a Ph.D. was not about pushing the boundaries of science.  </p><p>At least, not as much as it was about the endless paperwork, low pay, archaic promotion structure, bullheaded professors and flighty students, and an unending pressure to create derivative scientific papers to raise the numbers of the school. </p><p>Yet, as I carefully put on several layers of frustratingly thick polyester layers over the woolen body sock I was wearing before completing the set with a huge windbreaker polka, none of those annoyances mattered. </p><p>I was in Antarctica because of a rare opportunity to actually conduct some scientific experiment, an extended study about neutrinos and their possible impact on the standard model and the string theory — two cornerstones of modern physics. </p><p>So, I was quick to accept the offer when a chance to join the expedition of four to Antarctica, two from Europe, one from Asia, and one from America. </p><p>Of course, there was a reason that a junior like me actually received the opportunity. </p><p>We needed to live in Antarctica, in a small science outpost, for six whole months. </p><p>An excellent opportunity to bring my career to the next stage, but it certainly undersold the weight of the isolation. Especially since it was already a month since I arrived, and I was alone. </p><p>The participant from Asia was yet to arrive due to some bureaucratic problems, and the candidate changed completely. </p><p>One of the participants from Europe canceled at the last minute due to a litany of reasons, and while the other participant arrived, he had to leave two weeks ago due to health problems. </p><p>Who thought sending sixty-five years old to such a trip was a good idea, I would never know. </p><p>Which meant that, for the last two weeks, I was busy setting the equipment that was initially measured as work for four people, and, considering the number of devices that needed to be set around the snow to collect the necessary signals, it was back-breaking work. </p><p>I was lucky that since I was a master’s student, I developed the habit of spending my free time in the twenty-four-hour gym of the college. </p><p>Mostly due to boredom, as the most junior member of the lab, I was only able to use the equipment after midnight. After setting the equipment, there was nothing but waiting while the machine generated the necessary results, leaving me nothing to do. </p><p>I started going to the gym, the physical exercise helping me to stay awake — and I had to admit, not looking like a cardboard figure as I wore a t-shirt helped, even if my schedule was far too busy to ever leverage the benefits of such aspects.</p><p>Which was a pity.  </p><p>As I lifted another box that held a cutting-edge scientific tool that was supposed to require four people to lift — well four scientists — I was rather glad for my pointless hobby even though I never benefited from the more fun aspects of it. </p><p>But, before I could put on the next box, my walkie-talkie made a sharp sound, loud enough to hurt my ears. I tensed as I recognized the sharp nature of the sound, one that only happened once before, waking me up to help my fellow scientist during the emergency.  </p><p>It was the emergency channel. </p><p>“Harden, can you hear me, over,” said the voice from the other side, one that I recognized as the coordinator of the mission — the same unwelcome voice that had informed me about all the delays with the rest of the team visiting and other problems. </p><p>“I can hear you. Is there a change in storm prediction, over,” I said, tense. As, while that annoying voice hardly ever delivered good news, it usually didn’t bother to use the emergency channel. </p><p>My first expectation was that he called me about canceling the expedition I was about to leave due to the storm being near, which was not something I would accept unless there was a big change in the storm prediction. </p><p>The control center already tried to deny that based on their concerns due to the upcoming storm, which was expected to last several days, with the possibility of expanding into two weeks, afraid that it would have malfunctioned. </p><p>I did my best to override their concerns for that exact reason. It was the last device I needed to set before I started the calibration phase — which could be done from indoors, requiring only a computer. </p><p>Missing this window meant that I would sit inside for two weeks without doing anything.</p><p>“No change in prediction, but there are two tourists lost near you, with their snowmobile stuck, and with the upcoming storm, they are too far away from their ship for help to arrive in time. Over.” </p><p>“You got to be kidding me,” I growled, not even bothering to use the proper walkie-talkie speech pattern. “Why there are tourists here in the first place, and what kind of moron allowed them to leave for an unsupervised trip.” </p><p>“We don’t know anything except the fact that these two are some kind of VIPs, over.” </p><p>“And there’s no one else to help, right? Over,” I answered even as I grabbed the large box that held the last piece of equipment and carried it back to the storage unit. </p><p>“No, you’re the only one that’s near enough to help, over,” the answer arrived even as I put the box in the storage unit, and grabbed a second emergency first aid kit just in case. </p><p>“Excellent, so much for experimentation,” I growled, then my gaze widened in shock. “And I’m guessing they have to stay here with me, over,” I added.</p><p>“Unfortunately, yes. It’s impossible to send help until the storm passes and the air control is convinced there would be no relapse. Then, they will arrange a plane to take them. I have sent their location tracker to you, over.” </p><p>Just like that, I started missing being alone, without even losing it. The isolation was bad, but not as bad as babysitting two random tourists in a scientific outpost, preventing them from ruining equipment that came with a price tag of several million. </p><p>Which, considering their apparent recklessness, enough to make them lost in the middle of Antarctica despite all the precautions their ship was supposed to take, was going to be difficult. </p><p>And the VIP tag they had been referred to hardly addressed those concerns even as I drove the snowmobile toward their location tracker. </p><p>“How the hell they managed to get so far away from the shore? Over,” I asked, unable to suppress my curiosity. </p><p>“They met with a small blizzard, panicked, and tried to return to their ship, but accidentally drove the wrong direction until they ran out of gas, over,” the explanation arrived with a sigh. </p><p>I matched that with a sigh of my own. “I would like to put it to record that I don’t accept any responsibility for the damages they will leave around the place, over,” I answered. </p><p>“Don’t worry, their company is responsible for any damage, over,” the response came. </p><p>I said nothing, just driving forward, busy hating two idiotic tourists who decided that a trip in Antarctica wouldn’t be fun without a snowmobile trip, and the rest of the organization stupid enough to let them do so. </p><p>“Why the frozen hell are there even tourists that deep in Antarctica,” I murmured even as I slowed down for a moment, clearing the snow from my dark goggles, cursing my luck heatedly as I did so. </p><p>As I drove, a blizzard started. It wasn’t the storm itself. By the local standards, it was nothing more than a light drizzle, but considering it reduced the field of vision to less than fifty feet with ease, it was not entirely shocking for a couple of tourists to panic. </p><p>Antarctica was hardly the most welcoming place. </p><p>With the GPS assistance, it didn’t take long for me to arrive at my destination, the snowy opening that was holding two VIPs hugging each other, trembling. </p><p>Understandable, as even a glance was enough to show that their clothing wasn’t as thick as it was supposed to be, and it was slowly getting to them despite their garish colored overcoats — one bright pink, the other one a blinding green — which helped them to pop out among the piles of snow. </p><p>Of course, they were under-dressed by Antarctica standards, meaning the number of layers they were wearing didn’t make them look like an obese manatee, enough to make me an assumption about their gender. </p><p>Though, still not enough to make me confident about my guess, not before I heard one of them cheering. “Thank god, someone to help,” a voice cried enthusiastically, clearly female. </p><p>“Get on before the storm hits,” I said as I gestured to the back of the snowmobile.</p><p>“What about ours, are we going to—“ started the other, but I was quick to interrupt. </p><p>“Yes, we’re going to abandon it. A storm is coming, we need to move.” </p><p>“But—“ she started, but I was quick to cut off, hoping to push them to act. I was still hoping that, maybe, just maybe, I could still return and set the last machine before the storm arrived. </p><p>“The storm is coming. Either come with me, and use your amazing abilities to fix the snowmobile. Either way, I’m leaving in five seconds,” I shouted, raising my hand, folding my thumb to denote the count, which was all I could do with the mittens I was wearing on my hand. </p><p>It was enough to make them dash forward and abandon the snowmobile. “I have picked up the two, over,” I said, informing the base about my success before I started driving back. </p><p>More than once, they tried to ask me something, but the engine of the snowmobile helped to drown their voice as I drove at full speed. My annoyance reached a spectacular degree once I checked the device buried in the control panel that informed me of the latest status of the weather, only to realize the storm was already close. </p><p>Not enough to make my desperate hurry justified, but certainly ruin my hopes of setting up the last device. </p><p>I continued to drive at the maximum speed, hoping the speed would be enough to make me ignore my annoyance, and even after we arrived, I wasn’t in the mood to speak. Instead, I stopped the engine and started to walk inside. </p><p>“What’s this place?” asked one of them as she walked behind me. “Is this some kind of pit stop for us to rest before we go back to the ship?” </p><p>Her question clearly indicated that they were not informed about the decision of their ship to leave them behind. I reached for my walkie-talkie and pressed the speech button. “We arrived at our destination, over,” I said. </p><p>“Excellent news, I’m informing their company, over,” arrived at the response, and while we did so, I led them inside, where I used to deal with them. </p><p>“Hey, I’m talking to you,” one of them cried as she followed me, her voice annoyingly high. “I asked you a question, how long are we going to stay here?” </p><p>“Explain the situation, over,” I said before passing them the walkie-talkie, then pointed a small storage unit. “You can use that to put your clothes there,” I said before I moved deeper to the base, leaving them back. </p><p>I was already annoyed enough without dealing with the necessity to explain the situation to them. </p><p>The shocked cries that reached my ear despite the walls thick enough to isolate the Antarctic cold, triggering my annoyance enough to reach the next level, suggested that it was the correct decision. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Why not push her to the limit, I decided, and rather quickly considering the monumental nature of the situation. Risky, yes, but as I captured Aria’s excited expression, I didn’t have the heart to disappoint her. </p><p>Yet, not immediately. I let those weak spanks linger another minute as I worked on her back, adding a few tantric tricks to awaken her desire more. And, if the way she was shuffling on my lap was any indicator, it wasn’t something she was particularly familiar with. </p><p>Which was good, as it showed an aggressive turn was just reckless rather than suicidal. </p><p>“You don’t seem to be caring about your punishment,” I whispered as I leaned down and kept my hand on her uniform. “Maybe we should see if you can handle a real punishment.” </p><p>“What-“ she started, only to gasp in shock as my fingers grabbed the edge of her uniform. A pull was enough to reveal her hips, and the following pull moved her panties around her ankles, leaving her bottom naked. </p><p>She might have reacted aggressively, but as my hand landed on her beautiful ass, she was quick to lose any word she might let out in a little flood of pain, resulting in a shocked gasp. “You just need to resist for ten more, little maid, now count,” I said as I spanked her again. </p><p>“One,” she gasped, her reaction automatic. </p><p>That didn’t surprise me. The whole reason I even dared to push her hard was the read I had on her. Not only she was clearly not a trained spy, but the other actions didn’t give the impression that she was quick on her feet. </p><p>The sudden change of pace, combined with the promise that it would last only a few seconds was enough to stall her response. </p><p>A horrible compromise, of course, but it would be a while until she could learn that. I slapped her ass again, this time even harder. “T-two,” she stammered, gasping in pain, giving me another little clue about her. She might have incredible magical abilities, but she certainly lacked any kind of physical training.</p><p>Even Cinder wasn’t as bad in that aspect. </p><p>“Good girl,” I murmured as I spanked her three more times, each hard enough to earn surprised cries. So, when my fingers lingered on her ass after the fifth spank, she said nothing, and just murmured in appreciation. </p><p>After all, it was better than the alternative. </p><p>As I was dealing with that, my other hand was lazing around. I continued to work on her back, though much more aggressively as I trusted the spanks to distract her properly. </p><p>Even as I slowly unraveled her uniform, leaving her back naked. </p><p>By the sixth spank, I started massaging her hips aggressively. By seventh, I was teasing her inner thighs softly, my fingers lingering far more than necessary while my other hand danced on her naked back. Though, she still obediently counted her blows.</p><p>I turned my gaze to Aria, curious about how she was reacting. She was certainly enthusiastic. One of her hands was on her chest, mauling her tits, while the other disappeared under her desk, the movement of her shoulder leaving no doubt about what actually she was doing. </p><p>Interestingly, my spy didn’t react to that. Curious, I leaned forward to see her expression, only to meet with shock and arousal. The reason she didn’t react to Aria was simpler, however. Her eyes were firmly shut. </p><p>Amusing, I thought, but said nothing as I turned my gaze back to my cute elvish spy. </p><p>By the ninth spank, before she could count, I decided to change the pace a bit more. This time, my fingers landed on her wetness, dancing aggressively. “No, that’s too much,” she gasped. </p><p>“Oh, you failed to count,” I declared immediately. “What a pathetic little performance.” </p><p>She reacted to that statement by stiffening, far worse than I expected. “I … I’m not a failure,” she gasped, her voice sharp. Clearly, I touched another sensitive spot. </p><p>“Maybe not, but we have to start from the beginning to make sure. Are you ready for the challenge?” I said, immediately backtracking from my earlier comment. There was something dangerous in the way she reacted calling her a failure, one that I would have loved to circle around under the circumstances. </p><p>Of course, the offer was absurd as well, but her impaired judgment was helpful in such cases. </p><p>“Alright,” she agreed. </p><p>“Good, but we need to change the situation a bit, we need to increase the challenge,” I declared, and before she could comment, I changed our positions, and carried her to the large couch in the room. A few seconds later, she was on the couch, on her back. </p><p>But with a very important change. Her outfit was gone. </p><p>The only piece of clothing that remained on her was her panties, and even then, considering they were still around her ankles, it was hard to say that she was still dressed. </p><p>Her naked body was certainly amazing, more than enough to rival Aria. Her breasts were just a touch smaller, but just as shapely, and the rest of her body was even more flawless — if such a thing was possible in the first place. </p><p>Maybe I would compare them side by side … later, before my little spy started to react to her punishment. I sat down next to her, and one of my hands slipped between her legs, caressing her core rapidly. “Now, start counting,” I whispered, and slapped her breast. </p><p>My slap was much weaker than my earlier spanks, which made the intensity of her beautiful moan rather interesting. It exploded loudly enough to make my insides tremble and tempt me to take an even more aggressive step forward. </p><p>I managed to suppress that. Barely. </p><p>“Don’t forget to count, sweetie,” I reminded her before slapping her breast once more. The expression of confusion on her face was tremendous, but she still started to tremble helplessly. </p><p>“One,” she moaned as her eyes flew open, pleasure jolting her out of her deep shock. The pleasure was intense enough to steal her mind, however, showing that her breasts didn’t rival Aria just in size, but also in sensitivity. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as I slapped her breasts again, but this time, rather than pulling back immediately, I stayed there, mauling softly to make her tremble. Her mouth parted as she let out another gasp, her fingers clenching tightly against the couch, showing the intensity of her emotions. </p><p>But, in her shock, she had forgotten something. “You missed one, sweetie,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Oh, no,” she murmured, but even as she started counting from one, the panic I expected to find was absent, showing the intensity of her emotions. I could sense her mind was spinning wildly. </p><p>“E-eight,” she whispered after an appropriate number of slaps that left a mark on her breasts, but she was panting even more. </p><p>“It’s good to see you’re getting in the mood,” I said, unable to resist the urge to keep it back. That made her whimper as a little hint of rationality sneaked into her mind. It took her a moment to process that, then she tried to pull away. </p><p>Pity her body lacked the energy to succeed. </p><p>“Oh, someone had forgotten to count,” I chuckled. “Let’s start from the start.” </p><p>“T-this is nonsense,” she managed to whisper as I slapped her breasts once again. </p><p>“You don’t want to be a failure, do you?” I asked, with absolutely no problem pushing against the weakness she had revealed earlier. It was not a nice thing to do, but considering she was a spy, she didn’t have grounds to argue against it. </p><p>Not that she could argue with her mouth occupied with moans, the building orgasm doing its job to distract her. </p><p>She writhed on the couch, trying to wriggle away from my touch, but considering she was still obediently counting, it was far less honest than she was trying to convince me. </p><p>Her growing passion was betraying her. </p><p>Before she could recover, I leaned down even more, and my hand focused on her wetness. She cried out loudly again, her back arching up off the couch. Her full breasts stood up against her tight body.</p><p>\"Too much,\" she whimpered, trying to protest as the pleasure coursed through her body, once again forgetting to count. This time, I didn’t even bother to remind her, just ignored her feeble, weak objections and continued to drive into her. </p><p>On the couch, she just gasped, unable to think clearly, lost in pleasure. Soon, she gave into the pleasure, unable to make sense of her jumbled thoughts and the rhythm of the invasion, the pumping of fingers doing everything that was necessary. </p><p>Soon, her arguments changed in nature. \"Yes, yes, yes!\" </p><p>“Do you want me to bring you to your first climax of the night?” I suggested. </p><p>“F-first,” she started, but that was all she was able to say before I turned on the intensity even higher, and she started to moan desperately. Soon, she was trembling on the couch, her mind losing cohesion. </p><p>Aria gasped, which was less about the show, and more about the fact that, in her orgasm, our little spy had forgotten to maintain her spell and revealed her pointy ears, creating an amazing view. It seemed that, in her distraction, Aria had forgotten about that — or maybe she was too distracted to actually notice it in the first place, distracted by her breasts when I had used that spell earlier. </p><p>No wonder why she didn’t panic even as I fingered an extremely dangerous elven spy.</p><p>Leaving me with another important decision…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as I walked away, I had a smile on my face. It had been fun to turn the supposedly boring approval session into something more. The accident was fun, but I had never expected that, despite her no-nonsense attitude, Coach Juana would dare to tease me like that. </p><p>Of course, once she did, she found herself in a game she couldn’t handle, but that was a completely different issue. </p><p>However, even as I entered my car, I didn’t have a destination in mind. I could go back to my room, but sleeping was not an option, not with the risk of the shadow assassins. It looked like they stopped coming, maybe the magic of my guide scared them from sending more … but I wasn’t willing to bet on that, not when a loss might actually cost my life. </p><p>I could go back to study, or work on my web crawler, but at this point, there wasn’t exactly a huge benefit. I needed a much better computer, maybe even a standalone server, for it to work; and money wasn’t the only thing that prevented me. </p><p>Dragging a huge server into my dorm room was hardly inconspicuous. </p><p>So, I started driving around the campus, hoping that a little movement would give me inspiration, when I had a notification on my phone. A private alert from the security system of the stadium — a little benefit of my earlier hacking.  </p><p>Curious, I turned on the security feed, only to find a familiar face digging around the equipment room. Arthur, fumbled around in the equipment room. For a moment, I was almost certain that he was sabotaging, but then I noticed that he had his own jersey in hand. He was using some kind of brush to draw something with red ink. </p><p>Though, I had a suspicion that it was not actually ink. </p><p>Curious, I watched him as he occasionally referred to the papers in his hand as he slowly drew them, fully focused. I would have loved to read the content of those papers, but unfortunately, the camera wasn’t good enough to allow me to read, so I focused on other details. Like the fact that the papers he was using were crisp and white, and not the parchment I expected to see considering he was drawing magical symbols. </p><p>Clearly, a printer was more useful than ancient scrolls. </p><p>Though, even as I watched him, I was driving toward a different location. His room, which was, at this moment, conveniently empty. </p><p>I parked the car a mile away, covered the rest of the distance by running, and sneaked into the dorm once more — which was considerably easier after my earlier scoping. Soon, I was in the basement, but not the server room. This time, my target was different. </p><p>Sabotaging the fuse box took only seconds, and unhooking the emergency one took only a few seconds more — which disabled the security cameras. It was a bad idea to have reliable power for the security cameras, but since it was a dorm and not a bank, they clearly thought it was an acceptable trade-off. The cries of protest rose across the building as I dashed up, feeling confident as the security cameras were gone. </p><p>There was a risk that Arthur had another security camera in his room not reliant on power, but it was a fair bet to take. Barely a minute later, I had already opened his door, and stepped inside. A quick glance around the room as I used my phone camera showed that there was a large, leather-bound book in a visible location. I reached with my middling senses, trying to sense if there was some kind of curse on the book. </p><p>I didn’t feel anything, so I took it, but digging through his other stuff didn’t give me anything more. After digging around a bit more, I decided to disappear. Like every break-in, the rule was fast and loose. Pity I was unprepared to leave some kind of trojan on his computer. I was afraid of poking around with his laptop — which was currently turned off — because I didn’t know whether he was responsible for the security, or the ones that assigned him, and I didn’t want to risk alarming his headquarters. </p><p>Still, I stopped at the fusebox, and turned on the power, not willing to leave any evidence of my sabotage before leaving. After another dash later, I was safely in my car, driving away… </p><p>Of course, as I did so, I continued to check Arthur as he worked on his drawing, dedicated, until he completed a very complicated scheme on the inner part of his jersey, and moved on to the other parts of his gear. As I watched him draw one over his pads, the pattern he had drawn on the jersey radiated a glow, then slowly started to disappear. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>When he had finished and left the storage room — working only on his set — I was already stomping back to my room, with my little treasure in hand. “How do you do, buddy?” I said as I looked at my new pet, which was sleeping as he leaned against his little bowl. I topped it off with Recovery-Intent before I sat on my desk, and finally started examining the book I had pilfered from Arthur. </p><p>At first glance, I could see that it was an interesting book. It was clearly old, but I was willing to guess that it was measured in centuries rather than millennia.  </p><p>“Let’s see what I have in here,” I said as I opened the leatherbound tome, and met with something much more fitting to be about magic. Thick pages yellowed with age, mysterious drawings, clearly written in hand. The book was written in multiple languages. Latin, I recognized immediately, and Greek letters were equally familiar. Some exploration showed that other sections were written in Sanskrit, Farsi, and a number of other languages. </p><p>Though it was predominantly in Latin and Greek. </p><p>“Fantastic,” I murmured as I decided to tackle the challenge. I didn’t know any of those languages, certainly, but my Traits helped. The bigger help was the internet, though I had to be careful in my search, cutting sections into smaller sections just to be safe. It was a long, thankless job, and my choppy approach hardly gave me a lot. </p><p>Still, as the time to leave for the morning session approached — luckily at eight, as today there was no physical training, and just tactical to allow the players to recover — I started to get a rudimentary understanding of the text. Not a lot. </p><p>The first thing I realized was the number of warnings about magical practitioners making mistakes to various detriments, ranging from madness to death — a great range of violent and explosive ones. The warnings were simple enough to decipher as they were open. Never dare to use Intent directly to avoid an explosive end. </p><p>Of course, they didn’t call it Intent, but used various words. Mayeia, Divineia, magic, and a bunch of other words. There was a great discourse in the book about what to call it, though I lacked the proficiency in the language to decipher the nuances in it. I could only understand that the argument was between whether to call it magic or divinity — and a bunch of other terms with philological implications. </p><p>As I dug, I met with several sacrificial rituals, including a lot of blood and entrails. Fortunately, none of those sacrificial rituals were actually about humans, and mostly targeted bulls and sheep — with occasional more exotic beasts like lions and tigers. The warnings about the risk of a poorly designed sacrificial ritual were clear, not that I really cared. I had already seen that there were other risks, in the form of cursed fires. </p><p>Another interesting aspect was the mention of a lot of gods and demons, but considering my own experiences, that was not a shock. </p><p>My real focus was all the runes and artifacts that were described to manipulate Intent — though they called it differently. There were some artifacts, and a lot of complicated runes to achieve that, each with several caveats about risks and dangers. I managed to piece together enough information to understand that it was about the risks implied in the content. </p><p>About how Intent was dangerous, especially when it was polluted with strong emotions. No wonder they were able to easily use Chess to empower themselves, yet they were treating the football game as a huge challenge. </p><p>A lot of fascinating stuff, I decided as I prepared for the meeting. I was about to leave the book behind, but after some consideration, I decided to lock it into the trunk of my car, which was safer than my dorm. </p><p>And, after some more consideration, I decided to bring my new pet with me as well. It would be a nice red herring for Arthur and the mysterious organization behind him. </p><p>With my tortoise in the back seat, I drove toward the stadium.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As it turned out, it took only seconds for her to realize the absurdity of her suggestion. She caught my eye as I walked, hesitant, so I did my best to push an expression of hesitant discomfort on my face, hoping that her pride and vindictiveness would be enough to keep her committed to this absurd idea. </p><p>I walked around her once more, and stood on her back. She said nothing, which was all I could have hoped for. She shuffled in discomfort as I put my hands on her body, and if I dared to directly grab her breasts, I had no doubt that she would have been alarmed. </p><p>My hands were on her back, right at the area her bra had been covering earlier, the safest spot to further sell my aura of hesitancy. Moreover, I wasn’t above cheating, and continued to flood her back with my healing energies — though more was a relative term, as it was still just a warmth to provide comfort, nothing compared to the flood that I had given to the poor tortoise I had brought back from the dead. </p><p>“Ahh,” she gasped as I massaged the only point I hadn’t rubbed before, dealing with the knots there, her arms twitching up and down as she tried to decide whether to cover her breasts or not. </p><p>Ultimately, she did not, giving me a chance to continue my massage while enjoying the glorious sight of her caramel skin unobstructed. My only pity was that she was still wearing the pants off her suit, depriving me of her legs, which were doubtlessly as amazing as her breasts — which made it very easy to handle that particular ‘disappointment’,</p><p>I continued with my massage, feeling her relax under my touch … which was exactly what I needed to push for more — but not without another trickery. “What do you think about this scheme, I’m particularly proud of it,” I said as she moved to a new printout. Of course, I was aware that she was just looking emptily at the last few schemes and putting her signature, but she didn’t know that I knew, which allowed me to use that to trick her. </p><p>“In what way?” she asked, her automatic response tinged with a touch of fear, understandable as despite looking at the paper for twenty seconds, she didn’t even bother tracing even the simplest aspect. </p><p>Her question was about the invitation I needed. I reached over her shoulder — which allowed me to get a much better view of her breasts, especially when she hesitantly raised her head, making the view even more beautiful, her pouty lips trembled with hesitation tempting me to dip down and steal them. </p><p>Pity, it was too much. </p><p>Instead, I put my finger on the paper, and started explaining. “The trick of this play relies on the location of the Running back. It looks like a standard rush from the interior, but he’s too far away. At first, it’ll look like a simple mistake, but then he’ll take a fake step, and take an outside route. With the tight ends blocking …” I said, explaining the plan in great detail. </p><p>Unnecessarily so, at least in terms of tactics. When it came to the massage, it had a different objective. Even as I leaned forward, my left hand stayed on her back, moving in a manner that I tried to convince her that it was absentminded as I ‘lost’ myself explaining my tricky play and all of its variations. </p><p>At the same time, my careless caresses started dragging me to other places. The side of her body at first, teasing spots that I hadn’t touched earlier, the movement slowly drifting away from methodical and turning erotic… She tensed at the change, and even sent a hesitant glance up. </p><p>I was not bad at acting, but I had a feeling that it was her own growing pleasure that worked to convince her rather than my skills. After all, the stress she had been under for the last few days had been … painful, and suddenly replaced that with pleasure, especially through a literal magical massage. </p><p>Even for a strong-willed, no-nonsense woman like my sexy coach, it was too much. After all, she had needs. </p><p>So, when my fingers drifted to the side of her breasts, her lack of any kind of complaint was very noticeable despite its inactive nature. I acted like I hadn’t noticed that even as my fingers started dancing at the edge, and I felt her shuffle. </p><p>“The chair is very uncomfortable,” she muttered after, trying to convince me that the shuffle was about anything but the pleasure that was slowly invading her body, which wasn’t particularly convincing. </p><p>Especially since, even as she shuffled, she made sure not to move her upper body much, like she was afraid of scaring my fingers from their task, still under the impression that the reveal was too much for me. </p><p>Clearly, she didn’t know much about the gossip about what I had been doing back in the den if she was buying my shyness this much. </p><p>I was tempted to dissuade her of this notion, but after some consideration, I decided against it. Instead, I pulled my fingers back to the safer spots first — amused by her tensing when I pulled back — before letting my hand drift down, caressing her smooth stomach, one that showed she had been spending most of her time in the gym not only training others, but also herself as well. </p><p>The whimper escaped her mouth when my hand climbed ups, caressing her breasts once more, this time from underneath her breasts, enjoying her trembling as I did so. Her body tensed even more, giving me the tell-tale sign of an upcoming orgasm, not immediate, but then, not too far away either. </p><p>Time to shift gears. </p><p>“You must be really suffering from the weight, let me help you properly,” I whispered as I leaned down, my tone suddenly not hesitant, but throaty and erotic. </p><p>She was shocked by the sudden change in my tone — though, admittedly, her shock might have something to do with my hands landing on her breasts, squeezing hard. </p><p>I squeezed hard, but it was not a reckless move. The extended teasing session taught me a lot about how she reacted to my touch, and the touch was just strong enough to flood her body with pleasure. </p><p>Enough that, when she opened her mouth, what escaped was a beautiful moan that filled the room. Her beautiful chocolate eyes widened in shock,  but even as she desperately pressed her lips together, I continued mauling her breasts, enjoying their perfection recklessly.</p><p>An amazing way to spice up a boring meeting, I decided. </p><p>For a minute, she said nothing, her head dipping down to hide her beautiful face even as I squeezed her breasts repeatedly, each moment enhancing her pleasure more. She battled against the sensation, but with her nipples between my finger, being squeezed repeatedly, she didn’t have much chance. </p><p>She raised her head soon, giving me a helpless glance, begging … though whether to stop or continue was a mystery. </p><p>And I was more than happy to use that ambiguity for my benefit, and continued teasing her breasts. I was initially planning to add another layer, but as I played with them, I realized she was even more sensitive than I expected, and decided to embrace the challenge of teasing her endlessly. </p><p>Each touch made her shiver more. </p><p>Her gaze got more and more intense. “Ill …” she managed to whisper as her anger flashed on her face, realizing I had been playing her earlier, interrupted by a moan.  </p><p>I decided to retaliate. After all, her actions were hardly innocent. “Come on, Coach,” I whispered throatily. “Come on, my beautiful Coach. What could I do after you went and revealed those amazing breasts to me? I’m only human.” </p><p>Her blush was spectacular. </p><p>“That was—” she whispered, pausing to let out a moan as I chose that moment to twist her nipple. “That was an accident,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, reflecting disbelief — which was fake, as I knew it was my own magical accident that triggered it. “What about after then, when you didn’t even bother covering these amazing wonders?” I followed, letting my fingers dig into her breasts, as if there was any chance of misunderstanding what I was referring to in the first place. </p><p>That, she failed to answer. After all, even with the way I had been acting, there was no doubt about the true nature of her actions. She was the one that chose to weaponize her spectacular breasts for amusement, and a good massage was hardly a valid excuse. </p><p>Yet, shame was a beautiful aphrodisiac, and, combined with my treatment, she started trembling with the orgasm. The pleasure invaded her … but even with her moans, I could feel that she would retaliate against her earlier loss … and it would certainly not be sexual. </p><p>So, I chose to beat a hasty retreat. “Feel free to finish the rest of the plays in your own time, Coach,” I said as I pulled back, and when she realized what happened, I was already at the door. “I’ll visit to pick the signed plays tomorrow evening,” I said. </p><p>She froze, still unable to process her explosive orgasm… “And, don’t play games if you’re not ready to lose, I might not be merciful the next time,” I said before slamming the door behind me. </p><p>Did teasing her made any sense from a sense of safety? No. But sometimes, the temptation was too strong to deny. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until our next encounter… </p>",

    "content": "<p>My smile was hard to contain as I walked into my kitchen, preparing a huge pitcher of iced tea. </p><p>It was out outside, but not enough for me to finish a huge pitcher alone. Luckily, I wasn’t alone, far from it. I smiled I listened to the laughs coming from outside, from my pool. </p><p>Ten minutes ago, I hadn’t planned to do anything but watch some tape for my Saturday, to make sure I was sharp. It was a plan that had been ruined once my doorbell rang. I wasn’t expecting anything, so assumed it was delivery. </p><p>I certainly wasn’t expecting five beauties, each wearing sun dresses. Surprise, Sarah said as she pushed me away — a bit harder than I expected, probably still annoyed about our last encounter — while Naomi explained that they decided to surprise me with a midday pool party. </p><p>It was hardly a point to reject that statement after all the time we spent together — with all of them, in various combinations — so I just pulled the aside and told them to feel at home while I dealt with the preparations. </p><p>And, I had to admit, having the girls over for a fun pool party wasn't exactly the worst idea ever. </p><p>As I prepared in the kitchen, I could hear them jumping down into the water one after another. I was yet to see what they were wearing for the pool, but I didn’t hurry up. Sometimes, pleasure required some seasoning. </p><p>I carried the tray with all the glasses as I walked toward the garden. </p><p>Carrie was the one I had noticed first, sitting on the grass, her incredible breasts proudly supported by a black bikini top. The contrast of the dark fabric against her alluring exposed cleavage was spectacular. The top wasn’t supposed to be revealed based on the cut, but her breasts clearly disagreed. </p><p>The bottoms were even more modest, and combined with her position, gave nothing but her beautiful legs. And, since our earlier encounters showed that she was certainly not body-shy — at least not yet — it was not hard to imagine she had another ploy in play. </p><p>In contrast, Irene went with a relatively plain white one-piece with black patterns. Well, at least, it was supposed to be. The situation was even worse —  better — than Carrie’s swimsuit, because unlike Carrie’s, Irene’s swimsuit was clearly designed for someone with less generous sizes. </p><p>Though, knowing her, it was referring to an obscure fictional character or something. </p><p>I could have spent half a day watching her, if she wasn’t swimming next to Naomi, who had decided to go with something rather more playful. Bright orange, and more revealing than the other two, but nothing that would cause a scandal on a beach. Of course, her tight body and her glistening skin would have gathered all the gazes. </p><p>At the corner of the pool, I could see Ida, who had decided to go radically more conservative than the others. A green top with absolutely no hint of cleavage from any side — which was impressive as she certainly didn’t have small breasts — and her bottoms were more reminiscent of shorts than bikini bottoms, joining the latter category only in a technicality. </p><p>Though, without her camera in hand, even that was enough to make her blush as she caught my gaze and dipped down. </p><p>Her bipolar attitude was simply sexy — especially since she didn’t go between two extremes of crazy, but two extremes of hotness. </p><p>Only one was missing, though, considering the footsteps from behind, it wasn’t hard to guess where she was. “Don’t make her have an aneurysm, she’s a bit shy,” Sarah said. </p><p>I turned, and couldn’t help but whistle in appreciation. Because, unlike the others, Sarah was wearing an absolutely maddening piece of swimwear, the kind that more fitting in sexy magazine covers than on public beaches. Her set was dark scarlet, yet the suggestiveness of the color took the second piece. </p><p>She was wearing a crazy set of a string bikini, with two tiny triangles to cover her nipples that required only half an inch to create a scandal, and the bottom was only slightly better. As she passed me, I caught sight of the bottom, which was a string, and nothing else.</p><p>I said nothing, because if the gasps coming from the rest, I wasn’t the only one that was ambushed by it. I chuckled as I watched their gazes, in various shades of jealousy and frustration. None of them were innocent alone — or even in various duo combinations — but clearly, they had been planning to play the pool party more casually. After all, with the exception of Carrie, none of them had the full view of the situation.</p><p>Sarah broke that implicit covenant. </p><p>And, I thought as I kept my gaze on her hips, which were swaying far too aggressively to be a natural walk, broke that spectacularly. </p><p>Only in Carrie’s gaze, I could see a hint of satisfaction, clearly appreciating the opportunity to push the situation even more while looking like she was blameless, though that didn’t mean her jealousy was fake. </p><p>That was very much real as well. </p><p>My devious little blonde. </p><p>I had the ability to hide my gaze, but where was the fun in that. Instead, I kept my gaze on her dancing hips, curious just how much that little trick would push the rest. </p><p>Naomi coughed playfully, hiding one word. “Showoff.” </p><p>Sarah just smirked at her as she slowly slid into the water, and started swimming. </p><p>“Now, I feel perched,” I said loudly. “Who else wants some ice tea.” </p><p>“Me,” Irene said, and she started swimming toward the edge. As she swam, she fixed her swimsuit. It felt weird, as she didn’t seem shy enough to fix that.</p><p>I realized I was mistaken when she held to the edge, which gave the sight of her cleavage, the perfect view revealing that her earlier playing didn’t reduce her cleavage but increased even more, to the point of revealing a hint of the areola. </p><p>What a naughty little sexy beast, more than daring to join the game once it started. </p><p>“Thanks,” she said as she started sipping on the side, but none of the others were daring enough to join the game immediately, so I walked toward the table with the tray, leaving them to frolic in the water — or in Carrie’s case, stand on the side. </p><p>I had great hopes for an amazing party…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was feeling much different as I planned to leave the vault, lighter and stronger. </p><p>No doubt, considering the amount of improvement I had just experienced. Pity I didn’t have time to use the rest of the Purified Spark I had managed to score. I could have stayed to improve more, but at this point, the treant was already being surrounded, and I didn’t want to ruin things until things collapsed. </p><p>And, I didn’t want to miss the opportunity. </p><p>I had drawn several runes into the vault, and dumped enough nature mana to make it dangerous, before I teleported down to roots, using the earlier teleportation beacon I had created.</p><p>With the increase in Stats, the jump was even more trivial. </p><p>The moment I arrived at the basement, I lashed out with a magical bolt, which was enough to take down the necromancer imbuing the water with his cursed mana. </p><p>{+50 Purified Spark}</p><p>Not a waste, but only the start compared to what I had in mind. First, I rushed toward the bubbling mana source, and created a huge ward around it, one that used both Purified Mana and some Nature Spark, and suddenly, the river had changed from necrotic mana to nature mana. </p><p>The sudden change of mana flow affected the battle outside significantly. The undead lines, surprised by the change, retreated more than necessary. And, it allowed the treant to rush forward, and connect the huge dead tree… </p><p>A mental order later, the treant sacrificed itself, and all the mana that it was on its structure infused on the tree… A significant amount, but not enough to leave anything but cursory damage. Luckily, that was all I needed. At the same time, I triggered the explosive wards I had in the vault, and rushed toward the edge of the tree. </p><p>Neither was there to actually create damage, just a distraction. </p><p>The real trick came in the form of an aggressive release. </p><p>{-2000 Purified Spark}</p><p>{-10000 Mana}</p><p>A huge, spectacular risk, but also, it was the fastest way to take down the tree. My purified spark spread along the tree, converting every Necrotic mana and Spark they touched. First, I split the wave into two. One wave channeled upward, to ease the path of the mana that came from the sacrificial treant. </p><p>The second, bigger wave traveled down, converting all the mana and Divine Spark they had invested to the tree … every root started to convert from a neutral entity. </p><p>At this time, the liches were panicking against the sudden tyrannical mana fluctuation ruining their fortress much worse than they were expecting. They realized that their arrogance, probably from their overwhelming success against ineffective elves, put them in a horrible position. </p><p>They attacked the treant both with their crystal and their spells, which was another mistake. After channeling all the mana and spark inside, the treant had already turned into a useless relic. </p><p>Their erroneous judgment made their small chances even more horrible. If they had been using the dead tree as a casting focus, they could have thwarted my assault, but they didn’t, giving me a chance to actually follow. </p><p>Soon, the wave of mana and Spark I had sent to the roots finished its job. I sent the mana toward the trunk, but devoured all the Spark from the roots. </p><p>Soon, the Spark from the upper trunk arrived as well…</p><p>{+6801 Purified Divine Spark} </p><p>Another spectacular gain, enough to trigger another huge stat boost, one that I desperately needed to meet the next upcoming battle. </p><p>{-5900 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>{+3 All Stats}</p><p>Fantastic… </p><p>I opened my eyes to focus on the control, this time the Aether dimension. I could sense the connection with the outer shell, but the constant flow of Necrotic mana toward the shell had stopped. It didn’t cause an immediate collapse, but I doubted it would stay like that for long. </p><p>“I found my way to trigger an urgent undead response,” I murmured happily. Not only this dead tree was more important for their strategy, but also I didn’t risk any valuable elven lives as a trap. </p><p>But, before any response, I needed to do a lot more things. </p><p>I grabbed the ground, and pulled some stone on me, turning into a shiny, obsidian armor, and a huge, beautiful sword. Completely useless, but enough to look distracting. </p><p>But, before going outside, I had to do one more thing. I threw another small seed, and created a small tree, one that was connected to God Forest, right at the river, converting the watery mana into pure Nature mana, and sending it upward. </p><p>I could have tried to connect it to the huge tree, but I was afraid that it might trigger an adverse reaction. I could feel that the huge tree was not something simple. </p><p>Then, even as mana started to fill the underground cave, converting from the river — which was much easier than the challenge the necromancers experienced due to similarity — I created a tunnel, and went out. </p><p>Appearing from right underneath the remains of the tree. </p><p>Risky, but after the great stat boost, a risk I could afford easily. </p><p>The sacrificial explosion of treant had been useful for two reasons. First, it dealt with most of the zombies, which would have slowed me down. Second, and more importantly, as the distraction went through, a great number of necromancers had gathered around, trying to be the first ones to take the Spark of the treant. </p><p>A few of them were already fighting against each other. </p><p>I couldn’t say that they had no justification as far as what they could read, but it didn’t change the fact that it was a mistake. </p><p>A deadly one. </p><p>I rushed forward toward the closest lich before they could even register my presence, my newly enhanced speed more than enough to cut it mercilessly. A deadly slash was all I needed to deal with it, though the slash was just there to cover the huge burst of pure mana, eroding its divine spark. </p><p>{+95 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>That changed the situation significantly, but they lacked the opportunity to react before I started mowing them down. I dodged under a hurried blast of necrotic mana and took another necromancer. </p><p>A fascinating start. </p><p>As they started to gather their defenses, I put my hand on the ground, and a small forest appeared around me, and appeared rather rapidly, enough to conceal me from their view as I dashed around… </p><p>The trees turned into treants while I cut down necromancers one after another, while the invasion of mana started to wreak havoc in the trunk of the dead tree, especially since all necromancers had recklessly walked outside, and were too distracted by my assault to even notice that. </p><p>Another flare of mana, and a huge number of leaves rained down from the trees that appeared freshly, destroying the hordes that were attacking. I was showing a bit more than I had initially intended, but after all my gains, I was willing to reveal more. </p><p>After all, I had some other interesting tricks I was ready to use. </p><p>What followed was fifteen minutes of non-stop battle, which was surprisingly boring. Especially since it was one against a necromancer army. If they had been attacking me using a proper formation, things had been much more difficult…</p><p>But with their vulnerable elements, the only ones with the ability to actually threaten me, facing me directly, the danger had been lost almost immediately. And, after the disappearance of the risk, what remained was a large army that couldn’t threaten me, one that I cut easily. </p><p>With amazing benefits. Even though it was lesser than my other gains, it was still significant nonetheless. </p><p>{+728 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>While I had dealt with the outside, the constant infusion of Nature Mana already handled the internal defenses, and destroyed the inner side, killing the remaining undead. </p><p>That didn’t mean I stopped the rest after the battle was over. I dashed around the dead tree, using my new stats to create a very complicated defensive ward that could be leveraged against the assault. </p><p>The defenses were much stronger than the other settlement, and not just because of the increased stats. Unlike the settlement, I didn’t need to keep my defenses subtle or hidden. </p><p>After all, I had just taken down a huge undead army, and the lack of any growing defense would have been more suspicious than the alternative. I dared to do so, as, if the worst came to worst, I could just teleport away… </p><p>With that done, I started waiting. And, since I had nothing to do, I turned my attention to the Aether Dimension once more. Not just to replenish my mana storage, but also to finally examine the structure of the outer shell…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 16    Charisma: 16</p><p>Precision: 16    Perception: 16</p><p>Agility: 16     Manipulation: 16</p><p>Speed: 16       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 16      Wisdom: 16}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 2392}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 4140}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2009}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000] </p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t sure what to expect as the huge treant got closer to the undead fortress. I didn’t expect panic, at least not the blind kind if such a monster attacked a city filled with people. Zombies lacked the sentience to be affected by their oncoming end, and liches could always retreat. </p><p>However, even when counting that, I was surprised by the reaction the sapient undead was displaying against the battle.

And the ones that stayed back were clearly unhappy. </p><p>I already knew they were using it to capture Divine Spark, and probably for an important objective, but the intensity of their reaction and the incentive they were displaying that they were somehow benefiting from captured Divine Spark. </p><p>And, considering their speed to join a potentially dangerous battle, they not only benefited from it, but they also benefited from it significantly. Which was curious, forcing me to reexamine most of my assumptions about the battle. Clearly, something else was going on.</p><p>Luckily, I had the time to examine that. Just as the first wave of zombies was dashing toward the treant I started examining my strategy, curious whether I could attract the remaining group as well. </p><p>First, how to handle the first wave. There was no chance the zombies could damage the treant even a bit, but even at a distance, I could feel the excessive amount of necrotic mana filling every zombie. They weren’t going there to damage, but to deliver some mana. </p><p>Smart, too bad I had no intention of allowing that to happen. I sent another magical order, and the treant raised its wooden arm. A swing distributed hundreds of seeds, and a small horde of smaller treants rose, moving faster to meet with the zombies. </p><p>One horde against the other, while I watched through a remote spell. As they crashed, chaos appeared under their feet, grass and flowers blooming and dying repeatedly in a spectacular display of the circle of life. Zombies died, and treants got injured, even as I slowly started to tap into the core of the situation. </p><p>A glamorous battle slowly covered the plain in front of the tree fortress, balanced even as the sky started to get covered by the fluctuations of mana. </p><p>However, the balance didn’t survive for long. As the number of necromancers on the field increased, they started to support the treant from a distance, slowly chipping the smaller army of summons. </p><p>Pity there were still many guards at the vault. I wondered if I could actually trick them. I let the huge treant radiate even more nature mana even if it started tapping into the reserves I had created. </p><p>Yet, it was effective for two reasons. First, it allowed the treant to rush forward faster, taking down more and more zombies, and doing so rather rapidly as the horde got closer and closer to repurposed remains of the previous tree. Second, and more importantly, it implied that the treant had even more Divine Spark than they had first thought. </p><p>The temptation didn’t take long for the work. A few more liches rushed into the vault and left with empty crystals, and after some argument, they left, leaving only two Death Knights to guard. Not willingly as I could feel they were the weakest ones. Their reaction confirmed that even with the extra juice, they didn’t see the treant as a threat but as an opportunity. </p><p>I understood their approach, certainly. Pity, it was a horrible decision. </p><p>Since the threat of the casters was no more, I approached the vault much easier, and relaxed as I suppressed my magic. I started gathering my magic, sharpening the nature mana into two deadly spears, and soon, I let them loose. </p><p>{-1290 Mana}</p><p>Two death knights went down immediately, before they could even react. I created a cage of mana, preventing the remaining mana in their structure from dispersing, and drained their Divine Spark. </p><p>{+29 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>Now that the threat of the death knights was no more, I started working on the Vault, quickly unraveling the security layers, enough to allow me to enter. Luckily, the defenses were more focused to prevent unauthorized access than actual protection, which made the problem much simpler than otherwise. Soon, I was inside. </p><p>“Wow, that’s a lot of crystals,” I murmured as I examined rows and rows of crystals, though I noted that once one crystal was placed, a magical defense activated to prevent it from being removed. Not a huge problem, but harder than the entrance — especially since, at the same time, I had to keep my attention on the treant and make sure it was giving a valid defense. </p><p>The challenge got bigger since I couldn’t actually let any of the liches or death knights approach, because, unlike what I was faking, the treant only had a few points of Divine Spark, and most were about trying to maintain the connection. So, I used the reserves to aggressively blast any that approached — even if it destroyed a few death knights and ruined the opportunity to steal all the Spark they had. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t care much about a few dozen points, not when I was looking at the hundreds of crystals that were in the vault. </p><p>Two minutes later, the first row was successfully unlocked. It wasn’t a huge amount of time, but unfortunately, not little either. Not with a battle going on outside, each second costing a dangerous amount of mana. </p><p>{+529 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>“Amazing,” I murmured, but before starting to work on the next row, I decided to make a little adjustment. </p><p>{-442 Purified Divine Spark]</p><p>{+2 Intelligence}</p><p>{+2 Manipulation} </p><p>The immediate boost not only allowed my mana to dance much more smoothly, but also allowed me to understand the intricacies of the situation even better. Soon, the second of the ten rows was unlocked, and it took about a minute and a half. </p><p>{+621 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>Excellent, I thought even as I applied the next wave of improvements, even as I started to feel the weight of the unbalanced attributes. Luckily, there was still some margin to push. </p><p>{-432 Purified Divine Spark]</p><p>{+1 Intelligence}</p><p>{+1 Manipulation} </p><p>{+1 Perception}</p><p>With those three increased as well, each row took less than thirty seconds to unlock, which meant, the remaining eight rows barely took four minutes. </p><p>{+5210 Purified Spark}</p><p>A fascinating amount of Divine Spark. </p><p>It was still a challenge to balance the battle outside, but the treant managed to both keep the illusion that it was packed with Divine Spark, but also drove much closer toward the fortress than I had been expecting. </p><p>It surprised me. I was already planning to let the treant retreat a bit to maintain the illusion, but the magic of the necromancers had been much weaker, and the defenses were much more chaotic. Then, I realized the problem. </p><p>The necromancers were manipulating the defenses, and they were doing so to allow treant to approach much easier. For a moment, I was surprised, as while the existence of the traitors wouldn’t have been shocking, it was a weird location to reveal that. </p><p>Then, I realized that their trick was a bit different than I had predicted earlier. Instead of weakening the defenses of their opponents, they were weakening theirs … only to draw the treant closer, clearly hoping to take the biggest share of Spark once it was taken down. </p><p>A fascinating show of selfishness … though maybe not, considering I was dealing with a bunch of people that sacrificed their lives for a cursed existence. </p><p>Regardless of their drive, it gave me a rather interesting opportunity. But, before taking that opportunity, I needed some more improvements. First, some physical boost to balance the weight of the stats. </p><p>{+5 Strength}</p><p>{+5 Precision}</p><p>{+5 Agility}</p><p>{+5 Speed}</p><p>{+5 Endurance}</p><p>{-2550 Purified Divine Spark]</p><p>“Finally,” I murmured as the familiar warmth spread into my body, one that gave me the necessary physical improvement to allow me to push for more and more. </p><p>Next, I wanted to top off the Wisdom and Charisma to match the other stats. </p><p>{+4 Wisdom}</p><p>{+3 Charisma}</p><p>{-746 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>And just like that, my stats were fully balanced, and with a great amount of Purified Spark available to be leveraged for the next stage or to be converted to Stats if necessary, but converting and absorbing all that Spark took another few minutes of me. </p><p>Enough time to get the treant even closer… which stopped me from improving my other stats. Getting even stronger was nice, but not at the cost of ruining my opportunity. </p><p>It was showtime.</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 13    Charisma: 13</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 13</p><p>Agility: 13     Manipulation: 13</p><p>Speed: 13       Intelligence: 13</p><p>Endurance: 13      Wisdom: 13}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 2618}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 12140}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2009}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Lily was still frozen as she watched her friend walk away, unable to believe what was going on. A part of it was accidentally touching his half-naked body, even though it wasn’t somewhere dangerous. </p><p>Another part was his muscles, which looked much more … captivating from up close. It was easy to mock Jenny’s whorish ways until she got a glimpse of them up close. </p><p>“How dare you,” she gasped, speaking loud enough to suppress the sudden shame she was feeling. </p><p>“I’m doing what?” Darion answered, his tone cold. Too cold. </p><p>“Removing your shirt without permission!” Lily gasped, doubling down on anger. </p><p>“Permission, really?” he said, chuckling. </p><p>“Of course, you do what I want, or you get fired—“ Lily started, only to realize he was walking away. “Where are you going!” she gasped as she chased him. </p><p>“Well, since you’ll get me fired, I don’t need to stay here, right?” Darion said. </p><p>Lily froze for a moment before she chased him. “You’re bluffing,” she declared, even though it didn’t feel like he was doing so. At all. He didn’t respond, so she picked up speed, and blocked his path. “You can’t leave,” she gasped. </p><p>“Of course I can, unless you’re planning to wrestle me down,” he said with a mocking tone, but his face was hard. “I don’t need to explain to you how bad it’d end, right?” </p><p>“But, your job…” Lily found herself muttering, feeling like a rug pulled under her feet. She was so confident in her control, and suddenly losing that made her feel … dazed.</p><p>“You think that’s a job that I would care to lose,” Darion said as he walked, and Lily rubbed her head, trying to calm down. Maybe it wasn’t too bad. As long as she didn’t actually reveal those pictures to her sister, she might try to negotiate something else. “Too bad your friend will mock you for your failure,” he said. </p><p>“Oh, no,” Lily gasped as she reached to grab his arm, imagining just how badly Mary would gossip all around the school. She was Lily’s friend, but also she was the biggest gossip the school had ever seen. </p><p>However, just as she touched him, he grabbed her and pulled her in front of him, and she froze. “Did I tell you how much I don’t like people touching me without permission,” he growled, and suddenly, Lily felt her legs lose strength. </p><p>It was good that his grip was strong. </p><p>“Y-you can’t leave,” she stammered. “I’ll be humiliated.” </p><p>“You should have thought that before blackmailing me,” he answered. “So, unless you want to entice me to stay…” he dragged. </p><p>“How?” she asked, even though she had a very good idea what he was driving at. </p><p>“You’re a smart girl, guess,” he said. </p><p>“I…” Lily murmured, realizing maybe she shouldn’t blame Jenny too much. After all, she was realizing that, once she found herself in a compromising position, it was very hard to reject the offer. Even if that was implicit. </p><p>She nodded.</p><p>A gasp followed immediately as he grabbed her ass, his fingers digging into her flesh, unlike anything she had ever felt before. He lifted her easily … which was good because her legs were trembling badly. </p><p>“W-we need to be quick, she won’t take long,” she barely managed to gasp. </p><p>“Okay, why don’t you show me how are you going to convince me to stay, then,” he answered, his smirk taking her breath and her legs trembling… </p><p>Which was good, as she didn’t need her legs to do what she had in mind to convince her to stay. She just hoped that Mary stayed away long enough. </p><p>She reached for his belt, quickly getting rid of his pants. She needed to work hard if she wanted to convince her before her friend —</p><p>“Are you alright, sweetie, you are not moving,” he said, his voice enough to restart her mind. Barely, she realized as her gasp hit her ears while she processed his size. She knew he was big, from the time she watched him work on Jenny, but close, it was different. </p><p>So very different… </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, it’s not going to suck itself. Either start, or I’m going to—“ he started, but Lily pushed forward, proud that she was able to silence him as she took most of it, even if it required her to take some of his assistance. “Not bad for a little naughty bitch,” he whispered. </p><p>Lily found herself blushing, though she felt lucky that her mouth was too full to answer — as she was coming blank. As he pulled her back and forth, she lost the sense of time … but it couldn’t be long, because Mary was yet to return. </p><p>Her lack of breath hit her hard, as when he pulled back, she found herself collapsing, the only reason her moans not filling the house was his hands, keeping a firm hold over her mouth. “That was good, for a start…” he said. </p><p>“S-start,” she stammered, her eyes wide. </p><p>“Of course a start,” he answered with a merciless chuckle, even as he got rid of her outfit, leaving her naked … and very vulnerable, with him positioned right at the position.</p><p>“But…” she whispered. </p><p>“But, what, little whore princess. Don’t tell me you’re inferior to the other redhead in the office?” </p><p>Lily knew he was teasing her, but she had no intention of being inferior to that whore… “Of course not,” she declared. </p><p>“Then, what’s the problem,” he asked. </p><p>“I’m not … wet enough,” she said. She certainly was, but it was better than admitting she was afraid of his girth. </p><p>“That’s easily fixable, sweetie,” he said, and Lily found herself leaning against the wall, his fingers skillfully dancing at her entrance, with a mixture of elegance and merciless domination that she didn’t even think to be possible. </p><p>As his fingers danced in her core, she slowly lost her connection with reality, along with the reasons for rejecting him, including one that was urgent … for some reason. “Are you ready, now?” he asked. </p><p>“N-no, not yet,” she managed to gasp. </p><p>“Let’s bring the big guns, then,” he said, once again displaying his strength as he easily changed her position, her weight nothing against his muscles. His fingers were replaced with his tongue, working even harder at her entrance, each brush of his thick tongue stealing more and more of her concerns.</p><p>Leaving only pleasure behind…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Now, repeat the rules,” Lily said as they finally parked at their destination, breaking the silence.</p><p>She was clearly trying to be oppressive and domineering as they drove, letting him boil at the shock of getting caught, but he just enjoyed the silent drive while having a sexy and barely dressed woman in the passenger seat. </p><p>Hardly the worst punishment he had ever experienced, which was why he decided to play along a bit more. “I’m going to stay in the car, and wait for you to return. I’ll keep my phone charged, and if you give me a call, I’ll respond immediately, playing along…” Darion repeated. </p><p>A rather long list, lucky that Darion had no problems breaking his word if necessary. </p><p>“Good, you’re sharp,” she said smugly and condescendingly as she put her hands on her waist. He might even felt like breaking his word, but he decided to cut her some slack — owing to her scandalous tank top, one that slipped high enough to reveal her areolas. </p><p>That mistake was enough to earn a little more goodwill from him. </p><p>“Now, wait here, away from the main gate, I don’t want her to see you,” she said before she turned and left. </p><p>“Well, a promise is a promise,” Darion murmured and started waiting for a whole ten minutes, before he stepped out of the car. While he was away from the gate, the walls didn’t block the sound, laughter hitting his ears, both female. </p><p>“Let’s see why she’s trying to keep me here,” Darion murmured as he looked at the wall. An imposing barrier, but nowhere as impenetrable as it actually looked, which was why, even in this age, burglary was a nice source of income. </p><p>A jump and a strong grip were all he needed to take a good grip, and he pulled himself, curious about what he would find… </p><p>And what he found was beautiful…</p><p>***</p><p>“I don’t believe you.”  </p><p>Lily looked at her friend in frustration, unable to believe that it was taking her that long to convince her friend about that. “I’m telling you, Mary, I already caught him having sex in the office. So, either he listens to me, or he’s fired. We can finally go to that concert out-of-state while using some excuse about a library or something.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she answered with a dubious frown. “It sounds unbelievable, and even if that’s true, I don’t want a random janitor hanging around us. It’ll totally cramp our style.” </p><p>Lily let a smirk cover her face. “That’s the best part, he won’t. Not only he’s a total hottie, but he’s also truly buff, and he has this amazing chocolate skin that almost glows…” She paused a moment to imagine what kind of skin-care regiment he was using. She refused to believe that it was a natural thing. </p><p>“Really?” Mary said, her tone unconvinced. “You think he’s hot. You, miss I don’t even look anything lower than nine.” </p><p>“Oh, you have to see his muscles. They are simply amazing. To die for, even.” </p><p>“Okay, pass that phone and show me then,” Mary answered.</p><p>She raised her phone, but ignored Mary’s raised hand, and instead pressed the call button. “How about if I do something better?” she smirked. </p><p>“You’re calling him here,” Mary gasped. “Won’t he be annoyed to drive back?” </p><p>“He won’t, because I ordered him to wait,” Lily answered, giggling at her friend’s fascination. It was good to order people around. She could now see why her sister liked it so much. </p><p>“Hey, Darion…” she started. </p><p>*** </p><p>A frown was on Darion’s face as he turned off the phone after the long, annoying phone call. “Impressive,” he murmured. “I trusted her not to annoy me for at least another day. Maybe I overestimated her.” </p><p>Darion thought about turning back and leaving, but after some consideration, he decided against it — and mostly due to her friend’s swimsuit preference. A nice topless show deserved its reward. </p><p>With that, Darion walked toward the gate, which they buzzed him around the house, and saw the girls. “Is it too late to change my mind,” he murmured in frustration as he realized Lily’s friend had already put her top back on. </p><p>Pity, he thought, but after a short consideration, he decided to continue walking. Maybe it wouldn’t be too difficult to convince her to get rid of those… </p><p>“Oh, I can see why you were drooling when you talked about him. He’s simply divine,” her friend said as she looked at him like a particularly tasty piece of dish, a look Darion was familiar with — and, considering what he could see, had no problems either. </p><p>Maybe he should stay a few minutes. </p><p>“So, my dear bodyguard,” Lily started smugly. “I was just talking about the details of our deal with my best friend, and she mentioned that she would love to go to this concert…” </p><p>“I’m guessing that’s not too close,” Darion said, the view enough to make him play along a bit more.</p><p>“Not too much, just a four-hour drive,” Mary said, her smirk widening. “Discounting the traffic, of course.”</p><p>“I don’t expect it to be too bad, after all, it’s just fifty thousand people in a stadium, how bad could it be,” Lily completed. “I believe that my dear friend Darion wouldn’t ruin that little plan.” </p><p>“You seem sure,” Darion answered, barely holding back a chuckle as he tried to play along, which was harder than he expected. She was even worse than Jenny in terms of looking authoritative. </p><p>“Of course,” Lily answered, with a little pause that was supposed to be menacing, but mostly worked to arouse him, especially combined with the way they dressed. “I know that you won’t go against my little request…” </p><p>“Don’t be so rude, Lily, maybe he has something important. It’s late notice, after all.” </p><p>“Oh, I’m sure he doesn’t have anything. He mentioned that while we were driving,” she said, then, much to Darion’s surprise, she walked closer. She was on the raised step, which allowed her to hover above him as she put her hand on his cheek, caressing. </p><p>Darion had to admit. She had some nice nuggets about intimidation. Stepping into someone’s personal space without invitation, even going as far as to put a hand on the cheek was daring stuff. </p><p>Too bad she had two problems. One, the way she dressed. The second, her target… </p><p>Darion just smirked, staying silent for a moment. </p><p>“Oh, this is getting heated,” her friend interjected. “Maybe I should go get us some fresh drinks, preferably something cold to help me handle this.” </p><p>“Mary!” Lily gasped, ruining the little she was able to gather in terms of authority. “Don’t ruin my great pose.” </p><p>“Actually, you’re right, it’s a bit hot,” Darion chuckled as he removed his shirt while Lily was looking at her friend. A fact that Lily somehow managed not to notice as she replaced her hand on her cheek. </p><p>“Oh, you’re right, he’s a total beefcake,” Mary said in appreciation, who wasn’t distracted enough to miss that. </p><p>“Hey, wait, where’s your shirt,” Lily gasped as she pulled back her hand like it was burned, while Darion just smirked. </p><p>“Oh, now, I really need to go pick something cold to drink. This is impossible to handle,” Mary said as she walked away, leaving Darion alone with Lily in the courtyard. </p><p>Good, he thought. He needed to have a talk with her about boundaries… </p><p>“Don’t worry, </p>",

    "content": "<p>Trying to tease an elf directly was a terrible and unnecessary risk, I thought even as I whispered something into Aria’s ear. After all, not only they represented a great threat — Cinder giving me a good idea about their potential strength range as their cosmic rival — but I also had no idea the kind of unique tricks they could pull. </p><p>Cinder’s abilities relating to the living flame had certainly been eye-opening, and the less that was said about her miraculous transformation, the better. There was a high likelihood that, not only elves had similar abilities, but there was a chance that those abilities weren’t conveniently inaccessible due to a mental block. </p><p>After all, not all my enemies would be like Cinder, taking a risk just to prove herself… </p><p>Therefore, it was an unnecessary risk to push that mysterious elf. </p><p>Aria followed my request. “What a clumsy maid?” she gasped in scorn — well, as close as scorn as she could manage, which wasn’t particularly close, and her excitement made it even more unconvincing. “You deserve a punishment.” </p><p>A terrible and unnecessary risk, which didn’t mean I wouldn’t take it. The shock of the inexperience I had seen on her beautiful face was all that I needed to push my mysterious spy far harder than it was reasonable. </p><p>“A … punishment, my lady,” our spy gasped, which was also enough to reveal that there was a problem. Maids didn’t react to such words not with confusion but with pure panic. </p><p>“Do you want me to handle the punishment while you handle your important paperwork, my princess,” I whispered loudly even as I used my access to grope her. It was always fun to tease her, but the real reason was to give the elf a moment to process the upcoming situation. I didn’t want her to react in panic, but considered it slowly. </p><p>Luckily, my earlier threat about targeting whoever arranging her access seemed to work, as, despite her blush, she stayed in place. </p><p>“Good idea,” Aria answered after some delay, and I slid out of my seat, and started walking toward our spy, her eyes widening. Too much, meaning I needed to relax her. </p><p>“A spanking is enough, right, my princess? After all, no need to push the poor maid too much,” I said, and saw our spy relax once Aria nodded, watching the situation enthusiastically. </p><p>Not surprising after the passion she displayed while she punished Emma. </p><p>I turned my attention back to our spy, her amateurish nature when it came to the subject couldn’t be more apparent. Her gaze darting was enough to make her thoughts visible, and the loosening of her expression admitted that she was willing to accept the punishment unless things escalated too much. </p><p>Her choice of illusion spell to show her expression while hiding her unique features made it even easier to hide it. </p><p>As I closed in, she reacted predictably tense, giving me the impression that if I dared to grab her arm, I would end up in a spell on the face. I needed to give her a bit of control even as I punished her, I decided as I sat down. </p><p>And patted my lap, inviting her to walk on her own. She froze, standing silently. I might have already gotten bored if I didn’t feel the thumping of her magic softly, showing that her power was considerable. </p><p>It worked excellently when mixed with her incredible beauty, and the maid uniform wasn’t exactly boring either. The contrast was particularly impressive. Her face contorted in confusion, but didn’t act. </p><p>Aria looked at me, ready to push, but I gestured for her to stay silent. She just accepted, with no problem. </p><p>For a minute, she stood in front of me, with her hands wringing the hem of her skirt — though I hardly needed that to read the intensity of her nervousness. Only when I was sure she wouldn’t react, I spoke. “Come on, sweetie, you don’t want to ignore the order of your princess, do you?” </p><p>That move finally extorted a step, which turned into two, and soon, she started walking. Slowly and hesitantly, but walking nonetheless. </p><p>The only thing that was not on her face was fear, confident in her magical power that there was no risk. After all, she was in the same room with a princess famous for her healing only, and her boy toy. </p><p>What harm could such a useless man bear, right?</p><p>I decided to tease her a bit more. Just as she was about to bend over, I gestured to the door. “Actually, why don’t you go and pour me a drink before we start,” I offered. </p><p>And, just like that, I saw what I was hoping for. A spark of anger, an emotion that was easy to convert into a passion. “Of course, sir,” she said between her clenched teeth. </p><p>She turned and walked toward the door, but before she could leave the room, I called her again. “Actually, scratch that, I don’t want to spill it. You can bring one after your punishment.” </p><p>The frustration on her face was beautiful. She started walking once more without saying anything, leaving me with the pleasure of pointlessly ordering someone that could probably dismantle the palace as long as I was not committed to defending it. </p><p>I didn’t call it playing with fire, but only because it would be unfair to Cinder. </p><p>While she walked toward me, I cast a spell to drag a thick ruler from Aria’s desk, which made our spy’s lips curl in disdain. Considering the ruler was flapping in the air helplessly, not an absurd reaction. </p><p>She would feel safer with such an incompetent display of magic. A completely inaccurate sense, of course, which was the reason I displayed it, but it worked well with my earlier ‘mistake’. </p><p>As she stood in front of me, trying to hide her disdain toward an incompetent human noble, I patted my lap. “Come here, sweetie,” I ordered. </p><p>She was hesitant, but didn’t dally much before she finally lay on my lap, facing toward Aria. “Good maid,” I called as I landed the ruler on her ass. </p><p>One that she took to her naked skin, leaving a lingering sensation of sting behind. One that was just a touch excessive for a blow, and might or might not include some very subtle tantric manipulation. </p><p>Her mouth opened in shock, but she didn’t cry. “Good girl,” I said as I used the ruler on her ass again, the skirt and the underwear working hard to blunt the impact. </p><p>“Two,” she admitted. </p><p>“Start from one, honey. Don’t tell me you can’t count,” I said with excessive dismissiveness. </p><p>The way she trembled in anger on my lap was beautiful, though the pure venom in her tone suggested I was pushing my luck too much. “One.” </p><p>“Good maid,” I said, with no need to fake the amusement I was feeling, aware that she misunderstood the source significantly. </p><p>She counted the blows to her bottom with increasing frustration, missing the fact that it was just a little distraction. My other hand was on her back, lingering lazily like I was trying to keep her in place. I didn’t press hard, just lingering. </p><p>Testing if my little elf was aware enough to notice as I carefully explored her sensitive spots, tantric allowing me to observe her mood accurately. None of those lingering touches left any impact that was worthy of memorizing, but it allowed me to create a pleasure map of her beautiful body… </p><p>A map that I started to put to use as we reached the double-digit numbers, accidentally letting my finger on the more sensitive areas, her neck, her left shoulder, and other innocent areas, building the basis for the future. </p><p>I didn’t usually work that hard to break spies, but I was willing to make an exception for the sexy elf on my lap. </p><p>Even better was her reaction. She started shuffling on my lap, too amateurish to actually hide her frustration with her own reaction — along with a shocking dose of shame that confirmed her lack of experience when it came to matters of the flesh. </p><p>She wasn’t as innocent as Aria — well, not as much as she had been in the beginning, as the way she watched us hungrily, not even bothering to fix her dress certainly didn’t shout innocence — but then, very rare was as innocent. </p><p>Still, she was handling herself nicely, until I shifted and my erection pressed against her stomach. Her eyes widened in shock, barely holding back a shocked gasp, and for the first time, I had to use my other hand to keep her in place. </p><p>“Calm down, sweetie, it’s not you, it’s the beautiful princess over there,” I whispered into her ear. Just another comment to further flame her anger, which would hopefully make her ignore the absurdity of the situation as I pushed forward. </p><p>Of course, assuming I pushed for more… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Juana said nothing as I stood behind her, but she checked me through a mirror to see if I was using my vantage point to get a better view of her cleavage. I didn’t … at least not until she finally got convinced of my ‘good intentions’ and turned her attention away.</p><p>“You can go through the tactics while I solve your back problems,” I said as I leaned forward and pulled the papers in front of her, which gave me an excellent view of her cleavage from my superior vantage point. </p><p>“A good idea —“ she started before she swallowed her words. The reason, my fingers, dancing on her shoulders to attack the first knot I had found, which melted under a soft flood of Recovery-Intent. Just a minuscule amount, but excellent as a massage aid. </p><p>She cut her words, because her option was between that, and letting out a moan, and she was prideful enough to avoid the second option. </p><p>I said nothing as I worked on her back, the show enough to turn a boring bureaucratic meeting into something spectacularly entertaining. It was fun, but it was also something that was necessary. Juana was tense. Her point about the challenge her impressive bosom was generating was not wrong — despite the fun way she chose to display that — and the rest of the week, with all its ups and down, was stressful enough to leave its mark as well. </p><p>She was strong enough to handle the stress that would have cracked a weaker person, but that didn’t mean it didn’t impact her. She was truly tense, and her back was knotted badly… </p><p>Only to unravel under my touch, the dexterity of my fingers and the magical healing abilities, when combined, impacted her incredibly. </p><p>She continued reading the papers as I worked on her back, but it didn’t take long for her attention to start wavering. The time she spent on each paper lengthened, and she started asking some questions with apparent answers. </p><p>Soon, her face darkened further as the blush invaded her face. She bit her lips to prevent such a notification. </p><p>Time to enhance the fun a bit more, I decided as I dragged my finger along her spine. Her eyes widened as a shiver hit her, and hit her hard, forcing a gasp. “Ah, you’re not bad at massaging,” she commented, using that to conceal her moan. </p><p>It wasn’t successful, but I let her think so. “It’s a useful skill to have to make sure I can recover after long training, especially the leg muscles. That’s why I have such good stamina,” I said. It was mostly wrong, but she didn’t say anything. </p><p>Though, even if the explanation was wrong, it was hard to argue against the results. </p><p>The moment fell to a lull as I let my fingers down, bypassing her bra to reach her lower back. “Lean forward a bit,” I told her even as I started working on her lower back, but my fingers didn’t dip to anywhere that could be termed too dangerous. </p><p>Too bad for her that, even without dipping down to the small of her back, I had the ability to enflame her arousal further. Her back might as well be an open map for me to find her sensitive spots, each unraveled knot leaving its place to a point of pleasure. </p><p>I forced down the temptation to tease her, knowing that it would break the illusion I had carefully constructed over the last hour. Instead, I returned to her shoulders, the healing energy penetrating through her skin deeper and deeper to relax her. </p><p>“Is this enough, or should I continue?” I asked, but timing it perfectly, just as the pleasure started to rise. High enough that continuing was tempting, low enough that she wasn’t alarmed at the prospect. </p><p>“Sure,” she answered quickly — far too quickly, even, but she was distracted enough to miss that fact. </p><p>“Raise your left arm,” I asked even as I started moving down her shoulder, and she followed. I moved down, focusing on her forearm first, before I reached and raised her arm, putting her palm over her chest to keep it upright. </p><p>It was certainly not about allowing her to feel my perfect muscles — supernatural, even, and it was certainly not hyperbole. </p><p>The combination worked spectacularly. With only a t-shirt on the way, she started caressing my chest. Mindlessly at first while I worked on her arm, but then, suddenly, a blush hit her as she realized what her fingers were doing. </p><p>That stopped, but she didn’t pull her hands away. I enjoyed her shocked gaze even as I focused on her arm, delivering a five-minute-long massage that took a lot from her to ignore. </p><p>A magical massage was certainly cheating, but that didn’t reduce the impact of watching the unflappable Coach Juana slowly melt under my attention. A true miracle, worthy of the wielder of the Divine System. </p><p>“Any plans for celebration after we win on Sunday,” I commented as she started to relax. </p><p>“Probably more work to celebrate,” she answered, not mentioning the high likelihood of losing. I wished that goading her to make a bet on the result was something I could do, but under the circumstances, that was definitely out. </p><p>It would ruin the whole act like I hadn’t noticed her attractiveness. </p><p>“Too much work?” I asked. </p><p>“Definitely, with both the dean and the director gone, there’s a lot of things to be organized, especially with the mess their departures had created.” </p><p>“Not to mention the departure of Coach Bill,” I said, not mentioning Spencer, though the way she chuckled showed that she noticed it as well. </p><p>“Yes, his presence could have been helpful, but I’m sure you can do — even more,” she said, another moan escaping as I manipulated her palm, the pleasure enough to interrupt her words. </p><p>I imagined her laying on a bed, covered in oil and nothing else as she moaned under my fingers … but it was not something that could happen tonight. She was still guarded, not seduced — which was an impressive achievement considering my amazing game. </p><p>Or maybe not, I realized ten minutes later, when I was just finishing her other hand. Her left hand hooked around the front of her bra and pulled it softly. If she was wearing something more substantial, it would have been an innocent gesture, a little move to deal with the feeling of warmth. </p><p>Yet, she was wearing a sports bra and nothing else, turning it into an amazing show. She was pushing herself to the limit. </p><p>“Pity we don’t have a horizontal surface here,” I commented even as I moved in front of her, still acting like I hadn’t been affected by it. Yet, when she decided to test my determination by pulling the front of her bra forward once more, I reached for my Intent. </p><p>And used it to replicate the earlier telekinetic push once more, right at the hook of the bra. I was trying to unhook it, but measuring the pressure was challenging, and it went a bit more than I had been planning. Which meant, combined with her pressure, her bra snapped off, and suddenly, she found herself holding it in her hand. </p><p>Which left her spectacular breasts, delicious in their caramel glory, fully naked. </p><p>She froze, and so did I — though mine was more of a theatric than honest reaction. I looked at them, my mouth open, enjoying their perfection. I had to admit, the gravity-defying nature of her breasts, especially with their size, was enough for me to suspect that there were some supernatural shenanigans going on. </p><p>I was acting up the effect of her — admittedly amazing — breasts because of the way her lips curled. My earlier combination of Taunt and Seduction must have worked even better than I had expected, especially combined with the pleasure of the massage, as she was very slow as she raised her arms. </p><p>Enjoying the power of her breasts over me, quite a bit more than it was healthy.</p><p>Something that I could push even more. “I-I … I’m guessing that you’ll stop the massage,” I stammered, even more horribly shy than a boy seeing breasts for the first time, avoiding her gaze. Yet, even as I did that, she felt more and more vindicated, finally attaining victory after all my ‘silly’ lack of realization. </p><p>After all, in her mind, she deserved the victory. Who was I to ignore her beauty! </p><p>“Well, if you can’t handle it,” she admitted as her arms stopped, and instead parted open, like she was trying to hug. “But my shoulders still require some massage. Why don’t you finish it first…” </p><p>“A-as you wish, Coach,” I stammered, like she was talking about the most unimaginable torture, avoiding looking at her as I stood behind her once more. </p><p>Curious just how much it would take her to realize the absurdity of her suggestion. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“ … this is still too complicated, barely acceptable,” she muttered as I revealed another plan after discarding the first joke plan. “Do you really think they can run it?” </p><p>“Possibly, if the defense lines up exactly as I want,” I answered. “That’s why it’s here in the first place. I’ll only use it if the defense lines up as I wish.” </p><p>“Do you think they’ll run such a complicated blitz? They have to be panicking to pull such a dangerous play,” she commented. </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I answered with a smirk — one that might have been a touch teasing as I tapped into Seduction subtly. “After the chess tournament, their football team is getting a lot of flack about using such a dirty trick, especially against a team that was already struggling.” </p><p>“I can’t imagine why people had such an impression. It’s not like someone claimed that in the middle of a live feed,” she commented. </p><p>I let my smirk widen for a moment. “I can’t think of a reason. But either way, they’ll be on the field, ready to prove that they are too good to pull such tricks against a depleted team, especially since that team didn’t have an amazing record in the first place.” </p><p>“So, they’ll play aggressively,” she realized. </p><p>“Exactly, I’m hoping for a lot of blitzes.” </p><p>“Do you think your offensive line could block all of it?” she asked. </p><p>“Certainly not,” I answered immediately, and her eyebrow rose. “Well, Arthur is going to be the starter. He’s willing to prove himself, and strong enough to handle a hit or two … Or ten,” I added. </p><p>“Do you think that’s … advisable,” she muttered, hesitant after I had declared my intention. I didn’t hide that, as she would be in the game either way, and it was better to hash it out now rather than arguing about it on the side. </p><p>“Maybe not, but that’s the only chance we have to keep a close game. But if you want †he first game where you’re the official head coach to be a spectacular failure,” I offered, and I watched her flounder, her selfish desires competing with her desire to protect her players. “How about a compromise,” I offered. </p><p>“What kind of compromise?” she said, sounding suspicious. A smart attitude considering who she was speaking with. </p><p>“Nothing nefarious,” I said. “I promise that I’ll pull Arthur out of the game, or adjust the play, if he can’t handle the pain of the repeated hits. How about that?” </p><p>“That sounds … reasonable,” she admitted. </p><p>It was reasonable … unless one factored in Arthur’s true identity as a spy. I knew very well he was doing his best to ingrain himself into the team to the point that he couldn’t be removed so that he could dig into my secrets, so the pain wouldn’t be enough to pull him out of the game. </p><p>Especially since he had already seen my ‘ancient’ artifact that I was using to heal everyone, meaning he wouldn’t fear injuries as well. </p><p>Being tackled for the whole game by a group of defensive players with an active grudge against our team would be excruciatingly painful for him, but I had no intention of trying to make the life of a spy any easier. </p><p>I wouldn’t have used the same strategy for the other players. After all, they trusted me enough to work as hard as they could manage, and even if that was coming from a selfish direction, I appreciated it nonetheless. </p><p>A spy was a different issue. </p><p>“Now, since we’re in agreement about letting our brave Quarterback carry us to victory,” I said, happy with the result. The only thing that would have made me happier would have been to have Kevin in the position of quarterback, but life was not ideal. </p><p>Coach Juana didn’t look happy at my comment, but she wasn’t idealistic enough to ruin her first big break to protect a player that she didn’t even meet. </p><p>Life was rough. </p><p>“Now, to the next play,” I said, smiling even as I used my traits to color that smile once more. “We have a lot of plays to go through…” </p><p>We did, but the rest was a boring task. It wasn’t supposed to, as ordinary, the head coach would have many different feedbacks to the plan by integrating a wealth of experience. But she didn’t have that experience, and those plans were reflecting my supernaturally-enhanced capabilities. </p><p>Combined, there wasn’t much to do by rubber-stamp them. </p><p>Therefore, it wasn’t surprising that I started to feel … naughty. Who could blame me, for the view I was constantly being subjected to? However, I knew about Juana enough that she would never reach any outward teasing. </p><p>So, I decided to use the opposite. I used Seduction repeatedly to push her mind toward a naughty direction, but I used the full extent of my abilities to make it look like every single one of those brushing fingers and teasing smirks completely accidental, while she didn’t catch me enjoying her cleavage — even when she used the mirror to keep observing me to make sure. </p><p>Pride was an interesting emotion. Juana worked hard to avoid teasing, doing her best to be taken seriously, and the way she was dressed was certainly not her first preference. However, now that I wasn’t giving her even the slightest sign that I found her attractive, she was feeling slighted. </p><p>And, her rapid promotion was another interesting aspect. A part of her problem had been her lowly position back when she was just a conditioning coach, easily kicked out. Now, she was both the head coach and the sports director, and even though both positions were temporary, she still had incredible authority, enough that she felt that she had the upper hand against anyone in the school.</p><p>Let alone a mere student that was helping her. I doubted she was aware of her own change, as most of it was slowly being unearthed by my endless teasing. </p><p>All combined, she started to get slighted by my lack of attention greatly, and soon, it started having some interesting impacts. First, she grabbed a piece of paper and used that as a fan, acting like the room was getting hot, which was not the case. </p><p>Heated, certainly, but not hot. </p><p>Then, she removed her blazer, which left her wearing only her sports bra. Without the jacket to block the view, the sight of her cleavage looked even more amazing, tempting me to drag my tongue over her caramel peaks. </p><p>Pity, it was too early for that. </p><p>“I think we can strengthen the left side in this formation,” she commented as she touched the far side of one of the papers, and pulled her chair closer as an excuse. </p><p>“A good idea, but I was thinking about baiting them with this,” I explained. “If they send two receivers, the safety will break toward there before the quarterback even passes. There’s no harm if he changes his play at the last second, we’ll give up about ten yards. But if he ignores that, we’ll have an easy Interception,” I explained. </p><p>That explanation was useless, because the plot was clearly explained on the paper, and even without that, Juana was good enough to understand the intent behind it. Yet, she acted ignorant, just to pull her chair closer. </p><p>Only a moron would think that the way she rubbed against my arm was accidental. Holding back a chuckle took a lot, and not dipping my head down to enjoy the amazing view took even more. Yet, the gold at the end of the rainbow was enough to keep me focused on my self-appointed mission to drive her mad through frustration. </p><p>Especially since, she miscalculated. By pulling herself so close against me, she was able to touch me casually — as evidenced by her hand that was resting on my leg at the moment while she acted like she was completely focused on the play —  but that also meant I could counter. </p><p>Not as openly, but there, all my supernatural advantages came to the surface. A rubbing of shoulders, right at a sensitive spot … An accidental finger touch just as she was breathing, timing my reach to the paper so she rubbed her chest against my side in a way she couldn’t blame me…</p><p>Soon, her frustration reached a beautiful point, enough that her nipples started to get visible despite the strong fabric of her sports bra. </p><p>It was working, so I decided to finally attack directly when she stretched hard, one that made her display her cleavage spectacularly by stretching her bra to the limit. “Are you feeling alright, coach?” I asked. “We can always call it a night if you’re tired, and we can finish tomorrow,” I said, and this time, I didn’t just use Seduction, but also Taunt.  </p><p>“No need, just my back, nothing new,” she said, frustrated even if that didn’t work, but her next move surprised me. She grabbed her breasts and pushed them together. “It’s their fault, constantly carrying them is rather exhausting,” she said. Even as a casual point, that was an exaggerated move, and what she did was certainly not casual. </p><p>She pushed her bra to the limit as she pushed, her breasts popping out enough to give me a glimpse of her areola. </p><p>“Backache is a problem,” I said. “I can give you a backrub to help if you need,” I offered, but I stood even as I offered. </p><p>She nodded first before she froze, realizing what she had just agreed. Teasing was one thing, but a massage was different. I could see rationalization in her beautiful eyes. </p><p>But that didn’t last long, and soon, she nodded. </p><p>After all, it was just a massage. An innocent massage... </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had to climb two floors before I could finally come across smaller rooms I could use to hide. Most of the floor was dedicated to a forge, with several zombies constantly forging swords while an impressive number of necromancers pumped necrotic mana into the forge to ensure the weapons would end up tainted. </p><p>It was painful to watch. I was hardly a professional forger, and I had my own shortcuts, but still, watching their horrible waste was annoying. </p><p>I didn’t let that annoyance stop me from slipping into one of the storage rooms, piled with weapons that were radiating cold energy. If it wasn’t for my layers of protection and Proto-HP, just standing in this room would have killed me. </p><p>As an advantage, the mana they radiated was enough to conceal my own spells as I looked into the Aether dimension. </p><p>Once again looking at the confusing dance of Aether and mana, I searched for my beacons. The beacons were weaker than I would have liked, but combined with the physical proximity — which assisted, but not as much as I would have liked — I managed to find the magical presence of the tree after a minute in the confusing mess of Aether and mana. </p><p>“What a pity,” I found myself murmuring. Unlike the physical part of the tree, which was broken and destroyed, the presence in the Aether dimension was still whole, just corrupted. There was no hint of nature mana or Spark in its presence, instead, the whole structure was doused with Necrotic Spark, pumping Necrotic mana to the Aether dimension… </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder where, and I started trailing the mana tendrils. It wasn’t an easy task without fully phasing into the Aether like I was teleporting, but luckily, the constantly shifting nature of the Aether dimension helped. I didn’t need to move to trace that. As I waited, the destination drifted closer at one point, and I finally came across the other end of the connection. </p><p>The border of the plane. Or, more accurately, the chaotic, rotating shell of mana that was rotating endlessly, surrounding the plane, made from more mana than I could imagine. </p><p>No wonder it was a mixture of necrotic and nature mana battling, and why it was the undead trying to make sure the outer shell stayed intact by responding to the breaches. </p><p>It was clearly a lengthy affair. </p><p>I guessed the fortress tree I was in wasn’t the only focal point for the ongoing corruption — likely not even the strongest one — but ultimately, it was just a guess. I needed to explore much more to ensure it worked flawlessly. </p><p>With that, I left the armory, and started climbing upstairs, glad that the preferred fashion among necromancers was thick robes and cloaks. </p><p>I continued climbing up the stairs, each floor dedicated to a different kind of operation. However, I had seen the signs of a change on the tenth floor, with four death knights standing guard at the entrance. Combined with the lack of traffic, my constant disguises wouldn’t have worked. </p><p>Luckily, that was not the only trick in my bag — my admittedly large bag. I went back two floors down, and found another empty corner before casting several more spells, changing the dark robe into a patterned brown to match the color of the dead tree. </p><p>Then, in the absence of convenient windows, I carefully cut an exit at the outer layer, and started climbing the outer layer, the dead branches and an illusion to camouflage helped me to sneak in.</p><p>Though, even cutting had been a challenge, as the dead tree was containing a great amount of Necrotic Spark. My own manipulation abilities managed to keep it from turning into a disaster — though suppressing the temptation to drain the tree was big.  </p><p>I could have tried to cut an entrance, but instead, I climbed toward the upper side, where there was an opening large enough for a dragon to land — and that was not hyperbole, considering I actually watched an undead dragon lift off. </p><p>It was dangerous, but not as dangerous as trying to cut open an entrance to end up facing a wandering lich or an overenthusiastic death knight. </p><p>Their private entrance was the less risky option. Still, I made sure to adjust my face slightly to look like an elf in case I got caught. That way, even if they enhanced their defenses to prevent another breach, they would focus outward. </p><p>Luckily, they relied on magic rather than active observation for defenses, which was easily dealt with. Once again, I was inside… </p><p>The upper floors lacked the chaos of the lower floors, which made it a pain to move around. Only Death Knights and Liches were there, forcing me to cast several spells to hide in the shadows. Their numbers weren’t high enough to trust the anonymity of their disguise.</p><p> I didn’t know where to go and was exploring randomly, so when I felt a flare of Arcana Mana. A good destination, I supposed as I followed it, only to see a death knight leaving a room empty-handed. </p><p>Clearly not an ordinary room, I decided, though matching the clues was not exactly challenging. For once, the room didn’t just use the dead tree as walls, but was actually made of metal. And, considering the number of runes that surrounded its walls, they weren’t just relying on the strength of the metal. </p><p>Another clue about the importance, the room was guarded by an impressive group. Two liches, and eight death knights, none of them particularly weak as shown by their presence. </p><p>Which meant sneaking the room was impossible, at least with my current stats. Concealing my presence while unraveling the Arcana defenses and pushing back the suffocating necrotic energy would have been challenging if I had access to full Stats and skills granted by the System, let alone now.</p><p>Even cracking it without destroying whatever was inside was a challenge in my current state. </p><p>Luckily, that didn’t prevent a more blunt approach. </p><p>But, I didn’t launch that strategy immediately but waited for someone else to arrive and use the vault — which clearly was — to see what kind of material that was hidden in its depths. I waited at the edge, slowly creating a few arrays that I pumped with mana -- nature mana I converted from the surrounding Necrotic energy. </p><p>I stayed as mobile as I could be for the next half an hour, away from the vault, filling several wards with nature mana to the brim, waiting for another undead to use the vault. It happened another half an hour later — a tense, stressful half an hour. The death knight was carrying a crystal. </p><p>The same kind they had used against me, to drain Divine Spark from the trees. </p><p>A good find, as from their lack of ability to convert the Spark, I expected them to just dispose of them into Primordial Aether. But maybe I was wrong, and they had the ability to convert it, just not as portable as I do. Or maybe they had some alternate usage. </p><p>Either way, they had something that was worthy of me to plunder, the same thing that I was in desperate need of. Fascinating. </p><p>Fascinating enough that I was willing to change the objective of the mission significantly, especially since the amount of Necrotic Spark that was locked in the tree made it a good target. I couldn’t steal all of it, not without defeating all the undead that was currently here — let alone the potential reinforcements — but the same didn’t count for the little amount that might get lost during the battle. </p><p>After all, even a percentage of the thousands of points I could feel locked in the dead trunk meant a stat point or two — and I was not at the point of turning my nose. </p><p>Still, I didn’t launch my attack immediately. If I was going to turn that into a more convincing assault, I needed a reliable excuse. </p><p>At that point, I remembered the seed I had buried, which was a good excuse for me to push. Creating a connection of mana was not expensive, but it would have been impossible to do. </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t the only possible source of mana. Instead of connecting to me directly, I connected the seed to the God Forest, creating a stable connection that could be used to channel mana.  </p><p>{-30 Nature Spark, God Forest}</p><p>Not a cheap connection, especially since the Spark that was assigned would get lost if the seed would get destroyed. Yet, that was not without its advantages. I used my permanent connection to the God Forest to modify the tree, so, when it started growing wildly, it didn’t grow as a tree. </p><p>But as a treant. </p><p>I assigned not only more than a quarter of the mana the forest was generating — the most I could afford without pushing the elves to panic — but also allowed it to access a few mana storages I had been keeping for a serious siege. </p><p>The amount that I channeled was significant. Almost two million points of mana… Enough to destroy everything. </p><p>But, not for nothing. I didn’t need my indirect connection to feel the approach of the treant, destroying the hordes on its path… </p><p>The way the ground trembled with each step was evidence enough…. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 399}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 16240}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2009}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was good to be moving around once more. </p><p>Even if I was going through a long stretch of ruined land, necrotic mana getting more and more intense without the forest I had built up to prevent that. It was not the whole world filled with that mana — at least not yet — but that didn’t mean it wasn’t an unpleasant feeling. </p><p>Especially since I couldn’t just plant one of the seeds that were with me and transform the whole area, not unless I wanted to be swarmed by a horde of disposable zombies. I wasn’t afraid of them, not with all the tricks I had developed since my arrival, but that hardly meant that I wanted to face them on unfavorable ground and ruin my preparations. </p><p>The river gave me a route to follow, and I moved upstream, though I made sure to stay half a mile away. Close enough to see anything that was going on easily, but far enough to avoid the occasional patrol that was following the river. </p><p>The patrols were getting more and more common as I moved upstream. A few zombies walked around aimlessly at first, but soon turned into disciplined squads that were made of skeletons wearing armor that was forged for their bony bodies, accompanied by a necromancer. </p><p>It was much harder to avoid necromancers, but that didn’t mean I was unhappy seeing them. The number of patrols and their strength meant that they had something to defend. </p><p>“It’s better to be worth my time,” I murmured as I hid under the shadow of another dead tree as waited for a large contingent to pass me, ignoring the smell of death. “I wonder if I could set up a secondary breach,” I murmured as I slipped a seed, but the mana that followed didn’t go to its growth, instead covering it to create a field that would protect it from necrotic mana. </p><p>Along with a beacon that would allow me to teleport there if I wished. </p><p>[-583 Mana]</p><p>{-1 Nature Spark}</p><p>It was difficult to put that much Divine Spark in seed without destroying it, but luckily, I had enough time to fiddle while I waited for a particularly large patrol to pass me. </p><p>I even had enough time to reach Aether Dimension to grab some Aether, efficiently breaking it down to more usable mana. </p><p>[+9210 Mana]</p><p>Though, as I delved aggressively, I could feel the density of Aether was dropping. Not significantly, but enough to be noticeable. </p><p>I had a feeling that my forest had a role in that change. </p><p>Soon, the patrol moved away, and I continued my depressing trek, toward the border of the plane once more, though stopping more and more due to patrols. </p><p>Until I came across a fortress. One that was even more depressing than the desolate landscape, as the fortress was carved from the remains of a huge, broken tree, the kind that would be measured in miles rather than yards. </p><p>I didn’t know how tall it had been when it was alive, with its branches reaching toward the sky, but considering even its broken state it was taller than two miles, I had a feeling that the term touching the sky wouldn’t have been too much of an exaggeration. </p><p>Pity that was not only completely dead, but was also carved into an imposing fortress, spitting out undead every second. </p><p>The imposing nature and the density of the undead already revealed that it was my destination, and I didn’t need to see the river that I was following was coming from the roots of the tree, probably born from an underground spring. </p><p>Now, all I needed was to decide how to sneak into the place. I was tempted to use my usual underground trick, but unfortunately, I was quick to realize it wouldn’t work. The closer to the tree, the more the ground was infused with necrotic energy. </p><p>“Annoying,” I murmured as I realized that it was probably not an intentional strategy, but a side effect of corrupting that huge tree. It was the roots spreading the necrotic energy in a wasteful manner. </p><p>I could have tried to cut through the necrotic mana, but the density of mana would effectively blind me. </p><p>The river was facing a similar problem. Diving sounded like a viable strategy, but considering they were using the river to constantly pump for mana, it was also risky. I didn’t know how active they were in managing the process, but the risk was unacceptable. </p><p>Luckily, there was an easier solution. A few choice illusions, some tailoring, and a hunch later, I was just another zombie, walking forward. It was a simple disguise, yet effective, for one simple reason. </p><p>I could manipulate necrotic mana to stick around me. </p><p>It was hardly a pleasant feeling, even though I was careful to maintain the distance and my Proto-HP was there to block any harmful side effects. Unfortunately, it was a vital part of my disguise. </p><p>With that, I waited until I noticed three groups of zombies merging together under the guidance of several necromancers, and slipped into the group, acting like a part of the flow. It was not as simple as it sounded, but luckily, all the times I had disguised with the assistance of Subterfuge taught me a lot, and I managed to slip in. </p><p>I could feel the energies of the necromancers spreading around and controlling the zombies, and a tendril also reached me, convinced by my fake connection. </p><p>And, I just acted like I obeyed their command as they patrolled around their fortress, occasionally slipping between patrols to drive closer. Luckily, the necromancers were occasionally stealing zombies from the control of each other, which made my switch rather innocuous. </p><p>Once I mixed into a new group, I waited for an opportunity to change my concealment method, sometimes looking like a skeleton, sometimes as a zombie. The closer I got to the fortress, the stronger I made my necrotic-mana shell. </p><p>However, the closer I got, the more I started to notice interesting stuff. </p><p>For one, the dead tree was not just filled with necrotic mana, but also Necrotic Spark. I couldn’t be sure how much unless I probed directly, but even at a distance, I could feel thousands of units would have been an understatement. </p><p>Fascinating, though that brought the question, of why the river contained so little mana — at least relative to the potential it represented. Some were clearly being used to create a bigger undead army, but unless I was significantly miscalculating, that didn’t explain it either. </p><p>I had a feeling that the answer was in the Aether dimension, but even as I took a quick peek — which was a risk — it ended with a failure. Not unexpected, as I was still far away from the tree, and I doubted it would work, not with the way the distance worked in the Aether dimension. Without a beacon to help me find my path, it was near impossible to find the tree. </p><p>Temporarily shelving that objective, I turned my attention to my more immediate problem. Sneaking into the fortress successfully. </p><p>It took five hours for me finally to arrive at the huge gate of the fortress tree, and another hour to find a group actually entering the fortress to slip in. Hardly an efficient use of time, but much less risky than trying to penetrate the layer of magic around us. </p><p>Six hours later, I was finally inside the fortress. </p><p>The inside of the tree had been carved into a huge entrance, every inch filled with undead, with stairs that were going both upstairs and downstairs. </p><p>The upstairs seemed even more crowded, so I chose downstairs as my first direction. Another half an hour, and I managed to slip down, and even find a nice corner to change my disguise once more, walking around as a low-level necromancer. </p><p>I even conjured a large pile of paper, walking around in a hurry, hoping to give the impression I was a man with a task. </p><p>After taking another set of stairs that brought me even deeper, I finally came across the source of the river. A huge spring, bubbling fresh, and some kind of mana I didn’t recognize — similar to nature mana, but not the same. </p><p>Pity that was the only glimpse I could get before it was drowned by the constant necrotic mana that was being pumped into the water by a necromancer, using a corrupted root filled with runes to achieve the objective. </p><p>It accounted for some of the mana the corrupted tree was generating, but not all of it. </p><p>Luckily, that floor had several nooks I could use to draw teleportation beacons. Even better, the constant conflict of mana as they fed the river made sure that the energy in the room was chaotic enough that the beacons could stay concealed for more than a temporary glimpse, which would allow me to teleport into the fortress directly into the future. </p><p>Risky, but safer than trying to dig a tunnel, and more preferable than half a day of constant disguises, alternating between skeletons and zombies while suffering the suffocating aura. </p><p>With the beacons done, I climbed the stairs once more, looking for a safe corner I could use to peek into the Aether dimension. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 399}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 16831}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2049}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was the blush that covered the face of the spy that allowed me to make that decision, so, as I noticed her trying to scuttle toward the door, I spoke. “Where’s this maid going without you dismissing her, my princess,” I asked loudly, and she stopped. </p><p>“He’s right,” Aria said, immediately following my clue even if she didn’t understand why I made such a request. She looked shy, but not enough to actually keep me down. “Stop.” </p><p>“I … My princess, I thought … I should leave you alone,” she muttered, panicking. </p><p>Her panic was welcome, as I could hear the hint of an accent in her tone. An unfamiliar one, which was more of a clue than I expected. I whispered something in Aria’s ear. “Just do what you’re asked, don’t improvise,” Aria said, trying to sound sharp, but sounding cute. “Or I might fire you,” she threatened, which didn’t even make her blink, which was something I expected. “… along with whoever actually hired you,” Aria added. </p><p>That worked much better, and I caught the widening of her gaze. Whoever hired her was her accomplice. Fantastic. </p><p>Aria would have noticed the irregularity of her reaction as well, if her attention wasn’t lost the way I was grabbing her breasts, far too interested in the immediate aspects of her pleasure to question why I asked a maid to stay. </p><p>“As you wish, princess,” the spy said, her voice tense, but not respectful, giving me another interesting direction about her personality. </p><p>“Good, finish cleaning, carefully, then bring a new tray,” Aria ordered, once again parroting my whispers while she moved closer, her plump ass rubbing against my erection, enjoying the way she shivered. “We need refreshments … to study properly.” </p><p>“Yes,” I said as I pushed her down against the desk, and pushed her dress down. “Study, just like my dear princess wants,” I said, doing my best to sound subservient. If the way the gaze of the spy jumped up with a sense of mercy was any indicator, she actually believed that. </p><p>That was, more than anything else, the evidence that I wasn’t dealing with a professional spy. So, even as she continued climbing, I started poking at her disguise magically. It was a subtle poke, and less about breaking it, and more about understanding the way she was maintaining it. Particularly, I wondered if it was an artifact, or if it was her personal ability. </p><p>Both options had advantages and disadvantages. An artifact lacked flexibility, but the ability to gear a spy like that implied the ability to field a lot of such artifacts. In comparison, the ability to cast such a spell would make a spy more immediately dangerous, but it would also mean that they might be desperate enough to risk a high-level spellcaster. </p><p>Risking an artifact, even an expensive one, had much more different implications than risking a top-tier caster. </p><p>Of course, there was also the possibility that they weren’t afraid of the security of the caster, but that was an even bigger and more dangerous problem. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I watched her blush, yet unable to keep her gaze away from us as I pushed Aria onto her private desk, her tits jiggling beautifully. It was an alluring sight, especially as I prepared to reveal my shaft. </p><p>Meanwhile, the maid-spy retreated, and Aria turned to face me. For a moment, I thought she would question me about what I was doing. </p><p>Instead, she took a second to get rid of her remaining items of clothing, relying on natural beauty before she fell on her knees, and applied the same treatment to my pants. As she did, there was a smile on her face, different than others I had seen. Still shy, but this time, it was underlined with an erotic confidence that was missing earlier. </p><p>She was getting more and more familiar with the true meaning of fun. </p><p>And wasn’t that a was a scary thought? </p><p>With her previous inexperience disappearing further with each meeting, she was turning out to be a dangerous opponent. “You wouldn’t mind helping me do the paperwork, right?” she murmured even as she dragged her finger over my naked erection, her tone gaspy enough to make me tremble. </p><p>“Whatever you wish, my princess,” I whispered back, enjoying the way her eyes shine as I called her mine. </p><p>I sat on her desk, and started working on the details of her paperwork, the details easy to decipher. </p><p>For all the differences in the ideology and other visible areas, the paperwork was nearly identical. </p><p>Amusing. </p><p>Of course, amusement I felt wouldn’t be enough to actually make me work on paperwork if the request came from someone else. But Aria was different — though, the fact she used her free time to cover my lap with her beautiful hair as a certain familiar warmth wrapped my length. </p><p>I leaned forward and actually started to complete paperwork, while her lips and her fingers made sure to keep turning that into a pleasurable activity. I murmured as the enjoyment hit me, enough to turn even the boring act of doing paperwork into something pleasurable. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>I hummed as the wetness around my girth spread further and further, turning the pleasure into a new stage. </p><p>As I heard the footsteps of the maid-spy, I decided to surprise her. Just as she was about to take the turn, I used my empty hand to push Aria down enough that she wasn’t visible when the maid entered. </p><p>“The princess is … gone?” she said, hesitant suddenly. </p><p>“Bring the tea, sweetie,” I said, enjoying her approach, even as I gathered my magic, ready to be released. Not to attack her, but to pull a prank. A dangerous prank … but a prank. “I’m feeling rather parched.” </p><p>“The princess?” she asked, hesitant, but as she failed to see Aria — the sound of her gags and gasps hidden behind a simple spell — I could see a dangerous expression appearing on her face. </p><p>“Are you planning to ask her something?” I said. “Or are you disappointed that you can’t see her naked?” </p><p>As I asked that, I was enjoying the sensation of Aria’s pretty mouth and throat as I pushed her down to the limit. Her hands were on my legs, but she didn’t try to push herself away, just enjoying the treatment as well. </p><p>“Of course not,” she said, her tone much less subservient as she walked toward me angrily, ready to deal with me without the presence of the princess. I could already feel some kind of magic brewing in her. One that I didn’t recognize — but still determine it was painful, but not deadly. </p><p>My little spy was clearly unhappy with the indignity she suffered. </p><p>Too bad for her I had already planned to counter her. “Too bad, she’s here,” I said as I chuckled, and removed the pressure from Aria’s head while I dispelled the silencing spell at the same time. Her head rose, her blonde mane dancing wildly. </p><p>A surprise reveal for our shy spy, though she reacted two ways. First, she lost control of her hands, and the tray she was carrying slipped out of her hands once more, traveling toward the ground with incredible speed. </p><p>Second, she lost control of the mana she was gathering. For an incompetent mage, it might have created a dangerous problem that might have caused an injury, yet for her, it was just a flare, one that was soft enough that even Aria didn’t notice. </p><p>But, it was enough for me to pull my trick. “Careful,” I said panickedly as I waved my hand, sending an incompetent — or, at least, seemingly incompetent — spell toward her, which kept the tray floating. </p><p>But also ripped up her dress, revealing her breasts in the process. </p><p>She gasped in shock as she covered her breasts — spectacular breasts, almost enough to rival Aria — which was amusing and cute. And, while seeing them was amazing, and complimented Aria’s amazing blowjob, even that was not my aim. It was also just a distraction. </p><p>No, out of control spell and its sexy effect was only a cover to dispel her disguise spell. Not completely — as I didn’t want to push her to a confrontation — but just disrupting for a second, one that gave me the truth of her looks. </p><p>What it revealed was arguably the prettiest face I had ever seen, maybe even to surpass the beauty that was between my legs, combined with striking silver hair and silver eyes, their shape-changing slightly, turning more exotic. The combination would have been my biggest focus if it wasn’t for another detail. </p><p>Her ears. </p><p>Her long, pointy ears. </p><p>Fascinating, I thought even as the spell settled back, confirming my guess about her identity. Now, I needed to decide what to do…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, what’s the plan, Coach? Celebration after an amazing day?” Marcus asked me as we were walking out of the stadium, and it was already evening once more. Our meeting was followed by another training on the field where we had run through the selected tactics. </p><p>A session that had gone swimmingly thanks to another little benefit. </p><p>[Teaching II]</p><p>Just like my other traits, it wasn’t exactly a cure-all, but it helped me to control the classroom setting much more efficiently than I expected. I always had trouble breaking down stuff into more digestible pieces, but Teaching helped me not only with that, but also helped me to catch any player that misunderstood what I had explained much quicker than I would have otherwise. </p><p>Though, that wasn’t the only reason Marcus was in the mood for some after-game celebration. No, that honor went to the trick with the Recovery-Intent, the low-level healing field spreading from it enough to keep all players near peak condition. </p><p>Combined with the new Trait, it worked to a shocking degree, and a day’s training worked more efficiently than a camp that might have taken a week ordinarily. </p><p>That hardly meant that our problems were over, of course. We still needed about a year to turn us into a functioning team — and even then, we would have been lacking in pure talent — so my tricks were still vital. </p><p>“Unfortunately no,” I answered the question. “No celebration, as I still have a lot of things to attend to before tomorrow’s final walkthrough,” I said. “A lot of arrangements to finalize.” </p><p>“Damn, I certainly don’t envy you,” he said before walking to his car, and I walked to mine, disagreeing with his conclusion but not bothering to argue. More work was annoying, but not when that work was being conducted with Coach Juana — now, Director Juana after her latest unofficial promotion. </p><p>The visit was about going through the logistics of the game day. She asked for a detailed brief, which was understandable, as still, she was the official coach for the game, which meant she still had an important stake in the game. It would be rude for me to reject her when she asked for a walkthrough. </p><p>Of course, I was honest with myself enough to admit that, her looks — her beautiful face and her even more amazing, curvy body, were both on constant display despite her best efforts to undersell them constantly, which earned her some unwelcome attention from Coach Spencer — played a big role in my lack of frustration at the late-night visit being less annoying that it otherwise could have been. </p><p>At this hour, the roads were empty enough, so it didn’t take long for me to arrive at my destination, even if I stopped on the way to pick up some coffee. A familiar building, the same one I had visited just days ago about the fight at the team house, only to be suspended by the dean. </p><p>The same dean that was currently kicked out. Poetic… </p><p>I walked in, waving to the security, who didn’t even attempt to stop me — as I was a rather familiar figure at this time — as I climbed the stairs, and soon, I was standing at the office of the sports director. </p><p>“Come in,” Juana called as I knocked on the door. </p><p>As I entered the room, I couldn’t help but stagger a bit. I had always known Coach Juana was a beautiful woman, but there was a difference between knowing and seeing. </p><p>She was currently wearing a pantsuit, which was rather plain, its cheap cut obvious, but that did nothing to impact Juana’s beauty as I got a glimpse of her from the side, with her hips pushing the pants to the limit. </p><p>The fact that the jacket was not on her, but discarded to the back of a chair, leaving the task of hiding her chest in her white blouse made the show even better. It was equally loose, but there was no hiding her incredible bosom. </p><p>A beautiful sight, but luckily, I managed to walk forward without skipping a step. “I brought coffee,” I said as I walked steadily, carrying a bunch of paper on the other. “I have an iced latte and a warm Americano for you, whichever you prefer,” I said as I put them on the table. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to accidentally topple forward and use the iced coffee to ruin her top. The view would have been amusing. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t just afford the credibility loss that would come along. “Oh, you have one extra?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, I decided having something to your taste would help the late-night crunch more pleasant, so it was basically a selfish move,” I answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“Oh, yes, positively devilish,” she said as she grabbed the iced latte, and some extra sugar I picked just in case. </p><p>I watched as she worked on it, feeling rather miffed that ruining her shirt was not on the cards — at least for the evening — when I realized that I made a mistake. I was still connected to the System while I was wishing, which, combined with Intent, worked just as a telekinetic push, and pushed it forward… </p><p>Spilling right to her top. </p><p>“God damn it,” she gasped as she jumped to her feet, which was too late, as her white shirt had taken a color that was more similar to her beautiful caramel skin, spreading further along. It also turned her top slightly transparent, but unfortunately, it only revealed that she had a huge bra underneath. “Sorry about that,” she gasped as she tried to rub it with a napkin, but it was useless. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said. “Do you want to go change?” </p><p>“I would,” she said as she stood up. “Sorry about that, I’m not normally clumsy but…” </p><p>“Today was nothing but normal, right?” I said with a chuckle as I watched her grab her bag and leave for the connected private bathroom. </p><p>Her promotion might have resulted in a lot of work, but it also had its perks. </p><p>I turned my attention to the papers as she disappeared into the bathroom, still drawing some new schemes and adding a few other things that required her perusal. Nothing prevented me from using them without warning her, but it might be a problem once other coaches joined the team. </p><p>I draw several more trick plays, ones that I didn’t dare to put on the paper because there wasn’t too much time — and adding some plays on the last day was certainly a bad idea. However, I wanted to test just effective a new trait, Teaching, would be for teaching. </p><p>I had to admit, I was rather hopeful about that. </p><p>When Juana walked back, a hesitant expression on her face, however, took all I had to maintain my gaze on the papers. The reason, was she had changed her conservative white shirt that had been drenched with coffee with the only other thing in her bag. </p><p>A black sports bra. And, considering her self-conscious blush and the little area that the sports bra covered her chest, I would bet my car that she was using that only when she was exercising in her own room. She still wore her blazer, and even tugged the sides self-consciously to limit the show. </p><p>Unfortunately — for her — the blazer was simply too fitting to succeed. </p><p>A gentleman would have offered to go and pick a spare t-shirt from his car, which I certainly was not. </p><p>But I was not a moron either, so I just glanced her way before turning back to my papers, and started drawing an even more complicated scheme. “I wonder what you think about this scheme, coach?” I asked. </p><p>“L-let me see,” she said as she walked forward, the slight stutter in her tone uncharacteristic of her attitude, but seeing I was acting like it was not a big deal, she got more comfortable as she got closer.  </p><p>Only to gasp in shock when she arrived. The reason … the play I had just drawn. “Are you crazy?” she gasped as she examined the scheme. “Even professionals can’t handle this play, it’s too complicated.” </p><p>“Really?” I said, doing my best to hide my chuckle — and hide my gaze — as she leaned forward, engaged and frustrated, her earlier hesitation lost in the fury she was feeling.</p><p>“Of course, look at this protection scheme, the only chance it ever has working depends on both tight ends making a correct read, and deciding which one to block, and two of the receivers also need to make last-minute adjustments. And, to make things worse, the quarterback needs to read all of them at the same time, and make a decision. Even for a professional quarterback, it’s impossible. What if they blitz forward?“</p><p>“I see,” I said, amused at just how much her anger and passion were enough to make her forget about the way she dressed, even to the point that she leaned forward to draw something to the particularly distant side of the paper, and giving me a shockingly amazing view of her cleavage, her breasts perfect enough to justify her obsession to always wear loose shirts. </p><p>Even though hiding them was a crime against humanity itself…. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“It was a nice session, right?” I said as I entered the locker room, following the team, after three hours of extremely exhausting training without a break. </p><p>It was a sign of my confidence and my control over the new team that I didn’t expect any retaliation — as much as it was a sign of their exhaustion. </p><p>“Shut up, Coach, or we’ll kill you,” Marcus said, the only one that was feeling confident enough to actually talk back, and even then, without any actual heat. </p><p>I was more interested in their attitude. There was nothing like painful, grueling training to erase their unearned confidence coming from the resignation of the dean. </p><p>“You better be quick, then, we have a strategy meeting in fifteen minutes,” I said, the collective groan echoing in my ear. “Alright, twenty minutes,” I said as I opened my bag, and pulled out my fake Staff of Hermes, and triggered the Recovery aura, moving to the next stage of our training.</p><p>The biggest advantage, it allowed me to radiate it to a decent range rather than requiring touch.  </p><p>As I triggered the aura, I kept my focus on Arthur, wondering whether he would notice the presence of the energy. His sensitivity to the effect, especially when it was something less intrusive than the overwhelming trick of the German Professor, had some implications for my future strategies. </p><p>He didn’t react to it, and neither did the other players, at least not consciously. Yet, they started to walk around faster, more briskly, the exhaustion losing its impact faster than usual. </p><p>It took a couple minutes for Arthur to notice my new object, and I needed to raise it up only once. His eyes widened as he noticed that, but managed not to say anything before he raised his phone and took a photo of it. </p><p>I deliberately gave him a good angle, as it was part of the objective. I needed him to have a good view of the show. It was the whole point of going all that trouble to fake an artifact, after all. </p><p>He only moved toward me after he took several photos — to his credit, doing so in a way I would have failed to notice without my Traits. “Hey, Coach,” he said. “What’s that?” </p><p>“A gift, from my teacher,” I answered, doing my best to look absentminded. Then, I froze, like I realized that I had made a big mistake, but wanted to hide that fact. </p><p>Creating a fictional person for them to search for was a useful strategy. </p><p>“Really, it looks old. Is it valuable?” he said as he reached toward it, and I jerked my hand away. </p><p>“Sorry, but it’s my lucky charm,” I said, doing my best to sell a panicked impression. </p><p>“Really,” he said as he looked at it seriously. “You believe that stuff.” </p><p>I just shrugged before wrapping it with a thick fabric and starting to move. “See you all in the meeting room, we need to go through the tactics…” </p><p>***</p><p>I had a son t smile on my face as I watched the players arrive at the large meeting room, this time none of them late. None of them even cut close, showing that the morning treatment had been enough to resolve their issues. </p><p> As they gathered, my hands were dancing on the keyboard, assigning the necessary videos to each screen, ready to leverage the expensive infrastructure arranged by our unfortunate old Dean. </p><p>I looked at the players, each hulking and muscular, yet their forward-leaning posture was enough to put even the most enthusiastic nerd to shame. “After our warm-up…” I started the meeting, the statement earning a line of a chuckle, “I have managed to get a preliminary understanding of our capabilities, and let me tell you. I’m impressed.” </p><p>I was glad for Leadership, as it helped the statement to work as a source of a moral rather than a condescending delivery. </p><p>“Now, let’s talk about the best way to leverage the strategy,” I said. “We’re going to rely heavily on zone coverage for defense, and run plays through the center for offense,” I explained. “We’ll be playing with a simplified playbook, ideally less than twenty plays that everyone needed to memorize, but I’ll have some special schemes assigned for each player. Now, about the first play…” </p><p>As I explained, I couldn’t help but shake in amusement. It hadn’t even been a month since I had first here in this room as a new backup, hoping to impress Coach Bill so that I could have the opportunity to take the field for just a few plays, hoping to farm some intent. </p><p>I certainly didn’t expect to be sitting in the position of Coach Bill, handling the session. And, as an added benefit, there was no Spencer here to create annoyance and try to make the offensive players happy in a vain attempt to relive his glory days.  </p><p>After pulling a whiteboard to the center, I started going over each scheme one by one, drawing each group one by one before focusing on explaining them more in detail, and sixty players that filled the room listened in rapt attention. </p><p>Once again, I enjoyed the irony of the focus they were able to exert as I went through the details of the schemes, enough to put them into the top position of their classes if they were able to display such an effort. </p><p>Unfortunately, the process was not as efficient as it could be. With the management of the school in shambles, the coaching staff was completely gone, and I was trying to do the job of about twenty people. With my Traits, I was confident in my game plan — the problem was, communicating the details. </p><p>For most players, it took nearly a season for them to efficiently learn the playbook, and even that required endless practice combined with the careful coaching of their position coaches. And, I needed to teach all in one grand session, which was hardly comparable. </p><p>Even with the extremely simplified playbook I had put together, it was a difficult task. I didn’t have great hopes for this session. The most I could hope was to give them a general breakdown so that they could self-study further, while identifying the hopeless cases to focus on.</p><p>Would that be enough, certainly not, but at this point, that was all I was able to do in preparation? I didn’t expect any of that stuff to actually bring me victory, not even close. I just hoped to avoid a horrible blowout.</p><p>I would somehow find a way to handle the rest during the game day. </p><p>Of course, I could always go and visit Doctor Williams, hoping to see if I could come to a deal that I could use to remove my concussion report — as I had much more confidence to win the game if I was on the field. </p><p>Unfortunately, neither the meeting I overheard, nor my own limited yet memorable adventure implied that Doctor Williams was easy to reason with, especially from a position of weakness. </p><p>No, I much preferred to take the risk based on my own abilities, and continued to explain our simplified playbook. “And here’s another zone scheme we’re going to use when we see them line up with their receivers spread out,” I said as I moved on to the next play. </p><p>“Isn’t it the same play that we have seen earlier, Coach?” one of the new players asked, which came from the basketball team. </p><p>“No, it’s not,” I said as I quickly draw another. “Look, here, I expect the interior linebacker to stand a step to the left. Now, do you understand the benefit of it?” I asked. </p><p>He shook his head. I might have taken a note to explain it later, but I could see that he wasn’t the only one that was looking blankly at the schemes I had developed. “Look, let’s draw two simulations to see how such a strategy impacts the run plays,” I started, trying to explain the difference between the two without confusing them even more. </p><p>“What about man coverage, wouldn’t that be more effective?” another asked. </p><p>“Technically, yes, but that requires more coordination,” I said. “Let’s assume that the play broke down, and one of the receivers moved to the left, who would be responsible to chase him?” </p><p>“Naturally, the cornerback one,” he answered. </p><p>“Good,” I said. “But what if the tight end had cut to the left at the same time while his assigned man was blocked by one of the linemen. What then? Who would be the assigned to the receiver then?” I asked, and rather than answering, he pulled back. </p><p>“Sorry,” he murmured. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it was a good question. The biggest problem with the man coverage schemes is the challenge that comes from how to handle the more complicated schemes of attack, and unfortunately, we don’t have the time to teach every single of them right now. Maybe after a few more games,” I said. </p><p>The team nodded, much more relaxed now that they realized asking questions didn’t result in a painful follow-up — unlike how it worked while training on the field — and allowed themselves to relax. </p><p>And, while they were enjoying the show, I was enjoying a benefit of my own as well. </p><p>[Teaching I, Acquired]</p><p>An unexpected benefit, but certainly not an unwelcome one. Maybe, I wouldn’t have needed to cheat too badly to avoid a spectacular defeat.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Ida shuffled in her new seat, naked and trembling, yet doing her best to defy our comment about being exhausted; but she didn’t even have the energy to raise her camera, the greatest evidence of exhaustion she could have. </p><p>A good way to make a decision. “Let’s see if she can recover enough to immortalize such a beautiful moment while I deal with your punishment,” I said as I pulled her Carrie onto my lap. </p><p>Carrie froze for a moment before whispering. “Aren’t you going to untie me?” </p><p>“Why,” I answered. She couldn’t see my face due to the way she was sitting, but I was sure she had no trouble guessing the kind of smile I had on my lips. “Isn’t keeping you tied down a good start? Just in case you’re feeling … naughty!” </p><p>“No, I’m not naughty, I’m a good girl,” she gasped in protest. Admittedly, it wasn’t as effective as she might have liked to believe, not with her track record — both immediate, and more general. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I whispered. “I wonder how many good girls I would have found naked in my room, watching their friends … graduate…” </p><p>“That’s not my fault, Ida tied me up, and now you’re keeping me prisoner,” Carrie gasped loudly, blaming her exhausted friend. Though, that blaming didn’t prevent her hips from moving back and forth, which was not prisoner behavior. </p><p>At least not the nice kind. </p><p>“So, you’re saying that all I need to let you go and it’ll all be over,” I whispered into her ear, calling her naughty bluff as my touch on her stomach got lighter, making her think that I might actually follow up with that. </p><p>“No!” she gasped, far too quickly as she stiffened on my lap. </p><p>“Oh, a lie…” I whispered. “I thought that you wanted to be free.” </p><p>Carrie froze for a moment, her eyes closed as she turned her spectacular intellect toward digging herself from the little verbal corner she dug herself into. Ordinarily, it would have taken a second for her to do so, but to her defense, she was somewhat distracted. </p><p>“I want to be freed by my own power,” she whispered after a pause. “It’s not fair to do any other way.” The way her hips started dancing despite my hold left no doubt about what kind of payment she had in mind. </p><p>I turned to Ida. “What do you think?” I asked even as I let my hands caress Carrie’s naked belly, enjoying the smoothness. She tried to push forward a bit so that she could slide my shaft inside rather than just rocking on top of it, only to decide against it when my arms tightened around her body. </p><p>Even with all the changes in her attitude, she was still obedient when it counted. </p><p>Amazing. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Ida murmured as she forced herself to sit, showing the extent of her exhaustion. I let her recover. Pity I didn’t have anything to entertain myself while waiting … right. </p><p>I chuckled even as I let my hands rise, cupping Carrie’s amazing tits, enjoying the way she squirmed under my touch like a cute restless rabbit. I let my fingers sink down, once again enjoying the perkiness of her breasts. </p><p>“Come on, Ida,” Carrie whispered. “I’ll model you once, whatever you wish!” </p><p>“Three times,” Ida countered, her exhaustion blinking away immediately at the prospect. Carrie looked thoughtful. “And today doesn’t count!” Ida added,  immediately using the opportunity to push for more. </p><p>“That’s too much,” Carrier gasped, followed by a moan as I twisted her nipple. </p><p>“Oh, then maybe we should let you go. We don’t want to push a delicate beauty like you too much,” Ida answered. I couldn’t help but smirk at her sudden viciousness. It was always a treat to see such a shy beauty suddenly turn cutthroat just because of her passion for her hobby. </p><p>“I … I accept,” Carrie answered, quick to abandon her attempts to bargain at the prospect of a loss. She was not a good haggler, especially not when distracted. Though, if I was reading the way her tongue was darting out correctly, the earlier show had pushed her too much already, and leaving without a proper tumble was abhorrent to her. </p><p>I chuckled at her attitude. Ultimately, I had no intention of sending her away after all the work she put in to make today such spectacular entertainment, first with Sarah, then with Ida. </p><p>“Good,” I murmured as I continued groping her, enjoying the way she trembled under my touch. I let one of my hands climb up until I grabbed her hair, using that to pull her lips to a convenient location for my merciless kiss. </p><p>My tongue invaded her mouth, and her hips responded by increasing the speed of their dance. It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to tease her more … and it wasn’t mercy for her that made me act. </p><p>No, after the long tease with Sarah, I was still burning with desire, and the little show with Ida hadn’t been enough to completely resolve it. </p><p>My other hand shifted to her hips, and I pushed them forward. A little shift in my waist, and when her hips pulled back, her familiar warmth enveloped me yet again. </p><p>Her moan was beautiful even when suppressed by my lips, and she continued to tease me. As I continued tasting her lips, a distinctive click reached my ears. I glanced, only to see Ida already taking photos of the show. </p><p>I glanced at Ida, watching the dance of emotions, from satisfaction to jealousy, dancing beautifully, split between the opportunity to record the show, and taking another turn. I might have been surprised by her naughtiness, but after my experience with the rest of their friend group, the surprise was much more muted. </p><p>I turned my attention back to Carrie, enjoying the way she was dancing on my lap despite the impediment of her bound state. </p><p>The kiss didn’t last for long. Soon, I let my lips drift lower, stealing a lingering kiss of her neck while her moans exploded, her face fully visible once more — a little favor for Ida, who was doing her best to immortalize the moment. </p><p>She failed to say anything, the pleasure enough to steal her words. I let her hair go, and brought that hand to her breasts once more, enjoying the sensation of her perky breasts once more, aggressively, enough to leave several red marks behind. </p><p>Marks that was very interesting, if Ida’s sudden determination to stand up despite her trembling legs were any indicator. She managed to drag her naked body in front of us, before she fell on her knees just a couple feet away, her camera conveniently positioned to take the show fully. </p><p>Carrie said nothing, just moaning again and again, losing herself in the perfect mixture of pleasure of my touch, and the thrill of being observed. Her dance, despite the impediments she was dealing with, was beautiful. </p><p>With her hips moving in their won, I shifted my hand on her hips, caressing her inner thigh. She pressed them tighter. “Part them open, sweetie,” I whispered. “Let’s give your friend the show she deserves after all the trouble she had gone through.”</p><p>“But … that’s too much —“ she whispered, which was all she was able to say before a slap landed on her hip, interrupting her complaint. </p><p>“That’s not fair, sweetie, you promised her,” I whispered. </p><p>“Yes… you promised,” Ida agreed, but that didn’t prevent a blush from spreading to her face as Carrie parted her legs open, which allowed her to get an unobstructed view of my shaft disappearing again and again, elevating the erotic moment into something even more. </p><p>However, her shock didn’t take long, as she raised her camera and started taking photos with a renewed passion. I didn’t expect those photos to come out particularly good, for one simple reason. </p><p>She was holding the camera in one hand… </p><p>The other disappeared between her legs as she stimulated herself recklessly, the passion of the moment enough to overwhelm her professionalism. </p><p>There was only one problem. “Why don’t you open your legs as well, sweetie. It’s not really fair, isn’t it,” I said, challenging her in the exact same manner I had toned against Carrie earlier. </p><p>“I don’t…” Ida muttered, feeling shy despite the camera in hand, which was a rarity. </p><p>“Maybe I should close my legs, then,” Carrie whispered. I knew that was a bluff, as the way she tightened as she parted them open to escalate the nature of the show she was giving showed that she enjoyed being watched — almost as much as she enjoyed watching her friends getting dominated after assisting their seduction. </p><p>However, Ida wasn’t in a position to catch such detail while her mind was blanked with pleasure, and she obeyed Carrie’s request, further enhancing the beautiful show I was receiving… </p><p>Life was good. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“It was a good warm-up,” I whispered. “Now, are you ready for the real punishment?” </p><p>The way her almond eyes widened was simply divine. Her lips parted open. “Real punishment—“ she tried to ask, which died as my tongue invaded her mouth, and my arms closed on her back, which kept her in place as I twisted and turned. </p><p>And she found herself looking at the roots of the tree above us, pointing from the roots. A nice, comfortable position for her to enjoy the show … while giving me absolute control over the process. </p><p>I wanted that to get a better feeling of the connection. A connection that was, even at its weakest, complicated enough to overwhelm me if I allowed that to flow completely. </p><p>I was not in a hurry to let that connect fully. Instead, I pushed, a cute moan escaping Seldanna’s mouth despite my tongue, the position allowing me to invade her fully at my own pace. With my tongue in her mouth, she lacked the ability to say anything… </p><p>Not that she was trying to say anything in the first place, not when she was more than happy to let me take control. As she abandoned herself to my touch, I enjoyed the feeling — pity I couldn’t fully enjoy it, not when I could feel our connection growing slightly, but enough to matter. </p><p>Pity I lacked the necessary stats to understand the fluctuating, confusing nature of the connection.  </p><p>I was familiar with splitting my attention, so even without the full force of my old stats to support me, balancing the carnal and magical aspects of our little dance was not a challenge — especially since my innocent priestess seemed to be happy with the repeated invasions, not looking for any frill. </p><p>Ecstatic even, I corrected myself after pulling back from the kiss, and her cries exploded enough to strain my ears — a beautiful strain, naturally, especially with the rhythmic dance of her breasts, as if they were musical instruments to accompany her cries. </p><p>I had to admit, elves — at least, the spectacular example of her race in front of me — had a natural sense of grace, so even as I invaded her repeatedly, the rhythm of her cries and the sway of her breasts stayed synchronized. </p><p>A beautiful private show, I had to admit. Or at least, that was what I had thought … then, her mana started to get wild. </p><p>My little hideout was already drenched with a lot of nature mana, which was an inevitable consequence of the position at the center of a magical forest that was doing its best to convert an incredible amount of mana from Aether…</p><p>Which meant, there was a lot of mana for Seldanna to use. When the vines burst out of the ground, for a moment, I thought that we would repeat our earlier dance — which was not something I was entirely against it — but then, every single vine burst out flowers, with colors that I had struggled to imagine, covering every inch of the room. </p><p>A little cosmetic change, I thought at first, about to ignore, but as she used that, I felt our connection tremble, strengthening slightly once more. Interesting, I thought. I tried to make sense of it, which was rather difficult while being distracted by pretty colors and even prettier cries. </p><p>“Someone is feeling naughty,” I said as I rolled off the bed, our bodies still connected. It would have been painful, but the floor was already covered with flower petals thanks to her out-of-control spell.</p><p>“S-shut up,” she muttered. “It was an accident. I was … excited.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said with a chuckle, and reflexively sent a little sliver of magic into her. I was glad about it, because I noticed a little change, where her little sea of Divine Spark was resting. It was a subtle change, one that I might have failed to notice if I wasn’t watching in real-time, but I could see the borders of the energy, getting subtler. </p><p>For a moment, I was afraid that the border had been weakening, which certainly wouldn’t have ended nicely. I was ready to stop and help her recover — even if I had to take back most of her Spark, but the collapse I expected didn’t happen. </p><p>I was afraid, because the Divine Sea was similar to the Soul Space of the System. </p><p>For Soul Space, the borders were everything. The stronger they were, the higher the limit, and there was less chance of a collapse — which was deadly, as the experimentation on my enemies had shown.</p><p>Yet, Divine Sea acted differently. As the borders had weakened, I could sense her control over it was strengthening. Not an incredible jump, but then, the changes in the borders weren’t significant either. Just a change that could be measured by percentages… </p><p>The impact was clear, making me glad that I didn’t try to elevate her to the next level by using the same trick of the God Tree on her. I already had the idea such a thing might be bad — as the situation of my dear headmistress and her attempt showed — but still, having evidence was nice. </p><p>As I examined the way she interacted with Divine Spark, I could see that there was a fundamental difference between the Guardian Trees and somewhat with the soul. Compared, it wouldn’t be unfair to classify the Guardian Trees, or the current God Forest, as artifacts.</p><p>Artifacts were capable of autonomous activities, even decisions, but there was a gap between that and sapient beings. </p><p>I took a note not to let Seldanna absorb more Divine Spark before I get a sense of what was going on…</p><p>Then turned my full attention back to the fun side of my experiment, and continued impaling her in a thick bed of petals and flowers, her face contorted with pleasure, unaware of her slowly growing power. </p><p> “So, what do you think, is your punishment working as intended?” I asked. Her answer came in the form of a beautiful moan, loud enough to create a spectacular scandal if we weren’t conveniently underground. </p><p>“Mmm, not as good if you are failing to answer,” I said, chuckling at the panic on her face as she suddenly found herself empty. Luckily for her, I wasn’t in the mood to tease her. I paused just enough to grab her legs and bring them to my shoulders, giving myself an even better angle. “Let’s try something more interesting.” </p><p>Her moans got even more intense as the new angle allowed me to invade her even more aggressively, her moans filling the place spectacularly. </p><p>A beautiful and memorable event for a beautiful first time. Playing with my shy priestess was certainly fun even without the surprise magical advantages and disadvantages… I picked up speed even more even as I decided to turn the sensuality up a bit more. I leaned down and pressed my lips against her neck, her moans rumbling against my neck. Her back arched as her legs wrapped around my waist tightly, helping me to pull even more. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in satisfaction as she started to get more and more intense. </p><p>Her moans intensified as I moved down. First, I nibbled her collarbone, earning a sharp cry. Then, I arrived at her gloriously round breasts, assaulting her nipples with my teeth to add some edge. As the red marks on her breasts increased, so did her cries. </p><p>The magical side of things got even more interesting as she climbed toward her second climax, as I could sense some of my Divine Spark being pulled. </p><p>{-1 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>It wasn’t an intense pull, certainly not something I couldn’t prevent if I wished so, but I let it move, and feel it settle in between her and me. A soft line, flickering and almost invisible.</p><p>But most importantly, not in the material plane. No, the connection actually extended between us through the Astral plane. </p><p>Interesting, I thought even as I flipped her on all fours, her back arching erotically while her tits swayed with each hit, the slaps invading the room. My thrusts were aggressive as her moans filled the room once again. </p><p>“A good finish, right!” I whispered as the pleasure started to get too much for me, and exploded inside her. I pulled her hair back even as I did so, filling her insides with my energy…</p><p>And feel the connection get even stronger… </p><p>{-10 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes,” she started moaning as another climax hit her, the unfamiliar pleasure enough to push her to the land of unconsciousness.</p><p>“Beautiful,” I murmured as I carried her back to the bed, enjoying her graceful looks in the room filled with flowers. I wanted to stay and enjoy it, but after some thought, I decided against it. </p><p>The undead had just attacked us with a renewed attack, and I expected them to come toward us with an even bigger strength in a few days. Going to scout was risky … but the benefits were tempting as well. </p><p>Especially since I finally had a safe-spot for to teleport back…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 399}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7331}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well…” she whispered as she stood in front of me, trembling in excitement, but that didn’t prevent her from leaning forward, her hands on my knees, her lips just inches away. With her mana filling the vines that she used as chains, she looked like she was in control … almost. </p><p>Her plan was ruined by her chest, desperately rising back and forth as she failed to control her excitement. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean she wasn’t wearing an absolutely maddening smile. “I guess someone was mentioning punishment for failure. How about now?” she whispered throatily. </p><p>“I was the one that talked about attention, yet I lost. Why don’t you tell me what you have in mind as punishment?” </p><p>“Good question,” she whispered, her smile getting wider as I played along. Still, she didn’t say anything immediately, just let her finger caress my body, climbing up all along, giving me a chance to drink her beauty, wearing only her panties and nothing more. </p><p>Almost enough to feel like a reason to avoid such a disaster.  </p><p> She looked like her heart was about to explore in excitement, so when she pulled back coyly, I knew that it was less about teasing me, and more about her trying to control herself. Still, that didn’t mean she didn’t enjoy the attention as she turned halfway in and bent over, the angle hiding the most interesting aspect as she slowly pushed her panties down, leaving her naked. </p><p>“I … shouldn’t be naked,” she whispered as she raised her hand, and suddenly, another vine pulled out of the ground, this time thinner, much more elegant, and filled with colorful flowers. It wrapped around her slowly, and soon, she was dressed in a beautiful collage of reds and yellows. </p><p>Looking godly. </p><p>“Isn’t this a shocker,” I whispered. </p><p>“Well, it’s not appropriate for a priestess to be naked while she’s busy with punishment duty,” she whispered, getting steadily used to the process.</p><p>As she closed in the distance, each step was sending shivers down my body, showing that her elegance was not only for battle. It didn’t help when she started swaying to an imaginary song, her voluptuous figure forcing her new dress, making her look like an excellent dancer. </p><p>I wanted to adore her and punish her in equal amounts, so I let her continue playing. The flowers danced in her wind as she twisted and turned, enhancing her striking beauty even further. Her innocent beauty combined excellently with her enthusiastic seduction, I decided as I enjoyed the contours of her body, my mouth watering in anticipation. </p><p>It had been quite a while. Yet, I could see her desire just as fast — and she had even less experience controlling that. I could wait until she cracked. </p><p> “Punishment,” she whispered, but it felt like anything but that as she sat on my lap, the flimsy magical flowers the only thing between us. Her smile grow as her hips danced, riding me rapidly, my shaft teasing her core with each step. “How’s this as punishment.” </p><p>“Positively evil,” I whispered, which was true. Her magical variant of a dress was beautiful, but at this point, it was just an impediment, blocking our fun and nothing more. </p><p>She didn’t say anything, but her moans, along with the way her back arched, were enough to confirm that she was not too far from my direction. </p><p>I waited, enjoying her close dance as her shivers got more and more intense, curious about just how long she would maintain her punishment excuse. Pity my hands were empty, I was unable to caress her body like she had been doing. </p><p>Then, it clicked with me. I had a way to do so without cheating. She was doing her best to keep the vines around me under her control, and I couldn’t steal the control back without ruining the game … but the same didn’t apply to her dress.</p><p>I let a sliver of mana infect it, dancing along her body as she moaned seductively, and soon, her whole dress was under my control, and she was too distracted to notice. So, as she danced, I decided to make some subtle changes. </p><p>The dress started to get thinner in certain places, revealing more and more of her beautiful bosom, for example, or subtly getting thinner around her waist to reduce the dampening effect. The thinner the dress, the more apparent the heat of her parts against my shaft. </p><p>She closed her eyes and enjoyed the sensation, too distracted to notice the intentional nature of it. Her legs parted, intensifying the sensation even further … making it a very dangerous situation with my control over her dress. </p><p>I could have brought things to completion, but I didn’t … not yet. Instead, I focused on the top side of her dress, ordering the petals to rain down, each petal increasing the show further. Soon, her tits were once again naked, this time in an ocean of flowers, her nipples showing just much she wanted the next step. </p><p>Luckily for her, I was at the end of my patience as well. </p><p>[-21 Mana]</p><p>Taking complete control over her dress was trivial. Her eyes widened as I took control of the vine and ordered it to abandon her body, her eyes widened. A beautiful sight, just not as beautiful as her body, completely naked. “As I said, you need to be careful…” I whispered even as I used the vine around her wrist to raise her up, aligned against my presence. I gave her a second, one that she could use to argue against the situation if she wished so, but there was only anticipation. </p><p>Who was I to leave her desires unfulfilled. </p><p>I let her sink down, her warmth wrapping around my girth spectacularly as her lips parted, filling the room with beautiful cries. She closed her eyes to enjoy the feeling, and I used the opportunity to extract my hands from their bindings. </p><p>I had played with her enough. Now, it was the time for the real deal. My hands ran up to her hips, ending up on her plump ass, disappearing into her softness soon after, enjoying the texture even as I assisted her movement. Up and down, but deeper with each repeat as she sacrificed her first time for me. </p><p>As her body adapted, her head shook, messing her hair, making the moment even more exotic than it had any right being. The feeling was intense. I enjoyed the sight, alluring yet magical, even as I picked up speed more and more. Her cries rose as well, making me glad we were safely underground, with no risk of alerting anyone with her spectacular cries. </p><p>“A fascinating way to train, isn’t it?” I asked her even as I continued the show. Her eyes opened, showing her surprise that I was talking, followed by shyness as the realization of what she was doing hit her. “Why, is there something wrong,” I said as I stood up, raising her as well. Her legs wrapped around my waist desperately, but she didn’t say anything. </p><p>She was too busy moaning.  </p><p>“Excellent,” I commented as I walked toward the bed, happy with my encumbrance.</p><p>When we arrived at the bed, I lay on my back, but did so without allowing her to pull out, and she found herself on the top. A position of control, or at least, it would have been if it wasn’t for the state of her arms, still bound behind her. I loved it, not just because of the control it afforded to me, but also, by forcing her arms back, enhanced the sight of her breasts even more. </p><p>Which, when combined with the position, looked even more spectacular. </p><p>“Ride me,” I ordered, and her hips rocked, not wasting even a second. She rose up, but only to sink deeper with a more intense passion than I expected, melodic moans rising non-stop as she traveled toward her first orgasm. She might not be experienced, but her enthusiasm was certainly peak-level. </p><p>Crossing my hands to enjoy the perkiness of her tits was one option, but I chose to reach and grab them, earning a lost cry in the process. “They are … too sensitive,” she admitted. </p><p>“How about the nipples?” I asked with a chuckle as I twisted them. The resulting mindless cries answered my question, along with her hips, picking up even more speed. Along with her tightness…</p><p>Signaling that she finally climaxed, and since it had been a very long time, my own explosion wasn’t too far away. I exploded into her, filling her with my seed…</p><p>And then, something weird happened. A connection, like a bridge, building between us. It was similar to the companion process, yet also different. It felt less controlled, more intense… But also, somewhat more substantial. </p><p>Like walking through a beautiful garden rather than looking at the same garden from behind a window. </p><p>She seemed unaware of that, if the dazed yet calm look she had as she collapsed against my chest, her hips rocking lazily… Her tightness was a prison, one that I was happy to stay in while throbbing, even as I tried to understand what had been going on… </p><p>Whatever just happened was magically too complex to understand, at least in just one attempt. </p><p>Luckily, there was nothing preventing me from repeat experimentation… Not when no one would be alarmed by her disappearance while she took a well-deserved rest after her spectacular victory…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7331}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "title": "Darion's Office 10",
    "content": "<p>“Let’s see what a new day would bring,” Darion murmured as he once again took the long path to visit the office of his new boss … at least until he could find a reason to test if she was just as weak against his advances as her employees had been. </p><p>And wasn’t that an extremely fun adventure… </p><p>“Oh, a familiar face,” he chuckled as he saw Sakura, amused that she could even walk after yesterday’s adventure. Not everyone could take his full attention for half a day, and still walk. </p><p>He didn’t bother trying to listen to what they were talking about, not when he could just ask her afterward. </p><p>He entered without knocking, a little attempt to test Mia’s sense of control. “You didn’t knock!” she said sharply, her tone biting. </p><p>“Well, you called, so I assumed you’re available,” Darion answered with a wide smirk, not affected by her passive-aggressive response at all. He saw her eyes tightening, but that was the extent of her reaction in front of an employee. </p><p>An employee turned to face him instantly, her beautiful face covered with a shy expression. Darion was happy to note the way she stumbled as she turned to face him. He might have taken it as a personal insult if she just shrugged the impact. </p><p>“Hello, s — Darion,” she started, correcting the way she called him at the last moment. </p><p>Mia looked even more frustrated when Sakura didn’t even ask for her permission to turn and talk with him. She drummed her fingers, trying to get her attention, but even with the sound increasing to resemble a drum, Sakura kept looking at him. </p><p>Showing that yesterday’s little recruitment went even better than he had thought to be possible. </p><p>“A nice day, right?” Darion said, and received a stammering response, which broke into a short small talk session. Mia looked increasingly frustrated, but to her credit, she didn’t react as explosively as he expected, showing that her sense of power over her employees wasn’t accidental. </p><p>Too bad for her that he had tools she could never match to tame some disobedient ladies with size fetish… </p><p>She managed to keep her mouth shut until Sakura left and he stood in front of her desk, though her expression told that it had been a close call. “Well, if your lovely flirting came to an end…” she said bitingly, another subtle admonishment that Darion just shrugged away, “I have an important task for you.” </p><p>“Sure, your words my command,” Darion said, and somehow, he only managed to sound half-sarcastic as he did so. </p><p>Prison taught him a lot. </p><p>His sarcasm didn’t help her anger. “I need you to drive my sister to her friend,” she said. </p><p>“Really, she looks old enough to drive,” Darion said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Yes, considering she’s in her third year in college, she is,” Mia said bitingly, and Darion smirked. “She lost her license for drunken driving, and she needs to visit a friend.” </p><p>Darion would have blown that task away directly, if Mia hadn’t been asking him to drive a sexy redhead barely into her twenties, of course. There were jobs, and there were rewards. It was much better to sit down in a shitty office. </p><p>Janet and Sakura were there, of course, but Darion decided to give them some time to recover … they deserved it. And, they would be there when he returned from driving that little minx around. One redhead was good. </p><p>Two was better. </p><p>“I want you to act properly even if she tries to flirt with you, or you’re fired, understood,” Mia said. </p><p>“Oh, I promise. I’ll act properly —“ Darion started, only for him to be interrupted by the opening of the door, and Lily entered the room. Pity, as Darion would have loved to push Mia’s buttons a bit more. </p><p>“Hello handsome, I heard you hit the lottery of bringing me around,” she said as she walked closer.</p><p>“Oh, that’s what we call it?” Darion said with a chuckle as he turned toward her. He could hear the drumming of Mia’s fingers to warn him once more, but he didn’t let that deter him. Though, he was sad to see Lily had changed her outfit somewhat, staying away from whorish, and limiting herself to just revealing. </p><p>She looked good in the white shirt and miniskirt, but it was not as impressive as the transparent shorts he had seen her wearing. </p><p>“Remember what I said,” Mia said to him threateningly before turning her attention to Lily. “Remember the deal, I’m letting you go and hang out with your friend, but in return, you’re going to study when you return. Understood!” </p><p>“Yes, sis, I remember. I’m not a fish,” Lily answered petulantly. “We just talked about that a minute ago.” </p><p>“It wouldn’t be the first promise you have forgotten,” Mia answered. Darion said nothing, even as they shared a few more biting barbs. </p><p>“Yes, sister, it’s a deal. Now, let’s go,” she said as she poked Darion’s arm, and they started walking. </p><p>He didn’t say anything in the corridor, just walked to the garage, where a beautiful car was waiting for them. “Now, here’s the deal,” Lily suddenly said, her voice sharp. </p><p>“Yes, I’m listening,” Darion said seriously as he recognized the attempted intimidation, but it took all he had to actually contain his chuckles, mostly due to curiosity as to where she found the courage to threaten him. And a part of it was to watch the show. </p><p>It was both as cute and as threatening as a little kitten trying to roar. </p><p>“For the whole trip, you’re going to listen to everything I say, and once we arrive at my friend’s house, you’re going to stay in the car, ready to join us if I decide to call you,” she explained seriously. </p><p>“And if I don’t…” Darion said, his voice soft, almost meek as he tried to hold back his chuckles. Though, if her victorious expression was any indicator, she was under the impression that her attempts were working excellently. </p><p>“If you don’t…” she said, her smirk widening as she had just received a shiny new bracelet, “my sister will find several interesting photos about what you were doing with her bitch of a secretary.” </p><p>Darion found the whole situation fascinating. Her threats, her expression, even the fact that apparently, she disliked Janet as much as Sakura did… All of those reasons were more than enough for him to play along. </p><p>Of course, until she asked for something absurd, exaggerated, or plain boring, he would abandon that and start teaching her the true rules of the game she intent on playing… starting by making sure that one had something the victim truly cared about. It would be a pity if he suddenly got fired from his job due to probation. </p><p>Pity as in annoying, and not in scary, which one needed for proper blackmail. </p><p>“Good, you get it,” she said as she smirked before she started walking toward the passenger side. “Now, your first order, don’t look,” she said. </p><p>Darion found it easy to fulfill as a first order — especially since he could actually still see her from her reflection in the mirror as she got rid of her white shirt and replaced it with a black crop top, one that was too exaggerated to be actually called that, most of the fabric that was supposed to go to waist accidentally used for sleeves instead. </p><p>Darion loved it, though it was a pity the car blocked the view as she was changing. </p><p>That didn’t bother him. He was sure that it would be repeated at some point. </p><p>“You can turn now,” she said, but only after she stepped into the car, her smug smirk expecting him to look surprised. </p><p>“You … changed,” Darion answered, trying to sound shocked. He doubted his acting was very good, but her smile told him that it was sufficient. </p><p>“Yes, I did,” she said smugly. “Now, drive, we don’t want to be late…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You need to be more careful about your surroundings,\" I said as I enjoyed her bosom, repeating the words I had used when she first noticed my presence. Or, at least, that was what I tried to say. Suffocated in her very special hug, it mostly escaped as a soft murmur. </p><p>“Sorry, I can’t hear you,” she said, but I could hear the mischievous edge in her voice. She was feeling naughty. It was a rare change, and if someone else tried to push back like that, I would have done my best to squash that early — I spent last night doing exactly that for Valkyrie, even. </p><p>Aria was different, however. With her position and my … significant feelings toward her, it was good for her to learn a bit more outspoken. Though, I had to admit, the fact that I could hear the punishment already on the move, getting closer with soft yet steady steps, was enough to confirm that. </p><p>I stayed down in her bosom until I heard the sound of a crash. Only then, I raised my head, and looked at the two shocked beauties. Aria was to be expected, her expression similar to the time she had been almost caught by Emma, long before our relationship had evolved into its current form, her pretty mouth open, her body frozen. </p><p>The maid was not too different, frozen and unable to move, with a large tray upturned, shattering porcelain pieces and hot tea around. While she looked at her princess in shock, not expecting to catch a royal — especially one with Aria’s saintly reputation and famed shyness —  in such a compromising position. </p><p>I turned my attention to the maid, with her jet black hair, lovely face, and beautiful body — as anyone that was serving royals directly could be nothing but perfect. </p><p>Even as she looked, I cast a spell on her, a complicated, almost useless one that required the target to be completely novice, and could be only cast by someone with my mental competency or better. It did nothing to her mind, just gave me a trigger, one that would convince me that anything that happened for the last few hours was a dream. </p><p>Just because I wanted to tease Aria didn’t mean I intended to ruin her reputation. And I certainly didn’t trust the current palace to properly vet anyone. </p><p>Yet, for some reason, the spell just failed to find a purchase. It didn’t get rebuffed, which would have been the case if she was just magically-aware, or countered. It just failed to find a purchase. </p><p>It was not normal. Not even close… </p><p>Until I understood what was going on, I decided to act like I was dealing with an ordinary maid — even if she clearly wasn’t. I doubted the non-maid was faking her shock, and even if she was, it showed she wanted to play along. </p><p>It was a good way to see what was going on. </p><p>I cast another spell, one that was even weaker, but trickier, the kind that I would never dare to cast without the assistance of the Tether to allow me to design complicated structures, creating a few layers to test the mana in the room. </p><p>Many sources of magic jumped toward me — the royal quarters were rather expensively furnished — but my focus was on the maid. It confirmed that she had suspiciously little magic on her, but I managed to detect a layer of illusion — one that centered around her head. </p><p>It was enough to confirm that she was actually a woman, and not a man acting as a woman. It shouldn’t be a concern, and strategically it wasn’t, but personally, I had a different view. And, I was not in the habit of sacrificing personal for strategic. </p><p>What was the point of power if you had to compromise on the things you liked? </p><p>Aria was one of the things I liked, very much, even, and I would never tease her like that in front of another man — especially the way I was planning for the next half an hour. Another woman … that was a different issue.</p><p>While I was considering the immediate findings, Aria slowly recovered. She looked at me. “Yes, your majesty,” I said, pushing an obedient, sullen expression on my face, one that Aria had never seen before. She didn’t need to see my wink to understand I was teasing her, but that hadn’t kept me from giving her one. </p><p>I wanted to tease her, because I certainly couldn’t trust her to keep her calm if I revealed her maid was not a maid. </p><p>“I … see,” she whispered, trembling as she said so as she turned to the non-maid. “Sweetie, why don’t you clean the mess?” she said as she looked at her, this time louder, her voice smooth enough to convince a six-year-old. </p><p>Maybe, in a good day … if the child was already distracted by a colorful toy. </p><p>Luckily for her, the poor spy was not in a better situation. The scandalous nature of the situation, the fear of the circumstances and the possible punishment — it was not her fault, of course, but the reality of the situation is that guilt didn’t matter, not when one party was a noble and the other a commoner. </p><p>Of course, her identity as a possible spy complicated the issue, but for now, she was playing the role of the shy maid perfectly. She freaked out, but only the appropriate amount and started fixing stuff. “Would you be requiring another tray, my princess?” she asked. </p><p>I nodded as I caught Aria’s gaze. </p><p>“Y-yes, we’ll need it,” she whispered, but the blush that followed my clue showed that she didn’t think before saying that. Yet, she was too self-conscious to correct that, or even fix the current state of her clothing, which revealed her amazing bosom far more than it was appropriate. </p><p>She didn’t ask why I wanted the maid to linger — she had an answer in her mind. Not a correct one, as I wouldn’t bother teasing a maid too much, at least not under the circumstances, while she was being overwhelmed by the identity of the princess. </p><p>A spy, on the other hand … that was a different story.</p><p>The spy started cleaning while I tugged Aria’s hand, and dragged her to the desk, but rather than walking around, I sat on the desk itself, not caring that it displayed my erection very visibly. Then, I pulled her onto my lap. </p><p>Teasing her was fun, but I had no intention of a potentially deadly danger taking over my fun — not now, not ever. If I was such a person, the first thing after I earned my freedom would be escaping and sliding into obscurity — if I ever attained the position of Dark Lord in the first place.  </p><p>“Is this acceptable for you, my princess?” I stage-whispered. </p><p>She trembled, while the spy sent a glance toward us, biting her lip in confusion, and a bit of arousal. That made me think that her feelings, awkwardness, and clumsiness, were not just an act, and she was a spy not due to her incredible acting, but due to her magical talents. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first one — as I remembered Cinder using this exact trick to slide in. But, she was certainly not Cinder, of that I was sure. Even if she felt shy, she was the kind that would reflect it as pure anger outwardly. </p><p>Maybe I should try breaking her.  </p><p>There was no doubt about Aria’s sexiness. Her dress, with the front half open, was amazing enough before she started trembling in excitement. I touched the ties of her dress, opening the front even further, turning it into a positively scandalous thing — the kind that the Queen wore during her other job. </p><p>As I teased Aria, a delicious moan escaped her mouth, her body trembling. Her legs parted open involuntarily. It wasn’t a scandalous pose giving her dress, but it still revealed more of her beautiful legs. </p><p>While the spy continued to clean, Aria decided to take initiative, feeling naughty. She leaned down and captured my lips, her tongue attacking with an unusual intensity of passion, showing that our unlucky spy wasn’t the only one that was affected. </p><p>Her hips were another source of excitement, moving up and down to tease my erection. She did nothing to stop my fingers as they continued dealing with the dress … even when the dress pooled around her waist, revealing her amazing tits. </p><p>It was treason to reveal her like that to a spy, I decided as I helped her to cover. Pity, I had only my own two hands. I grabbed her tits and started squeezing, enjoying the mewling sounds that escaped her mouth despite the kiss… </p><p>I just needed to decide how to handle our spy…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing for a moment, just examining their expressions for a while as I tried to understand the reason for their shocked expression. I didn’t treat the news that I might be somewhat linked to the Egyptian Pharaohs as completely ordinary… but also, even if that was true, I wouldn’t put that on the list of top three about me. </p><p>My ability to somehow absorb Dragon Hearts, my unique relationship with the elements, my transformation. These features were much more shocking in my opinion. </p><p>And even when counting the importance of Ancestry, I would have assumed the name of Scipio was much more important. After all, Scipio Africanus was the man who had transformed Rome from a little kingdom in Italy to a proper sea-faring power that dominated the world. </p><p>In comparison, the link to an old, dusty kingdom shouldn’t count for much — even if it came with the connection with a nifty weapon that I lacked the ability to use properly. </p><p>“Is this really a big deal—“ I asked, or at least, started to ask before I was stopped by a gasp. </p><p>“How could you even ask that?” Xia said, interrupting me with an uncharacteristically loud tone, scandalized. I looked and saw Theodora wearing a similar expression. </p><p>I shrugged. “What, I was a bastard. History was not a comprehensive topic for me. Why don’t you explain if that’s very important? What’s the big deal with carrying their blood?” </p><p>“Not blood, at least not only that. You have the bestowment,” Theodora corrected me, like she was explaining to a five-year-old. </p><p>“Fair,” I said. That part was similar to my spear. “And what’s the deal with the bestowment, then?” I followed. They looked at each other, waiting for the other to go, but several seconds passed, and neither said anything. “I’m waiting,” I followed up.</p><p>Xia spoke first. “Well … I don’t know,” she muttered, shy. </p><p>“You don’t know? After making all that fuss?” </p><p>Xia blushed. “Hey, the Mandate of Heaven is one of the biggest secrets of the Middle Kingdom, and I was just a healer, unimportant enough to be discarded. Do you think I would be able to learn about the most important secret of the Emperor? Why don’t you ask the princess here? She’s the one that actually has actual royal blood … even if it comes from an upstart usurper….”  </p><p>Theodora looked at Xia angrily, clearly not appreciating the last comment, but her anger was quick to be buried in her shame. “You don’t know as well, do you?” I asked. </p><p>She paused for a moment, but I didn’t push her for an answer, not when it was clear. “No,” she whispered. “All I know is that it’s the biggest secret of my family, one that was only known by the Emperor and the direct heir?” </p><p>“Weren’t you the heir?” I asked. It might be a sensitive question, but considering the importance of the situation, I decided to push it regardless.</p><p>“Yes, but my father …” she said, pausing slightly. “He still hoped for a male heir, and didn’t want to pass the secrets to me. And even if he failed that, he was planning to pass the crown and secret by marrying me off and passing it to my son directly.” </p><p>“Silly move, you would have made an excellent Empress,” I said, enjoying her blush as she explained that. </p><p>“Thanks,” she muttered as she walked to me, and hugged me tenderly. I chuckled at her reaction — as well as Xia’s jealous gaze — but my mind was already on what to think. </p><p>I waited until she recovered. “Now, let’s walk, we still need to find a shelter before we start moving.” </p><p>“Where are we going?” Theodora asked, once again showing that her royal blood didn’t mean she was intent on taking the initiative.</p><p>“First, we need to find a shelter, preferably away from the shore just in case one of the ships drifts toward the shore after the battle. Then, we’ll talk about our destination.” With that, I started walking, and they followed. </p><p>African coast, especially a random spot we embarked, was reputed to be a dangerous place — but it was certainly not as dangerous as the mountain I had used as a home before my Rome visit. </p><p>Not to mention, even with my magical abilities impaired, I was confident enough not to fear anything weaker than a full legion. Sea had been rather stressful — as one could never really know what was hidden in the depths — but the land had no scares for me. </p><p>As we walked, I was thinking about our destination. </p><p>I was tempted to abandon everything and go back to my temporary home, to meet with Astrid and Lillian once more. It was tempting, and it would provide a safe haven for both Lillian and Astrid. </p><p>Too bad that it was not possible. Mount Pyrenaean was a beautiful location, surrounded by a protective chaotic magic field that made it very difficult to traverse, and made it extremely easy to ambush. </p><p>There was a reason Caesar dared to establish a secret city there, and somehow managed to maintain the secrecy around that even with everything going on. </p><p>Unfortunately, even at the height of his infamy, Caesar never angered an Archmagus — at least to the best of my very spotty knowledge, and even if he did, he probably had some on his side as well. </p><p>Yet, not only I had managed to anger one enough to probably make myself a mortal enemy, but I was also accompanied by the escapee princess of the Eastern Roman Empire, a target that the current Emperor treated as the utmost priority, enough to start another bout of war with the Republic. </p><p>No, Mount Pyrenaean was a beautiful hiding spot, but not when everyone chasing me. And reliability was not even the only issue. There was no guarantee that I could reach there in the first place, not by passing through the lands under the control of the Empire or Republic.  </p><p>“Tell me about the situation in Egypt?” I asked. </p><p>Theodora didn’t ask the reason before starting to explain. “For almost six hundred years, Egypt had been a part of Rome. Things had gotten complicated a few times, especially during the reign of Caesar, but they stayed in the fold ever since.” </p><p>“Which Rome, the Republic, or the Empire,” I said, looking at her, starting to find it slightly inconvenient that both parts used the name Rome by default, to signal that they were the legitimate successor. I didn’t care about it before, because I never expected myself to somehow exist in the gap between the two sides. </p><p>I was just a bastard noble of a colony… </p><p>“That’s a bit complicated,” she admitted. </p><p>“Make it simple, then,” I said with a chuckle as I slapped her ass, earning a giggle from her —  and another jealous glance from Xia. It was a good way to distract both from the mortal danger we had just faced. </p><p>“The simple answer is, that it depends on the year. Even under Rome, officially, Egypt had never been a province, and instead, it’s an allied kingdom, which means neither rules Egypt, but all the external decisions, from trade to military, are made by Rome. Which part has the sway changes, but there are some aspects that are pretty much set in stone. The Republic always has the first right to purchase the grain Egypt produces and has the sway over the navy, and the Empire has the overwhelming control over the land trade, magical materials, and the army.” </p><p>“A convenient split,” I said. “What would happen now that another war is about to explode?” I asked. </p><p>“Probably nothing. It’s one of the unofficial rules that both sides try to follow.  Egypt stays neutral, and continues to trade.” </p><p>“A weird preference,” I commented. </p><p>“Not really,” Theodora answered. “The wars between the two sides of Rome are pretty common,  and at this point, neither side is willing to push so hard that they weaken themselves against enemy invasion. After all, Germanic tribes were still a problem for the Republic, and for the Empire, Parthians had always been a dangerous enemy.” </p><p>”Not the weirdest detail about the nobility,” I admitted. “How would you feel about a trip to Egypt?” </p>",

    "content": "<p>When my phone alarm finally rang, I was putting the last touches on the surface of my fake artifact by rubbing some dirt and stone to give it an old look, like it had been recently dug out of the earth — a night-long effort, interrupted by another wave of shadow assassins that I was able to get rid of it smoothly, leaving me to wonder when they would realize the inefficiency of their moves.</p><p>The result was worth it.  </p><p>My own staff of Hermes — or at least, a broken version that was only a bit bigger than my hand. Walking around with a full-sized staff was hardly appealing. It was by no means an expert work, and would never trick a curator, but I didn’t need it to. I just needed it not to look freshly made. </p><p>I just needed an excuse for my recovery purposes. </p><p>Of course, there were better, more relevant items from mythology for that purpose, but I wanted to have an excuse I could have used for different purposes, just in case. </p><p>“Now, to your food,” I said with a chuckle as I focused on the little item I had created from the remaining wood. A large bowl, made of wood for my newest pet. I filled it with carrots and lettuce, and more importantly, filled the wood of the bowl with Recovery-Energy. </p><p>With that, I pushed the box to a concealed corner of the room, and set my cameras to warn me of any movement, then I left. </p><p>I was at the stadium fifteen minutes before the training was supposed to start, to make sure everything was in order. Yet, Marcus was already there, pushing one of the tackling dummies to the center. “You’re early,” I called. </p><p>“So are you, Coach,” Marcus answered with a chuckle as he looked at me. “I thought you would have skipped the training after yesterday’s show,” he said with a chuckle. “Who knew you could make a spectacle out of a nerd game.” </p><p>“If you’re not making a spectacle, you’re not trying,” I said with a chuckle even as I walked with him. </p><p>“You’re right, but not every spectacle could get the Dean fired while humiliating our opponents, that was very impressive,” he answered. </p><p>I shrugged. “We just need to make sure that we don’t get humiliated this Sunday.” </p><p>“That’s a tall order,” Marcus answered even as he grabbed some other stuff. </p><p>“How’s the mood with the team,” I asked. </p><p>“Better than expected,” he said. “Watching Dean’s misfortune helped quite a bit for the mood. At least, they are not afraid they will be kicked out of the team once the dean allows Spencer to come back.” </p><p>“Yeah,” I chuckled. “That ship is sailed unless we get humiliated this Sunday.” </p><p>Marcus didn’t share my mirth about that. “Unfortunately, that’s a very likely probability,” he admitted with a sigh. </p><p>“Any reason?” I asked. His gaze was deadpan. “Well, any reason than the fact that we were a chaotic team that had been gathered as a last-ditch effort, filled with practice squad and other mess,” I followed. </p><p>“Well, other than that little issue…” he said with a mocking tone, before getting serious. “I’m afraid of the mood. They are too relaxed after your victory, and actually expect us to win.” </p><p>“And that’s affecting training efficiency,” I guessed. </p><p>“No,” he said, before pausing. “Well, yes, as yesterday’s evening training was rather lax,” he admitted. “But the match is what I’m really afraid of. What will happen when the game won’t go as gloriously as they expect. When we fail to defend against a long pass, or throw an interception. I fear that they will panic and collapse.” </p><p>“Good point,” I said as I looked at him. “They are enthusiastic, but that’s not a clear advantage. Maybe I should test their mental state today.” </p><p>“That would be helpful,” he admitted. </p><p>Before he could say anything else, my phone rang. Considering there were very few people that would have gone to the trouble of calling me at this ungodly hour, I decided to check.</p><p>It was Coach Juana. I gestured for Marcus to continue with the tackling dummies before answering. “How can I help you, Coach?” I asked. </p><p>“You can help me by running the whole training yourself today,” she answered, her tone between shocked and irate. </p><p>“What happened?” I asked, curious about her tone. </p><p>“I have just received a promotion,” she answered. </p><p>“Really, maybe I should congratulate you, Head Coach —“ I started, only to be interrupted. </p><p>“Not the Head Coach,” she said. “I’m going to be the next Sports Director.” </p><p>“Really? That was a big … promotion?” I asked, though I let some doubt infect my tone. Technically, it was debatable whether it was a better job compared to being Head Coach, depending on the ultimate target. </p><p>“It is a promotion,” she answered. “Especially with the way things had been going. Technically, I’m the interim head coach as well, but I doubt I will be able to pay much attention to the team for a week or two. With the double-resignation, everything is a mess.”</p><p>“So, it’s certain, they are gone,” I said. </p><p>“Was there any doubt,” she asked, chuckling despite the exhaustion in her tone, suggesting that I wasn’t the only one that skipped the sleep.</p><p>“Considering my interactions with them, I wasn’t entirely certain that it was enough. They were shameless enough to stay.” </p><p>“They might be shameless, but the same doesn’t apply to the Board. Ultimately, the board was clear that the scandal was too big to handle, and suggested a face-saving resignation was a better option than getting fired while under investigation for bribery and other irregularities.” </p><p>“Good news,” I said as I paused for a moment, considering the implications, feeling rather greedy at the prospect of all that Intent while holding the fort alone. I hoped that the match would be enough to complete the repair. </p><p>[Repair - Phase One - Progress - 49%]</p><p>Considering all the passive flood was barely able to push it to another point despite the scandal — though I had spent some for experimentation — the game represented the biggest opportunity to solve things. </p><p> “About handling the team,” she suggested. “I might try to reach a few high-school coaches to see if they are willing to take the challenge—“ she suggested. </p><p>I interrupted her. “No need. As long as you can handle the operational and logistic aspects, I can easily handle the training and the game time,” I answered. “I just need to skip the classes.” </p><p>“As the new sports director who’s responsible for the academic career of the players as well, I didn’t hear the last part,” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. “As you wish, director,” I said with a chuckle. “Anything else?” </p><p>“No, coach,” she answered. “Go and make sure we don’t get humiliated this Sunday. I don’t think either of us can handle it.” </p><p>I shut the phone, and went back to help Marcus, checking the state of the locker room and the corridors in the process, confirming that the cleaning crew had done a comprehensive assessment of the area. </p><p>As we worked a few of the other veterans arrived before the official time, and started helping. I noticed Arthur among them, moving back and forth with the group, doing his best to make himself a part of the group. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if I explained someone about my situation, they would have been shocked that I didn’t kick Arthur out of the team. But that would have been a horrible mistake. A spy, once discovered, was an excellent double-edged sword. </p><p>Not to mention, I didn’t have the luxury of getting rid of my best Quarterback at the moment. His backup was a Running back that could barely throw a few short passes, and while I could use him to pull a few trick plays, that was the extent of what was doable. </p><p>The irony, that a group of people that was potentially my enemies gave me the most important tool I needed to resist the situation. </p><p>I watched as the people gather, delaying the start of the training. The reason, some of the newer players, arriving late. Not for long, just for a minute or two, but that was never a good sign. Conveniently, I had been looking for a chance to break their happy mood. </p><p>“Good morning, team,” I said cheerfully. Amusedly, I noted that it was enough to unsettle the old players, and some of the new players. But most of the new players smiled benignly, thinking that it was an honest greeting. </p><p>They could not be further from the truth. “I can see that your group had volunteered you a lot for a morning greeting. A nice two-mile run,” I said, to which they didn’t react. “In full gear,” I added, my friendly smile disappearing into another, not-so-friendly one. |Are you guys happy about that?” I asked with a cheerful tone. </p><p>“Maybe only the late ones—“ one of the new players that were on time spoke before one of the others could silence him. </p><p>“Oh, good, volunteers for a three-mile run,” I said, with excessive cheer. It was a bit pushing, and another coach, especially a student-coach, trying the same trick might have experienced some unfortunate responses. </p><p>Luckily, I was cheating, and it only earned a groan of protest before they started running.  </p><p>An explosive way to start a day, but welcome. After all, it gave me the chance I needed to test my newest toy… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Was that a good thing, or a bad thing, little buddy,” I murmured as I fed a small carrot to my temporary pet, along with another dose of Recovery-Intent. </p><p>I was torn between being happy or alert about Arthur and German Professor being connected to the same group. From one perspective, it was beneficial for both of them to be a part of the same group, as it would help me to deal with them as a unit rather than trying to play them off against each other. </p><p>On the other hand, it meant that I wouldn’t be playing two groups off against each other in case of an emergency. It was always easier to bargain while playing two groups against each other. </p><p>“But not all hope is lost,” I thought as I focused on the last part of the discussion, particularly the aspects about Doctor Williams and the potential information she had over me. Their discussion implied that, she was either a member that stood at a particular distance — enough not to reveal her information — or a distant ally. </p><p>Either way, it gave me some hope to collaborate, especially now that I wasn’t afraid of revealing magic to her for the first time. She was clearly aware of it, and prodded by that, rather than her curiosity being triggered from scratch. </p><p>“But not now, right, little buddy,” I murmured as I scratched the head of the turtle and fed him a bit more. “No, she’s a demanding bitch, and it’s best to deal with her from a position of strength.” </p><p>I might have considered visiting her right now if I hadn’t discovered the alternative usage method of Intent. Even if I failed to apply anything but Recovery, I still had an incredible advantage in the match. Football was a violent sport, and especially the second half became a game of endurance, pain tolerance, and luck of injury. </p><p>If my near-instant healing could save a tortoise from certain death, it should be enough to cure the football players of their small injuries and their exhaustion. </p><p>Of course, should and would be two different things, and there were many reasons it might not work as perfectly on humans, but I still had two days of training to make sure things had been going perfectly. </p><p>Though, that path had some problems as well. The organization was already aware that I had the ability to use Traits, but they were already expecting someone else to be supporting me — and quite inefficiently, if their discussion about the impossibility of handling the people in the stadium was any indicator. </p><p>I needed a dummy to trick them, I decided. I turned on the Internet, and searched for something I could use for the subject. After some search, I picked the Staff of Hermes as a good object for that purpose. </p><p>My first inclination was to purchase one online, but after some consideration, I decided against it. I just didn’t know about their surveillance capabilities, but checking someone’s order history, especially if they had a friend inside, was not particularly difficult. </p><p>“Why don’t I make one for myself,” I said as I started reading about wood-crafting, to see the process, which looked simpler than I expected. Not exactly trivial, but most of the challenge was the ability to use a bladed tool, and the precision that was required to get the angles right. </p><p>Not something that could be developed in a day or two, even for a savant, but I was betting that, at this point, I was more than a simple savant. </p><p>“I’m going out to pick some wood, little buddy,” I said as I looked at the tortoise on the box and flooded him with another dose of Intent, to test if there was any great side effect, before I prepared to leave. “You must be bored,” I suddenly said and picked him up, though I was sure that I was reflecting my own state. </p><p>Watching tutorials on woodworking was not the most entertaining activity. </p><p>Thanks to the remote location of my dorm, it didn’t take long to arrive at the forest, and soon, I was walking around, looking for a thick branch, continuing to flood Recovery-Intent to my new pet.</p><p>Yet, as I walked, I started to feel some kind of … presence. </p><p>“Weird,” I murmured, but since it was an adjective that defined the latest stretch of my life perfectly, I decided not to use that as a word of dismissal. Instead, I decided to use the same trick I had been using earlier to cure my little pet, but with a little change. </p><p>I didn’t focus on any kind of trait, and spread raw energy… Yet, that didn’t work. Curious, I attempted a few more Traits, including Perception and Pattern recognition. None of them worked either. </p><p>“Was that an illusion, little buddy,” I murmured as I put my hand on the shell of my new pet, and flooded with Recovery-Intent. </p><p>And felt the same sense of resonance. The link was hard to deny, I decided as I started to walk in that direction. I had to walk five minutes before I found the source among the naked trees. </p><p>A broken and charred root of a tree, one that had looked like it was struck by lightning at one point. “Curious,” I murmured as I continued to flood the tortoise, and receive the exact same feedback. “Do you also think that my little fake healing item might end up not so fake, little buddy?” I answered, but he didn’t react, lazing under my magical treatment. </p><p>Curious, I spread some Intent through its structure, little enough that it wouldn’t have even shattered a small pebble, doing my best to pull a variant of the old German’s trick, and it worked. I could see only a part of the trunk actually resonating with the energy. </p><p>“Now, another experiment,” I said as I raised my fist, gathered some Strength-Intent on my fingers — a natured variant of what I had pulled against those shadows — and smashed down, shattering the useless parts easily, like they were made of foam. </p><p>The useful part would fit into a shoebox comfortably. “Still, a good amount,” I said, and started carrying it with me. And, the way he had been rubbing against the wood as we walked back, I wasn’t the only one that was feeling the effects. </p><p>Curious, I started to play with it, and came up with several findings. First, it was reacting to Recovery-Intent, and only that. Another finding was … persistence. Other items got affected by Intent, but it was a fleeting thing. </p><p>The wood functioned almost like a battery, and even as I ceased feeding it with Intent, it maintained its warmth. One that had been disappearing slowly… Very slowly, as when we arrived back to my room, it was still noticeably warm — both physically, and magically. </p><p>“Okay, little buddy, you helped me a lot,” I said as I put the tortoise back on his box, only for him to slam against the box, his gaze following the wood. “So, you liked it,” I said with a chuckle even as I broke a small piece, and filled it with some Recovery-Intent before putting next to it. </p><p>He immediately scampered on top of it, and rested his head against the warmth. I chucked, amused that a tortoise was acting more like a puppy. </p><p>I chuckled even as I walked back. First, I pulled some old papers, spreading them on the ground to catch the wood shavings, before I raised an excess piece of wood — which I picked to practice — while turning on the tutorial once more, watching the video as my blade danced on its surface. </p><p>My toolset was not perfect, but the precision helped me to avoid accidentally cutting myself. Fifteen minutes later, I was looking at the first attempt, which, looked like an extradimensional monster of horror, which could hardly be classified as a success. </p><p>“I’m so glad that I don’t have the luxury to sleep,” I murmured with a chuckle. Well, technically, I did. All I needed was to allow my guide to appear, and trust her to handle any possible shadow assassin that might choose to attack me. </p><p>But a sleepless night or two, especially under the combined assistance of Recovery and Endurance, was a good trade for avoiding a meddling angel… </p><p>It was time to work… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had a bounce on my steps as I walked through a mostly empty corridor, a jump in my steps after a quick nap. It was not my habit to have regular naps, but I decided to make an exception for the day.</p><p>Umi was fun and exhausting, and while returning, Brenda did her best to exhaust me further as well, feeling jealous of my attention. She assumed — rightfully — that my attention was a fleeting commodity, and decided to work hard to keep it on. </p><p>Though, I had to admit that she had the instincts for it. Another girl might have just tried to follow up with more sex, but she followed up with a long tease only, doing her best to leave me wanting for more, only to abandon me once we arrived at the shore, dragging Umi away. </p><p>Not before taking my credit card with her — one with a limit that I found acceptable, I was not a moron — while promising she would give her new bestie a makeover. </p><p>I might have kept her back, but considering it was still morning, I decided to let her go, and instead went for a nap. </p><p>I had a feeling that it would be a long day. </p><p>I was distracted as I walked, not expecting anything to happen, which turned out to be an erroneous assumption. </p><p>Which came in the form of a hand — a beautiful, carefully manicured hand — suddenly grabbing my arm and pulling me to a small room. The pull wasn’t strong enough to pull me in if I resisted, but the hand that grabbed me was familiar enough for me to allow that. </p><p>Tiffany, the busty redheaded wife of my most annoying employee. </p><p>“How can I help you, sweetie?” I chuckled even as I looked around while the door closed behind me, only to realize that I was in one of the smaller conference rooms the hotel kept for other events, and it was currently empty. </p><p>Her frustrated expression was very beautiful. “I didn’t expect to you break your promise,” she whispered petulantly. </p><p>It was theatrical petulance, evident by the way her pouty lips curled excessively, making her look more like a spoiled college girl — which, I had to admit, worked excellently, especially combined with her beautiful white summer dress. </p><p>Before asking that question, I let my gaze linger down, taking note of her incredible allure. </p><p>With her amazing curves, she was already beautiful, but the way her dress barely hang onto her body with one of the straps skewed — looked accidental, but considering the dress just dipped down enough to reveal the edge of her bra while providing an excellent view of her cleavage, arranged very carefully. </p><p>The shortness of her dress was further enhanced by the way her skirt was folded up on the right, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful, legs fully, but this time ending just before I get a glimpse of her underwear. </p><p>She was prepared very carefully. </p><p>“Tell me, honey, how did I break my promise?” I said as I raised my gaze to her face. </p><p>She trembled under my attention, but her smile got hungrier. “We were supposed to go shopping, but you chose to gallivant with your newest toy instead.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Are you frustrated that I didn’t invite you?” I asked, which earned a frustrated growl. </p><p>“Maybe,” she admitted. “Especially since you chose that whore Brenda instead. I didn’t know you had such high standards, maybe we should rethink our whole arrangement —“ she said, but she was unable to finish her words as I cut her off. I wasn’t in the mood to listen to what kind of beef she had with Brenda. </p><p>I leaned forward, capturing her lips even as I pushed her against the wall. Her lips widened, allowing my tongue to slip inside even as my hands landed on her hips, slipping under her dress to enjoy the feeling of her naked hips once more. </p><p>It might not have been long since I tasted those hips, but the sensation was still spectacular. </p><p>I stretched the merciless kiss for a minute, and when I pulled back, her makeup was thoroughly mussed. “You were saying,” I whispered as I looked at her blushing face. “It felt like you were trying to control who was I spending my company with, but that must be wrong. Certainly, you’re smarter than that.”</p><p>“I …” she murmured dazedly, her words hard to find in her haze, and my hands still mauling her ass making it harder for her to recover. “I wasn’t trying to control you. I just wondered why are you spending your time with … such a low-class person,“ she said. </p><p>I was amused, as she was talking about someone that was almost her copy, from the looks, attitude, and even the submissive machiavellian streak. The only difference was that Brenda was betraying her boss, while Tiffany was betraying her husband — which was hardly a comparison that put Brenda in a worse place. </p><p>But, since I was not an utter and complete moron, I mentioned none of those details. Dominance didn’t mean one could act recklessly, one must always be aware of what to say. And, to someone like Tiffany, any comparison to Brenda where she came as inferior was one of the taboo topics. </p><p>Luckily, there were many interesting ways to handle that. </p><p>“Oh, that’s big talk from you. Are you sure?” I asked enjoying her thoughtful expression. “Maybe you should show me that.” She threw a glance toward the door, particularly toward the key that allowed her to lock the door. “But, if you’re afraid that you can’t handle the risk of getting caught—“ I continued, only to be interrupted by a push to my shoulder. </p><p>“I’ll show you who can’t handle it,” she said as she pushed me toward a chair. Not the nearest one, but one that was positioned in a way that would be hard to see from the entrance, giving her a chance to hide under the table. </p><p>A nice thoughtful trick. I let that pass. </p><p>“Daring. You’re not afraid of people coming and find us here. It would be quite a scandal.” </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered, her smirk merciless. “After all, my dear husband was very insistent that I needed to flirt with you and earn your goodwill. As a good wife, it’s my role to listen to him. He’s the one that needs to think about possible blowback.” </p><p>I doubted that her idiot husband was imagining her slowly undressing me to blow me, and certainly not in a conference room anyone might walk in, but I didn’t bother saying that, more interested in watching her fingers pulling down my bermuda shorts. </p><p>“Oh, you’re already here,”  she whispered as she looked at my erection, acting surprised. Maintaining one was certainly not hard, not with the angle I was able to look down her dress, cleavage further enhanced as the dress slipped. </p><p>Her fingers wrapped around my shaft, slowly dancing up and down. “Well, but let’s make sure I’ll stay there,” I said as I leaned forward, my hand lightning fast as I took off her bra, and her dress slipped down, even more, to leave her tits completely naked. </p><p>“It’s a bit risky—“ she gasped in panic, but under my gaze, she nodded. She turned a bit, making sure the table was blocking her enough to hide her in case someone burst in, then turned back. “Just like I love,” she continued, her growing smile showing it wasn’t entirely inaccurate. </p><p>“Good,” I said. “Then we don’t have anything stopping you from starting.” </p><p>She started fast. She moved forward slightly,  her tits trapping my erection in between while her lips landed on top, her suction force incredible. Occasionally, she stopped to give a lick along the side, making it even sexier for my enjoyment. </p><p>I let her work as I crossed my hands behind my back, about to enjoy the sensation, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from Brenda. </p><p>Curious, I checked. It was a selfie, with Brenda hugging Umi from behind, and they were in a dressing room. Umi was blushing furiously, which was understandable considering neither was wearing a stitch. Umi managed to hide her core by crossing her legs, while the task of hiding her breasts was left one of Brenda’s arms hugging from behind, the other holding the phone.  </p><p>An amazing photo, even without including the mirror that reflected Brenda’s ass perfectly. </p><p>“That’s rude,” Tiffany growled as she looked up. </p><p>“Well, you need to work harder to keep my attention—“ I started, only for a click to come from the door. Someone was coming in.  </p><p>Her eyes widened in shock as she hid under the table, while I pulled the chair forward, enough to hide the fact that I was naked halfway. </p><p>The door opened, and Natalie entered, and following her was a young woman that I didn’t recognize, but looked somewhat familiar. </p><p>She was a beautiful woman, brunette, with a soft face, but her sharp smile contrasted that, almost vindictive. Her body was not as soft, but it wasn’t the bony, unattractive hardness, but a sportive kind of hardness that implied endless hours in the gym. </p><p>“Hey, Nathan, why are you here?” she asked, surprised. </p><p>“I’m having an emergency call with a client,” I said, showing my phone which was already in hand. “Work never ends, you know,” I said. “So, who’s your guest.”</p><p>“You don’t remember me?” she asked, frustration clear in her tone. </p><p>Normally, I wouldn’t have cared that much, but I was familiar enough with Natalie to know she wouldn’t have panicked for no reason. “Of course not, how could I forget you,” I said with a teasing smile. “I was just teasing you.” </p><p>Her expression softened, showing that she believed it. Meanwhile, I was desperately trying to remember who was she. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing as a soft blush covered every part of her visible skin while she reconsidered her strategy to distract me, her attention once again slipping away from the magical aspects of the battle. I wondered if her whole body was covered with that blush. </p><p>Then, as if she read my mind, she decided to show me that. Her hands reached to her front, and one by one, she started unbuttoning her shirt, shivering with each step, the revealed skin just as blushed. Soon, however, I was more interested in the peek of her cleavage, showing the expanse of her breasts… </p><p>She tried to keep her expression serious, but it was a challenge that got stronger with every button. Soon, her robe was completely parted, revealing her underwear… Yet, when she grabbed her robe, her hands trembled, like she was wondering whether it was too much. </p><p>That would not do, I decided, and manipulated the vines to move once more, the distraction proving enough to focus her back on our … game. “I’ll show you,” she growled as she get rid of her robe, leaving her effectively naked. </p><p>“A daring play,” I commented. “Now, are you going to continue with your fingers … or something more?” I said. </p><p>“Something more,” she whispered before she realized where I was looking at. “W-with my lips?” she asked, her cute eyes shining with shock, yet desire was not too far behind. </p><p>“Well, that’s one option, but certainly not the only one,” I reminded her, letting my gaze dip down to her spectacular breasts that challenged the ability of her underwear to stay whole. </p><p>“You —“ she gasped, but another magic assault to the vine that was keeping me bound was a good way to distract her from the shameful nature of the event, letting her focus on the present instead.  </p><p>Though, the shameful nature of the event didn’t keep her down for long. She didn’t lose much time before her gaze fell on my shaft, which was already throbbing thanks to her earlier treatment, and the show only made the situation more intense. Soon, she leaned down. Slowly, hesitantly, her gaze jumped everywhere. </p><p>Yet, ultimately, her lips captured the head of my shaft, her mouth even warmer than her fingers — which returned to the base almost immediately. It felt like velvet. Then, she moved, slightly, her shivers enough to kill a weaker man with a heart attack. </p><p>Yet, the true effect only started when her head started bobbing. Slowly, hesitantly, yet with an intense erotic tone. As she did that, she slowly caressed the base, unsure of her movements like it was a puzzle she was trying to resolve. When her head pulled back, I was afraid that was the end, but then, her tongue darted out as she hesitantly started her task, giving a lick. </p><p>I attacked my bound hands once more, which finally earned her gaze, frustration battling with desire. “Well, you need to work harder to distract me,” I suggested. </p><p>She murmured something unintelligible, probably not too nice. Then, her beautiful ruby lips parted, swallowing a third of my length in one smooth move, surprising me with her initiative. </p><p>I let my magical attack fade, abandoning the ground I acquired, giving her some advantage in our little game. The positive reinforcement worked better than I expected. Her eyes glowed — literally, with mana — as she pushed herself deeper on my shaft, managing to swallow more than half, and only letting out one gag in return. </p><p>It was a spectacular view with her lips caressing the base while the crown started to experience the tight grip of her throat. The sensation was equally nice. </p><p>Certainly a unique experience. Spectacular, even, especially when she continued to look at with her pretty eyes colored with victory. I didn’t argue against that, as we were playing one of those rare games that her victory didn’t mean my loss… A mutual victory was certainly on the table. </p><p>I watched passively as her pretty little mouth tightened around my girth, my length disappearing into her depths. Then, things escalated even more. She started alternating her pacing, her lips tightening further as she quickened. </p><p>It took everything I had not to comment on it, letting her continue to explore her self-assigned path to victory. She mumbled occasionally, but with her mouth occupied, it was difficult to decipher her words. </p><p>She surprised me by continuing her magical attack, and I felt her magic invading the vine that kept her legs immobile. I was tempted to act like I hadn’t noticed that trick, curious how she would follow up, but then decided against it. I didn’t want to make her overestimate her abilities to cast concealed spells, that kind of thing was dangerous. </p><p>Luckily, that didn’t mean I had to sacrifice my fun to teach her the lesson properly. As she delivered her covert attack, I copied one through the vine that was around my arm, loosening its grip, enough that I could pull my hand out of its tight hold. She didn’t notice it. </p><p>“You lose—” she whispered once the vine loosened around her legs and wrapped around mine, which was the moment I grabbed her hair and pulled her down using my freed hand, cutting her words. </p><p>I didn’t plunge her down immediately. “Think again,” I said, using my distracting attempt as leverage to wrap the one that was around my arms to hers, forcing her arms behind her. “You need to be more careful about counter-attacks. Now, you can blink twice and I can take it as a surrender—“ I commented, only to receive a growl instead. </p><p>A very clear negative response. </p><p>“As you wish, then it’s my turn to distract,” I said as I plunged her head down, invading her throat mercilessly. It had been a while since I properly tasted the warm touch of a beautiful woman with everything that was going on, and changing that felt incredible. </p><p>For a while, I stayed merciful — relatively — and maintained a pace she enjoyed as her head bobbed outside her control, her lips gliding over my steely shaft. </p><p>Her attempts to attack with her mana stopped for a moment, and I used the chance to move the second vine on her as well. Bound both ways, she lost the ability to react as I ripped her top off, finally leaving her breasts free. </p><p>“Now, that’s a distraction,” I chuckled as I squeezed her nipple, which just brought a suppressed moan, but there was no mistaking the arousal dancing in the depths of her gaze. She shivered, showing she barely had a minute to resist this pace. </p><p>If I hadn’t been going through the biggest dry spell of my recent history, I might have slowed down. </p><p>For this time, I had a different method in mind. </p><p>I tightened my grip without a warning and pushed her down even faster, while simultaneously raising my hips, occupying her throat aggressively. Her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock as I rammed my cock even deeper into her throat, cutting her breathing. Her throat muscles tried to resist my invasion, but I was merciless, not allowing her a chance to succeed. </p><p>Despite wheezing and gagging, she managed to maintain her gaze on mine, with a look that was just asking for more.  </p><p>“What a naughty little priestess,” I said with a chuckle, though I didn’t find that inappropriate. After all, she was worshiping something that effectively I created, making me her … grand-god. A little worship of my trunk was nothing inappropriate. </p><p>While I was fucking her throat mercilessly, she gagged and wheezed, adding another layer of enjoyment to our little game. She did her best to act obediently as she swallowed my behemoth to the best of her ability. Her mouth opened as wide as possible, trying to swallow me down. </p><p>“There’s a good priestess…” I murmured as I let her pull back to catch her breath, just before she climaxed, her nipple still between my fingers. “Now, do you want to stop our training, or do you want to continue.” </p><p>At the edge of a climax, she didn’t say anything for a moment, trying to catch her breath. Which wasn’t easy, with my hand digging into her tits, the rush of pleasure working excellently to distract her from the more immediate aspects of our little game. </p><p>“No,” she managed to whisper after a long while. “Don’t you dare to stop…” </p><p>“As you wish, my dear Seldanna,” I whispered as I pushed her down once more, her mouth fully open under my firm assault. My full length disappeared into her mouth and down her throat again, while she did nothing but gag and choke obediently.</p><p>I closed my eyes to enjoy the sensation as she started trembling, enjoying her first orgasm … of many that we would eventually create. And, as a first-time bonus, I let her pull back as she trembled badly, her bindings working excellently to keep her from collapsing. </p><p>Bit by bit, she recovered, and her gaze found mine. I expected confusion, maybe a soft vulnerability. </p><p>I didn’t expect a vindictive smirk. </p><p>Suddenly vines wrapped around my arms and legs. </p><p>Oops. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7352}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>When I had started teasing her, I hadn't expected much, but her absolute lack of protest as I rolled up her robes had done quite a bit to change my mind about it. I spanked her once more, enjoying the way she trembled on my lap. </p><p>In a way that had absolutely nothing to do with fear. </p><p>Only anticipation. </p><p>I spanked her again, and this time, a whisper escaped her mouth. “How much longer?” she whispered. </p><p>Her question earned me a big smile. Pity, she couldn’t see that from her current position. “Well, do you want me to stop?” I asked with a chuckle, a question that she left without an answer decisively. “Excellent,” I added, and spanked her once more. “After all, your tactical failure needs a big punishment.” </p><p>She didn’t answer, silent as my hand stayed on her ass after the spank, dancing on her skin. Curious, I decided to push a bit more. A flare of mana, and two vines burst out of the ground, one wrapping around her wrist, the other around her legs. </p><p>“W-what’s going on,” she gasped. </p><p>“Well,” I said, intentionally extending my murmur as I did so. “A part of your failure is about your abject failure to control your mana, so I have a little control exercise for you. You need to free yourself from your impediments, but you’re not allowed to flood it with your mana and destroy it. You need to overcome my control.” </p><p>“I…” she whispered. “What if I can’t… Will I be … punished?” Her tone left no doubt about what she was asking about. </p><p>“Of course not,” I answered with a smirk, and pulled my hand away, stopping to touch her. “I’m not going to touch you … at all.” </p><p>“At … all,” she said, her voice starting from a whisper and turning into a panicked gasp halfway. </p><p>“Of course not, you have been already punished, this is the training part. Aren’t you happy that you have such an enthusiastic helper, priestess?” I said with a chuckle as I crossed my hands behind my head. </p><p>But the state of her robe was enough to convey my true intent without the slightest doubt. After all, why would I leave it rolled, breaking the whole point of her conservative robe to reveal her surprisingly toned legs? </p><p>Which was a truly glorious sight, even with the monstrosities she wore as underwear. </p><p>“I see,” she whispered, but that was all she was able to say as she froze on my lap, unable to act.</p><p>Her inaction lasted a full minute, frozen with indecision, no doubt overwhelmed by what had just happened. She had already accepted my implied invitation, but the following twist was enough to freeze her. </p><p>Passively accepting was different than taking an active role. </p><p>It took a while until I felt her mana. Her magic gave her a lot of options, some allowing her to cut herself free from the vines, or at least fix her dress, but she ignored all of those possibilities, and soon, her mana danced in the vine, probing against my mana. </p><p>I responded to her tricks to take control, treating that as a fun way to experiment with controlling nature-mana, which was a great way to kill time as she tried to process the situation. </p><p>As we battled for control, both of us experienced a significant jump in mana-related abilities, and we were surprisingly balanced. I had the advantage in terms of pure power, but she was certainly more familiar with how nature-mana interacted with actual plants. I was just brute-forcing control most of the time — though, it was more the equivalent of wild bribery in vegetation terms.</p><p>She managed to steal control of the one around her arms after a while. I might have tried to steal it back, but when I felt it wrap around my arms instead, I decided to let it slide, curious about where she would go. </p><p>I smiled, but I was unable to hide my curiosity as she managed to push herself off my lap, instead ended up in front of me, kneeling due to her legs, still wrapped. Our little competition stalled with her focus shifting to keep me bound rather than trying to pull back. </p><p>Curious, I let that happen, enjoying my height advantage as she looked up silently. She was already a bundle of nerves, which gave me some nice ideas about how she might follow the situation, but I didn’t dare to ask. </p><p>I didn’t want to scare her off — not to mention, I wanted to see what she would do of her own volition.</p><p>“It seems that we’re locked in a stalemate,” she whispered, her soft tone promising a lot of interesting things about the situation. </p><p>“It seems that way,” I answered with a chuckle as I shrugged and raised my hands, highlighting my helplessness. It wasn’t an intense situation, especially since I could get rid of my bindings a dozen ways, and I suspected she knew that as well. “What are you going to do?”</p><p>But she didn’t say anything, busy biting her lips while avoiding my gaze. “I guess … I have to cheat a bit, then,” she whispered. Her words were ambiguous, but the way she put her hands on my thighs certainly was not. </p><p>I had several words on top of my tongue, ready to go out to tease her about her choice, but since I wasn’t a complete moron, I held them back to see what she would do. </p><p>“Let’s see if you can … handle it,” she said, this time louder like volume would give her confidence. It worked, though only until her hand landed on my lap, and felt the hardness underneath. “This is … wrong,” she whispered. </p><p>“It’s fine to admit it if you can’t handle it,” I said, giving her a little help. With my teasing, her anger flared. Not the softest of emotions, but an excellent way to suppress her hesitancy and push her toward an ill-advised decision. </p><p>The anger wasn’t enough to completely cure her hesitancy, but it was enough to let her hand continue its climb rather than stalling, and soon, she was pulling my pants down. “See … I can handle it,” she whispered, her voice dreamy as she looked at it. </p><p>I used that opportunity to counter-attack her, and the vines around my arms loosened for a moment. “Hey,” she gasped as she remembered to control them, and soon, they were once again tight. </p><p>“Well, as you said, distraction is a fair game. I can’t do anything if you can’t handle it.” </p><p>Her frown of frustration was simply beautiful, especially since it was accompanied by a twitch of her pointy ears. “I’ll show you distraction,” she gasped. </p><p>“Excellent decision,” I whispered as she dragged her hand up once more, this time touching my pole to remove any ambiguity about what was about to transpire. </p><p>She said nothing as her hands started to dance on my length, hesitant yet impressive, though her lips parted open in shock as she realized one important detail. “It’s … growing,” she whispered. </p><p>“That’s how it works when it’s … being used as a tool of distraction by a gorgeous beauty, honey,” I said with a chuckle, enjoying her shock. </p><p>“I’m gorgeous…” she whispered dazedly before focusing on its size. “But … it’s too big,” she whispered as she leaned back, her face contorted with shock. </p><p>“No, sweetie, just big enough, don’t worry about it,” I answered, enjoying her tremble, but her conviction proved stronger as her fingers started moving, her fingertips unable to touch. </p><p>“If you say so,” she whispered, doubtful, but too focused to care. As her hand danced, our magical struggle continued, though with less intensity. I could have used that to reverse the situation, but with her hands picking up speed, I decided to let that go. </p><p>It was nice to see her passion growing slowly. The attraction was a dangerous weapon, especially when combined with the rush of a near-death experience. She said nothing, but her moans lingered as her hands danced. </p><p>I said nothing, enjoying the sight. With her on her knees in front of me, her fingers wrapped around my erection, squeezing slowly with an intense look of concentration on her face. A little more forward than I expected of her, but certainly more attractive. </p><p>She looked at me occasionally with rapt attention, slowly squeezing her hand, while watching me for signs, her skills developing rapidly as she put her phenomenal perception abilities to the limit, her pressure soon reaching a perfect degree. </p><p>It was nice to see her newly improved abilities to excellent use. To her credit, she didn’t forget why she was trying to distract me in the first place, her mana battling against mine, and suddenly attacked with a mana rush.</p><p>“A good attempt,” I said with a chuckle as I blocked her. “Pity you failed to distract me enough…” </p><p>“Oh, I failed to distract you enough,” she whispered, the way her lips curled in challenge simply spectacular…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7352}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sakura fidgeted helplessly n his lap even as his fingers continued to dance at her entrance, caressing her inner thigh like it was nothing. </p><p>“A good start, right?” he asked. </p><p>“A start…” she found herself muttering, her fidgeting replaced by a sudden shock. Considering his fingers were dancing on her naked pussy, defining their current position as just a start was … ambitious. </p><p>“Yes, any problems,” he growled into her ear, which only made her wetter even as it stole any complaint she might have developed in the situation. </p><p>“N-no, sir,” she stammered, and only barely. </p><p>“Excellent,” he answered as he grabbed her waist, and suddenly, stood up. She would have fallen down if it wasn’t for his arm, tightly on her back, preventing her from a painful accident. Instead, she lost herself in the dance of his fingers, moans exploding off her lips as his fingers invaded her core. “That’s good, baby,” he said as reached down to her inner thigh and coaxed one leg further from the other. \"Open up for me.\"</p><p>And she did, until he dipped her down, like they were just conducting a sexy dance, but with one major difference. His face was buried in the valley between her tits, his tongue dancing aggressively, reminding her of her situation even as she exploded into a crazy chain of moans. </p><p>His face stayed in its descent even as she exploded into moans, the warmth covering her breasts, making her tremble helplessly. The feeling was divine as his breath warmed her chest, breathing in her scent. </p><p>Her hips undulated helplessly. \"Oh, God, please,\" she gasped helplessly as she felt her body going limp. </p><p>“Please, what?” he asked with a chuckle. </p><p>“Please … use your tongue on me more,” Sakura gasped, even though it was a horrible, terrible idea, especially in their position. In the middle of a cafe, where anyone could walk in… But suddenly, her world twisted, and she lost her complaints. </p><p>It took a second for her to realize he turned her upside down, with ease that truly shocked her, while also displaying his strength. Then, she lost her mind once more, because she felt his tongue pressing against her core, stealing her mind… </p><p>She felt like a toy, the best way possible to feel that way. </p><p>She tried to pay back. She was certainly flexible enough to unzip his pants and start paying back, but, as his mouth fastened on her core, she started moaning in a stupor, unable to finish her self-assigned task. </p><p>“P-please, sir,” she muttered softly. </p><p>“Please, what,\" he asked as he raised his head momentarily. </p><p>“I want to give as well, sir,” she muttered. </p><p>“As you wish, you little impatient whore,” he whispered. His insulting words should have angered her, but only made her hornier instead. He grabbed her once more, changed her position, and somehow, managed to get rid of his shirt at the same time. </p><p>How, she had no idea, but she didn’t care either, just desperately working on his pants to free what she deserved. She just worked on his pant furiously, using her teeth to unzip them. “Nice initiative, enough to earn your bonus,” he said with a chuckle. </p><p>She remembered earning the bonus was important, but that was just a momentary flash before she focused on the carnal needs. Most importantly, the side of the monster that buried her ass as she sat down. “How does that monster hide in your pants,” she muttered helplessly. </p><p>“With great difficulty,” he answered with a whisper, his tone stiffening her nipples even more. Nipples that long popped out of her mockery of a uniform, but she was well past the point of caring about that. She was thinking about the impossibility of the task ahead. </p><p>Fitting that monster inside her. </p><p>“Any problems, whore,” he whispered, the way that he was calling her triggering another set of trembles that destroyed her resistance — well, whatever little crumble had survived from her resistance, which was not much considering her current position, ready to be fucked like a whore in a public place. </p><p>Ultimately, her hand gently rest on his head while he caressed her inner thigh.</p><p>“I’m not sure if I can take all of it, sir,” she whispered, shocked that she could somehow deliver that sentence in one burst. “I never touched something so…” she whispered before letting her voice fade, hypnotized by the throbbing behind her. </p><p>“Well, no time like the present to test it, right,” he answered, and before she could say anything, he pushed her forward. </p><p>She felt a big fat monster against her entrance, trembling helplessly. “Right now—“ she managed to ask, which was all she was able to put as resistance before he started slipping inside. </p><p>Then, she lost her voice as something that greatly dwarfed any toy she dared to touch, let alone anything that was attached to a man — or whatever that passed for the ones she had been dating until this point. </p><p>Very mistakenly, she realized. </p><p>She felt herself stretch even as he pushed harder and harder until her soaked core stretched wide enough, taking the head without a problem. His pacing was impeccable, aggressive, and domineering, but never reckless enough to raise the beautiful sense of stretching into true pain. </p><p>“Ohh, I’m full,” she gasped as she felt him halfway in, finding it increasingly difficult to utter any words. She abandoned herself as she tried to deal with the incredible friction she never experienced before.</p><p>“Not remotely enough, sweetie,” he said as she pulled back, only to slam in again. At that moment, she felt herself losing her connection with reality. She closed her eyes as she lost herself in the pleasure, focusing on nothing but the friction in her core, and the sensation of fullness that somehow increased with every repeat despite how impossible it felt. </p><p>She barely noticed his legs touching her legs, showing that, against every impossibility, she managed to take him inside.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes, yes,” she moaned, repeating it like a prayer.</p><p>When she realized her position, she was already floating in the air … well, not air, but lifted by him, she corrected, but with the way, gravity helped to take him inside, it might as well be the same thing. </p><p>“You feel good, slut,” he whispered, and she felt a soothing relief mixing into her arousal — and somehow turning out to be even more explosive. “Tell me how I feel?” </p><p>“You — fell — amazing — sir,” she managed to shout, every word interrupted by at least a couple moans as he continued to invade her steadily… </p><p>Then, her foot touched the ground, making her fear that they were stopping. She opened her mouth, only to be silenced by his lips, cutting off her words before she could even say anything properly. </p><p>It took a while for her to realize they were not stopping, though in her defense, she was trying to balance herself on one foot while still wearing her heels, and his shaft, constantly invading her being didn’t make it any easier to think. </p><p>Everything was behind a milky layer of pleasure.  </p><p>When he finally put her on the ground, there was no attempt from her to pull away from his gargantuan cock barely fitting in her. Instead, she leaned back, taking him in. Though she was having trouble remembering what to do with her arms now that they had nothing to do. </p><p>\"Yes — yes — yes...\" she moaned, her hips in synchronization with his merciless yet steady thrusts, like the wild rumbling of a beautiful sports car. Yet, even with that speed, it took forever for him to go in and out of her, filling her deeply and completely. </p><p>“I’m going to cum…” she gasped as the sensations, unlike any she had ever experienced, filled her whole being. It didn’t help that he began nibbling her neck and worked his way to each of her ears.</p><p>“Then, let’s find the correct place,” he whispered once he finished with that, and, a moment later, she found herself pressing against the counter that she was supposed to be serving from behind…</p><p>Yet, she was in front of the counter, being served … the irony was spectacular. </p><p>Just not as spectacular as the exploding orgasm, filling her whole being, stealing her breath, and taking her sight… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I left the Queen’s private quarters early in the morning — but not so early that the rest of the palace was still sleeping —  I was in a good mood. Sapphire was always a pleasure, but the inclusion of Valkyrie turned that into a true feast. </p><p>But I expected my mood to improve even further soon due to my destination. The Princess’s quarters. I was whistling with joy as I stood in front of the secret entrance, a simple spell enough to unlock the secret entrance. </p><p>I walked in, doing my best to stay silent, more than happy to take the opportunity to tease Aria if the circumstances allowed. I still pulled the shadows around me to hide, not wanting to get caught by a maid in an accident. It wasn’t something I couldn’t handle, whether through threats or magic, but why invite unnecessary trouble. </p><p>It was good, because I could feel the presence of another person in Aria’s quarters. I stayed wrapped in the shadows while walking forward. I found Aria and the other person in the study. Aria had a pile of paper in front of her, and was going through them with impressive efficiency while the other person was a maid, alternating between ferrying papers and carrying refreshments. </p><p>My little princess was quite a worker bee while alone … I was certainly impressed. </p><p>I turned my attention to the papers in front of her, trying to get a sense of their content. It didn’t take long for me to realize the issues they included were less political, and more about ensuring the safety of the commoners. </p><p>As usual, she was really nice. </p><p>As I watched her work, I let my gaze focus on the way she dressed, a simple light green dress that left her arms completely bare, with a frilly skirt, the kind that a peasant girl might wear to a festival, cute and honest. And, to make things even simpler, she had no makeup on. </p><p>Most noble-born would never dare to wear something like that, but then, most noble-born would have looked like a fisherman’s wife that was in the process of being divorced. </p><p>Aria simply looked divine. </p><p>I got closer to her, but did nothing until the maid left the room for a long disappearance, waiting for inches away from her, shaking my head in slight disappointment. Her beauty might be legendary, but that certainly didn’t extend to her awareness. Yes, my ability to conceal myself in the shadows was strong, but that was not an excuse to miss my presence even when I stood next to her for minutes — and I wasn’t even running the trick at the maximum potential. </p><p>“You need to be more careful about your surroundings,” was my first words, along with a flick to her nose, startling her in fear enough that she jumped to her feet, the motion toppling her chair. </p><p>I waved my hand to block the noise just as she processed the identity of her intruder. “Byron, you scared me,” she whispered in a throaty tone, though she was greatly mistaken if that worked as an admonishment. </p><p>It wasn’t just that her tone was unintentionally sexy, but the way her chest rose with each breath, pushing the chest area of the dress to the limit, significantly straining it to the limit. </p><p>“Take that as a reminder that you should be more careful about your surroundings, sweetie,” I answered, and she frowned. “I’m very fond of you. I don’t want to lose you to a political accident.” And just like that, her frown turned into a shy smile, showing that even my reluctant admittance was enough to salve her earlier concerns. </p><p>She said nothing as she walked hurriedly toward me. I opened my arms invitingly, though my gaze was on the way her assets had been dancing. In her dress, she seemed to also skip wearing underwear, which increased the impact of her hurried walk significantly. </p><p>Then, she hugged me tightly. “I missed you,” she whispered. “Where have you been?” </p><p>“Sorry about that,” I answered as she buried her head in my neck, and paused a moment to enjoy the warm sensation. “There had been a little situation with the mysterious enemy that we’re facing, but I managed to get a handle on it,” I said.</p><p>She didn’t ask any follow-up questions, contending to limit herself to what I gave, once again showing she was not really suited as a ruler, but as a healer. Oh, she tried to work, certainly, as the passion she attacked the paperwork showed, but unfortunately, the real challenge came from the awareness to handle everything that was around the throne… </p><p>And she lacked that. </p><p>She was really lucky that I was very fond of her, enough to make sure I would keep her safe even if she surprised me by choosing to become the Queen — as she showed no true desire toward that direction. </p><p>Either way, those questions took the backseat when she raised her head a bit more and caught my lips in a searing kiss, delivering a beautiful, heated embrace as her tongue danced into my mouth, creating a beautiful flicker. </p><p>I pulled back after a moment, examining her face, even lovelier in such close quarters. The lack of makeup was nothing against her natural beauty, the soft lights of the room dancing on her skin more than enough to compensate when combined with her growing blush as she felt the tickling of shyness. </p><p>The fact that she could feel shy after a kiss despite everything we had done was another amazing yet entertaining detail. </p><p>“What? Is there anything on my face?” She whispered. </p><p>“Nothing, you’re perfect,” I answered even as I dragged my finger on her lip, making her shiver. She said nothing, just blushing as her lips parted invitingly. </p><p>She just shivered under my touch. I hummed as my lips pressed against her, enjoying their delicate softness once again, the repeated exposure doing nothing to blunt the pleasure I was getting from it. </p><p>Her tongue jumped out, quick to respond, and soon our tongues battled. </p><p>“Delicious,” I whispered for a break, then kissed her again. This time, she was even more active, but her body reacted by trembling more and more passionately, flushed and nervous. My tongue probed her lips and she accepted my invasion, wholeheartedly surrendering. </p><p>I let the kiss extend far more than my usual habits, enjoying her response. She was an interesting mixture of obedience, desire, and innocence, no kiss too long to enjoy such a mixture. </p><p>“So, did you miss me?” I whispered into her ear once we pulled away once more, but she didn’t let me take a step back, her arms tightly wrapped around my chest, showing that her passiveness was nowhere to be seen when it was time to secure what was important to her. </p><p>“What a silly question,” she whispered as she left a soft kiss on my cheek, an innocent yet impactful move. “Do you want me to show you?” </p><p>“Will I be surprised by the way you show me?” I whispered. </p><p>“Maybe,” she answered, though her mischievous smile was very promising. I nodded, allowing her to do whatever she had in mind to do. I let her take control, and she pushed me back, which would have been sad… </p><p>If she hadn’t immediately followed herself, squashing my body between hers and the wall. She pressed my shoulders down, and I decided to follow her, curious just how far she would push. </p><p>The answer, as it turned out, was not too much. She just buried my face in her cleavage, which had got bigger at one point as a couple buttons had popped off while we had been having fun, even without pushing things for more. </p><p>Then just as things were about to reach a fun point, I noticed footsteps getting closer. The maid. She didn’t have particularly soft steps, but Aria seemed to be unaware of that approach. I tried to raise my head, yet she pushed down, keeping me in her cleavage. </p><p>I smiled into her breasts. If she didn’t want to allow me to speak, then she could deal with the maid. And, it would be another lesson about maintaining decent situational awareness. </p><p>Or maybe not. I needed to make a decision… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Even with my disguise, I didn’t approach the building directly, but paused a bit at first to walk around the structure that was the residence of our spy that was also moonlighting as our newest quarterback, taking note of the security cameras. </p><p>I identified several.  Some were the same cheap model that was used by our college, while others were small and sleek, not to mention impossible to detect without my unique advantages — which further confirmed Arthur was up to no good. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, it didn’t take long for me to catch a mistake. He had installed his own cameras based on a security scheme, to cover the gaps of the existing cameras, probably tapping into their feed during operation. </p><p>And the school staff didn’t really care enough about security maintenance, so one of the cameras rotating slower than their supposed speed, giving me a short window to dash and climb to the first floor. A hard climb to an ordinary person, but not for me, not even without my traits. </p><p>I waited until the corridor I was targeting had no signs of movement before I rushed forward, and climbed up the stairs. A short, horizontal climb later, I was on the first floor safely. A quick glance confirmed that Arthur’s security measures didn’t extend to the interior of the first floor — another mistake — and I started moving forward. </p><p>My destination, was the third floor, where records showed his room to be. I did my best to reduce my presence as I walked, keeping my head down to prevent anyone from noticing — luckily, most were already out in the bars at this hour. </p><p>And the poor, cheap lighting of the corridors certainly helped. </p><p>I kept my focus on my surroundings as I moved forward. I didn’t expect to have much trouble, and Arthur looked like he was operating alone. And even if that was incorrect, the prospect of getting caught wasn’t scary, not after I had already revealed myself to that German professor earlier the day. </p><p>I was expecting that German professor to have some kind of link to Arthur —  their appearance was too coincidental otherwise — and even if didn’t, I had no hope of hiding my extraordinary rise, not with their attention already on the football team — and the mysterious disappearance of Coach Bill. </p><p>I stopped to listen when I reached the stairs. They were empty. Then, I checked to see if there were any security cameras. </p><p>There was, but a carefully thrown stone was enough to handle that. I climbed the stairs as fast as I could without making a discernible sound. On the third floor, I carefully took a glimpse of the corridor, and I listened for any problem as I climbed up. </p><p>A quick glimpse into the corridor showed a little problem. Unlike the earlier floors, I could see several cameras, positioned to protect Arthur’s room. I frowned, a problem. I could try to access his room through one of the others, but it had other risks, especially since I didn’t have anything that would help me. </p><p>A mistake on my part, but this was just a scouting trip. I climbed down the stairs once more, but when I reached the first floor, something occurred to me. He was using the school cameras to his benefit? But how. </p><p>I wished for another mistake from him, especially since it had some convenient implications. I much preferred to compete against a ragtag group than a bunch of professionals that knew what they were doing. </p><p>I arrived in the basement, toward the server room, the camera even easier. Avoid. I was rusty when it came to picking locks, but my Traits were more than enough to compensate for it, and I used a simple piece of metal to open the door, as easily as using the key. </p><p>“Damn,” I murmured as I closed the door behind me, taking a note of the room, dusty, warm, and otherwise horrible. </p><p>Yet, around the dust, I could see some disturbance, toward the left wall, in one of the small server racks. And, behind, a little antenna, one that probably allowed connection. </p><p>I walked toward the small computer on the corner, curious if I could hack it, and what kind of security measures were there. However, as I pulled the seat, I realized it wouldn’t be too difficult. The operating system was standard and outdated, which made it extremely easy to break in. </p><p>A forced reboot, and a few system commands, and I was in. </p><p>I had access to the local network. “Now, let’s see if I can somewhat piggyback into the physical access of the device,” I said as I quickly installed several programs. The security computer was initially not connected to the Internet, which was a smart choice, but all I needed was to plug one of the idle ethernet cables to connect it to the web. </p><p>I could have used my phone as a hotspot, but that was less safe. </p><p>Using that access, I downloaded several programs to poke around the firewall, which helped that I was already familiar with the programs and tools the school was using for their cybersecurity — helped by the fact that they were cheap, poorly written, and installed as incompetently as one would expect from the lowest bidder. </p><p>Using that to piggyback into the little device Arthur installed, however, was significantly more difficult. It was hardly something I could do through a poor computer, so, after setting up a backdoor for my access and leaving it connected to the Internet, I left the dorm. </p><p>Backtracking my movements hadn’t been particularly difficult, even as I used the opportunity to install some programs that would continue working on accessing the device. I searched the dark web to find some information about the device, which turned out to be a specialized device, but still sold to the general public for quite a bit of money. </p><p>And, as a consequence, there was quite a bit of discussion about how to break it, and my Traits helped me to separate the wheat from the chaff. </p><p>However, I wasn’t confident about my success. A lot of the programs I had used was relying on the fact that users would keep the device mostly on factory settings, which the user manual strictly warned against. Still, I had hope. Arthur, for all the skill he displayed in other aspects, looked particularly unsuited for clandestine work, as shown by his careless approach to security cameras. </p><p>I hoped that it extended to his security protocols. </p><p>To my surprise, it actually worked just as I hoped. No problem, no delay, so that as I was moving back, I had the real-time voice feed from his cameras as well as the school cameras. He didn’t have any in his room, which was a pity, but not a big one, considering his cameras also recorded sound. </p><p>So, rather than turning back, I treated it as an audiobook, listening as he delivered a lengthy report about the medical records of one of the players that went with Coach Bill. </p><p>It was a boring discussion, just reading the exact same details that I could access through reports, but I listened, hoping that someone else would speak. If they didn’t, I would have to pay another visit, this time when he was in training, to poke around his room now that his security measures were under my control. </p><p>That turned out to be unnecessary, as barely a few minutes after I returned to my room, I heard a familiar voice interrupting him. “Enough about those inconsequential things. I want to learn more about this … Terry,” said a very familiar, accented voice. </p><p>Our dear German professor, confirming that his appearance in the tournament was not accidental.  </p><p>“I’m sorry professor, his records show nothing out of extraordinary, he’s well within the baseline.” </p><p>“Nonsense, are you blaming me for being a liar, little boy. I told you, he resisted my presence, and the way he plays chess is suspect. No one could improve as much as he could without assistance.” </p><p>Arthur was quick to answer, the panic in his tone clear, which implied Professor Argus had a higher rank in their organization. “I’m not saying that, professor, I had watched him, and it’s clear that he shows too much capability to be normal. He’s clearly one of the Touched, but I don’t know who Empowers him,” he explained.  “It’s just that his official medical records don’t show anything.” </p><p>“Can’t we force him to go to a medical check?” Argus answered. “I want to know the secrets of that little boy,”  he said, his voice menacing enough to show me that he was taking today’s defeat rather personal. </p><p>I shrugged, even as someone I didn’t recognize answered. “No, not immediately, at least. We don’t have any connection in the school.” </p><p>“Can’t we just bribe someone,” Professor said.  </p><p>“Maybe, but not yet, at least not until the match. He had simply generated too much chaos to make that a wise move.” </p><p>“All the more reason for us to be aggressive. He’s working so hard to stay on the football team, which means somehow, his handler has the ability to tap into the passion of the watchers of a full stadium full of crazed fans without being overwhelmed. It’s anything above we can do. We need to be proactive.” </p><p>“No, on the contrary, that’s a reason to stay safe. We don’t want to poke around something we don’t understand, not when it can trigger a disaster,” the unknown voice answered. </p><p>That argument went on for a bit, before Arthur interrupted. “Maybe we should try to contact Doctor Williams, she clearly has some clue about his true state—“ he said, before being cut short. </p><p>“I would never deal with that traitor,” Professor Argus suddenly interrupted, shouting, unhinged. “Never in a million years.” </p><p>“He’s disconnected. I better go calm him down. We’ll talk again, tomorrow,” the voice said.</p><p>Leaving me with a lot of interesting questions… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Even though I had a big smile on my lips as I had left the hotel — after making sure I had put Lauren into bed — due to the double success I experienced, in the tournament and in bed, my mind was already on the next set of problems. </p><p>Particularly, all the implications of the capabilities the German professor revealed. Some of those implications were strategic, showing that I wasn’t the only one that was able to use Intent to get supernatural abilities. I remembered the dismissive way my guide referred to them, waving them away as merely heroic traits. Luckily, that also implied that the System had many other capabilities. </p><p>Some of them that might even be available once I completed the repairs — hopefully during the match Sunday. </p><p>Other implications were more operational, like what their presence meant. I wanted to believe that they were not aware of my capabilities, but at this point, that was a fool’s dream. Even without my relatively impressive performance during the match, their presence meant that they were targeting me. </p><p>Coach Bill’s and the other players’ suspicious disappearance just confirmed it. </p><p>Luckily, that was not all negative. I had managed to get a full view of the German Professor’s trick to empower himself by using his student as an intermediary, and, if push came to shove, I could always convince any possible observer that I was using the team for a similar purpose. </p><p>“More importantly, is it possible to empower them using the system,” I found myself asking. The trick Professor Argus had pulled to enhance the capabilities of his student temporarily was just the thing I needed to enhance our chances coming Sunday. </p><p>Worthy of experimenting on, though I needed to find a way not to kill my players accidentally…</p><p>Then, I noticed something on the side of the road, on a long, empty stretch between the city and the college. </p><p>“It’s your lucky day, little friend,” I muttered even as I pressed the brakes hard. The reason, a small tortoise, wounded with a cracked shell, my enhanced perception was the only reason for me not to mistake it for dead. </p><p>I much preferred to beat up humans than to hurt an animal, but since the tortoise was too far gone to be helped by a veterinary even if I hurried up, I didn’t feel particularly guilty. </p><p>That didn’t mean I was careless, of course. I had laid an array of ten stones in front of me, trying to channel Intent through the trait of Recovery to each one of them, flooding them hard until they cracked. Did it waste some intent, yes, but it was a drop compared to what I had received during the tournament? Even the after-effects were enough to support that. </p><p>“Pray for me, little buddy,” I said with a teasing tone. After all, what my angelic guide was insisting was correct, I was supposed to get strong until I could become a god… </p><p>I put my finger on its head, and channeled Recovery-Intent, far more carefully than I had been doing earlier. For a moment, I had thought it to be a failure even as I held the little beast, barely bigger than my hand, but then, one of its — his, I corrected myself, as I started to get a better sense of his body under the constant flow of Intent — little limbs twitched. </p><p>“Not bad,” I thought as I stopped the flood of the Intent, and the connection ceased, the signs of life it was displaying started to fade once more. The smart thing was to just dump him to the side now that the experiment concluded successfully…</p><p>But too cruel, even for me. </p><p>“It’s your lucky day, little buddy, not every animal is lucky to be get treated by a god,” I decided as I dug some paper from the trunk and spread them on the passenger seat, and put the turtle there. </p><p>The rest of the distance, I drove much slower, a finger on his little head as I continuously flooded him with Intent to trigger his recovery — which worked even better than I had expected, his wounds disappearing at a speed visible to the naked eye. At one point, I even had to stop and fix his shell to prevent it from recovering crookedly. </p><p>When I arrived at my dorm, the little beast was already scampering back and forth with a speed and attitude that was very uncharacteristic for a tortoise, but considering the was pulled from the gates of death, a little change was understandable. </p><p>I placed him in the bushes that were at a distance from the dorm, far enough that no student would come and annoy him. </p><p>Unfortunately, the moment I put him down, he started scampering around, searching for something desperately. Food, a realization hit me. He had shown a remarkable recovery, but even with the magic, that had to come from somewhere. </p><p>“You’re lucky that I like animals more than I like people,” I muttered as I grabbed him and brought him to my room. </p><p>Luckily, even with everything that was going on, the delivery of the meals didn’t stop. I put him into a large box, and dumped all the fruits and vegetables that came with today's meal, and the ones that remained from yesterday. </p><p>Then, after one last intense wave of Recovery-Intent to make sure no internal bleeding or something similar remained — hopefully, as I was hardly a veterinarian — I moved to my computer. I had to finish drawing tactics for Sunday’s game and start practicing, but that was not the most urgent task he currently had. </p><p>The most urgent task was to understand where his little spy had come from. </p><p>Tapping into the student records didn’t take long. After all, I had the same access that the coach had, which included the current address of every player. Arthur turned out to be living in a dorm on the other side of the campus. </p><p>Luckily, there was a library near, giving me an excuse to drive there — though I made sure to flood my temporary pet with another flood of recovery intent, to prevent any complication that might happen. </p><p>If I had the time, I wouldn’t have taken my car and instead preferred to walk — the less attention it generated, the better. Unfortunately, I was facing a rather tight timeline, and I couldn’t spend hours going back and forth across the huge campus. </p><p>Instead, I made sure to pack a couple hoodies and other changes of clothing into a small bag that looked like it was holding books. </p><p>The library wasn’t crowded — studying had always been … optional … in Sunset College — but still, my approach had been documented by more than one student, taking my photos to share. I had no doubt that only very few were actually here to study, while most treated the place as a free alternative as a bar where they could hang out with their buddies. </p><p>Especially at this late hour. </p><p>“Hey, I still need to study as well,” I said to one of the cameras with a shrug, giving a confident smile. “Especially since I need to make sure they don’t use my grades as an excuse and kick me out,” I added, which earned appreciative laughter from the crowd. </p><p>Pandering to them was not exactly fun, but after everything that happened today, I was certain at least one of those videos would go viral, and I didn’t want to look bad before the dean’s fate was determined one way or another. </p><p>I didn’t want to give him anything he could actually use against me. </p><p>Most students stayed away from me, my reputation suitably effective to keep them away, but some were still brave enough to walk toward me. </p><p>I treated them as volunteers for another round of experimentation, blasting them with a small Wave of Intent, channeled through the Intimidation trait, copying the other trick of the German Professor. </p><p>Their frozen faces suggested that they might have actually experienced a heart attack — luckily I had already experimented with Recovery as well. </p><p>In the library, I took a few quick turns and slipped into a small room with no security camera. A minute later, I had left, completely different. </p><p>Most people had misunderstandings about disguises, thinking that it required elaborate makeup and even more elaborate props, while, most of the time, just a simple change of clothing was enough as long as it was paired with a change of posture.</p><p>A little trick I had leveraged many times back on the streets, especially the short period I lived as a pickpocket — before growing up realizing that was a horrible career choice, high-risk and low-reward. Still, the skills I had picked then were still in place, enhanced further by my Traits… </p><p>No one cared about another hooded nerd with a bad posture and trembling gait leaving the library. </p>",

    "content": "<p>For a while, I didn’t intervene with Ida’s transparent excuse, letting her do as he wished, content in pushing inside her repeatedly to push her ever closer to her orgasm, though not as recklessly to bring that immediately. </p><p>The moment was too beautiful not to savor. </p><p>As time passed, Ida’s transparent excuse started to get even more see-through, to the point of being invisible, fully revealing the intent behind it. I chuckled even as she stopped paying attention to her pictures, and her free hand started to linger down, landing on Carrie’s breasts. </p><p>She squeezed aggressively, showing that I wasn’t the only one that was fascinated with the great expanse of her bosom. Carrie moaned helplessly, her words destroyed by her makeshift gag. After all, not only her breasts were spectacular, but also extremely sensitive. </p><p>Combined with her helpless state, it was no wonder she was being driven crazy. However, unable to say anything, the best she could do was to squirm as Ida twisted her nipples recklessly, triggering a beautiful mixture of pain and pleasure in her. </p><p>“It’s unfair,” I suddenly whispered. </p><p>“What’s unfair?” Ida asked in a scathing tone. “She’s the one that arranged everything, and sacrificed her friends one by one to your horrible appetite,” Ida commented. Her words were not wrong, technically, but the way she was rocking her hips as I invaded her core repeatedly took a lot of impact from the words that were hidden in her tone. </p><p>So much for my horrible appetite. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, I’m not talking about her, I’m talking about you,” I whispered into her ear, the position allowing it so. Though, I make sure to keep my tone loud enough for Carrie to hear, who stopped her shuffling for a moment. </p><p>No doubt recognize my mischievous tone. </p><p>“And what are you talking about?” </p><p>“Well, I was thinking that it was unfair for you to distract yourself by trying to do two things, rather than just focusing on punishing Carrie. </p><p>Her eyes widened, even bigger than they did when I had invaded her whole being for the first time. “Wait —“ she ordered, sharp, but that was a mistake. Before she could tighten her grip on her camera, I pulled it off her fingers, and unhooked it from her neck. </p><p>“Much better,” I said, smiling at her solitary word, interrupted the moment I had pulled it off her fingers, enjoying the way her words had disappeared into a panicked gasp, her earlier confidence melting faster than an ice cube dipped into lava. </p><p>She pulled her hand away from Carrie’s body, like it was made of the same lava. Carrie chuckled, her gag unable to suppress that particular sound, her body rocking softly. </p><p>Ida opened her lips, but no words were forthcoming. Not that I cared much, as at this point, her mouth had many more important things to do. She shouldn’t exhaust herself by trying to form words. I leaned to capture her lips, one hand around still around her waist to keep her in place. </p><p>“Try to hold onto something, sweetie,” I ordered, making her eyes widen. Yet, at this point, with her shattering confidence and her mind blanked with pleasure, she had no choice but to follow my orders. </p><p>And, the only thing she could hold on to at our current position was Carrie. </p><p>She still managed to do it as safely as she could manage, and put both hands on Carrie’s shoulders. “Good,” I said. “But let’s make sure Carrie could communicate her problems,” I added, and reached. </p><p>“Noo…” Ida whispered softly, but that was all she was able to say before I pulled off Carrie’s makeshift gag and threw it to the side. </p><p>“Finally,” Carrie murmured, her beautiful lips curling into a smile. Ida just trembled. Amusing that Carrie, still blindfolded and her body wrapped in ropes, radiated an aura of control much stronger than Ida, who was currently busy panicking. </p><p>Since Ida showed no intention of answering, I decided to use her pretty mouth for a more useful purpose. I sealed her lips with mine even as I shifted, forcing her to rely on Carrie to maintain balance. “Wow, it sounds like fun,” Carrie commented, interrupting the sound of our hips slamming loudly, filling the house with our sound. </p><p>“Oh, believe me, it is,” I answered as I pulled back for a breather, while Ida just let out a panicked yelp. “Don’t you think, sweetie?” I asked as I slapped her ass. </p><p>“It’s … not fair,” she murmured at the slap. </p><p>“Exactly, it’s not fair to keep her bound and blindfolded, Chad,” Carrie said, somehow managing to sound sarcastic and erotic at the same time, which was not a simple achievement. “Oh, wait…” </p><p>Ida moaned in shame, and I took over, not stopping invading her core even for a moment. “You know that she’s not wrong, right?” I said with a serious tone, like I was negotiating peace rather than banging her naked body ceaselessly. “You were the one that tied her down helplessly to fulfill your own professional objectives. It’s not fair for you to suddenly start talking about fairness.” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered. “But this is too much,” she continued. </p><p>“Really, maybe we should ask Carrie,” I said as I grabbed her blindfold, and tugged it free in a smooth move, giving her her vision back. </p><p>Her gaze was sexy and bright as she pinned Ida down, who failed to say anything as she came face to face with her model. A nicer man might have stopped his movements to give Ida a chance to recover. </p><p>But then, a nicer man wouldn’t have been in my position, invading her whole being in front of one of her best friends, a friend that Ida had been photographing in bondage before — and after — my arrival. </p><p>“Carrie, sweetie, do you mind helping me to silence her,” I whispered as I pushed forward with more strength. One advantage, I finally buried myself fully in her, triggering a spectacular cry that told me her climax wasn’t too far away — and would arrive in a spectacular manner — but that wasn’t the biggest advantage. </p><p>No, the biggest advantage was that it disrupted Ida’s balance, so rather than relying on grabbing Carrie’s shoulders and maintaining as much distance as possible, her arms wrapped around Carrie’s neck. </p><p>With the effect of bringing their lips to close. </p><p>An opportunity that Carrie took instantly, with more passion than I expected her to take, suggesting that her voyeurism kink wasn’t the only surprise she was holding for me. A twist of her neck was enough to close the distance, her tongue invading Ida’s mouth. </p><p>My presence prevented Ida’s retreat, keeping her in place. Not that she had the confidence to pull back from the kiss. </p><p>Or likely, the intent as well. I remembered just how distracted she was while playing with Carrie’s tits, and the sudden tightening in her core was just another clue she wasn’t against Carrie’s choice. </p><p>Such an interesting group of friends, I thought as I continued my beautiful, scandalous task of giving Ida her first explosive climax, her tits dangling freely with each push, the angle working perfectly to enhance the effect. </p><p>“Pity I can’t pay her back,” Carrie murmured as she pulled back, glancing down to her breasts, still carrying a few red welts. </p><p>Remains of Ida’s earlier burst of courage. </p><p>“Too bad you won’t have another chance,” I said mockingly. </p><p>“Right,” Carrie chuckled back at my reminder that there would be many other opportunities to actually push forward and to the more and more fun stuff. </p><p>I tightened my grip around Ida’s waist, invading her core. “This is … not fair,” Ida murmured, the extent of her complaints. </p><p>“Oh, really? Maybe we should stop. I wouldn’t want to put you in a situation you don’t want,” I asked with a beautiful chuckle, giving her a chance to reject the invasion of pleasure without actually creating a comprehensive structure.  </p><p>“No!” she gasped in shock, her voice loud for the first time since I had taken her camera away. </p><p>“Really? Maybe —“ I started, only to be interrupted again. </p><p>“No!” she gasped again, showing how desperate she was not to stop without finding her release. I looked into Carrie’s eyes, and met with a mixture of mirth and amusement. </p><p>“Well, if you feel so strongly,” I whispered even as I picked up speed.  Her legs wrapped around my waist despite the difficult angle, doing her best to assist my assault. </p><p>I impaled her again and again, her moans getting louder with each repeat, soon forcing Carrie to kiss her just to suppress her sound. Though, the speed she leaned suggested that it wasn’t exactly a great difficulty. </p><p>With her arms still tightly around Carrie’s neck, one of my hands was free to explore her body recklessly, without stopping even for a second. “Such a beautiful friendship,” I said with a mocking tone even as I grabbed Ida’s breasts, which might be smaller than Carrie’s, but still amazingly beautiful. </p><p>Ida tightened around my length, the special kind that showed she finally hit her limit. The length she was able to resist had been surprising, but I was willing to guess that it was more about the extended cosplay adventure we shared with Irene. </p><p>I said nothing, just pausing for a moment to feel her tightening, though I had to grab her waist to prevent her from collapsing;  unlike her arms, the grip of her arms had been weakening significantly. </p><p>Accompanied by a delirious, exhausted moan to follow her explosive cries… </p><p>“It seems that our great photographer is finally exhausted,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Yes,” I said as I looked at Carrie, doing nothing to hide my arousal. “It seems that way…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>I pulled Seldanna underground even as the cheers exploded on the surface, celebrating their victory, unaware that just how close to disaster they were after their spectacularly bad intervention. I kept my attention on the surface, dealing with the nearby undead scouts, but not even for a second I believed that I was able to deal with all of them — or even a significant minority of them. </p><p>The attack was too calculated for them to just have a few observers close in, and the explosion itself was too spectacular to be missed. My best hope was to hide the details of the victory. </p><p>However, as I pulled back, I noticed another interesting thing. </p><p>Small particles of Divine Spark, flew toward my victorious priestess, just like the forest had been receiving them constantly. However, her current Divine Spark wasn’t reacting as I had expected. </p><p>With the tree, the reaction had been simple. Then it was weak, the sparks were absorbed violently into its tiny collection of Divine Spark, like trying to add more coal to a fledging fire, about to extinguish. Only my intervention kept the tree alive and absorb the energy smoothly. But, as it started to get stronger and stronger, the absorption capabilities turned much more substantial.</p><p>At this point, I didn’t need to intervene to help it absorb. </p><p>Yet, with Seldanna, it was different. Rather than being absorbed by her Divine Sea — which I decided to temporarily name — they floated around like fireflies, with no intention of merging. As if she was pushing them away. </p><p>No wonder there were no notifications warning about the absorption. </p><p>I watched as those sparks danced around her magical presence, not going away, yet not merging. Curious, I let that continue even as I turned my attention inward, putting the gift from the undead to work. </p><p>{-302 Divine Spark}</p><p>{+3 Perception}</p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured as I enjoyed the difference the increased stats were made, enough to trigger a significant difference in my senses. It helped that I was getting more proficient in assigning stats, allowing me to extend the difference between them somewhat. </p><p>With my enhanced perception, I could see that what was going on was not a simple issue. Somehow, the layer around her Divine Sea was rejecting the infusion of the spark, like a magnet pushing different polarity. </p><p>Maybe it was like the difference between having and not having Sapience, maybe it was something completely different. I lacked the information to understand it. </p><p>Luckily, I thought as I cast the spell to awaken her. I had sufficient time to assess that.</p><p>“Where am I —“ she gasped before she raised her head and looked at me. “What happened in the battle.” </p><p>“We’ll talk about that in a moment, but to not push you too much, the battle is completed successfully, with no loss,” I explained to her as I caught her gaze. “Now, tell me your biggest mistake.” </p><p>“My … mistake,” she muttered. </p><p>“Well, I was forced to intervene against an enemy you should have been able to handle alone, so there was clearly a mistake,” I said, and to her shocked expression, I continued. “There’s no guarantee that I will be here able to help you during the next battle,” I suggested. </p><p>“You’re leaving,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Not yet, but ultimately, that’s on the table,” I reminded her. “But not immediately, and not until I’m sure that we’re secure here,” I said, and she relaxed. “Unless there’s an emergency,” I added, and she was tense once again. </p><p>“Then, what?” she said. </p><p>“We don’t know about the scale of the next attack,” I admitted. “I’m sure that that beast was an attempt of last resort, but not from their leader. I’m sure they are much stronger. No, this was the last resort from the unlucky lich they tasked to defeat and secure the borders before they could move inland.” </p><p>“And now, their true elites will arrive,” she gasped, afraid. “Maybe we should send another courier to the other tribes. Maybe they would come.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about that, they’ll arrive,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“They didn’t, at least not yet. What changed.” </p><p>“Well, two things. First, we’re able to defend this spot far longer than anyone could expect, even though they abandoned it as a sacrifice,” I explained, doing my best to frame their lack of attention as negative — not that I needed to work hard for that with their all historical baggage. </p><p>“And second?” she asked. </p><p>“Second, I’m sure that the spectacular explosion would be more decisive than any message we can send. It’s proof that we’re standing here, with more power than they expect. And if there’s one thing the rulers don’t like, it was the others gaining the same power.” </p><p>“We don’t have a ruler,” Seldanna declared decisively, yet with her pretty face, it came across as petulance. “Tribes are independent of whatever they have there, even if they dare to name it as the capital.” </p><p>“Sure,” I answered. “But are you sure they would answer the same if I asked them?” I countered, and she fell silent. “Exactly,” I said with a chuckle. “But enough about that. Let’s go back to the question. What was your mistake?”</p><p>“My … mistake,” she whispered. “I wasn’t very familiar with my power,” she said. </p><p>“No, that was just something forced by the circumstances, that’s not your mistake,” I corrected her. </p><p>“Then, what was it?” she asked hesitantly. </p><p>“You pushed yourself too much, trying to protect stupid people against their own mistakes. You have already ordered them to retreat, but they ignored your order and did something incredibly stupid. You can’t risk everything to protect them. Not when it was at the risk of killing anyone.” </p><p>She ducked her head shyly. </p><p>I chuckled. “But you knew that, didn’t you,” I asked, and she just nodded hesitantly. “But you did it anyway, because you knew that I was there to protect you…” I continued, and she nodded again, blushing even more. </p><p>“Naughty…” I said with a chuckle, letting my voice earn a throaty tone as she shivered. “Such a naughty move, using me, are you willing to pay the price, then?” </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, which came much quicker than I expected, making me shiver in anticipation. “Yes, I am…” </p><p>It seemed that I wasn’t the only one that was frustrated by our massage being interrupted halfway. “Good, first, your punishment,” I said, and patted my lap. “Come here.” </p><p>“Punishment…” she gasped, surprised, but that surprise didn’t prevent her from walking forward steadily until she stood in front of me. </p><p>“Now, lay on my lap,” I whispered, my tone suggestive. She shivered, but the arousal in her eyes was unmistakable. Not that I blamed her. I was not only her savior, but also my massage skills were spectacular. </p><p>“Well, you’re the … leader,” she whispered as she followed my direction and lay on my lap, her robe thick enough to cut the feeling significantly, even as I put my hand on her back. “Are you —“ she started, only to be interrupted by a gasp.</p><p> A gasp came after my hand landed on her hips.</p><p>“Am I … what?” I asked with a chuckle as I raised my hand and landed on her bottom. </p><p>“That punishment,” she gasped. “Maybe something else…” she whispered, managing to sound throaty as she did so. </p><p>“Something like what?” I said as I chuckled, acting like I didn’t understand what she was leading toward. It wasn’t believable, of course, but she was too shy to point that out. Instead, her eyes fell on the floor demurely. </p><p>The next spank landed, and her chin clenched as she tried to keep her moan in. Which wasn’t too difficult, as my spanks were more playful than painful, and her thick robe further blocked the pain. “I …” she whispered, but that was all she was able to say. </p><p>“Well, since you can speak, the punishment is clearly not effective,” I said with a chuckle, and grabbed her robe. “I should work hard to dissuade you from such dangerous gambits.” </p><p>She said nothing for a while, losing herself in the sensation as I slowly pulled her robe up, slowly revealing her beautiful legs to my view, with curves to die for. “Thank you,” she managed to say as the robe continued to climb, which surprised me. “You’re a very selfless hero.” </p><p>After a week, I must have made an even greater impression. </p><p>“I am a hero, right,” I said with a chuckle, though it was certainly not inaccurate. After all, I was doing most of it as a mixture of powering myself up and experimenting on Divine Spark, but that didn’t change the fact that I was their savior. </p><p>And, from her perspective, I did so selflessly, without even revealing myself, letting her take all the credit. </p><p>Not to mention, empowering her in the process. </p><p>She was ready to reward me for it, if her silence as I slowly peeled up her robe was any indicator, revealing her surprisingly perky ass considering the plumpness of her hips… </p><p>It was going to be fun, I decided as I spanked her ass once more, this time only her underwear to block my touch… </p><p>Her moan was simply beautiful… </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7352}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>If there was one disadvantage of great planning before the battle, it was boredom… </p><p>I used the great number of magical detection wards I had spread underground to get a real-time view of the battle. As I predicted, the zombies were attacking from the wings, rushing in with a recklessness that was exaggerated even for disposable corpses of undead beings. </p><p>Some of the elven archers panicked at the unexpected strategy, but the numbers were simply too far apart for it to make any difference, especially with nature mana filling the forests to the brim, both allowing them to cast much stronger spells, and giving them a natural barrier to weaken any undead spell before they were even cast. </p><p>However, soon, the reaction of the elves disappointed me. They reacted to the attack rather more obviously than I expected, splitting into two to meet with the attack, and left the center almost completely empty. </p><p>I wasn’t afraid of the consequences, as I had already arranged for Seldanna to stay in the middle, ready to defend against the trap, but it was annoying to see elves not only missing the trap, but also reacting to it exaggeratedly. </p><p>They were excellent archers and decent mages in their sphere … but their tactical acumen was nonexistent. </p><p>A topic for the future, I decided as I continued to watch the assault. Five minutes into the intense assault, I finally noticed a stirring in the middle… </p><p>And the monster came strolling in. I didn’t recognize the monster. It looked like a dragon, but with many weird changes on its body. Whether the beast had been a natural chimera when it was alive, or had been adjusted by the necromancers to create a very effective battering ram was a mystery. </p><p>But, since the battle was enough to distract the elves, I used the tree-elevator to go to the surface as well. I wanted to watch the battle with my own eyes, though more as a leisure activity than an actual need. With my Divine Spark-infused forest as my focus, my magical senses were much more useful than my eyes to catch anything extraordinary. </p><p>I just wanted to watch Seldanna throwing down against the great monstrosity. </p><p>Though, I had to admit, the monster rather looked intimidating to the naked eye. A hulking beast, a hundred feet tall and five hundred feet long, it was already scary enough without its skeletal dragon head open, displaying its teeth, each bigger than a sword. </p><p>Even at a distance, its roar was dangerous, radiating a huge flood of focused necrotic energy, an ugly facsimile of a dragon’s breath, the thickness of the necrotic energy intense enough to cut through the passive shield of the nature mana. </p><p>That was far from the full extent of the defenses I had created, but I was deliberately keeping them hidden — ready to appear only in case of mortal danger — as I let my beautiful priestess a chance to shine. </p><p>And, shine she did. “You dare!” she shouted as she raised her hands to the sky, and the mana that surrounded her answered, touching a little seed — one that turned into a huge tree to block the necrotic flood, absorbing it to its structure, rotting as the necrotic mana clashed with nature mana.  </p><p>But, the elves surrounding Seldanna survived, looking at her with shock as she casually rewrote what was possible to do with nature magic. Understandable, as the strongest elf that visited the forest barely had five points of Divine Spark locked in Chosen form, limiting both their output and their control significantly. </p><p>What Seldanna did in a second, a coven barely replicate in a minute.</p><p>However, that only made the monster pause for a moment before it continued charging. Seldanne rushed forward as well, doing her best to meet with the monster without it could reach the first guardian tree at the perimeter. </p><p>She didn’t know that it didn’t matter to actually defend them and I could pull back its energy and spread along the other trees  — though, considering the cultural importance of the guardian trees, I doubted that it would have mattered in the first place. She would have still done her best to defend them. </p><p>If there was one thing she was, she was earnest in her desire to defend the land.  </p><p>The monster charged forward, uncaring of the small figure that it could easily squash standing in front of the first guardian tree — which was enough to confirm its lack of intelligence, and also confirmed that there was no necromancer that was directly controlling it. </p><p>Interesting choice, I decided as I stretched a little mana stream inside the beast. Ordinarily, using mana for diagnostics would have been very difficult from such a great distance, but another advantage of the forest was that I could manipulate mana in the forest almost as well as if I were standing next to the beast.</p><p>Surprisingly, the moment it slipped into the beast, I lost control of the mana, like it was lost to a raging tornado. </p><p>Interesting, I thought, and rather than pushing, I waited for an opportunity. </p><p>It arrived soon after. Seldanna cast a spell, and a horde of roots exploded from the ground, wrapping around the limbs of the beast. A single root was weak enough not to slow the beast down, but hundreds of magically-enhanced roots were enough to stop it momentarily. </p><p>And gave me an excuse to slip a much more invasive probe. </p><p>[-183 Mana]</p><p>“No wonder it disappeared instantly,” I murmured as I felt the mana disappear into the beast. Inside the beast, there was a chaotic dance of mana going on, and not just necrotic mana. I could sense different types of mana, each swirling in a different body part. The necrotic mana and nature mana were the most prominent ones, but occasionally, I could sense other types of energy as well. </p><p>Purer mana that reminded me of Janelor at the head of the dragon, arcana mana that radiated from a weird-shaped grafted wing, some purer healing energy coming from a shell … and some other energies that I could barely recognize. </p><p>Each of them was contained by a crystal that was buried in the middle, one that was containing a crystal filled with Necrotic Spark, and one that clearly contained more than a hundred points of Divine Spark. </p><p>No wonder no necromancers were actually defending it. It was not a vanguard, but an explosive trap, and the creature was just there to isolate the different types of mana as they brought it deeper into the center. </p><p>An interesting gambit. In its nature, it was very easy to defeat the beast, just immobilize it and push it away, and watch it destabilize as the different types of mana started to react violently. With no necromancers controlling it — no doubt afraid of the backlash, a phenomenon I flirted with during my own attempts of mixing energies — it was almost trivial for an accomplished mage. </p><p>Yet, that required a reasonable tactical response, which the elves were lacking significantly. As the beast appeared in the center, most of the elves rushed toward it in panic, arrows flying desperately as they wanted to take down the beast before it could reach the first tree. </p><p>Arrows themselves weren’t a threat against any undead, but the nature mana these arrows delivered was a different thing. It started to infuse the beast, triggering its chaos. The beast pushed to move forward as its mana started to destabilize, but the hold of the roots was too strong for it to move. </p><p>A fact that the few necromancers that were a part of the army didn’t miss, and aimed their spells at the roots that were holding the beast in place, the necrotic energy enough to destroy them. </p><p>I could have intervened to keep the roots, but instead, I decided to let them snap, curious how Seldanna would react. </p><p>My aims were twofold. I wanted to test her tactical understanding of the situation — as we had many discussions about magic and its strategic applications for the last week — and I wanted to give her an opportunity to display her true power in front of the other tribes. </p><p>I didn’t miss that more than one was grumbling about her authority, and a little reminder about true power wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>For the first attack, Seldanna attacked the beast directly with several spells, trying to take it down as quickly as possible, but a flare of mana made her realize something was wrong. </p><p>“Get away, and continue protecting the edges, something is wrong,” Seldanna ordered them, shouting as loudly as she could manage, but even with her incredible displays of magic, not all elves listened to her orders. </p><p>The majority listened, but a significant minority did not — and some I recognized as the latest arrivals, and the guardian trees they brought along were right at the edge, risking destruction. </p><p>As far as disobedience went, it was not a terrible reason, but that didn’t change the fact that it made Saldenna’s next move extremely difficult. She started casting two spells at the same, another horde of roots to pin the beast in place, and a wide shield that would not only protect her, but also the elves that surrounded the monster, some stupid enough to try and flank the beast. </p><p>Their presence made Seldanna’s job much more difficult. Creating a half-circle shield was relatively easy, because it only needed to deflect the explosion, leaving it to spread to the other side. It was not trivial by any means, but it was still doable for her after the power-up, even with the roots taking some of her attention. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same didn’t apply to a full shield, especially when she made the mistake of covering the top and making a half-circle, impossible to contain. And, ironically, even if it did, there would have been only one direction for Necrotic Spark to escape; underground, and it would have damaged the forest just as much. </p><p>Luckily, I was there to help her. Just as the explosion was triggered, I took control of her shield, opening a gap at the top to channel the explosion away safely, while reinforcing the ground to avoid disaster from there. </p><p>{-2949 Mana}</p><p>Right in time, as the explosion happened hard enough to imitate an earthquake. I watched as Seldanna collapsed due to exhaustion, pushing herself to the limit to reinforce the shield, which showed she was too distracted to actually notice I had taken over the shield. </p><p>The elves rushed toward her, some in panic, but even from a distance, I could sense several of them had some bad motives — one even had his knife out already — showing that generations of tribal hatred weren’t just gone, but simmering underneath. </p><p>“How fun,” I muttered sarcastically even as I cast a spell, and roots appeared around Seldanna and pulled her into the ground. Since I had such a convenient excuse to intervene, I just did so. </p><p>Luckily, I was able to steal most of the Divine Spark the necromancers hid in the beast, making it not only a beautiful teaching moment, but also profitable. </p><p>{+192 Divine Spark}</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 9</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 712}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7352}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",
