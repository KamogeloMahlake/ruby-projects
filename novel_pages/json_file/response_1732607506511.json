    "content": "<p>Isolde’s departure left me feeling dissatisfied despite my climax, mostly due to how it was attained. It felt good to finally set up some kind of accord with Isolde, the last remaining member of my immediate captors —the ones relevant to my pleasure. </p><p>I spent my time free of my chains, using magic to clean up the mess I created, as well as practicing a couple of difficult wards. Setting up wards was one of my weaker areas. I had the knowledge, and I had the skills, but I lacked the practice, because most of the time, the wards I used required a team to establish, and in such cases, I naturally observed from afar to make sure it worked correctly, but usually not involving magically. </p><p>My lack of practical experience wouldn’t be too back if it wasn’t for my relative lack of mobility, and my need to stay concealed, which removed a great number of my preferred actions from the list. It was boring to practice, though necessary. </p><p>I was barely able to practice for half an hour, when I felt the alarm ward at the entrance trigger once more. I chained myself once more, not knowing the identity of the visitor. Being caught by Lancelot of the Queen out of the chains was a complication I didn’t need right now. </p><p>Luckily, the door opened, and revealed a much more welcome figure. “Good morning, Princess,” I called, smiling widely. </p><p>“G-good morning,” Aria answered, but she froze at the entrance, unable to walk forward. She was wearing a cute green dress today, which, unfortunately, was bulky enough to cover any hint of skin, even more conservative than her usual way of dressing. </p><p>“Please, come in,” I finally called after she spent a minute, frozen at the entrance, no doubt still overwhelmed by what had happened the day before. She followed my invitation, but rejected my following wordless invitation when I patted my lap. </p><p>“Byron,” she whispered, using my name, which barely a few people had used. “We need to talk,” she continued, but words struggled to leave her mouth, straining the limits of her willpower. </p><p>“Sure, Princess,” I said even as I once again got rid of my chains and stood up, using my height advantage to overwhelm her, which was all I needed to silence her. She was already a bundle of nerves, no doubt as a result of what had just happened. She took a step back as I did so, trying to maintain the distance. I repeated it, and the distance stayed the same, but the third repeat left her back pressing against the walls of my cell. I closed in the distance with slow and deliberate steps, until I was standing in front of her shivering body. “Please tell me your concerns,” I whispered even as I caressed her face, as a lover would. </p><p>From a certain perspective, I did count as one. </p><p>“W-what we did,” she managed to stammer as she tried to stand upright, overwhelmed by our proximity. </p><p>“Be more specific, Princess,” I said as I caressed her cheek, leaning forward like I was about to kiss, but not making connect, just chuckling at her parted lips. Despite her discomfort, she was clearly yearning for another touch. </p><p>“W-what had happened in the bed,” she stammered again, her blush climbing upward. </p><p>I was tempted to repeat the question, but I doubted she would be able to keep herself upright if she was forced to go more into detail. Without the effects of her arousal, she seemed to be struggling even thinking about it. “I see,” I murmured. “Are you unhappy with what had just happened, because I remember you enjoying my teachings quite a bit?” I whispered. </p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” she said. “What we did was wrong! We can’t do that again?” </p><p>“Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Because I’m going to be married,” she said. </p><p>“But you’re not married yet,” I countered, which silenced her immediately. It wasn’t a proper answer, of course. It was barely an answer, but she was too overwhelmed by our closeness to properly answer that. </p><p>“It shouldn’t -” she tried to counter, only to fell silent when I leaned forward for a kiss, my chest pressing against hers, feeling her heartbeat through the tightness. </p><p>I didn’t kiss her yet, just hovering close. “So, you’re saying that you don’t want to this anymore…” I whispered before I completed the distance, enjoying the warmth of her lips through a soft kiss, then pulled back. “Or this…” I added, this time teasing her neck. “Or this…” I said, followed by another kiss, this time aggressive enough for my tongue to invade her pretty little mouth, leaving her gasping as I pulled back. </p><p>She didn’t answer, nor that I expected her to answer. Instead, I grabbed her hand and dragged her toward my chains. I sat down and pulled her on my lap, and she complied without the slightest resistance, too confused by her own reaction. “But…” she finally murmured as she felt my hardness underneath her, and realizing her compromised position. “This is wrong.” </p><p>“Are you sure,” I whispered as I grabbed her pert ass over the skirt of her dress, squeezing gently, making her shiver once more. “Where exactly is the harm? I’m helping you to learn, we both enjoyed it immensely,” I explained, then smirked suggestively, “and you could easily heal any pesky evidence before your wedding night. It’s nothing but positives.” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she murmured, but despite her apparent reluctance, her already weak will to deny the call of pleasure was fading away decisively, leaving a passive toy behind. So, when I grabbed her chin and leaned for another kiss, she was completely obedient under the assault of my tongue. </p><p>“Excellent decision,” I whispered. “Then, why don’t you be a good girl show me you have learned your lesson well,” I said, dragging her hand to my bulge to remove any ambiguity about what I had been talking about. </p><p>“W-with my lips?” she asked, her cute blue eyes shining with shock and desire. </p><p>“Well, that’s one option, but certainly not the only one,” I reminded her, squeezing her breast at the same time, making her let out another beautiful gasp that begged me to stop our little game and push her against the wall. </p><p>Still, despite her scandalized expression, she didn’t lose much time before standing up and pulling down my pants and underwear at the same time, revealing my shaft, which was already more than half-erect thanks to the soft presence of her ass that had been pressing until a moment ago. Even more excitingly, her hands went to the chest of her dress, where a complicated knot was hiding the treasure that was her tits. </p><p>Unfortunately, after sending a hesitant gaze to the door, she let her arms fall to the side, no doubt remembering the previous time, where Emma had burst in without a warning, catching us in the middle of things. All told, a reasonable concern, so, I let her crouch down without releasing her glorious tits, even though I wanted their softness wrapped around, sharing their warmth. </p><p>However, when she leaned down to capture my length without any further prompting, it was easy to ignore that particular detail. Her fingers were soft as always as they wrapped around my length, like high-quality velvet. She was still hesitant as she leaned down and her lips touched my skin, making her shiver. When she looked up to catch my gaze in the blue depth of her eyes, I actually had to rely on my experience to keep myself from exploding. </p><p>The willing touch of the innocent Princess was simply too incredible. </p><p>She slowly caressed the base, unsure of her movements like a student that was trying to solve a problem after a long break. Still, her tongue darted out as she hesitantly started her task, walking around the ridge. “Not bad,” I murmured, moaning exaggeratedly, more to encourage her than the overwhelming pleasure from her technique.</p><p>She murmured something unintelligible. Then, her beautiful ruby lips parted, swallowing a third of my length, surprising me with her initiative. “Good girl,” I said, patting her head. </p><p>The positive reinforcement worked better than I expected. Her eyes brightened at the compliment before she pushed herself deeper on my shaft, managing to swallow almost two-thirds of it despite her gagging. The resulting pleasure was spectacular, her lips caressing the base while the crown starting to experience the tight grip of her throat. The sensation wasn’t as tight as what I had experienced the last time, where I had deep-throated her in front of Emma, but the resulting pleasure was made better by the simple fact that she was moving based on her own will. </p><p>Receiving a blowjob from her, I decided, was a spectacular experience. The way she looked up at me with her pretty blue eyes as she moved her head back and forth was certainly played a role in that, almost as much as the way her pretty little mouth felt when her lips tightened around my girth, my length disappearing in her depths. Then, it got even better. Without even prompting, she started alternating her pacing, her lips tightening further as she pulled out, creating a tightness that rivaled her virgin entrance. </p><p>“Nice instincts, you’re getting better at this,” I murmured in approval, which made her blush shyly. An interesting reaction to my words, considering she was doing her best to swallow the entirety of my length. </p><p>“You’re enjoying this as well, aren’t you?” I added, which turned her blush into an inferno. She tried to mumble an answer without removing my cock from her mouth, treating it as an excuse not to answer it, but I had no intention of letting it slide. “Answer me,” I whispered, and she shivered, but still freed her mouth. </p><p>“Maybe,” she mumbled indecisively, which, under my sharp gaze, immediately changed. “A bit,” she corrected herself, her hand still wrapped around my shaft, dancing up and down methodically. </p><p>“Come on, Princess,” I said. “There’s nothing to be ashamed of. It’s only natural to enjoy these kinds of things. As a healer, you should know that.” </p><p>She nodded, but rather than answering, she returned her task of sucking my cock, which was the tastiest method of avoidance. I chuckled, but this time, I let her get away without answering my question, not wanting to push her too much. Not that I was afraid of her pushing back, of course. My worries ran in the opposite direction, actually, that she might revert to her passive state, not wanting to push herself too much. </p><p>So, I leaned against the wall, enjoying as her blonde hair spilled on my lap as she repeatedly swallowed my shaft, getting quicker and quicker even with her swollen lips and her struggling breaths. Though, the way she was rubbing her legs against each other made the situation even sexier. </p><p>I decided to add a touch of variance, and pulled the strings of her dress, widening the front of it, finally creating a window with the view of her amazing breasts, the vision even better thanks to the beautiful angle. “You’re getting much better,” I whispered. “Trying to hold back myself from exploding is certainly difficult.” </p><p>She said nothing, as it was pointless to speak with her mouth full. Instead, she surprised me by grabbing the same strings I had loosened earlier, and pushed her dress to her waist, leaving her corset responsible for covering her modesty —and doing a bad job it. Unlike her dress, which was extremely conservative, her corset was a much more interesting piece of clothing. </p><p>It was a red and white piece that barely covered her nipples, giving me a delicious view of her areolas. It was tight, which made the top of her breasts pop out deliciously. Moreover, it looked like that a snap would have dealt with it easily, leaving her top bereft of any protection. </p><p>“Someone came prepared,” I murmured even as I reached and grabbed her breasts, mauling them over the fabric of her corset, which was surprisingly soft to touch. “You wanted this to happen, right?” </p><p>I didn’t expect, or required, an answer, as watching her gobbling my length was much more entertaining. Under her determined assault, I finally hit the limit, and my cock started throbbing. “I’m about to explode,” I warned her, yet she stayed in position, even as the first big viscous gob landed on her tongue. </p><p>Despite the humiliation it implied when factoring her position and my prisoner status, she didn’t seem too broken as she savored my seed, managing to swallow the most of it, and the little piece she failed to get slowly sliding down her lip, adding to her eroticism. </p><p>Watching as she swallowed my load without any prompting left me with one last question. What should be my next move?</p>",

    "content": "<p>One against four was never a good odd to face, and worse if all four were actually magic users with significant military experience. Add in the fact that they were led by a Sorcerer, and I had a true challenge in front of me. </p><p>While I had already killed the majority of their group, it didn’t give me as much confidence as it was supposed to have, because ultimately, the only reason I was able to do so was a combination of a bunch of freaky events that belied belief. Not only they underestimated me as they hunted because of my earlier escape, but also, at the moment of my attack, they were distracted by a rebellion of their captives. Add in the fact that the chaotic environment of the mountain worked perfectly to mask my magical presence, and they were whittled down by essentially the most perfect ambush possible. </p><p>Facing a sudden rain of fire while trying to dodge a water spear, all the while the earth shook underneath me told me that the reputation of Roman Legions was well-deserved. The combination of attacks, launched without the slightest discussion, forced me to react by casting a magical shield, because it was impossible to dodge all three attacks simultaneously. I either cast a shield and not only wasted my mana, but also sacrificed initiative, or dodged, and received at least one dangerous attack. </p><p>Counter-attacking would have been a dangerous but viable strategy, if it wasn’t for one important detail. I was being attacked by the mages only. The sorcerer was yet to cast his spell, his hands glowing, awaiting my choice before committing to a spell, ready to defend and attack as the situation demanded. A perfect strategy to snatch me. </p><p>I could hear my late grandfather’s lessons echoing in my ear. ‘A mage that follows the flow of the opponent is a stupid mage. And there is no difference between a stupid mage and a dead mage but time.’ I had to change the balance somehow. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was easier said than done. Other than a unique lightning spell I was yet to perfect, I had no option to risk myself. It was a unique movement spell I had created myself based on a few mentions in the library. Unfortunately, it left my muscles burning and twitching. I could use it to get away, but that would mean letting them go, something I could not afford. Unless I killed every single one of the mages, they would know that I was responsible for the death of almost a dozen mages, and Rome had massacred tribes and subjugated small nations for less. </p><p>I needed them to believe that their expedition force had died because of the mystery of the mountain. If they lose a Sorcerer mysteriously, it was unlikely for them to send another. It was the only chance for me to avoid a lifelong chase, or being imprisoned in the mountain, no matter how nice the city was. </p><p>Without using the lightning dash, I had to rely on other stuff. And despite being a sorcerer, only the element of the sky, the lightning, gave me the chance to succeed. The elements of Gaia —earth, fire, air, and water— still resisted my control, and it robbed me of the edge I could use against them. </p><p>The quick lightning bolt I launched as I rolled to the side exploded on the Sorcerer’s shield, who looked more than happy to stay in defensive while the other three continued their assault. The biggest disadvantage of the lightning was its unsuitability to defense, and using a non-elemental defense might work against the mages, but it’ll also allow the sorcerer to attack me. I tried to hide behind a tree, but it exploded before I could reinforce it. I tried to raise an earth barrier, but the sorcerer just blasted it, before redirecting my lightning bolt… </p><p>Five minutes into the chase, I was feeling properly exhausted, paying for the two area-effect lightning explosions I had used for earlier, and constantly throwing lightning bolts like candy wasn’t exactly the most relaxing activity. And whenever I used the occasional non-elemental spell, or relying on other elements, the drain became even more noticeable. The mages were starting to get exhausted as well despite using much weaker spells, but the same couldn’t be said for the sorcerer himself. He had a stony expression on his face as he methodically deflected or blocked every spell I could. </p><p>“How about I surrender?” I murmured even as I launched another lightning bolt, mostly to break the pace rather than with genuine intention. I had hurt them enough to know that a quick suicide was vastly preferable to be captured. The same end, but without the pain and the humiliation. However, my idle statement worked, just not the way I intended. The sorcerer’s calm expression finally showed a flicker of emotion. Pure fury. It went just as quickly as it arrived, but it told me something important. He wasn’t calm, he was just experienced enough to hide his emotions. </p><p>And it gave me a plan. Not a nice, honorable plan, a kind that could easily be described as despicable, but I didn’t ask to be hunted like a dog by half-a-cohort’s worth of mages led by a sorcerer, so I felt justified. “Come on, what does a few useless mages matter,” I commented with an exaggerated dismissiveness. “I’m sure your employee wouldn’t care a bunch of useless dogs too distracted to notice an ambush. He might even reward you for getting rid of a bunch of useless guys.” </p><p>The flare of anger that passed through Sorcerer’s face scared me, though not as much as the huge silhouette of a wolf made entirely of water, charging toward me scarily. Rather than trying to shield myself, I nailed his spell with a lightning bolt of my own, something that required impeccable aim and iron nerves. A moment of delay, and I would have died. </p><p>“Ah, I see,” I murmured lazily even as I dodged the assault of the three mages, their pattern was broken by the angry assault of the sorcerer. “Based on your incompetence, I’m guessing they were trained by you. You should thank me, I prevented your useless disciples from shaming you in polite society.” </p><p>I had no doubt that the sorcerer was smart enough to realize my objective of angering him intentionally. But anger was an interesting emotion. Just because his mind knew about it didn’t mean that he could control his emotions perfectly. Another water wolf attacked me, this time followed by a fireball, but pair of lightning bolts from my end was enough to handle the threat. “Missed again,” I stated lazily, doing my best to hide my labored breaths. </p><p>The sorcerer attacked, this time with an area-effect air spell, something hard to dispel with a lightning bolt, but also with limited damage. It also created a cloud of dust, which obscured everything for a moment. </p><p>It was the opportunity I was looking for. Rather than trying to defend magically, I covered my face with one of my arms, while I sent a special lightning bolt toward the mages. It was the chain lightning, a very useful spell for dealing with the small groups, but with a great drawback. It required constant channeling to make sure it maintained its stability enough to jump into the nearest target, hence the reason I hadn’t used it against the crowd. </p><p>Handling three mages was a more manageable task, but not without its cost. As the earth-shattering cry of the first mage reached my ear, I maintained the focus. But it meant I couldn’t even cast a shield to defend myself against the wind, and it was too close to dodge. The gust of wind hit me with all the strength of a tornado, filling my skin with cuts even as it threw me back. Still, I was focused on channeling the spell, and the cries of the second mage reached my ear even as my back connected with a tree painfully, with a crack that I recognized as three of my ribs breaking. Of course, identifying the number of broken ribs from their sound was another little skill I had to ‘thank’ my grandfather for. </p><p>The pain enveloped my mind as the winds continued to drag me back, along with the tree trunk I had broken during the collision. Without the physical improvements I gained during my unique Ascension, I would have died, or at least lost consciousness, no matter how used I was to pain. Ultimately, the human body had some limits impossible to overcome with willpower, and even with my improvements, I was pretty close to it. </p><p>Still, through the sheer stubbornness, I was able to maintain control of the spell, and the third cry reached my ear, followed by the furious cry of the Sorcerer. I lost the connection with the spell, meaning he had managed to successfully shield himself. However, I wasn’t the only one that couldn’t shield myself and channel top-tier attack magic at the same time. The gust of wind lost its power, depositing me on the floor, and I stopped after rolling several times. Not the best thing to experience with broken ribs, not to mention with more wounds than skin. And I had a broken piece of branch in my leg, nicely pinning me in place. And just to make things even better, I managed to lose my belt, along with all my weapons.</p><p>I was on my limits, and even if I used my lightning dash to escape, I doubt I could run more than a few hundred yards, which would mean that I would be captured —if I don’t die from blood loss first. </p><p>The sorcerer dashed toward me, only to slow down when he saw my horrible condition. “I’m going to enjoy torturing you before I send you to Pluto,” he gloated gleefully, his face contorted with a mad joy, which, admittedly, I deserved completely. </p><p>It was time for one last bet. “Not if I send myself first,” I answered even as I grabbed the tree branch from my leg, and pulled it out, which let my blood flow freely. “You’re out of time,” I said, betting everything on his desire of vengeance. </p><p>“No!” he cried furiously as he dashed forward. “You can’t get away that easily.” </p><p>It was the opportunity I was looking for. Before he could realize what was going on, I reached my magic, and charging my body with lightning before I threw myself forward, putting all my weight on my working leg. It threw me barely ten yards forward, but it was just what I needed to stab my opponent in the neck with the branch that was still covered with my blood. “Please pass my greetings to Pluto,” I murmured even as I tried to suppress a completely new source of pain, my skin burned with my internal lightning, my muscles twitching horribly. The only positive thing about it was that being burned from inside out cauterized my wounds, saving me from the risk of immediate death in exchange for excruciating pain… </p><p>All told, I thought even as I tried to stay conscious under the tyrannical assault of pain, it was a successful battle. The opponent was dead, and I was still alive… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Titania was silent as the earth elemental burst in one of the tunnels deep into their base before melting into nothingness. It had outlived its usefulness momentary. If the earlier assault was a hammer, the current one was a scalpel, and a clumsy earth elemental would only hurt us. </p><p>“Let’s hide us from the view,” I murmured even as I cast one of the best concealment spells I had learned, making our figures fade into the background, with shadows wrapping around us. </p><p>[+2 Arcana]</p><p>[-316 Mana]</p><p>However, as we walked, I could feel a slight stirring in connection with Titania. Curious, I followed the connection, only to realize her emotional-suppressor from her light magic stirring in discomfort, pushing against the bondage I created. It was an ineffectual thing, barely pushing back before my own Companion Core worked its magic to reinforce the bonds, making them even stronger. Still, it was an interesting reaction against an arcana spell, even the slightest component of darkness stirring against. </p><p>Such an inconvenient ability. No wonder until now, Titania was a furious hammer of destruction on the battlefield. Her powers didn’t allow it to be otherwise. </p><p>Surprisingly, her next words proved that she was already moving ahead of her earlier instincts. “We should try to steal the information from their headquarters,” she whispered. </p><p>I was glad to see her already leveraging subterfuge in her thinking, though still elementary. “Normally, it would work excellently, but under the current situation, it doesn’t work for two reasons, one tactical, and one strategic. Do you want to guess why?” I questioned, wanting to encourage her sneaky approaches. I was starting to like her more and more, above and beyond her power, so I was willing to spend the necessary time to correct her thinking. </p><p>Luckily, with her spectacular mental stats —spectacular for the rest of the world, not in comparison to me— I didn’t expect our impromptu lessons to take too much time. I had all the confidence that she would prove a quick study, and if she didn’t, there were several more interesting lessons in subterfuge we could employ back in Silver Spires. </p><p>“Umm,” she murmured as her face scrunched in concentration. “Their defenses should be activated, and that would make sneaking in too risky,” she offered. </p><p>“Good, that’s the tactical challenge we’re facing. If we wanted to sneak in, we should have done that before our initial assault. But what’s the strategic challenge?” </p><p>She thought for a bit as we closed in the distance between us and their operational headquarters, even though we had to take a few detours, whenever my Biomancy waves alerted me to a nearby undead presence. “I’m not sure,” she murmured, disappointed. </p><p>“No worries,” I said as I patted her head while she preened, a part of me still unable to believe her changes, from the indomitable head librarian to the girl eager for my approval and a liking for chains. “It doesn’t make strategic sense, because I have already raided that place and discovered their most important advantage, all without making them aware. It doesn’t make sense to risk getting caught.” </p><p>“Can’t we just burst out together if we get caught? We’re certainly strong enough,” she offered. </p><p> “Not exactly,” I explained. “First of all, I was able to sneak in the last time because I was able to engineer a distraction without implicating me, mostly due to luck. Without that, the headquarters are too crowded to sneak in, even for my abilities. More importantly, if we get caught while trying to get in, it’ll alert them about a possible breach of information, forcing them to change their plans. We want them to hit our perceived weakness,” I explained. “Sometimes, a hidden card is more valuable than ten out in the open.” </p><p>[+3 Speech]</p><p>She nodded as she tried to process my explanation, while I received a nice surprise. Apparently, teaching someone could also improve Speech —though I suspected it was mostly about it changing her general outlook to the strategy, and not just acquisition of the new knowledge. However, before we could delve any deeper into the topic, we arrived at the entrance of the secret location. “I’ll attack first, stay hidden, and wait for my order to attack, even if you think I’m struggling,” I explained, even as I gripped my dagger tight. I left her quite a bit behind, shouldering the task of handling the first response alone.</p><p>It was time to test my new weapon. </p><p>I walked toward the headquarter, using my arcana to examine the wards as I got closer. I was happy to note that the ward scheme was the same, confirming that they had no idea about the earlier breach. And since I had studied their wards intensely before, it was almost trivial to trigger an alarm, informing that there was someone in the outer wards, trying to break in. I even avoided the most obvious trigger, and instead touched one of the hidden ones, to better sell the attempt. Otherwise, my presence inside wouldn’t be convincing. </p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>[+2 Subterfuge]</p><p>[-13 Mana]</p><p>There was no visible alarm, but I could feel more than a dozen presences inside moving, along with another dozen signatures patrolling the corridors suddenly changing their patterns. A much better response than I had been expecting. Apparently, without the presence of a rampaging dragon, they were much more competent. </p><p>Too bad they hadn’t expected someone to be brazen enough to ambush the bulk of their army in the middle of their base. </p><p>The first assault of the necromancers was spectacular enough to take down a lesser man. Four of them appeared from behind me, launching a volley of death bolts, while six others appeared on the front, some relying on death bolts, while two of them relied on elemental spells, one casting a large fireball to obscure my vision, while the other cast earth spikes, bursting from the walls. </p><p>Even more impressively, none of those was the real attack. No, the real attack came in the form of a hidden presence, its death energy throbbing like cancer to my magical senses. I had no doubt it was a strong lich, stronger than any I had faced to date. I could feel its mana gathering, mixing with the defensive wards as it prepared to launch a devastating strike. I had no doubt that I could protect myself with my magic, but that would reveal a lot of secrets that would best be kept hidden. </p><p>Luckily, while my physical stats were lesser in comparison to my magical ones, that inferiority meant little when compared to others, not when my weakest stat, Endurance, was already at thirty, which was supposed to be an unreachable target. </p><p>I turned back and dashed toward the four on the back, straining my Speed to the limit for the first time even as I imbued my dagger with the life energy. The spikes exploded against the walls, while the fireball exploded behind ineffectively, leaving only the death bolts to contend against. They had planned their assault well, with death bolts aiming to reach me simultaneously, but their assumption neglected my speed. As I dashed, I first met with an attack wave of four, dodging them without even reducing my speed. </p><p>I was among them before they could cast another batch of spells, which was the worst thing a traditional mage, be it an elementalist or necromancer, could experience. Before they could even finish their emergency spells, my dagger flashed, cutting the neck of the first one, and stabbing the neck of the second one, all in the same movement. Both of them collapsed despite the negligible life energy I had injected into the dagger, only around fifty points of mana. </p><p>Oeyne’s craftsmanship was truly excellent. Not only the dagger didn’t hemorrhage mana like my earlier attempts, allowing me to use it much more effectively, but the effect was amplified as well. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time to admire the dagger with the other four death bolts arriving. This time, rather than dodging, I grabbed the third necromancer and pulled him in front of me, manhandling him with my strength like a toy, using him as a shield, while I stabbed the last one in the hearth. Two of the death bolts hit him, while the other two went wide, missing us altogether. He absorbed most of the energy, though a small part of it splashed over me, with an effect that would be devastating to a lesser man. </p><p>[-129 HP]</p><p>After receiving the bulk of the energy from two death bolts, the necromancer was still alive without noticeable damage, which didn’t surprise me, as they were quite adept in handling death energy. He would have got stronger if he had completed his transformation to lichdom, but in his current state, reducing the impact was the best he could do. However, his wellness collapsed significantly when he received my dagger in his kidney, the life energy I converted through Biomancy wreaking havoc in his system. Rather than finishing him off directly, I pumped him with life energy, before I kicked him, launching him toward the new wave of attack I received from the other side, skewered by the earth spikes and burnt by the fireball. </p><p>Then, I turned back and dashed away, escaping the impact area of the ward before the lich could complete his spell. The angry cry of the lich as the spell exploded the area I vacated was a song to my ear, though I was still received quite a bit of impact from the splash, enough to remind me that playing with them was dangerous. </p><p>[-351 HP]</p><p>I turned a corridor, then cast another simple Biomancy spell, faking life energy getting away while I crouched in the shadows, letting the necromancers escape. Of course, the necromancers didn’t chase me blindly. Even they were smart enough not to do so after my display of physical superiority. I felt their flares of death energy, and several strong signatures walked closer, their purity of death energy more like the regular necromancers rather than pure like the lich, but much stronger. In total, there were eight of those. </p><p>I stayed stuck firmly against the wall, waiting for those figures to pass. Four of them pushed forward, while four of them stayed with the necromancers. Soon, four armored figures with glowing eyes passed me, unable to detect my presence. </p><p>Death Knights, I recognized them. Essentially, they were not exactly undead, but not exactly living as well, kind of like a necromancer going through a transformation, but unlike the necromancers, they stayed in that state. According to what I found out during my library trips, they were made from captured warriors, through a unique and very difficult method, preserved most of their stats, and even some of their skills, only without a mind to drive them, instead of following the commands of the lich that bound them. And due to the cost associated with their crafting, the liches rarely bothered to convert anyone lower than Level fifteen. They were rarely seen, because then they were precious enough that only a minority —the strongest ones— of the liches possessed one. </p><p>I doubted the lich that was directing the wards were strong enough to possess eight of them, so, either they were a combination of effort from a bunch of liches, or they belonged to a much stronger one, one that was not afraid of the others trying to steal its possessions. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I was facing an opportunity to damage their strength much more than taking down a bunch of useless necromancers, or even a couple of low-tier liches. And it wasn’t just about the battle potential. Death knights were an integral part of the lich’s power, and destroying them might affect the leadership structure of the horde, as creatures that were willing to surrender their humanity for an eternal cursed existence weren’t the kindest when it came to power struggles. </p><p>Still, I let four of them walk away, while sending a subtle signal to Titania, asking her to attack them once they turned their back to attack me. I gripped my dagger, tight like a spring, ready to launch forward. Then, two more death knights passed me, followed by the necromancers and the lich, and two more death knights behind them. </p><p>It was time to strike. </p><p>My dagger was shining as I escaped the cover of the shadows as I pushed it to the limit, filling it with life energy. </p><p>[-361 Mana]</p><p>Even then, however, when I stabbed the first death knight, it barely staggered, still swinging its sword. They were stronger than I expected, and much more resilient. I dodged the swing and damaged it again, this time managing to disable its arm. Behind them, I could see the necromancers preparing to attack. I didn’t have a lot of time to waste, but I still didn’t want to reveal my magical abilities, so I did the next best thing, and dumped even more mana to the dagger. </p><p>[-819 Mana]</p><p>It was cracking badly under the strain of mana, so, I did the best I could do, and stabbed the dagger at the mouth opening of the armor, which was pointless to exist on an undead as they didn’t need to breathe, but I was more than happy to abuse the stylistic choice. Then, I dashed away, doing my best to get away before the dagger malfunctioned. It proved to be the correct choice, as the explosion was spectacular, sending pieces of death knight’s armor around like a bomb, killing the nearest two necromancers, and wounding four others. </p><p>And just like that, with the high cost of a specially-crafted magical dagger, I was able to take down a death knight without revealing my magic. </p><p>Titania chose that exact moment to hit the other regiment, and her light magic filled the corridor, however, it was much more concentrated as she tried to burn down four death knights. Still, among the brightness, the death knights changed direction and charged toward her. I had the hope that she could take them down. </p><p>Then, things went horribly wrong. A cry of anger reverberated in the corridors, laced with death energy, strong enough to damage me without touching. </p><p>[-193 HP] </p><p>The damage itself was trivial, but the reaction of the death knights was the scary part. Their eyes started to burn with ethereal blue light, and the closest one swung its sword —now burning with a blue flame that radiated coldness and death— while the others started to move much faster. And like that wasn’t enough, a deadly presence appeared on the depths of the base, enough to blanket my death senses. </p><p>It seemed that my earlier guess was correct. Those death knights belonged to a much stronger lich. </p><p>And by destroying one of its death knights, I managed to anger it thoroughly.</p><p>The presence was getting closer to us, and in the background, I could feel some kind of magic going haywire. Apparently, it was busy with something important, and when it decided to take revenge for the destruction of its death knight, I caused whatever magical experiment or ritual it was busy to be destroyed. Like it needed another reason to chase me down… </p><p>As much as I wanted to test myself against such a presence to understand my true limits, I decided to follow the better part of the valor, and escape. Not only I was horribly undergeared for such a confrontation, the middle of their base, while surrounded by hordes of undead and the untold number of wards was not the best time to test my limits. Instead, I decided to dash through the crowd in front of me to meet with Titania, hoping to rely on my Speed. Not the best option, as I managed to receive a bad wound from one of the remaining death knights, which hurt much worse than I had been expecting, even though it was a glancing blow.</p><p>[-792 HP]</p><p>However, it only made me dash forward faster, because I didn’t want Titania to be locked between four of them. She might survive a blow. Might. She wouldn’t survive four of them. </p><p>Luckily, even with the boost from their owner, they weren’t as fast as me, and since the four of them were focused on them, dodging those was much easier. “It’s time to go,” I said to Titania as I grabbed her in a bridal hold, and dashed forward, as fast as I could. </p><p>Realizing the situation, Titania started using Arcana to cast impediments rather than trying to kill them with her light magic, but the death knights were able to shatter them with a stab, barely slowing down. “Why are they so strong,” she gasped. </p><p>“I have a feeling that we stumbled upon the opponent of our dear headmistress,” I quipped even as I dashed, not bothering to hide as I run through many of the weaker undead that tried to cut our path, none fast enough to even touch me at full step. </p><p>Still, a smirk appeared on my face as I slowed down slightly, just enough so that the four death knights were just a few steps behind us when we finally entered the secret passage I had prepared. </p><p>The secret passage that I filled with a great number of traps. Then, when I arrived at the middle of the passage, I cast an air-elemental, much stronger than the ones I cast before. Not the most efficient way to leverage my mana, but with a frenzied lich trying to catch up, it wasn’t time to be stingy. </p><p>[-4915 Mana]</p><p>I jumped on top of the air elemental, and it dashed away faster than a tornado. The moment we left the cave, I triggered all the traps I had created the previous time, where I had spent hours and a great number of magical reagents. I would have waited a bit more, but I was afraid one of the necromancers recognizing the trap and warning the death knights. </p><p>Then, we rode into the dark of the night, with a white glow covering our escape, leaving behind four death knights which almost certainly turned into glitter in the core of the explosion… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 439500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 3455 / 4920\tMana: 936 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [90/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [66/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [31/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>",

    "content": "<p>Titania’s face was glowing with excitement as I changed direction, and moved deeper into the base, but it lacked the manic obsessiveness I expected her to have. Just like her carnal joy, it was probably the first time she was enjoying the adrenaline rush of a battle without the effects of her emotional dampener, but she was already getting a hang of it. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one that benefited from a high Wisdom score in decision-making, it seemed. </p><p>Unfortunately, we needed to avoid the gathering spot, no matter how good it felt for her to burn hordes of skeletons and zombies. A part of the reason was my mana, still regenerating, but a bigger part of it was the wards that were being activated. Ambushing a bunch of inexperienced necromancers was fun, but I didn’t want to repeat it with the great wards backing them up. </p><p>So, instead of returning, I leveraged the benefits of my earth-elemental mount, and created a temporary underground tunnel. Their underground road was protected with wards, of course, but covering miles and miles of road perfectly was not an easy job. A simple application of my Arcana abilities was all it took to avoid their detection as we disappeared underground. </p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>[-53 Mana]</p><p>Since it gave us a moment to rest, I let Titania sit while I stopped the movement of our mount, letting her catch her breath after her latest orgasm while I grabbed a chunk of stone, to test my newest skill. Crafting. </p><p>Crafting was a difficult skill to master, and since I was a beginner, it came with a very limited set of instinctual understanding. However, unlike my other skills, I had a great advantage. I had worked with Oeyne, a master of her craft, and it gave me a much greater understanding of the skill. Folding my mana several times around the piece of stone while using Earth Magic to sculpt it was almost trivial. </p><p>[-281 Mana]</p><p>[+4 Craft]</p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured as I examined the stone dagger in my hands. From an objective assessment, it was nothing more than garbage, constructed from a material worse than garbage and carrying only one layer of enchantment, it was a total waste of mana. </p><p>Luckily, I had more than enough to waste it. </p><p>“What are you doing?” Titania asked as she realized we stopped. “We should hit them before they could react!” </p><p>“No,” I answered even as I grabbed another piece of stone and repeated the earlier crafting activity, which worked quite a bit better due to increased familiarity. “It’s better if we don’t hit them immediately.” </p><p>[-234 Mana]</p><p>[+3 Craft] </p><p>“Why?” she asked, her voice sharp, but even that was an incredible development with her famously dominant personality. The fact that she was asking me to explain angrily rather than trying to force me to speak was a huge development. Of course, compared to fact that she was sitting in front of me, wearing only a damaged skirt that didn’t even cover her slit, her reduced aggressiveness wasn’t even worth mentioning. </p><p>“I want them to start searching the intruders,” I explained. “Once they are committed to it, they’ll have many strong necromancers, maybe even some of the liches, away from each other, making them easy pickings. Hunting their strongest members will work much better than otherwise. Even better, after your display, they are likely to assume that you’re pushed to your limits, meaning they’ll prioritize speed over safety” </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>She nodded, approving my strategy, before her eyes landed on my hand. “Why are you wasting your mana like this?” she asked. </p><p>“Why? Do you want me to give you some more ‘mana’ instead?” I said with a naughty smirk. </p><p>Her blush was spectacular. “You dog,” she murmured, avoiding my gaze as she tried to process it, wrapping her arms around her chest. </p><p>I just chuckled before explaining. “I just received an inspiration on crafting, and want to try a new production method,” I explained. </p><p>“You can craft as well?” she asked, shocked. “What you can’t do?” </p><p>“I can do many things, including you,” I quipped, this time earning a slap on the shoulder rather than a shy avoidance. I just smirked as I grabbed another piece of stone, this time fashioning them into stone handcuffs, adding a simple suppression effect to them. </p><p>[-467 Mana]</p><p>[+5 Craft] </p><p>“Careful,” I warned. “Or I would tie you up to make sure you don’t get naughty while transferring mana.” </p><p>“You wouldn’t dare,” she challenged, which was all I needed to dash forward and grab her arms. Before she could even react, I pulled both of her arms behind her, and locked them with the handcuffs. “No,” she said. “Stop.” </p><p>“Do you really want me to stop?” I said as I pulled her on her feet, and slipped my fingers into her slit, which was getting wetter at a noticeable pace. “Your body doesn’t agree. Instead, it reacts like you want another dash of my … mana. Am I wrong?”</p><p>She didn’t answer at first, so I started pumping my fingers, trying to force her to answer. When that failed, I decided to employ my new crafting abilities to the limit. I grabbed another piece of stone, and started crafting another item, a cylindrical one that resembled my shaft, only shorter and thinner. Unlike the daggers, I invested quite a bit of mana on its crafting, and made sure it had several spells integrated into its nature semi-permanently, including the ability to vanish waste and constant lubrication. </p><p>[-1139 Mana]</p><p>[+13 Craft] </p><p>For anyone else, it was nothing more than a total waste of mana, but for me, it was valuable above and beyond my improvement with the magic. It was a toy that would allow me to teach Titania a pleasurable lesson. </p><p>She gasped when I pressed the newly-crafted stone anal plug against her puckered hole. “What’s that,” she gasped. </p><p>“Your punishment for talking back to your betters,” I said, even as I used my free hand to pull one of her ass cheeks to the side, giving me a better view of her rosebud, small and tight, waiting to be broken in. </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” she said, her earlier submissiveness disappearing as the plug threatened to invade her alternative entrance. However, when I pushed my shaft against her entrance, the head dipping into her wetness, her struggling ceased quickly. </p><p>“Really,” I said, even as I pushed the plug slightly deeper, earning a hiss. “Come on, Titania. You’re a big girl,” I said as I slapped her ass with my free hand, staining her alabaster skin. “You can handle a little pain.”  </p><p>She might have tried to refute my words, but when I pushed the plug even deeper, she prioritized gasping in shock, which followed by a moan of pleasure as I slipped the plug completely into her entrance, relying on the enchantments to prevent an injury, but that didn’t reduce the pain the slightest. Simultaneously, I slammed my shaft into her soft entrance, making her reaction even more spectacular. Even better, I received a very welcome notification. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 52%]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Grandmaster Tantric (5), Grandmaster Elemental (5), Advanced Craft] </p><p>The skill selection was a foregone decision. I quickly picked Craft once more while I spanked her ass. “Someone is enjoying being plugged in the ass,” I commented cheerfully as I grabbed her handcuffed wrists before starting impaling her mercilessly. </p><p>“N-no,” she moaned, but it was impossible to hide the pleasure echoing in her tone as her two holes were teased simultaneously. </p><p>“Really?” I said, and pulled back the plug, only for her to let out a disappointed gasp, clearly not expecting me to follow up my offer. Luckily for her, she was correct on that account. “So, you don’t want me to do this,” I said as I replaced the plug with my shaft, the tip sinking slowly into her lithe ass. She was not a rival of Marianne in the hips department, but her tight ass had its own taste. </p><p>She just moaned as I sank into her ass inch by inch, objections suspiciously absent as I forced her tightness to expand. I pulled out once I reached halfway, only to slam into her pussy once more, dumping a generous dash of mana, once again feeling the fullness of her reserves while mine dipped down dangerously low. Luckily, with four instances active, I barely needed ten minutes to fill completely again. </p><p>[-1381 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 54%]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>“You’re a monster,” she moaned, but when she twisted her neck to catch my gaze, anger was suspiciously absent. Instead, she nibbled her lower lip, giving me a sexy glare that shouldn’t be possible for her, but somehow working perfectly, begging me to move faster. </p><p>And I did so. I launched an assault, alternating between her holes as I wreaked havoc, pulling her arms back hard, slapping her ass repeatedly. And she was clearly enjoying the rougher treatment. “You like this, don’t you,” I murmured even as I cast an earth spell, and created chains to lock her legs, though, unlike her handcuffs, they were simple spells rather than true magical items, meaning they wouldn’t last. </p><p>She didn’t say anything else, but the way she tightened further was sufficient as an answer. What were the chances that the feared Titania enjoyed bondage? It wasn’t even like Cornelia, a submissive that bowed down to a stronger person. For Cornelia, it was about the power, but for Titania, it was clearly different. </p><p>I grabbed yet another piece of stone, quickly crafting it into a collar, connected to a chain. It was exactly what I needed to test Titania’s limits. I even etched a magic-blocking ward on it as well, one that would only hold if Titania didn’t stretch her powers, of course. With her magical abilities, truly cutting her off her magic was an almost impossible task without the help of extremely strong arrays, well-above anything I could craft on the fly. </p><p>[-559 Mana]</p><p>[+6 Craft]</p><p>She stiffened when she felt the stone collar on her neck, making me wonder whether I had finally pushed her too hard, but that concern didn’t last long, not when she suddenly started cumming, more explosive than I had ever seen her do before. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 61%]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Spotting Secrets. Help a paramour discover their true selves. +3 Wisdom. +1000 Exp]</p><p>I held her arms to prevent her from hitting on the floor painfully, instead helped her to sit. I even opened the handcuffs, but kept the collar on, which looked extremely beautiful in combination with her ripped skirt and used appearance. While she rested her back against the stone wall, trying to recover from the extreme high she had just experienced, I stayed on my feet, occasionally using weak Biomancy pulses to check our surroundings while I recovered my mana. </p><p>About fifteen minutes later, my mana was completely full, but she was still resting against the wall, her eyes still closed. “Are you ready to act?” I asked. </p><p>“M-maybe,” she stammered, cracking her eyes open. “I can still feel my legs trembling…” </p><p>“Yeah,” I murmured even as I leaned for a quick kiss, and after that, tugged her chain. “You have enjoyed the collar more than I expected.” </p><p>“But why?” she said, unable to hide her shame. “Isn’t it wrong to enjoy something like that? Like I was some kind of slave…” </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I said as I sat next to her, delaying the assault another couple of minutes. “What you enjoy during sex doesn’t necessarily have to be what you do in your daily life. Maybe that was what you needed, a contrast to your strict life, where you do nothing but missions or managing the library, forcing you to be always on command. You were always so stiff before we truly met, after all.” </p><p>“Do you think it’s permanent?” she questioned even as she dragged her fingers over her collar. </p><p>“Maybe, maybe not?” I said, caressing her raven hair. “The important question is, why do you care. We can always stop if you stop enjoying it,” I offered, then smiled mischievously. “And I promise I’ll forge you a much better collar if you continue to enjoy it,” I offered. </p><p>“You bastard!” she exclaimed, hitting playfully, but her wide smile was enough to tell her true feelings. </p><p>I sighed. “As much as I enjoy spending time with you, we need to move,” I murmured, and cast telekinesis on her robe, bringing it to us. “Put it on, and we can move again,” I suggested. She looked at her robe with no small amount of disappointment. “I know, but unlike before, we’re going to hunt strong magic users rather than mindless hordes. Our attack-defend combo is not guaranteed to work. There’s no guarantee that they can’t split us temporarily by attacking from multiple directions, and leaving you defenseless is not a risk I’m willing to take.” </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured mulishly, but her blush signaled that she enjoyed the attention. While she got dressed with her battle gear, I made the elemental mount move again. </p><p>Destination, their meeting area… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 439500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 4920 / 4920\tMana: 6300 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [87/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [63/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [31/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I gave Anna some time to recover from the wardrobe crisis she had just experienced, using the opportunity to swim a few more laps in the lake. When I walked back into the RV, it was almost midday. </p><p>I found Anna on her bed, wearing her thickest pajamas, buried underneath the blanket so that only her arms visible, reading her book with a deep concentration —or at least, that was what she wanted me to believe. From the way her eyes were stuck unmoving, it wasn’t hard to guess her real objective. </p><p>“Do you want to talk?” I offered. </p><p>“No,” she immediately answered, abandoning the slightest pretense of normalcy as she buried her face in her hands. </p><p>I sat on the couch she was using as a bed, and put my hand on her shoulder. Despite my expectations, she didn’t flinch away from my touch, rather, she leaned against my chest, which was a bonus. “Do you need to talk?” I asked. </p><p>After a minute of deafening silence, she whispered. “Maybe.” </p><p>I wrapped my arm around her shoulder, pulling her close. “Tell me what is bothering you.” </p><p>“Isn’t it obvious?” she whispered in despair. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I said, carefully keeping my tone gentle. “Why don’t you tell me exactly why are you feeling distraught.” </p><p>“I’m humiliated,” she cried, as her arms tightened around me. </p><p>“Why? Just because of your little wardrobe malfunction?” I asked, which made her arms tighten around me desperately, which was more than sufficient as an answer. “You really don’t have anything to be ashamed of, you know that, right? You’re really beautiful,” I said. </p><p>“W-what,” she stammered as she pulled back, but her blush was spectacular, a smile tugging on the edges of her lips through her depression. “T-this is not about that!” </p><p>“Really?” I answered, glad that she was out of her funk. “Then why are you suddenly smiling?” </p><p>“I’m not,” she immediately answered, but that made her even harder to maintain a sad expression. I looked at her with a bright smile, and she found herself nodding. “Well, maybe…” she murmured. </p><p>“There’s no maybe,” I said. “You’re a beautiful woman, only obscured by the garbage you’re wearing. Why don’t you go and try some of the clothes we picked together. Trust me, you’ll feel much better.” </p><p>“But … it feels weird,” she answered. </p><p>“We have already talked about it. Hell, it’s the whole reason we went shopping, buying all those clothes. Do you really want to waste my efforts,” I said, acting like it was a chore to dress up a pretty girl that shared the same space with me for a month. “You should wear them, so that you can get used to them.” </p><p>Under my sharp glare, I wasn’t surprised to see her nodding. She wasn’t the most headstrong girl I had convinced to undress, not by a long shot. </p><p>“Perfect,” I said even as I reached her shopping bag, which was still not open, other than the swimsuit, like she was trying to reject their presence. “Why don’t you go to the bathroom, and I’ll pass you today’s clothing,” I said. </p><p>“Shouldn’t I be the one to select?” she whispered, trying to resist my sudden overreach, but she wasn’t more successful than a butterfly caught in a tornado. </p><p>“No,” I simply said, sharp and authoritative, even as I grabbed her arm and led her to the bathroom. “We’re trying to get you in the habit of dressing differently. If I let you choose, I doubt you will be wearing anything but the most boring pieces.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to complain. </p><p>“No buts,” I cut her off. “It’s the only way you can win against your shyness,” I suggested, preventing another remark by a sharp glare. </p><p>“Okay,” she finally whispered as she slipped to the bathroom, waiting for my picks. \\</p><p>I was tempted to dress her in the little black dress I had picked for a night at the club, unfortunately, it was too early for that. Instead, I browsed her bags, searching for the baby-blue lingerie set, only to remember she had been wearing them the last night as well, during her secret visit. </p><p>I decided to push her limits, and instead grabbed the transparent red lingerie set I had picked for later adventures, willing to push her further. And while doing so, my eyes fell on the two skirts I had picked for her, one solidly in the miniskirt territory, the other even shorter, worthy to be called as a micro-skirt, enough to turn the simple act of sitting down into an erotic show no matter how careful was its wearer. I decided to pass her both, curious which one she would pick. </p><p>The only weakness of the set was the black tank top she had purchased, but I decided to keep that in, mostly as an excuse. It would have been rather excessive if she wasn’t wearing at least one item from her own selection. </p><p>“They are here,” I called, and her hand pushed out of the cracked door, unaware that she had given me a glimpse of her lingerie-clad body, which, unfortunately, was covered with one of her boring white sets. </p><p>“Pass me the pajamas,” I asked her, and she followed that before she could even consider the implications, losing another layer of protection. Of course, she could just leave the place in a bathrobe, but it was more about the mental impact than forcing her to change. </p><p>Then, after a few seconds, a shocked gasp reached my ear. “Is there anything wrong?” I asked, faking concern. </p><p>“Umm,” she murmured. “One of those items doesn’t look like something I had bought,” she said. </p><p>“No worries. It was a gift to an ex-girlfriend, but we broke up before I could give it. They are brand-new,” I explained, despite being very much aware of her concern. “Now, change quickly, I want to see your bravery!” I added, cutting her argument beforehand. Now, she would either wear them, or admit that she was a coward. </p><p>“O-okay,” she stammered. Another minute passed, then she spoke again. “T-there are two skirts,” she asked. </p><p>“So that you can choose whichever you want,” I said. “The first one would look amazing on you, but if you think you can’t handle it, you can wear the second one,” I explained, once again using the same trick of limiting her responses. I didn’t expect her to wear the micro skirt, but without it, she wouldn’t have worn the miniskirt as well. </p><p>“A-are you ready?” she stammered, almost five minutes later, while I waited for her, my cock rock hard in my swimsuit. </p><p>“Let me take my heart medicine first,” I shouted, earning a hesitant giggle in return. Then, the door opened, and I thought that maybe I should have taken a pill to calm my heart. </p><p>She was wearing the micro skirt, and she looked spectacular! The skirt was barely long enough to hide her underwear, and that was when she was standing perfectly straight. Wearing that skirt, every step would have been a challenge, and it was impossible for her to sit down. Her thick thighs were delicious to make my mouth water. </p><p>And even better, the first two buttons of her black tank top were open, adding a nice cleavage to the mix. On another girl, it would have been a modest one, but with her spectacular tits pushing her top to the limit, the resulting cleavage was several times more spectacular, crowned by the ghost of her nipples, visible through her top, showing her own arousal.  </p><p>“How do I look?” she stammered, trying to stand straight, but her self-confidence was melting quickly without a response from me. I said nothing as I stood up, walking toward her slowly, each step making it harder for her to maintain her posture. “M-Michael,” she stammered.</p><p>I stayed silent until I grabbed her chin, and raised her head slightly until I was looking at her beautiful blue eyes. “You look spectacular,” I whispered. “You can win a fucking pageant.” </p><p>“I don’t believe you,” she stammered, but the blooming smile on her face suggested that she was enjoying the compliment, regardless of the reason. </p><p>“Maybe you’re right,” I said, which stole her smile right back, but I continued rapidly. “Nowadays, those pageants favor those boyish girls, tall but no curves anywhere. Unlike your beautiful body,” I explained, and her blush was back with a revenge, so much that her mind short-circuited. I used the opportunity to present my arm, and she hooked around, and I brought her outside. </p><p>We barely took three steps outside when the wind pushed her skirt until it flew, revealing that she was wearing the transparent red lingerie I had bought for her, making my swimsuits very tight, and very uncomfortable.</p><p>She yelped as she pressed her free hand to control her skirt, with questionable success, but continued to walk along as I walked toward the nearby forest, looking for a shade. I started speaking when we were finally under the thick shadow of the forest. “The boys in the school would have gone crazy if they saw you like this,” I said. “I bet you would have received many more date requests if you had dressed in a way that would display her beautiful body, and ten times the kisses.” </p><p>“Ten times zero is still zero,” she answered with a sudden push back. </p><p>Once again, I grabbed her waist and made her turn until I was looking at her eyes, but this time, I kept my hands on her waist, like we were about to start a sensual dance. “And only if we were looking for another evidence why the teenage boys are morons,” I said, maintaining eye contact. “I can’t believe they missed this,” I said, even as I put my hand on her chin. </p><p>“Well, they did!” she shouted, angry and defensive. </p><p>“How about if we fix it,” I offered. </p><p>“Fix it,” she stammered, her earlier anger evaporated. </p><p>“Yes, fix it,” I said, slowly nearing her face as I used my hand on her chin to push her face up slightly, giving myself the perfect angle. “A wondrously beautiful girl like you, starting the college without a kiss, that’s a disgrace.” As I spoke, I closed in, and her lips parted, the moment getting charged. However, rather than stealing the kiss, I continued speaking. “Tell me what you want,” I whispered. </p><p>“I want you to kiss me,” she whispered, her lips shining invitingly. She shivered, charged with electricity, racing down her spine. Her hands trembled, so she took a deep breath, trying to combat it, but it only made her cleavage enhance —and thanks to my angle, I received a perfect show, enough to catch a glimpse of her bra and its doomed struggle to keep her perky breasts in check. </p><p>She closed her eyes instinctively as I closed in, then our lips touched. Her legs trembled, forcing me to hug her, to prevent her from collapsing halfway —not that it was a chore. </p><p>The kiss was a passive affair, one I enjoyed the softness of her lips to my heart’s content while she tried to stand upright, like she was unable to believe what was happening was not a dream. A surprising variance from her forwardness during her night visits, but by no means unwelcome. </p><p>She whimpered as I pulled back, only to avoid my eyes as I started speaking. “My hands are under your command,” I whispered. “You can drag them anywhere you want.” With that, I delved into her lips once more, enjoying their softness, though my tongue didn’t join the game. Not at first. </p><p>For a while, she just stood passively, enjoying the kiss like she hadn’t heard it, disappointing me, but after a minute or so, I felt her gentle grip around my left wrist, dragging it to her legs, until it landed on the middle of her thigh. She whimpered as my fingers started to caress the great expanse of her thigh, which was mostly naked thanks to her almost nonexistent skirt. </p><p>But the effect wasn’t as spectacular as when she dragged my right hand until it slipped inside her tank top, resting against the naked skin of her belly. A moan rippled off her lips, adding a delicious aroma to our kiss. Taking it as an invitation, I slipped my tongue inside her open mouth, and our tongues started swirling gently. </p><p>I felt like pushing further when she dragged my left hand up until my pinkie was pushing against her skirt, just an inch away from her burning core, but I didn’t do so, not wanting to scare her off at such a critical point, especially when she was in the mood already. So, I continued to kiss her gently, no matter how much I was tempted to take her hard against a tree, until her cries scared every single bird nesting in the forest. </p><p>Her body temperature climbed as her heart turned into a pile of embers, glowing with her passion. I kept my hand on the same height, but moved until I was massaging her inner thighs, and her legs parted, allowing me a great range of movement, close enough that I could feel the heat of her core. </p><p>I was expecting it to be her limit, and when she pulled my right hand out of her tank top, I treated it as the confirmation. Then, she proved she wasn’t out of surprises by dragging my right hand under her skirt, directly on her plump ass. </p><p>“Naughty,” I whispered into her ear, which would have made her run away in a panic if it wasn’t for my iron grip on her ass, enjoying the firmness of her flesh. It gave me the time I needed to slip my tongue back in her mouth, making her forget her concerns under the treatment of pleasure. Meanwhile, my fingers enjoyed the firmness of her ass, the transparent fabric of her underwear might as well not exist under my aggressive touch. </p><p>She nibbled her lips nervously when I pulled out of the kiss, but kept mauling her ass mercilessly. “Do you want me to go further?” I whispered, and she nodded. “I need your words,” I said before leaving a kiss on her neck. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she managed to whisper, her eyes closed as she leaned back, her legs widened further. </p><p>That was all the invitation I required before letting my left hand take the last small step, and land over her panties. “Your panties are soaking wet,” I whispered. “You naughty girl.” </p><p>The statement went through her like lightning, leaving her gasping her trembling —though it might be the effect of my fingers, teasing her soft flesh. She said nothing, no defense, no excuses, not that it helped with the evidence under my fingers, sopping wet. Her lust was thicker, almost palpable… I caressed her until she was about to explode…</p><p>Then, pulled back, and left her leaning against the tree, trying to recover, her eyes widened as she was suddenly deprived of arousal. “And that,” I whispered as I leaned just as I was about to kiss her once more, but didn’t do so, “was your first kiss. I hope you liked it.” </p><p>“I … did,” she said, trembling, trying to understand what had just happened. </p><p>“Excellent. Now, your next task is to wear those clothes until bedtime. And just to make sure you wouldn’t cheat, I’m going to keep an eye on you. Understood?” </p><p>“Understood,” she whispered, failing to realize I just effectively prevented her from masturbating to steal the edge, unless she was confident enough to do so where she might be get caught. </p><p>And I knew that she wasn’t… Not even close… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Is that all,” Isolde asked as she stood up, hovering above me dangerously, but it was less intimidating after being fed by her hand. </p><p>“That’s all…” I said, and she prepared to leave. I could have let her go, and slowly push her further if that was required. Instead, I found myself tease her a bit more, to break her unyielding expression if nothing else. “If that’s all you’re willing to do,” I added, only for her to freeze. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. “Are you changing the deal? It wasn’t the bargain!” </p><p>“Come on, Isolde. I have followed the deal to the letter. You fed me like a fresh maid trying to get the favor of her lord, and I gave you the detailed breakdown of the route, including all the dangers, traps, and shortcuts.” </p><p>“Then what are you talking about,” she said stiffly, her eyes sharp like a hawk. </p><p>“That’s for you to find out, and for me to profit,” I said, feeling even more confident now that my stomach was filled comfortably. </p><p>“You’re bluffing,” she said, looking at my eyes, looking for a sign, looking for hints of deception. Which, admittedly, quite an impressive reaction considering her usual brashness, like a newborn kitten taking her first trembling step; an impressive development, but against a hungry predator, ultimately useless. </p><p>I shrugged again, knowing my disinterest would keep her back. “If you say so.” </p><p>“What do you want? And what do you offer in return?” she asked as she crouched in front of me, looking at my eyes, her hands clenching hard. </p><p>“It has been a while since I was able to walk around, and my muscles are quite stiff. I wouldn’t say no to a massage,” I said. </p><p>Her sour face showed just how little she liked the idea. “And in return?” </p><p>“A surprise, but something you’ll find useful,” I said. </p><p>“I don’t trust you,” she growled, her anger burning bright. From her expression, I could read that she wanted nothing more than to pound me on the ground, leveraging my helpless state. However, she was also smart enough —barely— to realize that repeated physical assault attempts had brought her nothing, even harming her standing with the group. </p><p>Once again, I shrugged. I could have easily told her about the reward, but it was the next step of our game. I wanted her to accept a deal where the control lay on me, another step in breaking her habits. The Queen would have easily recognized it as a strategic negotiation deal and countered it —hence the reason I hadn’t given her the chance to actually negotiate, but tricked her otherwise the last night— but Isolde wasn’t familiar enough with the politics to do so. </p><p>“Then let’s conclude our deal, you’re free to leave,” I said, like I was not a prisoner but the king in my domain, humoring visitors. </p><p>She said nothing, but neither did move for a while, her eyes closed. When she opened her eyes, she looked at the plate still in her hand. She took a deep breath to suppress her anger before speaking. “Okay, I’ll give you a massage. But if what I get in return doesn’t impress me…” she said, raising her dagger to finish her threat. </p><p>“That’s a risk you’ll have to take,” I said, uncaring. “Are you going to stay, or leave?” </p><p>Once again, my dismissal worked perfectly to maintain her interest. She said nothing, just put the plates to the side, and crouched to my side. For a moment, she looked at my body, no doubt trying to decide where to start. In the end, she decided to put her hands on my lower thighs, and began squeezing. </p><p>Even with the first touch, it was clear that massage wasn’t one of her better skills. “Softer, unless you decided against our deal and trying to torture me,” I warned her. “You’re not trying to break my bones, but relax my flesh.” </p><p>“Shut up,” she said, not enjoying the correction, but the pressure of her touch alleviated. </p><p>“Better,” I said as she started squeezing. “But try not to focus on the same spot, let your hands wander.” </p><p>At my correction, her anger flared, but her hands followed my commands, which was the more important part. I had given her several more corrections, she rapidly implemented every single one of them. </p><p>As a result, I was impressed. The initial intention of making her massage me was to change her habits. Surprisingly, she proved to be a quick study, following every single correction to the letter, so much that I started to grunt with pleasure as she moved lower, massaging my calves. “You’re surprisingly adept in this. Maybe you shouldn’t waste your skill being a huntress and start a massage parlor.” </p><p>“I’m not a huntress,” she bristled angrily, her grip tightening enough to hurt. “I’m a pathfinder!” </p><p>“Is there a difference?” I asked, playing ignorant. </p><p>“Difference!” she shouted angrily. “One is a two-bit worker trying to take down rabbits for their meat, the other is an ancient organization that discovered continents and led armies through unknown battlefields.”  </p><p>“Shesh, sorry,” I said mockingly. “Then, miss pathfinder, please start rubbing my feet. My soles are killing me.” </p><p>“Your feet!” she lashed out angrily. “Do you know who am I!” </p><p>“Apparently, an overpaid scout,” I said dismissively. “Either massage me properly, or leave without your reward. I don’t really care either way.” </p><p>“You, you…” she repeated, jumping up to her feet, her fists hard enough to crack. She let out an angry growl, and kicked the wall repeatedly, her steel-toed boots protecting her feet, while her hits making the walls tremble. Her anger was radiating dangerously, but it only made me more aroused. She might not be the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, but she was striking in her own way. Her emotional outburst just added to that. </p><p>“Hey, do you really have enough time to waste it by trying to break down the walls,” I reminded her a couple of minutes later, which stopped her. </p><p>She said nothing —though her expression told a lot— as she crouched next to me again, and pulled off my sandals, leaving my feet bare. In her anger, she didn’t even notice that they were suspiciously clean, and pressed her thumbs against them. </p><p>It wasn't long before I was groaning with pleasure, partly to tease her, but partly because it genuinely felt incredible. With her strength and motor control, she made a spectacular masseuse. </p><p>I could feel the stress drain from my soles, my hamstrings relaxing under her touch. </p><p>“Excellent, now to my back,” I reminded her, and turned as much as the chains allowed. She put her hands on my shoulder. “Remove my shirt first,” I reminded her. </p><p>This time, she did so immediately, probably ranking it lower than the indignity of massaging my feet, which implied inferiority very directly. She applied my earlier suggestions perfectly as her hands —which lacked the roughness I was expecting due to the nature of her job— worked their magic. And they worked perfectly. </p><p>I might have earned limited freedom lately, with some really impressive side benefits, but it didn’t change the fact that my muscles were as tense as steel from being imprisoned. And while sex was amazing and removed his stress, his furious poundings hardly helped to soften his stiff muscles. </p><p>“You’re really earning your keep,” I moaned, not bothering to hide my satisfaction. “Move a bit lower.” </p><p>I couldn’t see her face, but from the way her hands tightened around my shoulder, it wasn’t hard to imagine it stiffening in anger as she imagined herself choking me. Still, after a moment, her hands moved lower, caressing my back, working their magic. I was even more interested when she moved a little lower than I expected, almost caressing my ass, her touch getting softer and softer. </p><p>“Turn,” she ordered without prompting,” surprising me greatly by her initiative. I understood the reason when I did so, only for her gaze to dip down my erection for a fleeting moment. </p><p>“Nice,” I murmured as she started massaging my chess —though it might be better classified as caressing. I closed my eyes, then cast a simple illusion to hide it when I reopened them. Thinking that my eyes were still closed, her gaze fell down to my erection, watching in fascination. </p><p>That idiot Lancelot, I thought, even though her idiocy helped me greatly. His pseudo-harem was so needy that they were fascinated even by a glimpse of an erection. He could have easily tamed his needy companions during their adventures, only to leave them untouched, trusting that his charisma and his reputation would work for eternity. </p><p>Too bad I wasn’t one of the minions of the light. </p><p>I said nothing as she continued to caress my chest, then stomach, like she was trying to memorize the contours of my muscles. I bit my lips, trying to decide how much I should push, but before I could decide, I felt her hand on the button of my pants. She pulled them off, leaving me in my underwear only. </p><p>I opened my eyes —dispelling the illusion— surprised. “Don’t act like you’re not going to ask that,” she growled angrily, but I didn’t miss her blush. </p><p>“Smart,” I said, once again closed my eyes, only to open them with the protection of the illusion. </p><p>After making sure my eyes were firmly shut by watching me for a minute while she massaged my naked upper thighs, she turned her gaze down to my raging boner, which was straining my underwear to its limits. She bit her lips as she looked at it while she worked on my thighs determinedly. And since it was a prisoner outfit, my underwear didn’t have the best fabric, thin enough to give a glimpse of my flesh. </p><p>As the massage continued, I could see her legs pressing suspiciously tight as she moved them back and forth, no doubt creating an amazing friction thanks to her leather pants, while her hands reached suspiciously close to my shaft, but never touching. </p><p>After five minutes of the same concentrated assault, and I decided to reward her for it. My hands were bound, but luckily, it wasn’t the only way for me to masturbate. I had long discovered the way to replicate the effect with magic, which, while not as enjoyable, was certainly effective. I cast the spell, an invisible grip dancing back and forth over my shaft without even disturbing my underwear thanks to my immense control, and I exploded. </p><p>And it wasn’t a simple discharge. I exploded with a loud groan, making a show of it, while my throbbing cock released a torrent of fluid enough to ruin my underwear. I dispelled the illusion, trying to meet her gaze. </p><p>It turned out to be surprisingly hard. Her gasp was just as audible as she watched my eruption, almost hypnotized, while her hands continued to rub my thighs, even when some of my cum touched her skin. Only after my shaft stopped throbbing, she realized her own compromised actions. “That’s enough,” she called as she stood up. “I have completed our deal despite your disgusting habits, now fulfill yours, or die,” she said, pulling a dagger. </p><p>“Sure,” I said cheerfully. “Such a delicious massage surely deserves its reward. I’ll even give you a bonus for the happy ending,” I said, the last part making her blush. </p><p>She was quick to hide her blush behind her gruff exterior. “Tell me.” </p><p>“I’ll do something better,” I said, smiling widely. “I’ll give you the chance to select between two options, between a top-tier magical item, and a legendary artifact.” </p><p>“Is that even a question? Of course the artifact,” she said, which was a justified question. A top-tier magical item was certainly valuable enough to take the central location in a noble collection, while a legendary artifact triggered border skirmishes, or even battles. “Are you going to ask me more disgusting things?” she added.</p><p>“No conditions,” I said, and suddenly, I caught a flash of disappointment, gone as quick as it arrived. I took a note of it before continuing. “However, the regular magical item is a superbly-crafted magical bow that can shoot weightless magical arrows as long as you supply it with mana, while the legendary artifact once belonged a mage-king known as the Emperor of Flames, perfect for strengthening elementalists.” </p><p>Just like that, she froze. It was an ugly deal, I knew. The correct choice was the staff, of course, as it would enhance the strength of the Armies of the Light significantly, while the bow would have a limited benefit. However, if such a staff was discovered, there was no doubt about its wielder…” </p><p>Isolde froze for almost a minute before she spoke. “I hate you,” she growled. “I hate you so much.” </p><p>I said nothing, as nothing I could say would be as effective as the words echoing in her mind. “Bow,” she spat out. “I’ll take the bow.” </p><p>As much as I was tempted to tease her, I said nothing, not wanting to tip the delicate balance I had established. I explained the location, and she left without a word, leaving me wearing only my underwear. </p><p>Corrupting people was always fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After a month of practice outside, I was able to read the mountain much better, which was exactly what I needed as I cut through the winds toward where Astrid’s totem animal had died, looking for the unwelcome visitor. I was trying to stay hidden as much as possible, which was made considerably easier by the fact that I was currently in a forest, with plenty of barriers to hide behind. </p><p>It also allowed my opponents to hide, but considering the numerical disadvantage I was under, it was a good deal for me. </p><p>Five minutes into the trip, I had noticed the first scout. He was a Gallic warrior from one of the tribes based on his dress, and he was stumbling forward, trying to stay awake, clearly being overwhelmed by the magical presence of the mountain. </p><p>More importantly, he lacked a weapon. </p><p>Before I could move near him, he collapsed, which was suspicious. I hid behind a nearby rock, waiting for the others to arrive. Since they were sending captives without a weapon, it was safe to assume that they were nearby. </p><p>I hadn’t needed to wait for long. Barely a minute later, twenty Roman soldiers walked into the opening, followed by almost fifty tribal warriors with their hands bound. All but one was dressed in standard legionnaire armor, but with enough accessories to reveal their magical leanings. Likely top-tier mages, I reasoned, considering none of them looked young. And when it came to mages, experience, especially the kind that was earned on the battlefield, was invaluable. </p><p>It was a painful lesson I had learned from my late grandfather, repeatedly. </p><p>However, that wasn’t as important as the figure standing in the middle of the formation, carrying a staff with a glowing rune that created a mobile shield around the group. It was a man pushing into the elderly status, likely at his late forties, but it wasn’t as important as the mana radiating from his spell, noticeable even through the chaotic mana flow. </p><p>Definitely a sorcerer.</p><p>It was a formidable team. Too formidable, even. To get this many mages, they had likely drained half a cohort's worth of magical talent, but the resulting team would be enough to destroy even the strongest noble houses back in Britanium. Luckily, they didn’t have many soldiers accompanying them, no doubt afraid of losing them, instead of using the tribals as bait. </p><p>I wondered whether they found the hidden holy ground, or those warriors belonged to a different tribe, not that I was in a position to care about the fate of Matron Helena. </p><p>I felt my mouth go dry, trying to come up with a strategy while the legionaries started discussing their next step, separated less than a hundred yards. I had two options, either use the opportunity to launch a surprise attack, or follow them to find a better ambush point. </p><p>However, before I could decide, fortune smiled upon me. First, they freed one of the other tribals, one of the mages speaking to him threateningly when he didn’t move, only to get shouted at. After a minute of shouting, the legionnaire stabbed him without a warning, and turned to the next candidate. </p><p>I looked shocked at the arrogance of the mage. I knew about the legionaries’ reputation of arrogance —which was a result of the centuries of military domination— but it was hard to believe it when it happened in front of me. </p><p>And that arrogance turned out to be a costly mistake, as the tribals sprung into motion. Several of them dashed toward the mages, uncaring of their lack of a weapon, while the majority dashed away, trying to escape. They were clearly fed up with the disregard they experienced, as well as their death that looked inevitable. </p><p>Their dash toward freedom didn’t work as intended. Before I could even properly react to their little rebellion, the ones that tried to attack were cut down by a rain of spells, and the mages were casting spells to capture the rest. </p><p>It was the perfect time to act, I decided. I took a deep breath, filling my body with mana to the brim before I raised my hand to the sky, then pulled down. </p><p>The spell motion was deceptively simple, however, I was stretching my mana manipulation capabilities to the limit, trying to connect with the nature of the sky, my mana folding in complicated patterns. A sudden spark from my hand traveled to the sky. </p><p>With their attention on the escaping prisoners, the Roman mages failed to notice the spark, with a great consequence. When they noticed it, the sky was already responding to my command in the form of a crackling lightning bolt. </p><p>The sorcerer was barely able to reach, and the shield that surrounded them glowed brighter, trying to deny the judgment of the sky. </p><p>I closed my eyes. </p><p>A bright explosion filled the area, bright enough to hurt despite my eyelids, accompanied by several cries. I was glad that I had practiced this particular spell several times, which was the only reason I was able to push through the sudden sense of exhaustion to cast a duplicate, before I even opened my eyes. </p><p>I only opened my eyes after I had released the second spark, the exhaustion hitting even stronger, as I had just completed a furious dash. Technically, what I did could be counted as a furious dash. It would pass in less than a minute, as long as I limit my casting. </p><p>“Disperse!” shouted the sorcerer the moment I opened my eyes, only to see their shield still standing, although with several violent cracks threatening its strength. There was no chance it would survive a second hit. </p><p>The legionnaire mages proved their discipline by following the order, running away as quick as they could while casting their own shield spells, while the area shield of the sorcerer quickly shrunk, turning into a personal one. Merciless, but under the circumstances, quite effective. </p><p>I started running away before the second lightning bolt even connected. Their rapid reaction and their coordination impressed me enough that I didn’t dare to meet them in open combat. With the modified shield, it was certain that the sorcerer would survive, and at least some of his mages would survive as well. </p><p>Hit-and-run tactics were much better under the current circumstances. </p><p>Even as I run, I was able to observe the results of my second lightning bolt. Eight of the mages, the ones slowest to react, had turned into charred messes, too close to the epicenter of the attack to survive, even with their shields. Five more had collapsed, seemingly alive, but certainly impossible to act in a reasonable time frame. Seven of them were still alive, and in good enough condition to give me a chase. </p><p>The scariest part was the sorcerer. Despite being in the epicenter of two assaults, he was still standing, albeit swaying like he was about to collapse, no less exhausted than me. Maintaining a shield clearly took a lot from him, though not as much as for me to duel him while he still had seven experienced mages as a backup. </p><p>“Catch him!” he shouted in fury, and seven mages acted, while the sorcerer followed them in the rear. </p><p>I run, picking a route perpendicular to the city, not wanting to lead them into my base. An onslaught of spells flew toward me, a mixture of arcane bolts, fireballs, and earth spikes, forcing me to cast a shield to resist it. It was not exactly easy, making me flinch with every hit. I could have handled it with ease if I wasn’t feeling winded due to lightning bolts, but unfortunately, my exhaustion was exacting its price. </p><p>Something was needed to change the pace before the sorcerer joined the fray after he rested. “Let’s see how smart you guys are,” I murmured in frustration as I kept one hand raised to maintain my shield, while used the other one to discreetly drew an explosive rune on the nearby tree, then continued to fall back. </p><p>I managed to repeat the same trick four times when the sorcerer finally joined the game, his water spells straining the capacity of the shield to the limit. I let it throw me back, stumbling until I fell on my knees, forty yards away from the nearest rune, while the mages dashed toward me. </p><p>Once again, I thanked Jupiter for the chaotic mana environment, before I triggered them simultaneously, choosing that exact moment to cast another lightning spell, this time, creating six rotating balls of electric, each bigger than my head, crackling dangerously. Three of them aimed at the sorcerer, more to prevent him from helping the others rather than with an expectation to hurt him.</p><p>With the explosion of the trees, a rain of wooden shrapnel hit my pursuers, shredding their skin. Most of them managed to shield themselves, or were far enough to avoid the damage, but two of them were close enough to the trees to be affected by the explosion, turning into mincemeat with the following spray. </p><p>The three balls of lightning that aimed the sorcerer splashed against his shield ineffectively as I expected, but the other three worked better. Two of my targets tried to shield themselves, while the third one was too late, instead of finding himself in the arms of Pluto. One of those shields held, protecting its owner, while the other shield cracked, leaving him wounded, only to be finished by the following lightning bolt, too quick to react. </p><p>“Only four remains,” I murmured to myself, but even as I said so. After killing or disabling seventeen mages, the remaining four shouldn’t be a problem, but I wasn’t stupid enough to actually think so. I was able to take them down, only because I was able to ambush them with the magical interference, assisted by a perfectly-timed rebellion of the captives. </p><p>The real battle was about to start. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The second morning of my new school life was no different than the first, as I moved from class to class all morning, and found myself an empty table for lunch. My new friend Carrie was nowhere to be seen, which made a humorous reversal of the traditional one-night stand dynamics. </p><p>Then, I saw her at the entrance, but didn’t turn fully, just watching her from the corner of my eye, one of the skills that worked perfectly for me as a Quarterback. She watched me for almost a minute before one of her friends from yesterday —a tall, slim brunette wearing a loose flannel shirt and dirty jeans, giving a quintessential tomboy aura— whispered to her something that made her blush, and they disappeared. </p><p>When the classes ended, I was planning to leave immediately, but then my phone buzzed, showing another message from Carrie, once again asking me whether I had time to visit her in the library. Even before answering, I went to the library to check, only to see she was at the exact same desk, surrounded by the same four girls from the day before, giggling and whispering while Carrie blushed. </p><p>‘I will be there in a minute,’ I wrote, and when Carrie informed her friends, all of them except the brunette tomboy rushed away. </p><p>I gave enough time to walk away before I walked forward. “Hey, girl,” I said lazily, keeping my expression calm. </p><p>“H-hi, Chad,” Carrie stammered, blushing hard enough to make me concerned for her health. “This is Sarah, one of my best friends.” </p><p>“A pleasure,” I said and shook her hand.</p><p>“So, Carrie tells me that she made a new best friend,” she asked immediately, a hint of challenge hidden underneath her good humor. “Are we finally looking for a new member for the Misfits?”</p><p>“Sarah! You promised!” Carrie interjected, looking mortified. </p><p>“Hey, just asking,” she answered. “It’s better to ask before those simpering whores pulls him away.” </p><p>“Sarah! You!” whispered Carrie, before I cut in. </p><p>“Hey, as much as it’s entertaining to watch two beautiful ladies bicker, do you mind cluing me about what’s going on?” </p><p>Sarah opened her mouth, no doubt to deliver another biting statement, but this time, Carrie was faster. “It’s nothing, she’s just being paranoid.” </p><p>“Hey, it’s not nothing,” Sarah countered, silencing Carrie with a glare, before turning to me. “It’s the usual clique bullshit,” she said. “The popular girls hate our guts because we don’t conform their standards of being simpering idiots, so they made a mission to pull away whichever boy that becomes friendly with us, making him backstab us,” she explained. </p><p>Her pride as she said that clued me into a particular detail. “Not successfully, I’m guessing.” </p><p>“Damn right,” she said, smiling for the first time, proud of her role as the protector of their little group. </p><p>“So, you’re saying that no boy in the whole school wants to befriend you beautiful girls,” I said, smiling sincerely, which made Sarah’s eyes widen for a fleeting moment before it disappeared. Clearly, she wasn’t used to being flirted. </p><p>“None that matters, at least, not until they learn to speak without stammering,” she said, throwing a disdainful glare around the library that housed most of the silent boys. It was a hypocritical stance, decreeing the popular girls while putting down the shy nerdy boys, but not one I cared about. If those boys lacked the courage to speak, nothing could help them. </p><p>“What’s the verdict, then?” I asked, hitting her with my best smile. And while she might dress like a butch lesbian, her blush left no doubt about her sexual orientation.</p><p>Sarah did her best to look grim despite her blush, trying to intimidate me before answering. “I’ll hold the verdict for now,” she said before she turned and left, her steps lacking a feminine sway. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” Carrie said as she looked at me, begging. “She comes across gruff, but only because she’s the unofficial protector of our group.” </p><p>“No worries,” I said even as I pulled a chair and sat next to her. “So, what’s that sudden protectiveness was about? The last night?” </p><p>“N-n-no!” she stammered, her blush back with a vengeance. “I can never tell them!” </p><p>I might felt self-conscious and lashed out if I was one of those weaker boys, but instead, I decided to tease her a bit. “I see how it is, I’m your dirty little secret.” </p><p>She jumped up to her own defense. “It’s not like that-” she started, only to be cut off when I started chuckling. “Meanie,” she said as she slapped my shoulder, but she smiled, so I took that as a win. </p><p>“So, if she doesn’t know about me being your dirty little secret,” I started, earning another slap to the shoulder in the process, “why is she being so defensive.” </p><p>“Umm,” she murmured, pushing her fingers together. “She, for some reason, thought that I might be developing a tiny little … crush.” </p><p>“Which is completely baseless, of course,” I said, but my dazzling smile removed any possible sting my words might carry, leaving her with another blush rather than frustration. She was cute when teased, her blonde hair framing her cute face. The fact that I could still remember her rocking body under her unflattering clothes did help, though. </p><p>“Maybe we should start studying,” she murmured as she flipped her book open, and we started studying. I was tempted to caress her leg a bit, but thanks to my awareness, I noticed Sarah watching us being a shelf, replicating my tactic, only less successfully. So, the rest of the session was similar to yesterday, two hours of studying, followed by a dinner paid for by me. </p><p>When she started driving, however, she was decidedly silent. I sat next to her, not bothering to speak. The closer we drove, the more disappointed I felt. It seemed that she didn’t want another tutoring session, and I didn’t want to open the topic. “Do you have anything important to do?” she asked when she pulled into my driveway. </p><p>“I have my evening exercises, but nothing more,” I answered. “It’ll take a bit more than two hours, but I don’t have to start immediately.” </p><p>“Again?” she asked, and I just nodded without explaining. I didn’t want to tell her about my athletic admission to college, and I certainly didn’t want to reveal my identity as a Quarterback. There was no way Carrie could handle that particular nugget well. “Do you mind if I join you in your exercise?”</p><p>“Of course not,” I answered. Having a shy blonde alone would surely help the boredom of exercising alone. “Do you have your exercise clothes?” </p><p>“Yes, today was the gym day, and I always have a spare set of clothes just in case,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I stepped out, and she followed me inside. “Welcome to my humble abode,” I said as I opened the main door. </p><p>“Wow,” Carrie said as she looked at the place, particularly the large garden on the back, with a large pool and an equally large grass field, piled with exercise equipment. It was one good thing about my father’s job. Not only the pay was impressive, but it came with many benefits in terms of housing. Of course, the long absences due to business trips was the drawback, especially since he was a single parent, but that particular detail lost its importance as I grew older, and an empty house turned from a source of distress to a very convenient advantage, whether it was for parties, or some paired fun. </p><p>“You can use the bathroom to change,” I pointed at her while I climbed the stairs, quickly changing into my exercise clothes. When I came back, Carrie greeted me wearing her exercise clothes, which, unfortunately, consisted of baggy sweatpants and a black, formless t-shirt, not any more revealing than her usual ensemble. </p><p>Carrie, on the other hand, seemed to be impressed with my exercise clothing, which was only basketball shorts and nothing else, leaving my muscular torso naked for her enjoyment. From her gulp, I could see she was enjoying the sight. “Shall we,” I said, gesturing at the garden at the back. </p><p>Then, I started exercising under the shocking gaze of Carrie, dashing back and forth while doing complicated patterns to optimize my footwork, jumping rope, lifting weights, a grueling circuit program that stretched both my explosive force and my stamina to the limits. Carrie had been working out at first, but then, she just sat, watching my exercise with growing interest —and arousal, based on the way her legs were rubbing against each other. </p><p>As much as I was tempted to stop exercising to enjoy her growing arousal, I didn’t have the option to relax, no matter how tempting was the idea. </p><p>“And that’s it,” I finally called, covered in sweat, and turned to face Carrie, who was watching me with obvious arousal. A more confident girl might have already started masturbating, though she lacked the courage for it. “I just need to stretch now, do you want to join?” </p><p>“S-sure,” she stammered as she jumped up to her feet, the way her tits dangling despite her annoyingly baggy t-shirt. </p><p>“Follow my lead,” I said to her as I started going through a number of advanced stretching exercises, but she lacked the flexibility to follow them. “Maybe I should help you,” I said after finishing my own round while she still struggled with one of the earlier complicated exercises. </p><p>“Do you really think it’s necessary?” she asked. </p><p>“Of course, flexibility is an important part of the topics I’m teaching you,” I explained, and she blushed even further. She tried to stammer a response, but I already stood behind her, grabbing her arm to bend behind gently. “Relax, and let out your breath,” I said, quickly guiding her over several fundamental exercises, while listening to her heartbeat from her back, thumping furiously. </p><p>“It’s not working for some reason,” I murmured. </p><p>“What am I doing wrong?” she asked immediately asked, eager to fix her mistake despite her desires. </p><p>“I don’t know, let me see how your muscles stretch, so I can get a better idea,” I said, and grabbed the hem of her t-shirt and pulled it up, and she raised her arms reflexively before she understood my objective, leaving her wearing only a white sports bra, stretched to the limit to hold her beautiful tits hidden. </p><p>“W-what,” she stammered. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie,” I whispered into her ear softly, in a low, throaty voice. “It’s not like I hadn’t seen more before.” </p><p>From the way she shivered, she seemed to enjoy that particular tone, or maybe, it was the effect of my sweaty chest pressing against her back. “R-right,” she said before stiffening once again. “But we’re in public!” Which was the point, as I wanted her to be overwhelmed by the sensations this time. It was my job as her tutor to make her get used to different stuff, after all, and standing half-naked out in the open was a part of it, even if it was impossible for someone else to see her. </p><p>“Don’t worry, the fences block the sight completely,” I answered, even as I grabbed the waist of her sweatpants and pulled them down, revealing her boring panties, wide enough to cover her generous ass. Perfect for exercising, of course, but not so much for her real objective. </p><p>Her heartbeat was going crazy as I made her sit, her legs in front of her, opened ninety degrees. “Take a deep breath,  and try to touch both of your toes at the same time,” I told her. </p><p>“It’s hard,” she said after struggling to reach her toes. </p><p>“You just need to try a bit harder,” I whispered as I pressed my chest against her back once more, the weight enough to cover the difference. She gasped, with pain, but also excitement. </p><p>I was more interested in the second part. “You just need to stand like that for half a minute,” I whispered even as my hands started wandering over her breasts, imprisoned in the tight prison of her sports bra. </p><p>Her whimpers started soon, but I kept her locked under my weight, while I counted the seconds. “And that’s thirty,” I said, pulling back my weight. She looked disappointed, which was faded immediately with my next words. “Now, lay on your back,” I ordered. </p><p>She immediately followed my command, but with her eyes closed. I grabbed her leg, and pushed it up until it was perpendicular to the ground, one hand on her thigh, the other on her calf, pressing just enough to create tension. Despite her strained expression, her body betrayed her true feelings in the form of her erect nipples and the wetness of her panties. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I wasn’t excited. She wasn’t the sexiest woman I had ever seen, hell, it wasn’t even the sexiest I had seen her, but there was something delicious about the way she just lay under me, obediently and silently, following my every order without hesitation. It was not something I had experienced with my cheerleader girlfriends, always loud and opinionated, more concerned about the social credit of bagging the Quarterback than the enjoyment of the sex. </p><p>“So, are you happy with my tutoring…” I said, and while she blushed, I continued, “about exercise.” </p><p>“Y-yeah,” she stammered, but unable to hide her disappointment. She wanted a repeat of the last night, which was more than clear with her actions, but she lacked the courage to actually ask for it. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I switched the leg, and continued our stretching exercise, each position more intimate than the last, which left her burning with desire, but she still didn’t dare to ask, or take initiative. I would have left her raging with a desire to teach her a lesson, but my own very inconvenient boner convinced me otherwise. </p><p>“That’s it for today,” I called, keeping my expression smooth, struggling not to explode with laughter at her expression, like I just stole her bag of Halloween candy. </p><p>“That’s it,” she repeated, dejected. </p><p>“Yeah, let’s hit the showers,” I said, then let a wicked smile appear. “Sorry, shower,” I corrected. </p><p>“Shower,” she repeated, dejection replaced by shock. “As in singular.” </p><p>I just chuckled and started walking, enjoying the sound of her hesitant footsteps as she followed me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Shall we,” I said after we rested for about ten minutes, which allowed Titania to reasonably recover from the after-effects of her orgasm, while my mana had regenerated completely. She was leaning against the wall, with her delicious body still on display, wearing only the ruins of her skirt and her shoes. </p><p>“Are you recovered?” she asked. “Already?” </p><p>“Of course, sweet cheeks,” I answered. “You know that I recover quickly.” </p><p>“But this quickly?” she said, her expression split between shock and fascination. </p><p>“What can I say, tonight, I’m feeling rather … virile,” I answered, which earned another blush. “So, shall we?” </p><p>“Pass me my robe,” she said, once again trying to act in her commanding usual self, but that didn’t work as well with the thick blush that covered her face. </p><p>I looked at her body on display, which made her arms twitch like she wanted to cover it, no matter how unnecessary such an action would have been after our earlier mana transfer actions. I grabbed the robe from my pack and raised it, only to pull back when she reached. “Do you really need this?” I asked. </p><p>“Of course I do,” she answered. “It’s an enchanted robe, perfect for defense. I can’t assault a base without it.” </p><p>“Even if I defend you?” I asked, and she looked at me questioningly. “Your Light magic is clearly a better option against the undead, the only disadvantage is your limited mana.” </p><p>“My mana is not limited!” she answered heatedly. </p><p>“Compared to me, it is,” I countered. “What if we replicate the same trick with the air elemental, and I handle the mobility and the defense, as well as trapping the corridors in our wake, while you handle the offensive side.”  A smirk popped on my face. “And don’t worry, I’m going to make sure to use an earth spell to keep a spell to keep your body hidden from the others. I am a jealous bastard, after all.” </p><p>[+2 Speech]</p><p>She blushed as I explained, but in the end, there was no other option but to accept. Which was good, because I preferred to use that approach for multiple reasons. It was tactically advantageous, but even more importantly, it would allow me to camouflage the second milestone of the Companion Process. The fact that I would be enjoying her delicious body in the process was an excellent bonus, as always. </p><p>I presented my arm to her with an exaggerated move, like we were about to walk into a ball hosted by the Royal family, blushing spectacularly as she did so. “You have an excellent poise,” I complimented her as she put her arm. </p><p>“It’s a habit of my youth,” she answered, trying to look impervious, even doing a half-decent job of it. Her adaptability was impressive. Though I chuckled, as talking about her youth while she was barely thirty —and definitely not showing it— was rather hilarious. </p><p>We walked in silence, though she examined the walls as we did so. “Impressive work, considering the environmental limitations,” she said. “Though I would be surprised if they could stand at the end of the month.” </p><p>“Two weeks is a more reasonable estimation,” I corrected her, even as I occasionally reinforced a rune or added another trap. It wasn’t a structure built to last, after all. “What do you think about the balancing structure of this part?” I asked, launching an intellectual discussion as we moved deeper underground, each step bringing us closer to the undead base.</p><p>[+3 Arcana]</p><p>As much as I enjoyed the discussion, when we stood in front of the entrance, it was the time for action. “Ready?” I asked as we stood. She nodded. “We need to be quick,” I explained. “I’m going to move us without stopping, just focus on killing the greatest number of undead possible, I’ll handle sniping the necromancers,” I said. I expected her light magic to work much better in dealing area-effect damage, even with my temporary Fire Magic skill, acquired from Cornelia. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t change the fact that at this point, I was stronger than Titania with a significant margin. Not only I could overwhelm her in terms of burst damage —fifty points of Charisma was definitely no joke— but also I was miles ahead of her in terms of utility and other abilities. That also didn’t mean she was useless, as with me properly supplying her with mana, she was a veritable weapon of area denial, especially against undead and other creatures vulnerable to her Light Magic. </p><p>“Wouldn’t it better to focus on the necromancers and the bigger creatures?” she asked. </p><p>“Not entirely,” I answered. “I can handle taking the necromancers while you focus on the mass creatures, but trying to take down the bigger creatures would require too much effort.” </p><p>“I can take them in seconds,” she argued. </p><p>“Yes, you can,” I said even as I bobbed her nose, enjoying her blush. Teasing her was fun! “However, that would drain your magic too quickly, and while my regeneration is not slow, it’s also not instantaneous. Pausing to recover would ruin our strategy. They have no reason to bring out their weaker zombies for their daily operations, and if we could cleanse the majority of them, it would help us.” </p><p>“But they wouldn’t be a threat against the school. There’s no chance they could penetrate the wards, and even if they did, our mages could easily cleanse them.” </p><p>“You’re missing something,” I reminded her. “What if they use those zombies to attack the other settlements. They could use the horde to siege every town simultaneously, forcing us to disperse our forces to defend them, or risk isolating the school forever logistically. Even worse, they could use the weaker monsters to conceal their real assault forces, and we would have no idea the true danger until we could face them properly.” </p><p>She ducked her head, blushing in shame. “I didn’t think of that,” she said, which didn’t surprise me. She might be a spectacular mage, but when it came to strategy, she lacked nuance, preferring to burn forward like her own magic. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked again, and when she nodded, I created another pseudo-elemental, however, this time it wasn’t air but earth. It would be slower, but with the added benefit of bypassing the walls and taking shortcuts at impossible locations. However, it was surrounded by a subtle air spell, to prevent the smell of the undead to reach our nose. It even had a throne-like chair on the top, which I sat on immediately before patting my lap. </p><p>[-1374 Mana]</p><p>She blushed, but followed my invitation, slowly lowering herself to my erection, gasping as her wetness wrapped my girth. “Ready,” she approved, looking ahead. Once we took a seat, walls appeared around us, sufficiently hiding us from the view while allowing us to attack with our magic. Essentially, it was an unholy mixture of a mobile fort and a love nest. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>Her high level was definitely convenient for development, I surmised, even as my arms tightened around her. “Hold on, it’s going to be a wild ride,” I whispered. </p><p>Our first destination was the huge army gathering spot I had discovered at the entrance, filled with thousands upon thousands of zombies and skeletons, hundreds of bone dragons, a variety of other creatures, and a veritable necromancer sea to control them. It wasn’t the safest place to hit, but the later we hit there, the harder our job would be. In terms of benefits, it was the most important area. </p><p>If we were hitting this place during the day, the necromancer’s central meeting spot might have been a better location, but unlike the zombies, they had the ability to counter my spells, so I wasn’t really willing to risk it. </p><p>I used my biomancy to check our surroundings, and the elemental mount moved slowly toward the meeting location, using a deserted path. “In five seconds,” I warned her. “Start casting.” </p><p>Since we were connected, I could feel her mana draining with an alarming speed as a rotating glow appeared in her hand, drawing complicated patterns. I could feel that it consumed about the same mana as the spell she used against the Darkness Wyvern, but the spell itself was several times more complicated. </p><p>The impact of it justified it. When we burst into the huge opening, we came across a necromancer, who looked at us with empty eyes, trying to process. He was still trying to understand it, when I lobbed his head with a ranged air spell before he could even react, the blood spraying. He was clearly a novice, as his transformation had barely started. </p><p>[-63 Mana]</p><p>I managed to take down two other necromancers the next second before they could react, one of them failed to react, and the other managed to raise a shield, but it might as well be a piece of glass against my attack. </p><p>The third one was able to raise an alarm, but it was too late. Titania’s spell was complete. She sent a hand-sized orb toward the center of the room, reminding me of an overgrown firefly, beautiful yet ultimately useless. That was the impression for my eyes, of course. </p><p>For my magical senses, it was burning like a secondary sun, fascinatingly-complicated even if it was unraveling as it moved. It was one advantage of specialization, I guessed. I doubted I could cast a spell that complicated without years of training. </p><p>Luckily, I had many options to cheat. </p><p>It finally triggered, several yards before its ultimate location, when one of the larger bone dragons tried to bat it away like it was a simple toy. A bright explosion covered the area, accompanied by the cacophony of cries so loud that it forced to cast a spell to block the disgusting sound. </p><p>Titania was gasping in exhaustion. “Excellent work,” I whispered to Titania as I grabbed her breasts and started pumping, also casting a healing spell to take the edge. Rest until I gave the signal, then repeat it,” I asked even as I pumped her with a fresh flood of mana. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 48%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience] </p><p>[-974 Mana]</p><p>I led the earth elemental through the middle of the zombies, which was attacking us mindlessly, unaware of the significance of the explosions. The bone dragons, and the other undead with rudimentary intelligence and self-preservation, however, were pulling back in what could be termed as panic if it was shown by a living creature. </p><p>Necromancers, on the other hand, were in a full-blown rout. Protecting the great collection area was nothing more than grunt work, therefore, assigned to the lowest ones in the totem pole of hierarchy. Some tried to attack, their necrotic bolts splashing helplessly against the walls of my construct, while others run away. </p><p>“Let’s add some heat to their panic,” I whispered, earning a glare from Titania even as I pounded her furiously, no doubt thinking that a deadly combat was no place for one-liners. </p><p>I disagreed. “What was the point of being strong if I’m not going to posture for a sexy woman,” I said to her, making her stammer. She was cute, feeling shy being called sexy when she was being impaled repeatedly. And while teasing her was fun, I had more immediate concerns to focus, such as necromancers, finally deploying a half-decent defense. </p><p>A lich stood in the middle of a circle, leading a ritual using the energy of the seven other necromancers spread around. I felt Titania stiffen, no doubt flashing back to the fateful day of our meeting, where she had almost died in a similar combination assault. </p><p>However, there was one huge difference. That day, they were the ambushers, and their ward was already charged, circumventing the biggest disadvantage. This time, they were playing catch-up. </p><p>Pity that they had no chance of succeeding. A fire dragon, mixed with a generous dash of life energy to prevent them from standing up saw to that. </p><p>[-531 Mana]</p><p>Before they could even raise a shield, the dragon slammed against them, breaking the node. The failure of their own spell was likely to destroy their bodies, and with my inferno, it was a done deal. “It’s time for a second spell,” I reminded her, and after ten seconds, another explosion of light occurred, this time spreading even larger, destroying another chunk of low-level zombies. </p><p>This time, I pushed her down until she crouched on all fours, slamming repeatedly to refill her mana, while also enjoying the way she gripped my shaft while she climbed toward her orgasm, clearly enjoying the new way of battle as much as I was enjoying, confirmed by the notification I had just received. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated.

What do you think?”</p><p>Looking at her excited eyes, I didn’t need her to answer to turn back, prepared for a fresh battle.  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 29    Experience: 434500 / 435000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 41</p><p>HP: 4756 / 4756 Mana: 4215 / 6003        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [86/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [62/75]</p><p>Basic Craft [0/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>There were many interesting things going in my mind as we traveled toward the huge base of the necromancers, but coincidentally, none of them was about the undead we would have to face. Not when I had just got ridden of the panties of Titania, fingering her mercilessly. Most of my attention was on the amazing sensation that covered my fingers. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>[-256 Mana]</p><p>However, a part of it was focused on a related, but very important problem. </p><p>The Companion Acquisition Process. </p><p>Even with Cornelia, introducing the system had been a relatively simple affair, that while I didn’t trust her entirely, I was relieved by the fact that she had no choice but to rely on me for the power she searched. </p><p>The same didn’t apply to Titania. While my assistance was critical, it was only until the current crisis was resolved, one way or another. Even worse was the presence of the headmistress, with her unknown strength and her ability to assess soul spaces. The ancient witch was truly dangerous. </p><p>However, to make things even worse, even with the looming potential threat of the Headmistress, I had to continue. For better or worse, I had already triggered the process, and it had created its unique node in Titania, which might have been already discovered by the Headmistress. The only thing I could do under the circumstances was to push forward, and hope either Headmistress doesn’t make a habit of checking Titania’s soul space regularly, or, in the case of discovery, she would entertain my offer of alliance enough to ignore I boned her subordinate repeatedly… </p><p>That left only one problem. I still didn’t want to alert Titania until it was too late, so I needed to hide the source of her first achievement. So, rather than pushing inside her immediately to quench my throbbing shaft, I waited until the perfect opportunity, fingering her in the process, as well as deploying enough mana to suppress her emotional blocker. </p><p>Her resulting moans were spectacular, so was her distinct lack of complaint. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>[-411 Mana]</p><p>I saw the opportunity in the form of a Darkness Wyvern, preparing to dive toward us immediately. It had a scary reputation in a similar vein to Shadow Wolf, only several times larger in scale. After all, despite its intimidating skill set, Shadow Wolf was a class nine creature, meaning its danger to real powerhouses was limited, and it culled the weak. </p><p>Darkness Wyvern was the opposite. It was a high-class creature, usually above twenty-five, some even passing thirty, and like the Shadow Wolf, it was an ambush hunter. Unlike the wolf, it had a more select palette, only hunting people with overwhelming strength, rarely attacking anyone below level twenty. Luckily, it was a rare creature. </p><p>And, even better, I wasn’t afraid of it thanks to my skill set, allowing me to both detect it easily and assault it with ranged options. I even achieved something most thought as impossible, and noticed it as it prepared its dive, rather than just before its claws connected. With that, it wasn’t a threat, because its explosive attacking ability wasn’t matched by its defensive traits. </p><p>Just as it was about to dive, I pulled my shaft free, and plunged it in Titania, earning a loud moan as she was assaulted by the familiar presence of my invasion. “Did you miss it?” I whispered as she tightened around it. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 24%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[-217 Mana]</p><p>“O-of course not,” she stammered. “It’s just for the mana, and nothing-” she tried to continue, but I cut her off. </p><p>“Look out,” I cried as I wrapped one hand around her waist as I ordered the air elemental to move to the side, dodging the dive attack at the last second. “Attack,” I ordered, while casting an earth elemental spell, summoning several pillars around the creature to pin it in place, strong enough to resist its furious thrashing. </p><p>[-651 Mana]</p><p>For her credit, Titania didn’t waste a second despite the extreme situation and raised her hand, sending a ray of light that cut through the darkness of the night, filled with a scary amount of mana, even as I continued to pump in her. I could feel a huge chunk of her mana, almost half, disappear in one spell, but not without its reward. The moment it connected with the Darkness Wyvern, the creature burned immediately, leaving a pile of ash behind. Damn, I thought, pitying the waste. Even with the strength of her spell, I wasn’t expecting such a result, but maybe, Darkness Wyvern was weak against her light magic, to the point of ruining it completely, leaving no hopes of extracting any materials. </p><p>Still, the notification that popped told me that I fulfilled my primary aim, so all was well. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25% - First Stage Completed +5000 Exp]</p><p>She made no mention of an achievement —which didn’t surprise me— as she gave an order. “Let’s go back, we alerted the necromancers to our presence.” </p><p>“No,” I said even as I started pumping inside her. </p><p>“W-what do you mean, no,” she stammered as she turned to look at me, forcing her to turn at the waist as my hands were still firmly on her hips, preventing her from moving. </p><p>“It’s an excellent opportunity,” I explained while I directed our mount to take an alternative route to our secret entrance. “No matter what, the surprise effect of our assault will fade in a few seconds. If they increase the guards at the entrance, it’s even better for us, as we’re going to use a hidden entrance.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to speak, only to be silenced when I ripped her top without a warning, leaving her only with her bra. </p><p>“No, the plan is solid. Now, we need to focus on recovering your mana,” I explained before I silenced her with a kiss, transferring a great amount of mana in the process to fill her drained mana reserves. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 27%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[-216 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Speech]</p><p>One good advantage of the changed route was that it gave me a chance to enjoy Titania as we travel. She was a spectacular sight, her alabaster skin shining under the moonlight, wearing nothing but a bra and a bunched-up skirt that revealed her delicious legs, while I continued to pump her. </p><p>I pulled out of the kiss, pulled her on my lap more comfortably, pumping in a leisure manner. She caught flatfooted by the sudden change, but made no attempt to change her position, no doubt convincing herself that it was for the mana only, though the way she tightened around me betrayed her enjoyment. I could easily imagine her staying on my lap silently for the rest of the route, trying to act impervious as much as possible. </p><p>I had no intention of allowing that, not when I finally have it under my hand. </p><p>“So, are you comfortable with the position,” I asked even as I lazily pumped her, each push slowly filling her mana. </p><p>“W-what,” she stammered as she tried to adjust her position, feeling self-aware, but didn’t pull out. I slipped my hands underneath her skirt to rest on her hips, enjoying the way her ass clenched under my touch. </p><p>“I’m asking whether you’re feeling comfortable, or whether we should push for a change of position?” I asked. “Maybe you want to lay down and I take you in missionary, or maybe you want to ride me in cowgirl? Or maybe I take you from behind while you lay on all fours?”</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 29%]</p><p>[+600 Experience]</p><p>[-135 Mana] </p><p>“T-that’s not necessary,” she managed to stammer, even though her blush intensified with every whisper of a new position, her eyes losing focus as she fell into the imagination. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, though that was by no means was a reason to stop my meddling. I grabbed the hem of her skirt, and after a pull, ripped most of it off, turning it into a miniskirt that would barely hide her ass, and that was only when she was standing perfectly still. It was delicious. And even better, this time, she didn’t even complain. “This is better, right?” I asked, pushing my luck enthusiastically. “This way, it’ll not get in the way.” </p><p>“Y-yeah,” she stammered and answer, doing her best not to moan, but failing spectacularly.  </p><p>“Good,” I said even as I returned my hand to her hips, continuing to pump as I enjoyed her wetness gushing around. “You just need to suffer for another five minutes, and then we’ll arrive at the secret entrance, you can handle it, right?” </p><p>“I can,” she whispered, her eyes closed, feeling more self-conscious after my questions, which was the aim in the first place. I didn’t want her to let her go dazed, I wanted her to enjoy every single detail. </p><p>For the rest of the journey, it continued at the same pace. I stayed slotted inside her, pumping gently, while she did her best to act like it wasn’t affecting her —and failing terribly. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 33%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[-291 Mana]  </p><p>“We’re here,” I told her as we arrived at the entrance of the cave, and dispelled the air elemental, glad that its drain was much more manageable thanks to my improved abilities. Unlike before, I still had almost half of my reserves even with all the mana I transferred. </p><p>Multiple active regeneration perks were certainly useful. </p><p>My feet touched the floor, but I didn’t let hers touch. Instead, I hooked my arms under her knees, forcing her legs to open to the limit, her body lighter than a feather thanks to my strength. “L-let me walk,” she stammered. </p><p>“No,” I simply said as we walked at the cave, and rather than continuing, I stood in the middle of the cave. “We still need to fill your reserves completely before we can act.” </p><p>“The position is weird,” she whispered, admitting. </p><p>“Sure, let me fix it,” I said as I grabbed her waist, and turned her 180 degrees, so that she was facing me, before I rammed her again. Her legs wrapped around me reflexively, and our eyes met, allowing me to read her emotions. </p><p>Frustration, because she was being betrayed by her own body as her entrance tightened around me, slippery wet. </p><p>Humiliation, because she was feeling a lack of control, turning her into a toy despite all her might. </p><p>Excitement, because of the stirrings of a way of life she had never imagined before. </p><p>Pleasure, because as I picked up speed, she was losing control of her own thoughts, overwhelmed with pleasure. </p><p>Then, I exploded, filling her insides with my seed and mana in equal amount, the torrent of liquid sweeping her conflicting emotions, leaving pure ecstasy behind as she climaxed, making her forget every single unimportant detail, from her position to impending deadly assault, making her focus on the reactions of her own body, her arms and legs tightening around. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 38%]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>[-611 Mana]  </p><p>“Not a bad way to recover, right,” I commented lazily, enjoying the way she tried to calm her expression, only to fail spectacularly. I wanted to tease her, ask her whether she liked my cock, but I had a feeling it was still slightly early to break the illusion of mana recovery assistance. She knew the truth, and I certainly knew the truth, however, speaking the truth still ruined the comfortable illusion that was established, one that was still necessary. </p><p>Pity we didn’t have a bed in here, as I would have loved to enjoy an extended holiday. </p><p>However, just because we didn’t have a bed, or I still needed to maintain the illusion, didn’t mean that I couldn’t push my luck a bit more. I finally let her go, and she stood straight, her legs trembling, my cum sliding down her inner thigh. “You’re still not full, right?” I asked, despite knowing the answer.</p><p>“No, I’m at two-thirds,” she answered. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I cast a spell against the wall, turning its rough natural surface into a smooth layer that would rival the best marble. “I want you to remove your bra, then go and lean against the wall, and push your ass out.” </p><p>[-4 Mana]</p><p>The position certainly wasn’t the craziest we had done together, but there was a big distinction. Until this moment, everything we had done together, she had been a passive participant, following my every whim and nothing else, like a leaf caught in the wind. This time, however, while still under my orders, she needed to take the action herself, with the full realization of what was about to follow. </p><p>Her stiff expression suggested that she was very much aware of that particular nugget. After all, she might be inexperienced in managing her emotions, but she was a very smart woman, and understood what was going on. And after several repeats, the pleasures of the flesh weren’t so novel that it would blanket her decision-making process completely. </p><p>She was still in control. </p><p>Still, she walked toward the new wall I constructed, her hips dancing invitingly, her hands reaching back to remove her bra, before she tossed it on the side. She did look at me questioningly when I cast a fire spell to burn it. “It’s better if we don’t leave any evidence,” I explained, like a sculpted wall —or a secret tunnel— wasn’t evidence. </p><p>She leaned against the wall, her tits pressing against the cold surface, her hands stilted to support. “Good,” I whispered as I stalked toward her, enjoying the sight of her puffed lips, her short skirt barely able to cover the upper side of her hips with the angle. “Now, bring your hand down and separate your lips, so that I can slide in.” </p><p>[+3 Speech]</p><p>Once again, it was not a functional request, but a test of my control over her. Even more beautifully, she followed the order immediately, widening her slit enough to reveal her soft flesh, begging for my presence. “Beautiful,” I gasped, fascinated by her obedience even more than her beauty. </p><p>Then, I pushed, my shaft disappearing inside her inch by inch, slow enough to savor it. She swallowed all without the slightest issue, almost sucking me in. Her wetness making it even easier. “Faster,” she moaned, and I gasped in shock. She turned to face me, frozen by her own reaction, though she was quick to recover. “T-the sooner my mana recover, the sooner we can attack them,” she gasped, even though her tone indicated that she didn’t have the slightest conviction behind her latest excuse. </p><p>“As you wish, sweet cheeks,” I said, spanking her ass to leave no ambiguity about which cheeks I was talking about, before I slammed hard inside her, and a cry of pleasure escaped her mouth, loud enough to make me glad the wards in the cave included silencing charms. </p><p>“Do it,” she groaned as I slammed, again and again, my spear dominating the battle, leaving her no option but to surrender to pleasure. “Faster, harder.” </p><p>Following her request, I started a merciless assault to her entrance, each slam making her tremble, pushing her to the limits. And unlike the other magically inclined girls, her physical stats were quite a bit more developed, allowing me to truly ravage her. </p><p>She was doing her best to handle the assault, huffing, puffing, moaning, crying, and even begging, all for her search for a release, while I slammed her repeatedly, filling her with mana until she was filled to the brim.   </p><p>It was another test, to see whether she would ask me to stop now that her mana reserves were completely full. However, from the way her moans exploded, I doubted that it was even an option in her mind. Several minutes later, I exploded inside her, triggering another orgasm in her. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 45%]</p><p>[+2500 Experience]</p><p>[-1396 Mana]</p><p>My seed was once again accompanied by a flood of mana. However, since her reserves were already full, I decided to leverage it a different way. I continued to inject mana, however, used it to envelope her emotion-blocking perk, essentially warding it up so that it would be impossible to affect her anymore. For all intents and purposes, it was destroyed. </p><p>[Achievement: Stolen Servant.

It was a spectacular gain in terms of benefits, but also, it finally gave me a few more clues about my system. The term Acolyte seemed technical enough to give me a starting point, and the huge rewards suggested that it was pretty important to do so. </p><p>In contrast, skill selection was easier. As much as I was tempted to select Tantric, it was still sufficient for my needs. On the contrary, Craft might provide me with the edge I require, allowing me to prepare against the challenges beforehand. </p><p>I pulled out, hugging her to prevent her from collapsing, intent on taking a couple of minutes of rest, allowing her to recover while I regenerated mana. </p><p>A dangerous battle awaited us. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 29    Experience: 421500 / 435000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 41</p><p>HP: 4756 / 4756\tMana: 2475 / 6003        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [86/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [62/75]</p><p>Basic Craft [0/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the morning, once again chained with the magic-suppressing chains —though not effective anymore— when I felt the alarm ward I had established at the entrance trigger. It was a bit early for Aria to visit, but still, I prepped myself. She must be anxious to talk. I looked at the door, excited to meet with Aria, curious about her reaction after the things had ended yesterday.</p><p>Which was why I was surprised when the door opened, only to reveal Isolde, already in full gear, looking at me angrily. </p><p>“Good morning, sunshine,” I chirped, making her frown even deeper. “What brought you to my humble abode?” </p><p>She stalked toward me in determining steps, her expression serious enough to give me a stirring of fear if I was still lacking magic. “I have a few questions, and for your sake, you better answer them quickly,” she said, and just to underline her statement, she kicked me on my ribs. </p><p>I used my magic to drain the impact, but made a show of gasping. Still, after that, I chuckled. “You’re a bit slow, aren’t you, sunshine?” I said, meeting her fury with naked amusement. She kicked me again. “Feel free to kick me as much as you want, but how do you think your precious Lancelot would react if he knew you have put me out of commission once again. I don’t think you have any credit.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” she answered immediately, her expression proud. “He trusts me immensely. Why would he trust me with an important mission if he didn’t trust me?” </p><p>“He’s sending you to a mission?” I asked curiously. “He’s not actually coming with you?” </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered proudly, pushing her chest out proudly like a raw recruit who just earned the praise of her drill sergeant. “He trusts me to handle it on my own.” </p><p>I chuckled in good humor, like I just saw a child perform an amusing trick. “It’s cute that you think so,” I murmured lazily, like I didn’t even care if she heard me or not. Of course, that made her pay attention to it.</p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, even as she kicked me on the ribs, her insecurity was clear. </p><p>“Nothing,” I said dismissively, knowing that the value of my statement would have only gotten stronger with it. It was a basic manipulation tactic. Of course, since it was basic, it wouldn’t work on someone more used to intrigue. Even Emma would have noticed it —though Aria would likely fall to it as well, considering the trick that led to my victory on that area. </p><p>She bristled insecurely. “Tell me,” she said, but this time, refrained from kicking me, which must be the equivalent of begging under the current circumstances. </p><p>“Well,” I murmured. “I just found it interesting that he’s sending you away to a mission when both Aria and Emma are going to stay back to accompany him. Isn’t this a bit … I don’t know, convenient.” </p><p>“Of course not, he trusts me, that’s why he’s sending me away to this important mission!” she stated loudly, a volume that was only necessary when the speaker was feeling vulnerable, and trying to conceal it with her loudness. She was daring me to disagree. </p><p>Which was why I did the exact opposite. “If you say so,” I said, feigning disinterest. </p><p>“It’s not true,” she repeated, looking for an argument. </p><p>I had never paid any real attention to Isolde when I still ruled the Darklands. Yes, she was a spectacular pathfinder, able to find her way in even the most dangerous wilderness. Even worse, she had all the hallmarks of a deadly assassin, able to move silently in any environment, with an impeccable aim with her bow, enough to hit a target from miles away. Unfortunately, she was ultimately hampered by her own straightforward personality and her misplaced sense of honor, ensuring she would never rise above a foot soldier in the grand scheme of things. </p><p>But after my surprise capture, things were a bit different, which was why I was willing to analyze her. And what I found was amusing. She was clearly feeling insecure with her role now that their days of adventure were over, and they were slowly transitioning into the palace life, where her skills were going to be completely useless, and her combative personality was a liability. It didn’t take a genius to realize her aggression came from the creeping insecurity, leaving her life in doubt. </p><p>“It’s not true, right?” she murmured again, hoping for a response, but my uncaring yet confident smile damaged her much more than any argument could. “It’s not true!” she cried. “I can prove myself if I can finish the mission quickly,” she stated, remembering her reason to arrive. “And you’re going to tell me how to approach your hoard,” she said, cracking her knuckles. </p><p>“And what are you going to give me in exchange,” I suddenly said. </p><p>“What?” she gasped. </p><p>“Well, you’re asking me to provide you information that would help you elevate your position, what are you going to give me in exchange,” I asked. </p><p>“How about a painless day,” she said as she loomed above me, preparing for another kick, unaware that none of them worked thanks to my subtle magical shield. </p><p>“Pass,” I said, bored. “After all those days, you can’t possibly think that you can get me to confess anything with a couple of kicks.” </p><p>“What if I go more serious,” she said, suddenly pulling a knife, like that was supposed to be threatening. She lacked the experience to hurt me without being deadly, and they could never dare to kill me. Not with their desire for the Eternal Core. </p><p>“You can never do that, not with my leverage,” I answered. </p><p>She laughed derisively. “What leverage. You’re like a dog, chained against a wall, doing nothing but yapping as I kick you,” she said, kicking me just to underline her statement. </p><p>Rather than crying, I laughed. “Well, that convinced me, I’ll talk…” I said, and she smiled, only to fade again with my next words. “To Emma.” </p><p>“You can’t do that!” she exclaimed. </p><p>“Why not?” I said. “I’m doing what you guys want and revealing my secrets, after all. Maybe the Queen even give me a more comfortable bed in exchange.” She looked at me in shock, finally realizing my leverage. It wasn’t a group interrogation anymore. “Wouldn’t it be fun,” I continued, ignoring her distress. “I’ll tell Emma everything about the hiding place and the way to it in exchange for some trivial rewards, and you can stay in the palace rather than going all the way to discover the route. Of course, I don’t know how your precious Lancelot would react to it. </p><p>“But…” she murmured, only to fade helplessly, defeated. I couldn’t help but feel disappointed. She didn’t even try to act like it wouldn’t bother her. I wouldn’t have believed her, of course, but that didn’t mean she shouldn’t at least tried. </p><p>“Well, luckily for you, I’m not an evil man,” I said. She looked at me hopefully while I did my best to suppress my mirth at my own statement, which might be the most bald-faced lie I had ever told. “Maybe we can come to an agreement.” </p><p>“What do you want?” she asked. </p><p>“What can you give?” I countered. </p><p>“I can get you food,” she offered. “It must be hard to live on with the meager prison gruel,” she said, with no small derision in her tone. </p><p>Admittedly, it was not a bad idea. Nobles were conditioned to enjoy the finer things in life, and even without their poor attempts of torture, I could easily imagine a noble willing to compromise for some semi-decent food. For someone that lived off the land whenever she scouted, there was no surprise why Isolde would feel disregard for such decadence. </p><p>“That would be nice,” I said, and her face was alight with victory, no doubt assuming that I was no different than those other nobles thanks to my fake background. “I naturally have my own conditions, of course,” I added, which clamped her excitement quite a bit. “I want you to feed me by hand.” </p><p>“You want me to … feed you,” she muttered, like she was unable to believe what she had just heard. “Ridiculous!” </p><p>“If you say so,” I answered indulgently and leaned back, my eyes closed to signal the end of the discussion. She tried to argue against it for the next five minutes, offering many enticing foods and shouting threats in rotation, even slipping a few kicks into the mix. She didn’t have much before leaving for her mission, so her surrender arrived. </p><p>“Okay,” she finally muttered in defeat, though still bristling. “I’ll be back in ten minutes.” With that, I watched her disappear quickly, giving me a fleeting glimpse of her toned legs and perfect ass wrapped in her leather pants. </p><p>Despite seemingly getting such a simple reward for revealing the secrets of the destination, I didn’t feel like I got a losing deal. After all, it was just the first step of my plan. Unlike Aria, Isolde wasn’t both submissive and weak, so pushing the situation to the extreme wouldn’t have worked. Unlike Emma, she wasn’t under the impression that she had committed a mistake so bad that nothing other than the location of the Eternal Core could resolve, which she desired to take with her horrible mental attitude. Unlike Sapphire, she wasn’t caught in the middle of a situation that would ruin her reputation while being dangled her hopes… </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that my trade was a simple trade to humiliate her. No, it was bait to pull her deeper into the waters. Getting a more detailed breakdown of the surroundings would make her job so much easier, but that meant that she wouldn’t be able to replicate the same feat for the next location —and there would be the next location thanks to my deal with the Queen. For the first time, it was just a nice-to-have. As she continued to display her amazing performance, my insider information would get more and more vital, especially when I added some fake self-destruction schemes in my information that required them to move fast. </p><p>Of course, when Isolde burst in, carrying a fancy plate filled with fruits and pastries, she was happy, unaware of the slippery nature of the slope. </p><p>“Here,” she said as she placed the table on my lap, looking despondent as she did so, maybe hoping that the smell of it would prove to be tempting enough to remove my last request. Unfortunately for her, I just opened my mouth, and waited. </p><p>She grunted angrily as she grabbed the pastry hard enough to squish it. “Slowly,” I warned her. “Either properly feed me like a decent maid, or leave and abandon our little deal. There’s nothing I can do if you can’t take a dish of humility for your ultimate objective. Maybe you just leave your precious Lancelot for that redheaded witch to take. She is fiery enough to handle him.” </p><p>That earned another kick in the ribs, but since it was lacking in power, I just chuckled, not even bothering to acknowledge it. “You’re a bastard,” she growled. </p><p>“I know, honey, I know…” I answered before opening my mouth once more. This time, she fed me a small piece of fruit with her trembling fingers, barely able to keep herself back. I was tempted to tease her further, but she was already on the edge, so I let it go, and slowly explained the surrounding area and the traps around. Most of the information was already provided to the Queen, but from her lack of realization, I understood that the information was not shared. </p><p>A nice precaution, considering our working relationship with the Queen was yet to be established properly. She clearly wanted to use the opportunity to validate the trip… </p><p>As Isolde fed me the last bite, I had finished giving her all the information required, and she was preparing to leave. But maybe… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I spent the rest of the month after the lucky break with the library wards alternatively between studying the precious information trove and practicing my new spells, pushing my lightning abilities to the limit. Luckily, I had two companions who were enthusiastic about dealing with all the stress resulting from studying. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one that saw incredible improvement in my power. Lillian had adapted to her new mana manipulation technique with great enthusiasm. According to her claims, it was like finally eating proper food after starving for days, even though I doubted she even starved in her life. Regardless of the accuracy of her metaphor, there was no doubt about her improvement. </p><p>Though in terms of improvement, Astrid’s record was far more impressive. Lillian got stronger, but she already had decent control over her magic, so her improvement, however impressive, was limited. Not so for Astrid, who never had systematic training. Having a holistic mana technique allowed her strength to skyrocket, to a point that she was able to strain Lillian during their practice duels, not to mention her own druidism-based skills had shown a marked improvement. </p><p>I doubted their improvement just because of their new mana technique, as I could still feel the connection between our magic whenever we had sex, but since I was unable to discover anything solid about it, only some fractured clues. </p><p>But our long retreat had other benefits, almost as important as the power improvement. After our long escape, it finally allowed us to relax, to a point that I was starting to hope the mystery of the mountain convinced Lillian’s kidnapper about our death. </p><p>And what a delicious retreat it was, I thought even as I pushed Lillian’s head down, forcing her to swallow more of my shaft while Astrid’s lips pressed against my neck, treating me with a delicious massage. She gagged and gasped around my girth, but after a month filled with debauchery, she was showing impressive ease as she swallowed me deep enough for her nose to press against my skin. </p><p>“Demolish this bitch,” Astrid murmured gleefully between kisses, her naked tits deliciously pressing against my back. </p><p>“Still bitter about the duel,” I countered, which earned a hard bite on the soft skin that connected my neck to my shoulder. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” I warned her even as I pushed deeper into Lillian’s throat, her grip soft and snug. Another stab of pain hit me, this time with Lillian digging her fingers to my leg, trying to regain my attention. I pulled her hair hard, but she only moaned harder, her blue eyes shining with pleasure whenever she was able to crack them open. </p><p>“Please,” Lillian begged as I pulled her hair, forcing her to stand up. Astrid was quick to take her position while I made eye contact with Lillian, her huge tits wrapped around my wet shaft, the crown captured between her lips. “Slut,” she murmured, looking at Astrid with playful anger. </p><p>Astrid didn’t even bother to use her words to answer her, scoffing lightly when she slid her fingers inside Lillian, easily invading her depths with three. Lillian moaned, which earned another derisive chuckle from Astrid as she collapsed next to her. </p><p>Astrid pulled her fingers out of her wetness, only to plunge them into Lillian’s mouth. Lillian moaned with glee. “Yeah,” I commented in amusement. “Clearly, Astrid is the only slut here.” </p><p>“Shut up,” Lillian managed to stammer as Astrid alternating between dipping her fingers inside her forcing her to lick. She was already charged with the earlier deep throating, and the familiar invasion of Astrid’s fingers worked wonders. Soon, her song changed. “Harder,” she begged. </p><p>It was another facet of our growing relationship that Astrid didn’t reject her, or tried to mock her for her weakness, instead teasing her core mercilessly. She had learned her lesson the hard way that what came around went around, thanks to an hour-long edge-play from Lillian while she begged for a release. </p><p>But when Lillian collapsed backward, trembling, her legs parted open, I had no more time for amusing introspection. Instead, I gestured Astrid to pull back, and took my position between her legs, my shaft widening her entrance. </p><p>Astrid kissed me furiously while I stopped pushing, just enjoying the position. Lillian tried to push herself forward —which was hard with her trembling body— when I actually pulled back, maintaining the status quo. </p><p>“Please,” Lillian begged, while we stopped the kiss and looked at her mockingly. “Please push your giant weapon inside me, ravage me, invade me-” Lillian begged. I was curious how long I could make her beg this time, but Astrid silenced her by sitting on her face. </p><p>“Loud bitch, isn’t s-SHE!” Astrid tried to mock her, only to end with a cry of her own as Lillian’s tongue traced her entrance. After a month of leisure sex sessions, Lillian had learned many tricks to silence Astrid as well.  </p><p>Still, based on the loudness of Astrid’s cries, I could see that Lillian was pulling all the stops, the magic in her tongue thick enough to be noticed as well. “Such a dedicated slut,” I mocked, and Lillian moaned in anticipation as I started pushing into her wet slit. </p><p>I gripped Astrid’s tits, enjoying their firmness as well as her cries getting louder, appreciating my involvement as much as Lillian enjoyed my thick girth forcing her to widen once more. </p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Astrid moaned as she struggled under our combined assault, joining Lillian’s muffled yelps as I pounded her hard enough to make the bed crack dangerously. I even stopped to cast a repair spell just to make sure the bed that suffered under such a heavy strain for the last month would survive our naked cuddling afterward. Sleeping together had become a norm, which added a domestic twist to our otherwise extraordinary life. </p><p>Weirdly, I enjoyed it almost as much as I enjoyed drilling Lillian mercilessly while she licked Astrid to an explosive climax. I alternatively quickened and slowed down, making her struggle even more poignant, her wetness dripping down to drench the bed, while Astrid’s juices covered her face. </p><p>“Damn, I’m getting close,” Astrid moaned, her pouty lips begging for a kiss, which I was happy to fulfill. I kissed her hard, my tongue dancing inside her mouth while Lillian’s tongue danced inside her. </p><p>Under attack from both sides, it didn’t take long for her body to lose its tightness, and she collapsed next to Lillian, gasping and trembling. “W-weak-” Lillian tried to mock her, only to stop when I leaned down to steal a kiss, ravaging her mouth while enjoying Astrid’s remaining aroma.  </p><p>“I’m going to turn you into a mess,” I promised her between kisses. </p><p>“And I’m going to drain you until you are nothing more than a shriveled husk, kept for my amusement,” she moaned as I exploded into her, which triggered another climax. “I love when you fill me up,” she moaned even as I lay between them, enjoying their heat as I recovered. </p><p>Despite Astrid collapsing earlier, I was up before her. “I want you on all fours,” I ordered Astrid. </p><p>“So he can fuck you like the bitch you are,” Lillian gasped, but moaned in appreciation when Astrid positioned herself so that she could devour the cum sliding out of Lillian, that playful annoyance was replaced by enthusiasm. </p><p>I started thrusting inside her, when fate decreed a change of pace. </p><p>I was pounding Astrid mercilessly while she munched Lillian’s treasure, when she gasped in a type of pain that didn’t belong to our bedroom. “D-danger,” she stammered as I pulled out of her and helped her to stand up. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” I asked even as I put my hand on her head and let my magic mingle with hers, feeling the turbulence of her magic, followed by another difficult trick. I let my mana mix with hers to calm her turbulence. “Tell me,” I said. </p><p>“A-attackers,” she murmured. “They killed a totem wolf before I could react.”  </p><p>Lillian gasped in panic, but calmed when I grabbed her hand. It was a testament to our growing relationship that I could calm her with just a touch. Then, I focused back on Astrid. “Warriors from the tribes?” I asked hopefully even though I knew it wouldn’t be the case. </p><p>“No, the legionaries,” she answered, her voice still strained. “The wolf was killed before I could get a better view of their numbers.” </p><p>I nodded even as I stood up, even as I thanked Eros for our luck. While the mountain was an amazing place to hide thanks to its chaotic magic, it was not without its drawbacks, the biggest being the impossibility of setting any kind of warding. The city had its own wards, of course, but they were erected by an impressive number of sorcerers working in tandem, after spending decades working for the most famous general whose reputation owed quite a bit to the quality of his temporary magical forts.</p><p>We were lucky when we discovered the magical storm didn’t interact as strongly with Astrid’s nature-based abilities. It wasn’t a complete immunity, of course. With her improved powers, Astrid could easily maintain total control of dozens of animals after she acquired them through a ritual. Outside of the wards, however, she could barely connect with half a dozen, with no chance to actually give them command through the interference. Despite all its limitations, it gave us what we needed, an early warning system. </p><p>“It’s time,” I warned them as I dashed toward the pile of clothes and put on my leather pants and tunic, both made from the skin of the ethereal wolves, giving me a limited magical resistance. I doubted it would match the enchanted armor of the centurions, but it was better than nothing. </p><p>“Maybe we should come with you,” Lillian offered as she dressed as well. </p><p>“No, we talked about this. There’s no chance that they are risking to explore this place without a sorcerer, and having you girls there will limit me tactically. With the magical nature of the mountain running interference, trying to ambush them is the best tactic, but if it doesn’t work, I will lead them away from the city. I can’t guarantee that they wouldn’t order some of the stronger mages to spread around.” </p><p>“I remember, ambush them using the wards, and never let them retreat,” Lillian answered. </p><p>“Exactly. I don’t know who is trying to kidnap you, but regardless, but just the presence of the city in such a unique environment is a treasure no one could reject, not to mention the treasures hidden inside, or the collection in the library. If discovered, we can never defend against the forces that would come for it.” </p><p>“We’re not losing this place,” Astrid stated determinedly as she stood up, pushing through her magical headache through sheer willpower, and despite the dangerous situation, I rewarded her with a kiss. It was a mistake, as her voluptuous —and very naked— body was very hard to pull away from. </p><p>“Careful,” I reminded them one last time, kissed Lillian as well before I departed for battle. </p><p>It was time to test the limits of my learning. </p>",

    "content": "<p>We were silent as we walked out of the headmistress’s office, which lasted until we arrived at her room. If she had any problems with me following her, she didn’t show it off. The walk barely allowed me to relax from the wild ride I experienced in the headmistress’s office. She had surprised me with her abilities, and not in a good way. I felt truly vulnerable there. </p><p>Titania started speaking only after we arrived at her room, which was the safest place to talk tactics. “We will leave with the first lights of the day, so we can ambush them around the sunset, where they are at their weakest-” Titania started, trying to take control, but I cut her off.  </p><p>“No,” I simply said. </p><p>“What do you mean, no,” she asked in her usual cold tone. “That’s an order from the headmistress.” </p><p>I shook my head, but let a smirk appear on my lips. “I didn’t disagree with the attack itself,” I said. “I disagree about attacking them during the day. We should attack them in the middle of the night.” </p><p>“Nonsense, the sunlight-” she started, but I cut her off once again. </p><p>“Will actually hurt us, considering we’re going to attack them in their underground base, where they are protected from the sun. If we attack in the night, at least most of their troops will be out, making our job even easier.” </p><p>“Still, we can’t wait until tomorrow night-” she tried to take control. </p><p>“I agree,” I said. “That’s why we should leave immediately. With magic, we can arrive there in less than an hour, and start our assault in immediately afterward. Since their spies probably reported that you’re back in the school, we would catch them completely unprepared.” </p><p>“Out of the question,” she argued. “I’m still not recovered from my latest mission-” Titania tried to argue, but I cut her off again. However, this time, not with my words, applying my tongue and lips in a different way. </p><p>[-159 Mana]</p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>“Any other arguments,” I said as I pulled back from the kiss, enjoying her dumbfounded expression. I had used some of the mana to help her recover her mana, but most went to hijacking her emotional-suppressor once more. “Take your gear, and we’ll leave.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to argue, once again stammering with a blush without the insulating effect of her magic. I interrupted her with a spank to her ass.  </p><p>“Let’s not waste any time. It’s the order of the headmistress, after all,” I said, using her earlier words against her. “Just take your gear and let’s leave.” </p><p>She looked dumbfounded, a thick blush covering her face. The confusion worked excellently, as she nodded obediently before walking to her bedroom. A moment later, she reappeared, this time wearing a new robe, and carrying a crystal staff, both radiating magic despite the restraining runes on them. They were clearly powerful, but it was also understandable that she didn’t carry them around daily. Most magical swords and other items for warriors had short lives, but compared to magic amplifiers, they might as well be turtles. </p><p>“Do we need to stop in your room as well,” she commented even as her grip tightened around her staff in an effort to suppress their magical presence. </p><p>“Nope,” I said, which made her look curiously. “Unfortunately, I can’t access my arsenal here,” I said, which was a blatant misdirection from the fact that I was still extremely poor when it came to disposable items. </p><p>Luckily, not for long, thanks to my growing relationship with Oeyne. </p><p>“Let’s go,” she said calmly, making a bid to regain her calm, which would have worked better if it wasn’t for her cute blush. She walked ahead of me, but this time, rather than going out, she brought me a random area in the depths of the library, and unlocked a secret passage. </p><p>“That’s going to bring us out?” I asked as I followed her, my gaze locked on her hips. She might not be as voluptuous as the other girls, and her battle robe might be too thick to hide her meager curves, but she still noticed my gaze, making her blush even thicker. </p><p>“Yes,” she simply answered before turning her attention back to us. After almost ten minutes of travel, the secret passage brought us to a warded cave, which also functioned as a stable for a Pegasi, one of the rare monsters that were tamed en masse to function as mounts. “It’s going to be difficult for her to carry both of us,” she said. </p><p>It was a critical decision point for me, which was in a case that looked deceptively simple. I could either use the mount together with her, or could summon the fake air elemental again. The existence of the fake elemental was not the issue, but the fact that I would be able to use such a magically-intensive method to travel, and still battle at the full performance was something different. </p><p>I wouldn’t have considered it if it wasn’t for the mysteries I had faced against the headmistress. Her ability to analyze soul spaces blindsided me, and when combined with her weird contrast between her aura and her mana, marked her as a much more unconventional character than I had expected. </p><p>Admittedly, it was my arrogance. I knew that she was able to keep her post for centuries despite many rival factions, therefore, she should be holding many cards. I just didn’t expect one of those to invalidate my greatest advantages that easily. I was afraid that once the immediate threat of necromancers had passed, she would start searching for me, easily finding the girls as well, likely discovering the Companion Mechanic as a result. Other than taking the girls and running away, it was hard to prevent it. </p><p>So, I needed an alternative approach, I thought even as I let my gaze fall on Titania. She clearly knew at least some of the secrets of the headmistress, and I could use this trip to pry them out of her mouth. The Companion Mechanic would have worked wonders in this situation as well. Yes, there was a risk that Titania would go to the headmistress and explain, but maybe, progressing in her companion system, along with the possible rewards, might help me quite a bit. </p><p>After a while, I decided to go with the riskier option. “Don’t worry, I have a better option in mind,” I said, once again creating an elemental mount, pumping enough mana to stabilize it perfectly. </p><p>[-2306 Mana]</p><p>Converting her to my side completely was a long shot. Luckily, that was not necessarily my only option. I could use our growing closeness to interrogate her about the headmistress —along with many other important things. If I discover something that required running away, it was a perfect time. </p><p>If not, maybe it would act as a peace offering between me and the headmistress. After all, she ruled a neutral faction, and I was very effective in helping her faction. </p><p>“But… Wasting mana…” she gasped in shock as she felt the waves of magic. </p><p>I chuckled even as I mounted the elemental before riding it to her. I leaned down to pull her gently, letting her sit in front of me, hugging her gently. I whispered. “Did you forget my advantage when it comes to regeneration,” I whispered into her ear. “Did you forget my specialty already?” I asked. </p><p>“Mana regeneration,” she gasped. </p><p>I chuckled. “Yes,” I said even as put my hand to her chin, gently pushing to position her lips for a perfect kiss, which I delivered even as I commanded the mount to move at the full speed. She gasped in shock, which was suppressed by our kiss. Despite the speed, however, our ride was comfortable, as I used another air spell to protect us from the winds. </p><p>[-103 Mana] </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>“That, and mana transfer,” I said in a low, throaty tone after I stopped the kiss, leaving her gasping in excitement. </p><p>“But…” she started, failing to continue her words under my gaze, which never stopped being funny considering the power she held in her fingertips and her lofty position. I was lucky that such a brunette beauty remained untouched, waiting for my eventual conquer. </p><p>“But, nothing,” I said aggressively as I let my hands explore her body. “We’re going to go into a very important battle, and you’re not going to go in with a half-empty mana reserve.” I waited for a moment for her argument, but it was not forthcoming. </p><p>I leaned in for another kiss, but this time, I pulled her onto my lap. Also, I had another surprise for her, as I ordered the elemental to turn the smooth ride into a bumpy ride, like a stage couch going through a poor country road. The effect, every tremble echoed in her core, arousing her even further, and she was already close to a surrender thanks to my kiss. The bumpy ride made things easier. </p><p>So easy that her hands barely found mine as they reached her robe, putting an ineffective display as I unbuttoned her battle robe. She barely resisted as her robe opened further and further, revealing a long modest skirt and a boring blouse underneath. </p><p>When I finally removed her battle robe and folded it before stuffing it in my bag, she barely let out a murmur of disagreement. When my hand slipped under her skirt and started climbing up her naked leg, however, she shivered before muttering, “Isn’t it a bit … much?” </p><p>“Is it?” I asked even as I ripped her panties with one pull, giving myself access to her wetness. “It’s the best way to transfer mana, and we’re short of time,” I explained, even as I used my other hand to free my shaft. “I’m just doing the best for the mission.” </p><p>Of course, it was a nonsense explanation, but her condition, she wasn’t searching for a reasonable explanation. As her innocent body once again felt the stirrings of arousal, she just needed a flimsy reason to silence herself for a moment. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I would have taken a different route, softly teasing her until she started begging for more. Pity that we had limited time before the attack. So rather than teasing her, I decided to move to the main event. I dangled her panties in front of her for a moment before letting them go, and they disappeared in the winds immediately. </p><p>“Hey, I need that,” she complained in a very out-of-character manner, highlighting her loss of control further as she wiggled on my lap, separated only by her skirt.</p><p>Our adventure was just getting started…  </p><p>[-103 Mana] </p><p>[+600 Experience]</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 28    Experience: 387600 / 406000 </p><p>Strength: 33    Charisma: 48</p><p>Precision: 30    Perception: 32</p><p>Agility: 30     Manipulation: 35</p><p>Speed: 29       Intelligence: 39</p><p>Endurance: 27      Wisdom: 38</p><p>HP: 4172 / 4172\tMana: 5297 / 5326        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [86/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [57/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I sat on her desk while waiting for her to leave the bathroom, and started examining the books open on her desk. The books and her notes were about repairing spell structures and wards, validating my assumption about the reason for her exhaustion.  </p><p>She didn’t neglect to send me a frustrated look as she opened the bathroom door and stepped into her bathroom, dressed in nothing but a towel, giving me a glimpse of her glistening skin before she cast a spell to slam the door close. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>I chuckled at her impotent anger, showing that the time she spent alone did little to regain her emotionless status. It was good news, allowing me to benchmark both the power and the recovery state of her light magic’s anti-emotion feature. And what I learned encouraged me further. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t miss her on the way to the meeting. I had no intention of revealing such an important freebie to the vaunted headmistress. Our playing field was sufficiently unequal before I started providing her with free cards. It was the same reason I didn’t bother Titania as she dressed, giving her some time to recover. </p><p>However, as I waited, I couldn’t help but feel panicked. The headmistress was a legendary figure, and the students barely encountered her, each encounter turning into an urban legend. Based on what I had searched, the last known student meeting occurred two decades ago, and left the student with constant nightmares for the rest of his life. </p><p>It was an interesting tale, though it was hard to guess whether it was correct or it was just another result of the mystery that surrounded her. </p><p>The gossip and tales about her were not a surprise. She was holding one of the most important posts known to mankind for significantly more than a century, but still managing to keep anything related to herself a mystery. </p><p>Including her political stance, powers, and even her appearance —not that I expected much from a crone that measured her life in centuries. </p><p>Even the thought of it was ridiculous. </p><p>Titania left her room almost half an hour later, and when she did so, her expression once again stiff as an iron plate. “Let’s go,” she said coldly, and I followed her, suppressing my desire to mess with her. </p><p>“Anything I should know about, before finally meeting the legendary headmistress?” I said. </p><p>“Just answer her questions truthfully, and don’t waste time,” Titania said. “And don’t think you can lie to her, you can’t,” she underlined. </p><p>“Really?” I said, feeling intrigued at her certainty. “Then, how comes there are traitors in the school without her noticing.” </p><p>“Politics,” Titania answered with absolute certainty, unaware that she had revealed important information to me. They knew the identity of the traitor. </p><p>How interesting. </p><p>Still, rather than pushing her on the subject, I decided to focus on her certainty about my eventual inability to lie. She might be talking about the insights generated by living long, but I had a feeling that it wasn’t something that simple. Maybe it was a skill like my Subterfuge, only about revealing the truth rather than hiding it, or maybe it was some kind of spell. Regardless, it was not something to be underestimated. </p><p>Honestly, I would have never taken the risk if I hadn’t already nominally allied with her accidentally when I saved Titania from the necromancers, and while I had secrets, they were not the kind that would come up easily. </p><p>Regardless, I could feel my heartbeat climbing up as we climbed the stairs of the central tower, which was the dedicated residence of the ruler of the school. </p><p>Then, Titania knocked on the door, a door that was glowing with magical wards. I wouldn’t like to try breaking it while the wards were active. “Come in,” called a voice from inside, rusty and cracking. Titania did so, giving me the first glimpse of the office of the headmistress. </p><p>And the first thing I noticed was darkness. The room was entirely too dark, from furniture to the walls, everything was in tones of black and dark brown, including the thick curtains, blocking the sunlight to leave a few flickering lights as the only source of light. </p><p>The sensation of darkness didn’t abate when we stepped in. Instead, it increased further. Without being blocked by the wards, her aura slammed against my magical senses immediately, which was just as dark as the decorations of her office. </p><p>Then I saw her. </p><p>She was sitting behind a huge desk, and the only reason I could tell she was a woman was her title. She was dressed in a black hooded cloak wrapped tight around her, revealing nothing but a lock of white hair peeking through. So mysterious, I thought even as I walked toward her in reluctant steps, even if something was tickling on the back of my head. To complete her looks, she had a huge hunch on her back, disfiguring her looks even further. </p><p>The dark accents of her room and her aura gave me a reason to second-think my visit. The only reason I didn’t beat a hasty retreat was the fact that she controlled Silver Spires, therefore had no reason to ally with the necromancers. </p><p>“Speak,” the headmistress ordered, her voice still croaky. </p><p>The situation was far too complicated for me to delve deep into the implications of her voice and her darkness, before I could get a better handle of the situation, at least. “I heard from a confidential source that the princess will be visiting the school…” I started and gave her a short yet effective explanation of the status. </p><p>As I explained, however, I was doing my best to analyze the aura that filled the room, to understand the accuracy of Titania’s warning about not giving her a signal. </p><p>It proved to be an excellent tactic, because, without my full focus, I could have never identified the subtle tendril of mana that doing its best to worm itself into my body, directly toward my soul space. </p><p>I had to hide my frown of disappointment, as her action clearly signaled that I wasn’t the only one aware of the secrets of the soul space. Me being the only one that discovered that secret would be a stretch, but still, I felt a bit disappointed at the loss of my advantage. </p><p>The disappointment was barely a momentarily flicker in my focus, however, as my attention was on running my own mana, stretching my Tantric and Subterfuge skills to the limit, and started designing a fake layer of soul space. </p><p>I was lucky that I was very familiar with the other people’s soul space appearance, allowing me to customize it based on the impressions I had gained from the girls. </p><p>The first thing I had done was to adjust my stats lower, not wanting to alarm her. I doubted she would be as calm if she noticed only two of my stats were below thirty —and barely— while my highest stat was almost fifty. Instead, I created a much more modest stat spread, showing my physical stats were even higher than the mental ones. I kept the likes of Perception and Manipulation extra-low, just to reduce her alertness further. </p><p>Of course, I couldn’t just downgrade everything and still maintain my credibility as a fighter. I faked my level higher to mid-thirties, but very limited space for further growth, and carrying the skills dedicated for combat. Tantric and Subterfuge were gone, replaced by Legendary Biomancy and Grandmaster Melee and Elemental, everything that Titania had observed me create.</p><p>Miraculously, I managed to finish it in seconds and cast it without alerting them —helped by the fact that I was targeting my own body. </p><p>[-146 Mana]</p><p>Then, the headmistress’s mana tendril invaded my fake soul space, exploring carefully. Weirdly, there was no subterfuge bonus. </p><p>Maybe I was caught already, I thought, doing my best not to reflect anything outward as I carefully examined her mana tendril exploring my soul space. It was certainly a possibility, but I had already committed to faking, and changing the tactics would only make things worse. </p><p>Instead, I decided to counter-attack —in a very limited sense— and started examining her mana, while I continued to explain the Princess’s visit. I wouldn’t have dared to copy her assault when I could see her magical flexibility was above mine, but her probe gave me a chance to do so. </p><p>The exploration gave me another shock. Everything in her room was dark, including her own aura, but in contrast, her mana was purer than anything else I had felt, which included Titania’s light magic. The headmistress’s magic was as bright as Titania, but it lacked the sensation of a crusader that was tempted to burn everything, instead of signaling a soft acceptance. </p><p>Such an interesting paradox, I noted. Especially since I didn’t know whether her aura, or her mana was her true self. Maybe neither was, and her mana was another layer of fake she developed to acquire Titania’s alliance. </p><p>Pity that I was not in a position to enjoy delving deeper into this particular mystery, still unable to decide whether she had discovered my own little ploy. She gave no indication of it, but I was not over the fact that my Subterfuge had not increased. Though curiously, my Arcana didn’t as well, which was supposed to be more about the successful construction of the spell rather than the effectiveness of the trick aspect. </p><p>Maybe it was just about the interference of the fake soul space… I certainly hoped so… </p><p>However, I wasn’t free to waste my time on alternative scenarios. “… and that’s it,” I said, completing my explanation as I looked at her face, hidden under her hood so that even my enhanced senses unable to see anything other than her white hair. </p><p>I expected the headmistress to speak, but Titania acted quicker. “What should we do?” Titania asked.</p><p>Rather than answering, the Headmistress looked at me. “What do you think?” she asked in the same raspy voice that reminded me of an old oak covered with mushrooms. </p><p>“I think we should attack their central base and damage them as much as possible,” I answered, despite having better ideas. Attacking was not the worst idea, as it would at least reduce their cards, but it would also reveal our hands unnecessarily, and wouldn’t give the initiative back. However, I suggested it for two reasons. First, I didn’t even know their resources to create a more complicated plan that could steal the initiative. </p><p>Second, and more importantly, I didn’t want to reveal my strategic abilities to the headmistress, certainly not before I could have a better understanding of her. </p><p>“What do you think, Titania?” the headmistress asked. </p><p>“We should have done it earlier,” she sharply answered, showing her hatred toward dark magic, which only made her obvious sympathy toward the headmistress even more curious. “What about the team?” she asked. </p><p>“You two will be enough. Their forces have already started dispersing around, and we need to keep some of our forces in reserve in case they target the towns with their monsters,” the headmistress said, speaking the longest sentence since I entered. </p><p>Titania didn’t look satisfied with the suggestion —which was telling considering her emotion-blocker was running at full power— but she still nodded. “Is there anything else?” she asked, and the headmistress shook her head. </p><p>She stood up and I immediately followed her, curious about the lack of interrogation, but feeling even more scared of the headmistress as a result. I had expected her to ask about my origins, leveraging her power position, but she hadn’t done so. So, she was either confident enough that she had got a handle of my abilities, therefore didn’t feel alert, or she already discovered more than I was aware, therefore staying calm about the subject. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, when I left the room, I was even more alert about the mystery of the headmistress… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 28    Experience: 386600 / 406000 </p><p>Strength: 33    Charisma: 48</p><p>Precision: 30    Perception: 32</p><p>Agility: 30     Manipulation: 35</p><p>Speed: 29       Intelligence: 39</p><p>Endurance: 27      Wisdom: 38</p><p>HP: 4172 / 4172\tMana: 5297 / 5326        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [86/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [57/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>That was the thing about me and the interesting, but potentially deadly ideas. I was like a gambling addict, unable to resist the call of the siren. </p><p>Hiding inside the same room with the Queen after defiling her completely wasn’t the most dangerous idea, though considering the full implications, not exactly the tamest idea either. However, the potential for entertainment was just too much to ignore, not to mention the possible benefits of observing her more directly.  </p><p>After finding a good hiding spot near the corner, under the shadow of a bulky wardrobe, I examined the curvy naked figure busy scooping my seed out of her entrance magically, struggling to believe it was the same strict Queen that was making people scared with her velvet-covered iron fist. </p><p>“Bastard, I’ll show you,” she murmured as she pooled the seed in her palm. She surprised me when rather than disposing of it, she started to cast a spell on it. A chill passed over my body as I felt a magical connection being established, ready to lash the moment she noticed my presence. </p><p>Luckily, it turned out that whatever spell she was using didn’t connect us in terms of location, because she gave no sign of noticing my presence. She stayed focused on the spell, giving me the opportunity to focus on the tendrils of magic that was invading my body. </p><p>As the binding of the spell got stronger, it got easier for me to recognize the spell, and once I did, a huge smile appeared on my face. The spell was trying to infect my psyche to build up more positive emotions toward her. </p><p>Even as I cut the magical connections of the spell and tied them to each other, making it ineffective without dispelling it, my respect toward her increased. There were several spells she could cast with my remains using her Tantric abilities, and several more if she was willing to spread into darker areas. And it was neither the safest spell, nor it was the strongest one. Even a simple tracker would have brought more immediate benefits, allowing her to send knights to arrest or kill me.  </p><p>However, unique among everything she could use, the one she used was the subtlest, and the most useful in the long term. The effect she used could be reinforced with each repeat, increasing my emotions toward her, creating an obsession. And such obsession would inevitably result in mistakes. </p><p>Or more accurately, would have resulted in mistakes if I hadn’t recognized and disabled it immediately. She had a great plan, but the same couldn’t be said about her luck, trying to take down a master with the dark arts. </p><p>I was already planning how best to use her misconception about the change in my emotions to my biggest benefit, even as I watched as she stood up, stumbling toward the bath on the corner of the room. However, rather than slipping into the warm embrace of the full tub, she cast a spell, turning it into a subtle rain that caressed her skin. </p><p>“I’ll teach you the cost of underestimating me, you worm,” she murmured absentmindedly, and I barely held myself from chuckling, wondering what she would think if she was aware of my continuing presence, and the great show she was proving me. For a while, I watched her as she murmured to herself in the variation of her initial words, all promising me a number of deadly threats. At first, I didn’t react much, after taking her completely, watching her calmly shower wasn’t exactly the peak of the pleasure.</p><p>Then, things started to change. </p><p>“I’m going to kill you,” she murmured again as she grabbed the soap bar and rubbed it against her skin a few times before continuing with her hands. She immediately focused on her breasts, which was a bit surprising, but not as surprising when her motions got weirdly repetitive. “I’ll kill you,” she murmured again, her eyes closed.</p><p>I was surprised, because she wasn’t washing her tits. She was playing with them. As she lathered her body with bubbles slowly, a soft, gentle moan escaped her mouth. “I’ll kill you,” she repeated as she twisted her nipples once again. Soon, one of her hands was wandering over her body freely, sliding across the soft skin I had marred earlier, but one of them stayed on her tits, caressing and squeezing in equal measures. </p><p>Well, I thought, surprised, enjoying the view. I had noticed that she was enjoying the treatment as I fucked her for the first time in years, but I didn’t expect it to affect her so much that she had to masturbate afterward to release the tension. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. </p><p>However, her angry words suggested that she wasn’t exactly a natural submissive like her daughter. On the contrary, she was masturbating because her earlier enjoyment clearly run contrary to her own habits, creating a tension she was trying to resolve. </p><p>Still, regardless of the reason, her hand dancing over her naked skin created a spectacular show. One of her hands continued to squeeze her breasts, while the other one finally found its destination, nestling between her thick thighs. A moan escaped her mouth as her fingers found the soft target area. She traced the outline of her outer lips first, her toes curling as she dragged her fingers. Then, they found her clit, circling and flicking in equal measures. </p><p>However, the real show started when her fingers finally found her entrance, slipping inside, she let out a long, throaty gasp. “Wish I hadn’t tried to drug that asshole,” she murmured absentmindedly as her fingers disappeared inside her repeatedly. “At least I wouldn’t be left out, trying to finish it myself…” </p><p>Who would have guessed that her last heartfelt begging wasn’t completely artificial, I thought, surprised. Still, it was a good note for the first time. That time, I should fuck her until she forgot her own name, just to make sure she wasn’t gossiping badly about me.  </p><p>Meanwhile, she focused on her own body while the light shower of rain still continued, stealing the heat of her body, her fingers invading more and more aggressively. Her moans rose even louder to accompany it, tempting me for a sudden encore. Pity that stepping out of the shadows would reveal far too many cards I would prefer to keep hidden.  </p><p>Finally, her voice hit the crescendo, followed by a loud screaming, paradoxically tinged with frustration and release at the same time. She leaned against the wall, trembling helplessly as she water washed out the last remaining hints of our earlier activity other than the marks on her skin, which were a more permanent reminder. I wondered whether she could cure them, or require a healer for it. </p><p>Somehow, I doubted she would go and reveal the source of those marks to the Princess for healing.</p><p>Unlike her earlier emotional outburst, she stayed silent after she finished her shower and slowly dressed, covering her beautiful skin with the same ugly dark gray cloak she had been wearing when she first arrived, along with the mask on her face. However, she didn’t bother to reapply the spell that turned her into a brunette, relying on the hood of the cloak for the concealment. </p><p>I slipped right after her when she finally left the room, accompanying her in her walk in the secret passage, an easy task thanks to her attention hampered further due to her most recent experiences. </p><p>Another challenge lay in front of me as we stood in front of her private quarters while she unlocked it magically. I either called it a day and left, or followed her in, hoping to discover some of her secrets. </p><p>After some consideration, I decided to follow her. No risk, no reward… </p><p>I was barely able to keep myself from gasping in shock as I entered her private quarters, because I had many different expectations about her private quarters, but what I had found surprised me greatly. </p><p>I hadn’t been expecting the Queen to have a library here, and I certainly wasn’t expecting her to have a copy of my own private library! </p><p>Well, while that might be an exaggeration, as architecturally it was quite different, but it was very similar in the most important aspect, namely, the books it contained. I had seen her use magic that was classified as dark, but the range of books she had surprised me greatly. Quite a few of those titles were also in my library, but I only acquired them after years of efforts, robbing, trading, and raiding the libraries of the most established magical families. The fact that the Queen also had them had very dangerous implications. </p><p>Maybe I should just turn and leave the place. If the Queen was able to get those books from those families, their relationship should be much stronger than I had expected, which ruined every plan I had put in action. </p><p>I was trembling in shock as the queen moved into a connected room, considering running away, but still, I stayed back. It was not my habit to escape at the first sight of adversity. Moreover, something was tickling my mind as I examined the books in her library. Something other than the titles was familiar about those books. </p><p>I identified why when I pulled one of the books from the shelves, and noticed some of the notes, scribbled in familiar handwriting! </p><p>“Makes more sense,” I murmured. Apparently, my library had survived the self-destruction I triggered, probably because it had been robbed at the same time the attack started. My respect for the Queen went up, as the only chance for her to get those books was the short window where the coalition started assaulting me, and my capture. </p><p>She had risked the eventual success of the operation to maximize her own benefits. It was the approach I would have taken. </p><p>Pity that her trump card was in my hands. One of the books was open, laying innocently on a desk. A brief assessment showed that it was a book on the advanced applications of the Tantric spells, the exact tool she was using to attack me. </p><p>I immediately picked the quill and started adding a number of footnotes and other stuff. Since the book was mostly annotated by me, I was willing to bet that she wouldn’t realize that those additions were really late. After all, who would expect their most private spot to be invaded, only to add a few extra notes to a book? </p><p>However, those notes were special, because, at the first glance, they looked like amazing ideas. Actually, they were. I had designed them myself based on my self-study. Pity that each had subtle but very dangerous flaws that would have allowed the counter-attack of a proficient opponent. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until Sapphire tries to use those spells on me again… </p><p>I stayed in the library for until almost the first lights of the morning, adding note after note across a number of books that I expected the Queen to leverage, both against myself, and for the eventual control of the treasures I would help her to ‘steal’ from my stashes. </p><p>Only after finishing that task, I dared to check the bedroom of the Queen, only to find a room much more in line with my earlier expectations, decorated heavily in white, blue, and a smattering of gold, rich enough to fund the capital for a year. </p><p>And in the middle of it was the Queen, laying in on a huge white bed, wearing a little nightie that failed to cover her amazing tits, tempting me for another touch. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was too risky, even for my loose sensibilities on the subject. </p><p>Maybe the next time… </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, let’s start,” I said as I gently grabbed her chin, enjoying the way she trembled under my touch. </p><p>“R-right now,” she stammered in shock. </p><p>“Well, nothing like the present,” I said as I used my free hand to pull her glasses, then peered deep into her eyes, letting my baby blues work their magic, making her shiver. “Unless you are not feeling comfortable, of course,” I added. </p><p>“No, I trust you,” she answered immediately, which could have been a disastrous mistake on her part. Luckily for her, I was one of the good guys. </p><p>Well, kind of. </p><p>“Perfect,” I said even as I examined her face, which was much lovelier without those bulky glasses. A little natural makeup wouldn’t have hurt, but luckily, we were away from any road light, so when I flicked the interior light close, the soft lightning worked wonders to enhance the effect, and her natural blush of excitement handled the rest, turning her into an innocent princess. “You can tell me to stop or wait whenever you feel uncomfortable,” I offered, even as I dragged my finger on her lip, making her shiver. </p><p>“O-okay,” she said, once again stammering helplessly as she tried to process the situation. </p><p>Her phone buzzed once more, but this time, before she could reach for it, I grabbed it and threw it on the backseat after silencing it. “No phones during the class,” I said in a sharp, authoritative voice, and her eyes widened further, in a way that suggested she might have more than one classroom fantasy. Something to visit later on. </p><p>She just nodded, still under my touch, while her irises widened as I slowly closed in the distance. But just as the distance was about to collapse into zero, she closed her eyes. I hummed as my lips pressed against her, enjoying their delicate softness. </p><p>I wouldn’t lie. It was an awkward kiss, mostly because she was frozen in shock. Not exactly the peak of eroticism. It was clearly her first kiss. Still, I maintained the contact as my lips slowly moved, trying to coax her to move. </p><p>Ten seconds into the kiss, I finally had a response. It was an awkward, weak response, barely noticeable, highlighting just how much she needed our tutoring sessions. </p><p>It was almost a minute into the kiss that I pulled back, leaving her gasping and panting. “Wow,” she gasped. “That was…”</p><p>“Delicious,” I completed her words, and before she could respond, kissed her again. This time, she was much more active. She was still doing trembling softly, flushed and nervous, but she responded much stronger. </p><p>It was time to push the envelope a bit, I decided as I gently grabbed her face, letting my tongue probe her lips, asking her to part them. She opened her lips, and let me slip inside. Her tongue tried to copy mine, starting a battle, begging for me to dominate her, but I kept myself in check, not wanting to scare her and cut it short. </p><p>Not when I was starting to enjoy it. She was surprisingly pliant, and I could feel my shaft awakening with her kiss. With the moving and everything, it had been a while since I had any female company, after all. So, ultimately, our little kiss evolved into an amateurish and sloppy, but nonetheless delicious, French kiss. </p><p>This time, the kiss lasted more than five minutes before I pulled back, leaving her panting and gasping. She said nothing, but her looks conveyed her dissatisfaction. She said nothing, but aroused by desire, her eyes begged for more. </p><p>I just chuckled as I pushed my seat all the way to the back, giving me the space I required before I grabbed her wrist and pulled her onto my knee. She yelped in panic. “It’s hard to reach over all the stuff. It’s more comfortable this way,” I explained, earning a hesitant nod. </p><p>Seeing her loss of confidence, I was quick to seal her lips with mine once more, a task that she was more than enthusiastic to assist. Our tongues battled once more, her skill level rising by the second. After another minute, I decided to bring things up to a new level. </p><p>However, in a different way. Rather than trying to fondle her, which would inevitably scare her, I grabbed her wrist and dragged her hand to my chest, letting her feel my muscles. “Oh, my!” she gasped as she felt the chiseled muscles under my shirt, caressing them enthusiastically. Meanwhile, I just wrapped my other arm around her waist, letting it hang there lazily. </p><p>Her fingers soon started working over the buttons of my plaid shirt, giving her access to my naked chest muscles, which she started caressing in fascination. “Second base already?” I asked when we pulled back for a breather, and her hand jerked back immediately. “Calm down, sweetie,” I whispered as I kissed her cheek, while simultaneously dragging her hand back to my chest. “I’m just messing with you.” </p><p>My kisses, which started from her cheek and trailed toward her ear as I followed her jawline, worked wonders to resolve her panicked response. She moaned softly as she slowly slipped down to my abs. Meanwhile, I started dragging my fingers across her spine like caressing a kitten, making her purr. </p><p>As we continued, her chest pressed against my biceps more than once thanks to our closeness, which clued me into one very important fact. I wasn’t the only one that was hiding an impressive body under loose clothes. Her waist was thin and smooth, while from what I could feel, her bra was overstuffed tightly with her breasts. Pity that if I tried to unhook it to see what lied underneath, I would have scared her off. Even when she was caressing my chest enthusiastically, she felt like a little bird ready to jump away. </p><p>I decided to tame her first. I let my kisses trail down from her jawline to her neck, showering her sensitive skin with soft kisses. She just enjoyed it without making a sound —or more accurately, without saying a word, as her moans were sufficiently loud. </p><p>It was a great misconception about the neck. Compared to moving onto the breasts, which was deemed as a benchmark of progress, therefore made the girls very alarmed, the neck was much more accessible. However, it was almost as sensitive as the breasts —or even more sensitive in some special girls, which I made them climax just by a dedicated assault of their elegant necks. </p><p>Carrie wasn’t one of those extremes, but still, as I kissed and licked her neck, she started squirming on my knee, making me wish that she was wearing a skirt, which would have made things so much easier. Still, I spent the next ten minutes alternating between her lips and her neck, while she explored every inch of my naked torso. </p><p>Her moans got louder and louder, signaling that while a climax wasn’t in the immediate vicinity, we finally stepped on that beautiful road, while doing nothing but foreplay. “You know,” I whispered as my hot breath caressed her ear. “We can go a bit further if you want.” I could have pushed without asking, but it would have made her tense. At this stage, it was better for her to feel in control. </p><p>It would only make it better when I finally take it back. </p><p>“I -” she started, only to be interrupted by a moan as I nibbled on her neck. “I don’t know,” she whispered. “Isn’t it a bit much…” </p><p>“Your call, my sexy nerd,” I whispered back. “If you think this is enough, then this is enough. If you think we can play a bit more, where I could show you the true meaning of pleasure, rather than the introduction we were handling, that’s your call as well.” </p><p>“True meaning,” she murmured in shock, before shaking her head. “W-we better not,” she said, then quickly added, “Not yet!” afraid of pushing me away. </p><p>“As you wish, my sexy nerd,” I answered back. “How about another kiss, this time a bit more heated?” </p><p>“More heated?” she repeated, gulping in anticipation as she nodded, and I stole another kiss of her soft lips. </p><p>This time, it was different, a true hurricane compared to the soft winds of the previous one, aggressive and domineering, breaking down her walls, taking control of the assault.</p><p>Carrie stiffened in shock at first, but it didn’t last long. Soon, she was doing her best to kiss me ferociously. Even though she failed to gain the upper hand, she didn’t feel like she had any complaints. Her hands reached to my chest, dancing over my muscles as she drew big circles, but each repeat brought her hands a bit lower. </p><p>Her ultimate aim was so clear that I would have laughed at her under different circumstances. However, I wasn’t stupid enough to do so when there was a deliciously curvy girl on my knee, trying to sneak a grope at my erection. </p><p>Soon, her fingers reached to the waistband of my underwear, dancing at the perimeter, but failing to take the final step. </p><p>I decided to take that as a signal to push my game to the next level. My hand slipped under her shirt, finally caressing her naked skin, though I stayed focused on the small of her back. My motive was the same as her neck. Not as alarming as removing her bra, but still an excellent erogenous zone to get her worked up even further. </p><p>Even with my lips doing their best to muffle her voice, her moans filled the car, making me glad that it was winter, which made us keep the windows closed. Otherwise, even in such an uninhibited place, we would have got the attention of the others. </p><p>It was time for the next step, I decided as my fingers snaked upward, finding her bra clasp. All it took was a flick to free her breasts from the imprisonment, but feeling her subtle stiffening, I immediately moved my hand lower to calm her down. </p><p>Luckily, a searing kiss and an attractive, musclebound torso proved just enough to distract Carrie from putting her bra properly, which finally gave me the chance to move onto the most exciting part of the evening. </p><p>Her surprisingly large breasts. </p><p>I couldn’t help but moan as well as I grabbed them over her shirt, allowing me to feel them properly without the pressure of her tight bra. They were tight, and they were supple. I felt like a pioneer who just bought some arid farmland, only to struck oil. </p><p>Carrie had a face that would be beautiful after the slightest effort, but even without that, she would have hordes of boys following her, if she just wore something form-fitting to show off her spectacular globes —and maybe with a hint of cleavage to highlight the impact. Discovering her was a rather entertaining coincidence. </p><p>Emboldened by my touch, her hands got braver. She found my belt, struggling to open it for a while before changing her mind, and started caressing my bulge over my jeans, while I finally slipped my hands under her shirt, touching the naked skin of her breasts. </p><p>It was weird. After all those girls, getting into the second base with a nerd shouldn’t be exciting, but it was weirdly electric, something I hadn’t felt during the string of cheerleader hookups I had experienced as a quarterback. Maybe it was the expectation, or maybe it was the lackluster reaction of the girls, who felt our hookups were a part of their expected routine. </p><p>Whatever it was, I decided to enjoy the moment rather than wasting my time trying to analyze it. I focused on her dangling tits, squeezing their huge expanse, thumbing her nipples. And what I found, from the firmness of her breasts to the suppleness of her skin, was undoubtedly the best I had experienced. The warm, heavy, firm, and paradoxically, somehow unbelievably soft at the same time.</p><p>Carrie moaned in pure ecstasy, wrenching her mouth away from mine just long enough to desperately whisper, “It feels amazing. Do it harder!” signaling that she was starting to lose control.  </p><p>A gentleman could never turn down such an urgent request, so I squeezed her tits harder even as I resumed the kiss, my tongue ravaging her mouth. In response, her hands over my bulge quickened, pushing me closer to an explosion of my own. Too bad it was a slow journey. </p><p>“Mmm--mm!” she moaned loudly, and I let her do so unfettered, stopping the kiss for a moment. However, this time, I had a better place to focus than her neck. I yanked up her shirt enough to reveal her tits, the cover of her bra inconsequential. </p><p>For a moment, I stopped to enjoy the glorious sight of her naked tits. “Damn, girl, you have amazing tits,” I whispered, completely honest for the first time in the evening. </p><p>“You think-” she started, only to be interrupted by a moan. This time, the culprit was my lips, clamping on her nipple. </p><p>She let out a gasp, and started rubbing my cock with wild abandon, which was all the confirmation I needed before I started to suck aggressively while my fingers explored every inch of her naked tits after they wasted a few seconds to completely remove her bra. </p><p>We were quick, like we were trying to win a race or something, our hands a blur over our bodies. Soon, she started trembling as her inexperienced body hit its limits, triggering an explosive climax. She started trembling on my knee so much that I had to wrap both arms around her waist to keep her upright, which had the added benefit of crushing my face against her chest, giving me the most amazing sensation of suffocation I had ever experienced. </p><p>She was like a firecracker, loud, messy, but nonetheless, spectacular as she shone under the darkness of the night. </p><p>It took several minutes for her to properly recover, a time I had utilized by lazily playing with her tits. </p><p>Unfortunately, as she recovered, she also slowly regained her wits. I could have pushed her before she recovered of course. With my experience, it wouldn’t be difficult to transition onto the backseat, but that wouldn’t be fair to her. </p><p>I said nothing, but smiled kindly as she blushed, then fixed her shirt, depriving me of the amazing view. Luckily, she forgot to put her bra back on, which gave me the beautiful sight of her erect nipples pushing out of her shirt. </p><p>“That was…” she murmured, unable to finish her sentence. </p><p>“Beautiful, and so are you,” I completed her, which put a smile on her face, especially when I followed with a kiss on her cheek. </p><p>Her smile was positively radiant, unrestrained by her shyness for the first time, which elevated her homely cuteness into a real beauty, so much that I had to bite my lips to constrain myself. Even then, a low grunt escaped my throat, suggesting a lot of interesting things. </p><p>That reminded her of the last remaining problem. “Should I?” she asked as she subtly glanced at my crotch, only to avoid it immediately, which told me that she was in no way ready to do that, especially after the hesitancy that crept in after the big explosion. </p><p>“No,” I said, and she flinched, her lack of confidence quick to invade the surface of her emotions. “Not yet, at least,” I corrected immediately. “You’re clearly overwhelmed, and it wouldn’t be fair to ask you that.” </p><p>“But it’s not fair-” she started, only for me to cut her off, mostly to flex my new nice guy persona. </p><p>“No, what is not fair is for any party to push themselves into they are not comfortable just because they want to pay back.” I chuckled. “And, don’t forget that I’m your tutor, I can handle a bit of discomfort.” </p><p>“Right,” she chuckled, her smile once again deliciously cute. </p><p>Then, we drove off silently into the night, excited yet satisfied… </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>I had departed Marianne’s room after cuddling for a bit, when she fell asleep. Initially, I had planned to bequeath her two levels, I decided to moderate it after she made considerable companion progress and received two achievements at the same time. </p><p>I still didn’t know whether leveling several times in a day had any side effects, and Marianne was not a good target to test that. </p><p>Also, I had quite a few challenging things to deal with, such as digging the mystery behind the low-key visit of the princess. Unfortunately, there was only one person I could discuss with. Titania. </p><p>Unfortunate, but not because I didn’t want to spend time with Titania. I genuinely enjoyed breaking through her artificial coldness to reach her innocent core —both metaphorically and literally. Nor I was really afraid of clashing incentives. While it was completely accidental at first, I positioned myself as the enemy of the necromancers, and whoever was standing behind them. Even if my aim didn’t completely match with Titania’s, the presence of an overwhelming enemy sufficiently ensured that neither Titania nor someone from her faction would target me directly. It wasn’t a certain thing, of course, but that was the best I could get in my political position. </p><p>No, I was afraid that she would drag me into a meeting with the Headmistress. </p><p>I didn’t feel ready to meet with the Headmistress, because she had a scary reputation, even more, overwhelming than the current Emperor. According to the rumors, she was alive for centuries, and even if that was an exaggeration, she was the Headmistress of Silver Spires for the last century at least, making sure she was definitely over a hundred. However, her past was hard to dig for my meager means. </p><p>Even scarier than her possible identity as an ancient crone, there was the fact that I was yet to discover anything about the faction she belonged. She didn’t work directly with any of the city-states, nor she directly worked with the Royal family. Nor she gave any benefits to border armies, Guilds, or the merchant families. For all intents and purposes, she was a neutral party. </p><p>And that scared me, because she was able to maintain her independence and the independence of the school despite the shifting web of politics and power dynamics. Of course, there was also the possibility that she was a powerless puppet, put in there by an agreement of all political parties as a compromise, but I could feel in my bones that it wasn’t the truth. </p><p>If she was weak, the necromancers wouldn’t be holding on the side despite the army they had already collected, and used it to destroy the school directly. Even Titania wasn’t enough to destroy that army, and it was a known truth that she was one of the strongest members of the faculty. Along with the traitor and the problems in the ward scheme, it should have been an easy victory. </p><p>“I hate this,” I murmured. For the first time since I had discovered my ability to level up, I was feeling overwhelmed. I was in a complicated web of intrigue, with too many moving parts, each one enough to bury me if I dared to stand against them directly. The idea of running away was getting sweeter. </p><p>Pity that Silver Spires was my best bet to discover any clues about the System. </p><p>Ultimately, all it came to an important qualifier. Whether I could survive the upcoming crisis, or escape if the crisis snowballed into something impossible to handle? And while it might be arrogant, ultimately, I had trust in my own abilities enough to make staying worthwhile. </p><p>“To the library,” I murmured, not even bothering to dress as the mule. My stats and abilities had reached such a point that even without explicitly changing clothes or using illusions, I could easily fade into the background. All it took was a simple change of posture, and suppressing my aura. </p><p>[+2 Subterfuge]</p><p>It was also a good opportunity to mess with Titania a bit, I decided, which put a huge smile on my face. Just a week ago, I was trembling in fear of getting her attention, and now, I was willing to tease her due to my own sheer enjoyment. </p><p>The sensation power was intoxicating. </p><p>Admittedly, it might not be the smartest idea, but after the display we put together with Helga, getting away smoothly, it wasn’t exactly a suicidal attempt either. So, when I stood in front of her private door and flexed my magic subtly to make sure I wasn’t detected as I unlocked her door, it wasn’t because I was afraid of her, but because I wanted to surprise her with my presence. </p><p>However, disabling her lock without triggering the rest of the wards turned out to be a more difficult task than I had expected, forcing me to waste almost five minutes, and enough mana to leave a weaker mage in despair. Luckily, it had its own rewards. </p><p>[-813 Mana]</p><p>[+4 Arcana] </p><p>My smile widened as I realized the sound of running water coming from the bathroom, signaling that she was perfectly prepared for my attention. Suppressing my presence sufficiently not to alert her was not difficult as I looked at the bathroom. She was in her huge bathtub, which was covered with bubbles, as she pressed her back against the marble, relaxing. </p><p>I undressed quickly as I watched her, before stepping into the bathroom, not bothering to wear a towel. Luckily, the tub was sufficiently big, so she failed to notice my presence as I slipped in at first, only realizing when my legs touched hers when I sat across her. </p><p>She flinched in shock, her hand already gathering a blast of light magic, ready to be launched. I was ready to lash out with a shield, but kept it in reserve. When our eyes met, she didn’t release her attack, instead of speaking with a dangerous voice that would have sent me running a week ago. “What are you doing here!” As she spoke, the light she was holding got even stronger. </p><p>“We have something important to talk about,” I answered immediately, but my lazy tone contrasted greatly with her sharp one. </p><p>“Speak,” she ordered, but keeping her hand raised, no doubt ready to lash out. </p><p>Instead of launching into an explanation, I chuckled. “Come on, after everything we had gone through, isn’t it a bit illogical to draw the line here?” I asked, using the steamier memories we shared to dismiss her argument. </p><p>That managed to push through her unnatural calmness. “B-but, t-that's-” she stammered, her blush covering her face for a fleeting moment as she felt softer emotions, which once again worked excellently. Unfortunately, her calm reasserted itself back quickly. “Why did you enter without connecting me through communication.” </p><p>I stopped for a second, considering whether to reveal the Princess’s visit, but after a brief consideration, I decided to admit it. As much as I liked Oeyne, she wasn’t as critical as Titania due to impending necromancer assault. Moreover, it might not affect Oeyne adversely as well. Ultimately, at this point, it was impossible to progress without risk. </p><p>“The oldest daughter of the Emperor is going to secretly arrive at the school in a few days,” I explained. </p><p>“What!” she exclaimed immediately, once again breaking her cold calmness, this time with fear. “Are you sure? Why? When?” she asked rapidly. </p><p>“Calm down,” I said lazily even as I dipped my hands underwater, and grabbed her foot. My thumb pressed against her sole, and started caressing her skin, displaying the full extent of my massaging abilities, even using my Biomancy subtly to enhance the pleasure. “We still have a few days to react, no need to put your panties in a bunch,” I added, then smirked. “Not that you’re wearing any, of course.” </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>“Focus,” she ordered, once again calm, but I still smirked in satisfaction, for two reasons. First, I was still able to earn experience without penalty from her, which was a nice win. Second, my senses were sharp enough to detect a familiar hitch in her tone, one that I had heard much louder when I was accompanying her in that cave, selflessly helping her to recover her mana. “Do you know why the princess is going to visit?” </p><p>“Yes, but I’m not going to reveal that,” I answered. </p><p>She once again raised her hand, threatening me with the glow. “I’m not in the mood to play, spill!” she ordered. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, entirely confident, because I wasn’t playing with her delicate foot because of my own pleasure —or not entirely. Through contact, it was easy for me to get a rough assessment of her status, and her mana pool was mostly depleted, barely a quarter remaining. Since she carried no sign of combat, she likely exhausted herself repairing the wards. “Go ahead, if you’re feeling confident to take me down,” I challenged her. </p><p>Even when she was going through the slight emotional turmoil, she was far too cold to actually take such an obvious risk when she was far from her best state. “Don’t talk nonsense,” she cut. “I need to make sure the information is correct.” </p><p>“That’s not my problem,” I said, even as I continued to massage her foot to the best of my ability, letting my fingers occasionally caress her dainty little ankles. Sometimes, it was hard to believe such a soft body belonged to one of the most intimidating figures in a school that constantly raised the powerhouses for humanity. “I’m not your servant, but your ally. I’m already doing you a favor by sharing information with you. Rather than trying to extort more, you better think about how to compensate for it,” I explained, doing my best to put the weight of my charisma in my words without alerting her to my trick.  </p><p>[+2 Speech]</p><p>“How?” she asked, suddenly changing her pace, which underlined my success. I loved my Speech skill, which not only helped me to be more eloquent, but also giving me a useful sixth-sense about the direction I should take the discussion to get what I want based on the subtle clues. </p><p>“For example, you can start by telling me what you know about the recent adventures of the princess, so that I can get a better idea whether she is a problem, or an asset to the problem we are facing,” I said. “Due to some unique situation, accessing general information flow is more trouble than it’s worth,” I murmured in annoyance, doing my best to convince Titania that I was anything but a lone trickster trying to carve a place for myself, especially since the truth of my situation, gaining my power in less than a month, was completely unbelievable. It was for the best if she believed that I had a mysterious power backing me. </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“According to the latest information, seven towns in her direct sphere of influence had fallen to monster hordes in the last fifteen days, along with several others in the land of their most ardent supporters,” Titania said. “Two houses lost their head in those assaults, even.”  </p><p>“Monster hordes, you say,” I repeated with a frown, receiving a knowing nod. If it wasn’t for the discovery with the earth gem, I would have discounted it by assuming it was a string of bad luck, though Titania probably would have done the same, discounting them as irrelevant. “Very unlucky.” </p><p>“Yes,” she said, her voice hitching slightly as my fingers started traveling lower on her legs, teasing her soft calves. “She is very unlucky.” </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>“Any undead presence in her lands,” I asked. </p><p>“No, not even a gossip, and we did our best to search,” Titania said, blushing slightly when I gave her a mocking grin. Considering the success they had displayed searching for them in their own backyard, their information about a lack of undead wasn’t exactly conclusive. But the fact that she was reacting to my wordless teasing shyly was an even better finding, proving my constant massage was having an effect in breaking her magical coldness. </p><p>“Let’s assume there aren’t any for a moment,” I said, which earned an angry glare. “What? You disagree?” I pushed. If she was willing to act injured, I had no problems in pushing her failure to the surface. Her anger got even more pronounced —which allowed me to easily move to her thigh without earning a comment— but she said nothing to defend herself or her faction. </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>[+400 Experience]</p><p>However, rather than continuing based on her silence, I stopped, focusing on caressing her thighs. “Continue,” she spat, unable to hide neither her anger nor her growing arousal. </p><p>“If the necromancers don’t have the ability to create monster hordes, it means that they have an ally with that ability who are also against the oldest princess, and collaborating with the necromancers to take her down without revealing their hand. And I think that’s even worse than the alternative.” </p><p>“Why?” she asked.</p><p>That question was alone was enough to prove strategic thinking was not exactly her strongest suit. Admittedly, I was cheating thanks to the benefits of my Wisdom as well as my Subterfuge and Speech, which provided me some political insights. “Would you give an ally of convenience your strongest weapon?” I asked, and she shook her head. “Exactly. If they are willing to give even limited access to the necromancers, who are not the most trustworthy group of entities, it means that they have stronger things in their arsenal. That, or they somehow control the necromancer faction that was about to attack us, which is an even scarier idea.”</p><p>“You’re right,” she admitted. “We need to talk about this with the Headmistress. You’ll come with me,” she ordered, her tone stiffer than it required to hide her arousal. </p><p>“Well, I don’t have anything urgent to do, so I can help you,” I said and stood up, displaying my magnificence to her eyes. Her eyes widened in shock, unable to pull away from my raging erection no matter how much she tried to pull away. I stepped out of the tub, but stood next to her. </p><p>“What are you doing, go!” she said, blushing. </p><p>“Just a second, I just need to do one last thing before leaving,” I said and before she could respond, leaned down, capturing her lips, slipping my tongue in her mouth along with a strong rush of mana to help her recover. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>[-167 Mana]</p><p>The kiss lasted for several seconds as she froze under my touch, then she pushed me away reluctantly. It was a soft push, but I pulled back nonetheless. “What was that!” she exclaimed, but rather than threatening me with a spell, she just looked at me in shock, her body rising just enough to give me a sight of her small yet perky tits for a moment. </p><p>“I’m helping you recover your mana, of course,” I said calmly, like I was commenting on the weather. “Since you’re going to see the headmistress, it’s for the best if you’re in top shape. What if she needs help.” </p><p>“That-” she stammered, trying to say something, but her wits abandoned her, leaving her mouth half-open. Never the one to such an opportunity, I leaned in for another searing kiss, this time lasting even longer. Even better, she didn’t push me away. </p><p>“Makes sense, right?” I said with a smirk as I pulled back for a breather, but before she could answer, I slammed my lips against hers once more. She just stayed still at first, but toward the middle, her tongue started to respond to my caresses. </p><p>[+800 Experience]</p><p>[-939 Mana]</p><p>[+3 Speech]</p><p>After another minute, I decided to push my luck even more, and let my hands-free on her body, caressing her tits, curious whether it would provoke her anger. </p><p>As it turned out, it would. “That’s enough,” she cut in. “Do your hands help you transfer mana,” she accused me. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I said with a smirk as I stood up, once again showing my shaft to her completely. “It was just for my own enjoyment.” That admission cut the winds off her sails, leaving her unable to answer. Still, it was a sign of our progress that she just processed it silently rather than lashing out. I continued. “So, that’s all I could do through the inefficient delivery method for a short while. That’s it for the moment, unless you want to try the full-performance method, of course.” </p><p>“Get out!” she exclaimed as she threw a block of soap at me. </p><p>I could have dodged it, but the image of the mighty head librarian attacking me with a block of soap while accidentally displaying her bubble-covered tits was amusing enough that I let it hit. “Violent much?” I said mockingly as I walked away, still giving her the full show of my naked body. “See you in a moment,” I said before I gave her a mocking wave, and closed the door, leaving her alone with the realization of what had just happened… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 28    Experience: 386500 / 406000 </p><p>Strength: 33    Charisma: 48</p><p>Precision: 30    Perception: 32</p><p>Agility: 30     Manipulation: 35</p><p>Speed: 29       Intelligence: 39</p><p>Endurance: 27      Wisdom: 38</p><p>HP: 4172 / 4172\tMana: 4106 / 5326        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [86/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [57/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sharing a kiss after a spectacular orgasm was a divine experience, especially when she was still shuddering due to the after-effects of the shock, despite the reprieve I had given her. </p><p>So, I kept the kiss gentle, at first at least. At first, she was motionless, just enjoying the weight of my body, but soon, her hands found my back, caressing softly. “You are delicious,” I murmured as I let my kiss wander from her lips to her neck, enjoying her giggly moan, her fingers digging into my shoulders in response, showing her enjoyment. </p><p>It didn’t take long for the same fierceness to mix into her kiss, when I returned to her lips, she bit mine hard, and I yelped. “Careful,” I said, slapping her thigh just to underline it. </p><p>“You deserved it,” she answered in a surprising moment of rebellion —the erotic, exciting kind— while her fingers dug even deeper into my shoulders, so much that if it wasn’t for her pathetic physical stats, it would have drawn blood. I just let my tongue attack harder, returning to her ardor in a more measured way. </p><p>[-213 Mana]</p><p>As the seconds rolled, she was started to get even more expressive, biting, scratching, clutching, even hitting, while I caressed her body with a contrasting gentleness. Apparently, the last orgasm denial left her wanting more than I had expected. </p><p>However, the real surprise came when her legs wrapped around my body, trying to pull me in, her hips gyrating already. “Do you want me inside?” I asked. She nodded. “Do you want me to slide inside you hard, slamming mercilessly?” I added. </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned, her legs tightening even more. ‘</p><p>“Do you want me to flip you over so that I let loose like you’re nothing more than a piece of meat existing for my enjoyment,” I whispered. </p><p>“Yes, please,” she begged. “I’m still burning with the sensation you created. Finish it, please,” she begged. </p><p>“Too bad,” I said mockingly as I faked standing up. “If you wanted to keep me down, you should have invested in your Strength more.” </p><p>“No! Don’t go!” she begged as her arms wrapped around my neck, keeping me in place. </p><p>I chuckled even as I pulled back a bit more, but rather than leaving the bed, I flipped her over so that I was looking at her plump ass. I pressed one hand between her shoulder blades, effectively immobilizing her while I got rid of my clothes quickly, matching her in nakedness. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m just messing with you. There’s nothing south of a total disaster that could pull me away from your peachy ass,” I whispered as I lowered myself over her once more, this time, my cock safely lodged between her plump cheeks. </p><p>Still, no matter how tempting it sounded, I didn’t slide inside her immediately. Instead, I once again focused on her neck, but this time, wrapping her hair around my hand slowly, once, twice, three times… Until her shining blonde hair turned into a delicious rope that gave me the leverage to pull her head back to seal her lips with a searing kiss. </p><p> Her hips started to shook, signaling that she was more than ready for the main event, only for me to pull out of the kiss and focus on her neck once more, biting hard enough to leave my mark of ownership. “Are you ready for it?” I whispered. </p><p>“Yes-” she started, only to be interrupted as I slid inside her mercilessly, enjoying her walls, which was properly loosened thanks to the extended foreplay. Even then, she let out a delicious cry, giving me the chance to silence her with another kiss. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 52%]</p><p>[-961 Mana]</p><p>Seeing the progress in the Companion Progress was always welcome, but I was more focused on the delicious way her walls wrapped tight around my shaft, like she was trying to stop my invasion —even though her moans disagreed with that conclusion vehemently. </p><p>I could have just kept her pinned under my body as I cut loose, but then I decided to be a bit more mobile. Without even skipping a beat, I wrapped my arms around her waist and stood up, easily lifting her as well. Two steps later, I trapped her body between the wall and my burning body. And just to push the envelope, I cast a cold spell on the wall just before her body connected to it, making her experience the contrasting sensations of cold and heat, making her moan even louder. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 55%]</p><p>[-631 Mana]</p><p>Her cheek pressed against the wall, she was barely able to moan as I slammed against her ass, again and again, the sound of flesh hitting flesh accompanied by the occasional spank I delivered, unable to resist the allure of her curvaceous ass. </p><p>She just took the assault, her hands pressing against the wall like she was a victim about to get arrested, willingly taking everything that I dashed out, taking my cock inside her moist opening repeatedly. </p><p>She just groaned in satisfaction with every slam. </p><p>“Do you like it when I use you hard, like you’re nothing more than a device for my own enjoyment,” I said even as I increased the pressure, making her moan even harder? </p><p>“Yes,” she cried, just a dash of pain, but a lot more pleasure. </p><p>Seeing her submission, rather than being satisfied, I only felt a desire to dominate her more, make her mine even more. Why wouldn’t I, when I had such a perfect little obedient girl to conquer entirely? </p><p>I fucked her hard in fury. I wasn’t angry, but I doubted that if we had an observer, she would agree. Still, Marianne just moaned obediently, clearly enjoying my merciless slams, so there was no real problem. Even when I pulled back to give her a moment to rest, she just moaned in disappointment, goading me for more. </p><p>And I did so, slamming even harder, doing my best to turn her into a simpering wreck. Too bad that she lacked the Endurance to truly handle my strongest effort. </p><p>Still, the results were spectacular. “That's right, impale me,” she moaned deliriously. “Take me, use me, make me yours!” </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 59%]</p><p>[-388 Mana]</p><p>“You really missed me in my absence, huh,” I commented, surprised by the longing and desire she was able to put to her words even when she was being flooded with pleasure. </p><p>I decided to turn up the heat even more. I pulled out and forced her to turn, only to grab her waist and lift her once more. “Grab my neck,” I ordered even as I kept her uplift with one hand under her ass, displaying my great strength, while used the other to lead her leg to my shoulder. After repeating it with the other leg, I slipped both hands under her ass to generate leverage and enjoy the softness of her ass, essentially forcing her body to a V-shaped position. </p><p>It was a perfect position. She had no power, no leverage, and even her pace was completely under my mercy, while every time I pushed, I let her move down as well, using the gravity to create an even more spectacular stab. </p><p>And it showed. She closed her eyes as the pleasure invaded her body, her cries slowly losing their coherence. “Keep your eyes open,” I ordered, keeping her pinned under my gaze. If she wanted to be dominated, I was going to dominate her, without allowing her to take shortcuts. “If you close your eyes, we stop!” I warned. </p><p>“Y-yes, sir,” she moaned in the sweet-spot between fear and need, showing her understanding. And I cut loose, aggressively invading her entrance, every push making her tits jiggle wildly. Just to underline my overwhelming physical strength, I started walking around the room to room, from study to her guest room, like I owned the place. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 63%]</p><p>[-251 Mana]</p><p>I couldn’t help but imagine the rush I would get from walking around the corridors like that, in front of everyone, without a care of the world. Unfortunately, it was impossible. First, I needed to be strong enough to survive such a scandal, and I doubted even the Emperor had such power. Second, I needed to turn the school into a female-only organization, because I was a jealous man, and had no intention to display my girl to the other men. </p><p>It might be a hypocritical attitude considering my own situation, but it was the best thing about being powerful. Only powerful had the right to be so. </p><p>“Tell me who you are?” I ordered even as I squeezed her ass, enjoying her immobilized body to my heart’s content. </p><p>“I’m your toy,” she moaned back, her eyes still pinned to mine, burning with honest desire, all the while I pierced her again and again. </p><p>She was too focused on my eyes to notice or care when I brought her against her dresses, which had a full-body mirror, not that she had a real-time view of it due to her back being turned to it. However, I split my attention between her eyes and the reflection of her beautiful back, watching in fascination as every merciless push stretched her further, filling her to the brim. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 68%]</p><p>[-391 Mana]</p><p>The view got even better as I pulled her asscheeks apart, revealing her puckered hole. Luckily, thanks to the convenience of magic, all it took was a simple dash of magic to prepare her back entrance, both cleaning and lubricating, before slipping in two fingers to loosen it. </p><p>Even as I prepared her backdoor for the impending invasion, I continued to slam her with my full weight. Her legs stiffened under the stress of the position, but she continued to moan, only to intensify when I added another finger to my next target.  </p><p>A squeal escaped her beautiful lips that were swollen with my hard kisses when I pulled out, only to put it in my other target. “Yes, yes, YES!” she cried as my shaft slowly invaded her backdoor, once again showing her preference toward the forbidden hole, something I suspected that I was responsible due to the nature of our earlier relationship, when I took her repeatedly in the ass before finally claiming her virginity. </p><p>Her body shook, tears slipped down her cheeks and her cries echoed on the walls, but none of them was enough to hide the sense of completion shining in her beautiful blue eyes. She clamped on my neck with her full strength, while I continued to take both of her holes in alternating strokes.</p><p>In the same position, seconds turned into minutes, while she did her best to break the magically-reinforced glass with her voice.  </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 73%]</p><p>[-1308 Mana]</p><p>“Let’s do a pop quiz,” I suddenly ordered her, like she wasn’t being challenged enough. “Show me the spell.” </p><p>“But-” she started, but I cut her off with an aggressive kiss. </p><p>“I didn’t ask for your opinion,” I suggested to her, even as I continued to slam inside her. “I ordered.” </p><p>Facing my sharp glare, she was unable to reject my order, and pulled off one of her hands from the back of my neck, and raised up between our bodies, inches above her beautiful tits that jumped every time I impaled her mercilessly. She did her best to cast it, but her concentration was marred with pleasure and the disappointment she felt prematurely, before she even tried. </p><p>Predictably, she failed. “Sorry-” she murmured. </p><p>“Repeat!” I ordered even as I continued to pump her with my mana, and preparing to pump her up with my seed. She tried, only to fail again. </p><p>Before she could apologize again, however, I exploded, which immediately triggered a climax in her as well, along with a flood of notifications. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 75% - Third Stage Completed +15000 Exp]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated.

However, if it wasn’t for the impending meeting with the oldest princess of the Empire, I might have chosen Craft Skill to round up my skillset, so that I could create better equipment for myself, working in combination with Oeyne. </p><p>But facing the prospect of such a critical meeting, not to mention a possible one with the Headmistress, I decided to rely on the utility of the Speech skill. Both the Princess and the Headmistress might have skills that would counter my Charisma, so the smoother my speech skills, the better. </p><p>After finalizing that, I turned my attention back to Marianne, who was enjoying her most recent achievement. “Try again,” I ordered, but this time with a smile. “Yes,” she said with enthusiasm, and after she waved her hand, the familiar warmth of the pure life energy filled the room, the gap in ability compensated by her stat increase. </p><p>However, we had another little surprise just as I was preparing to let her walk. “Another achievement, giving me two points of Agility,” she gasped in shock, and I reached for her soul space, only to feel a natural Achievement sliding into place. </p><p>I immediately focused on the process. It was a rare opportunity, especially since the great contrast I could feel with them. Naturally, it was different from the achievements that were generated by the Companion System, but to my surprise, it also felt different than my own natural achievements. </p><p>Yet another facet of mystery to my ability, I thought, even as I kissed her to congratulate her for her double achievement. Then, I received a surprise of my own. </p><p>[Achievement: Strange Source.

Luckily, Marianne was lost in a haze of her own, distracted by a spectacular combination of a climax and two new achievements. </p><p>I walked to the bed, almost drunk, while I tried to understand the implications of the latest achievement. It confirmed two things. First, other people received their achievements from an external source —maybe the same, maybe different— but somehow, my own came from a different place. </p><p>Moreover, I was starting to have a feeling that my own System somehow wanted me to explore that difference. Whether it had some kind of sentience, or it was some kind of magical automatic response, or even whether it was a reflection of my own subconscious desires was a very difficult question. </p><p>However, when I arrived at Marianne’s bed and threw her on the bed to lay next to her, hugging her curvy figure, I decided to ignore the implications of my latest major achievement for the moment. </p><p>I had already enough to worry about in the short term to worry about. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 28    Experience: 384700 / 406000 </p><p>Strength: 33    Charisma: 48</p><p>Precision: 30    Perception: 32</p><p>Agility: 30     Manipulation: 35</p><p>Speed: 29       Intelligence: 39</p><p>Endurance: 27      Wisdom: 38</p><p>HP: 4172 / 4172\tMana: 2571 / 5326        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [82/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [50/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite the entertaining and productive time I had spent with Oeyne, I found myself with a frown as I left her workshop. The sudden involvement of a princess of the Royal Family tickled my mind. With everything else that was going on, her arrival threatened to add even more to the upcoming chaos. </p><p>And I wasn’t naive enough to hope that it was just a coincidence. </p><p>However, the question still remained about her involvement, whether she was aligned with the necromancers, or whether she was another target to the secret plot that was going on. Of course, there was still a small, but realistic possibility that her visit had nothing to do with the pending necromancer assault, but as I mentioned, I wasn’t going to bank on that. </p><p>Unfortunately, my relationship with Oeyne was not enough to dig deeper about the princess’ visit without scaring her off, nor it was bad enough that I could employ more hostile interrogation tactics. </p><p>Since I was temporarily unable to do anything about the impending visit, I needed to focus on something I could control. Namely, a beauty that I had been neglecting for a while. </p><p>Marianne. </p><p>It was hard to believe that it was just a couple of days since I last visited her. It felt much longer with everything that happened, from the discovery of the Necromancer base to the discovery of the artificial monster horde. </p><p>Of course, while I missed her voluptuous body, it wasn’t the only reason for my visit. It was not even the main reason. With the possible necromancer assault, Marianne had the potential to play an important role if she could progress with the trick I had taught her, especially if I power-level her to the same point as Cornelia. </p><p>Having someone else that could deal area-effect damage to necromancers without hurting allies might prove critical, especially if the necromancers deploy a multi-pronged assault. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t hard to find Marianne in the late afternoon. I easily sneaked into her room, which turned into a routine task after many repeats. </p><p>She was in her room, practicing the Biomancy trick I had taught her, so focused that she failed to notice me as I walked toward her, even when I didn’t bother to hide my presence. It was good to see her working seriously, every attempt to cast accompanied with a great focus. </p><p>Of course, soon, my attention slipped down from the glowing energy in her hands to the loose, half-transparent nightie she was wearing, which displayed her curves to my eye. Even more impressively, the absence of any underwear was equally obvious. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured as I hugged her from behind. </p><p>She flinched. “Caesar, you scared me,” she said, but that didn’t prevent her from leaning against me with a deep sigh. “I missed you,” she murmured. </p><p>“Sorry, honey,” I answered even as I gently kissed her neck. “But the last few days had been very complicated, and filled with mortal danger. It’s good that you worked diligently on the spell I taught you.” </p><p>“I still can’t cast it,” she said dejectedly. “And what happened?” </p><p>“About the spell, don’t worry. You made more progress than I had hoped. And about what happened…” I said, dragging my words as I let my hands dance over her body, tasting her curves before finding her shoulders, squeezing lightly. “We can talk about that, or we can work on your tense shoulders. Which one would you prefer?” </p><p>“The second,” she immediately answered even if she blushed thickly, her habits as a noble daughter making her feel self-conscious even after everything we had done together. </p><p>I said nothing, just chuckled as I lifted her in a bridal hold, carrying her to her bedroom. “Who am I to deny the request of such a beautiful woman,” I murmured before clasping her lips with mine, enjoying the assault of her enthusiastic tongue, to the point that I rewarded her with slipping back some mana.</p><p>[-56 Mana]</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock. “I just earned some experience,” she gasped in shock. “What’s going on!” </p><p>“It’s another reward you earned with your cute obedience,” I immediately answered. “Keep it a secret though, okay?” I added, and she nodded immediately. She was smart enough to understand the implications of such a momentous development. But following her shock, I could see the hint of worship in her eyes solidifying even further. </p><p>“Who are you?” she asked, her face full of fascination. </p><p>I responded with a quirked eyebrow. “That’s another secret, and if you be a good girl, maybe you’ll learn it as well one day,” I answered mysteriously, hiding the fact that I had no idea about who I was either. Maybe one day, I’ll learn it too. </p><p>“I can’t wait for the day,” she said with a worshipful expression, her honesty suggesting that I hadn’t wasted my time working on her. </p><p>“Let’s focus on the important things first,” I added as lay her on the bed. “For example, the reward I had promised for you for working hard.” </p><p>She gasped in anticipation as I grabbed her nightie, only to rip it off in a primal pull, leaving her completely naked, then leaned over her. She tried to raise her body to cover the rest of the distance, trying to steal a kiss, but I pressed my finger to her lips, cutting her motion short. “Don’t worry, honey,” I murmured. “This is about rewarding you. Just lay on your back, and enjoy.” </p><p>“Mmmm,” she moaned as I traced her jawline with little fleeting kisses, her floral perfume teasing my nose, before I moved down, focusing on her neck for a fleeting moment, followed by her dainty collarbones. However, the next step on my journey, I spent quite a bit of time. Why wouldn’t I, when her amazing breasts deserved it thoroughly? </p><p>“Harder,” she ordered when I subjected her tits to a rain of fleeting kisses. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I dragged my hands on her tits, doing a soft pass to familiarize myself with the softness of her skin once more before sinking my fingers deep. But that was nothing compared to my clamping lips, sucking her tits hard enough to a bright red mark that signaled my ownership. “Better?” I asked.</p><p>“Much better,” she responded, surprisingly verbal, though that didn’t mean her shyness was completely gone. I could feel that she was trying to look a bit more outgoing and confident, but she was clearly trying to copy Cornelia. </p><p>I came to a sudden realization. She was feeling neglected, therefore she was trying to look more attractive to me, and she was doing so by trying to copy Cornelia’s more outgoing attitude. </p><p>How cute, I thought, but didn’t say anything. It wasn’t something that could be fixed with words. Saying something would only make things worse. Instead, I made a note to visit her more often, before refocusing on her delicious tits. The best way to reinforce her confidence was to give her an earthshattering orgasm. </p><p>Or maybe a few.</p><p>“I missed this,” she moaned as I squeezed her tits, her nipples hardening against my palms. I enjoyed the rumble of her moans, but as much as I loved her tits, I had other ideas in mind. My lips and one of my hands stayed on the vicinity of her bosom, but a naughty hand sneaked downward, circling around her cute bellybutton before dropping down even lower, finally unearthing the treasure that was hidden between her deliciously plump thighs that made me want them wrapped around my waist whenever I saw her curvy figure. </p><p>“Oh, yes!” she moaned as my finger circled around her clit like it did around her belly button, but to a much greater impact, followed by a much louder moan once my finger slipped inside her, making me glad that I had long reinforced the silencing ward in her room. Her slickness covered my skin as I added another finger to our little game, pumping inside her rapidly. “Faster, please,” she begged. </p><p>“As my sweetheart wishes,” I answered playfully, immediately following with a bite on her soft breasts while my fingers quickened. She might have tried to answer my little quip, but my rapid assault didn’t give her a chance to speak, especially when I enhanced her pleasure by coating my finger with mana, triggering her enjoyment even further while simultaneously helping her relax. </p><p>[-449 Mana]</p><p>Who said power-leveling was a boring affair?</p><p>I only pulled my hand away when her moans started to strain, signaling she was getting closer to a climax. I had a better idea to bring her over the hill. “Mmm, delicious,” I murmured as I pulled my hand out of her entrance, only to suck them with great gusto. “Let’s see whether it tastes even better at the source.” </p><p>Marianne said nothing, just let out a deep, guttural moan that betrayed her primal need, legs parting open invitingly. When I pressed my lips against her soft, moist lips, she let out a moan that would have convinced me that she was drunk if I hadn’t seen her sober. Still, maybe she was drunk, with pleasure, at least. </p><p>When my tongue joined in, her moans exploded even louder, giving great background music to my entertaining enterprise. “I love that you keep it clean,” I murmured as I enjoyed her smooth skin before I let my tongue free, drawing complicated shapes that drove her even crazier. </p><p>“Yes, for you,” she moaned even as her back arched with pleasure under my probing assault, occasionally slipping inside to add some penetration to our little teasing game. However, my aim wasn’t to make her moan in pleasure, or not just that. I also wanted to help her level up, using the opportunity to pass more and more mana, quickening her leveling journey even more. </p><p>[-725 Mana]</p><p>However, while focusing between her legs, I realized that my hands were quite empty, so I let them free on her skin, one of them climbing upward back to the great expanse of her tits, while the other dug into her thigh, with a roughness that contrasted with the delicate assault of my lips. </p><p>“More, please,” she begged, signaling that her climax was not too far away, but unlike the previous times, I disregarded her order. It might be her present, but everyone knew that anticipation only made the present better. “Please,” she repeated as my tongue performed a slow dance on her most sensitive spot, doing its best to drive her insane with pleasure, her moans getting louder and louder.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, her loud yelps and unrestrained howls only made it better for me. I barely paid attention to my primary aim of helping her level up, letting my enhanced Tantric skill show its benefit as I continued to deplete my mana while pushing her toward a new level. I wanted it to time it perfectly, so that she climaxed at the exact moment of leveling up, which would create a delicious memory for her, and a convenient mental association for me, just in case. </p><p>She begged, she moaned, she gyrated her hips, all in the hopes of making me move quicker, but unfortunately, it was never a symmetrical affair. At this moment, she was both the recipient of my performance and the instrument I played with. Only, she wasn’t a contributor, but a passive receptor, which, according to her moans, something she was perfectly happy with. </p><p>For a moment, I wished Cornelia was here. A performance like this would only be better as an audience, especially the said audience was my current maid and Marianne’s ex-girlfriend —and maybe still was… Regardless, I was vain enough to get off by Cornelia’s double-layered jealousy, both from never letting Marianne achieve the same heights, and not being the one to experience the said pleasure at the same time. </p><p>Maybe I should do that at the same time. </p><p>Even as a part of my attention wandered into interesting fantasies, I made sure to continue treating Marianne with my professional-quality edge-play, driving her crazy, all the while never stopping the mana flow. </p><p>[-1646 Mana]</p><p>Using my mana senses, I could feel her soul space strengthening further, another event horizon nearing, which signaled level up. Just as she was about to level up, I pulled back, but left just enough mana to enable her to level up. </p><p>“Don’t stop, please,” she begged. “I’ll do anything, just let me cum!” </p><p>“Really,” I said, several interesting scenarios that I could use that favor playing in my mind. “As you wish, Marianne,” I said, still staying away, but that didn’t mean that I stopped completely. Instead, I blew my breath against her sensitive flesh, and letting the last scraps of mana merge into her soul space at the same time. </p><p>The resulting cry of pleasure was simply a masterpiece, a transitory art piece that rivaled the best works of the grandmasters. Pity that I had no way of recording such a beautiful moment. </p><p>As she trembled with the aftershocks of her spectacular explosion, I pulled to her side, and hugged her tight, enjoying her sweaty skin against mine as it delivered every bubbly tremor directly, making me proud with the satisfaction of a job well done. Even her leveling went perfectly, and I could feel her Healing Skill get stronger, and more importantly, transitioning from fragmented to complete, signaling she had finally achieved the complete Grandmaster level. </p><p>[Achievement: Tremendous Tongue. Use your tongue to unlock the route for greater power. +500 Experience, +1 Precision, +1 Speed]</p><p>“I leveled up,” she murmured in fascination, though she only said that a minute later, where she finally pushed through the haze of her explosive orgasm.</p><p>“I’m wounded,” I said with a chuckle. “All that effort, and you simply focus on your level.” </p><p>My quip earned a playful slap. “You are a bad, bad man,” she accused, but it was hard to stick those harsh words with a dreamy giggle. Still, she tried. </p><p>“Really,” I said, as I suddenly shifted my position and trapped her under me. “Maybe I should show you just how bad I can be,” I said before I sealed her lips with a kiss… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 364700 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 28    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 27       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3753 / 3753\tMana: 4396 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [82/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“It must be a trap,” I murmured in shock as I watched the ward at the entrance melt away, providing me with access, even though it absolutely made no sense. Considering the location of the city, and the function it served, a trap like this made no sense, but I wanted to believe it to be true. </p><p>Because, the alternative possibility was even crazier. The ward melting away like this meant that I was authorized to pass through the wards, which made no sense at all. How could I be registered to a ward that was constructed centuries ago? </p><p>I didn’t walk through the doorway immediately, instead of focusing my attention on the wards. They stayed inert under my magical touch, giving me the opportunity to examine them carefully, making my task much easier, not that it meant I could decipher all the secrets it held easily. </p><p>The identification structure of the ward was easy enough to understand, not to exact specifics, but I was able to recognize a section focusing on identifying the heritage of the visitor, while simultaneously measuring the power as well, however it was also wrought with many time-tracking additions. </p><p>“Maybe it’s because I’m a Scipio,” I murmured after spending half an hour without discovering anything useful, and deciding to take the plunge. I passed through the doorway without dying, so my gamble paid off, but the questions remained. </p><p>Because, even as I said it, I knew that my Scipio heritage was unlikely to be the reason for my passage. Yes, my ancestors worked alongside both Caesar and Augustus during their rebellions, but in neither time, they had a strength that would justify being granted direct access to such an important section like this. </p><p>“Maybe…” I murmured, before I shook my head, dispelling those thoughts for a moment. The reason I could access this section didn’t matter, not when I finally had the access to the information I desperately needed. </p><p>I could finally crack my problematic Ascension. </p><p>Excitement dispelling my need to sleep, I started reading vigorously anything fundamentally related to Sorcerer ascension. </p><p>Only to find out that by any rational measure, I should be dead already. From what I could find out, my Ascension wasn’t just a botched version of a normal Ascension. Not even close. </p><p>According to the books, being a Sorcerer meant going against the natural order of the world, therefore, it needed to be conducted in an area that was completely isolated from the four elements of the natural order, namely, Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. If one tried to Ascend without isolation, the combined backlash from the four elements was supposed to destroy the mage that dared to defy the order. </p><p>There wasn’t anything about the rejection I was receiving from the four elements as well, but considering the fates of the others that failed to Ascend, I wasn’t really torn up about that particular advantage. </p><p>And, there was nothing at all relating to the lightning, the dominant element of the Sky. </p><p>In all the books I read, there was not even direct mention of it in relation to the Ascension process. Like the possibility didn’t exist at all. The closest thing was able to find was the descriptions of the God-kings in the ancient city cities, before the Great Collapse of the Bronze Age, but considering the timeline it referred was about three millenniums ago, before the great collapse had destroyed the ancient city-states so thoroughly that even finding written records of them become near-impossible, I wasn’t going to take it as reliable information. </p><p>Still, the mention of the God-Kings, bathing under the rain of lightning interesting. Pity that I didn’t have time to delve into such an unrelated academic pursuit. </p><p>In the end, I shifted my research focus away from the Ascension, trying to understand how to improve my own power. Luckily, on that aspect, the library was far more fruitful. Even though most of the tempering exercises and the spells were based on the four elements, the library also included a huge section on the non-elemental pursuits, from complicated and intricate runes impossible to be powered by normal mages, to the forging techniques on how to craft deadly weapons. </p><p>The only disappointing aspect was the lightning-based spells and tempering exercises. After spending four hours, I was barely able to find a handful of lightning spells, and only one tempering Technique, which was called the Wrath of the Heavens. Not exactly the friendliest name. </p><p>Though, as I read the tempering technique, I could understand why. The essence of the technique lied on summoning lightning directly to one’s body while staying in a specially-designed room. The room was supposed to reduce the impact of the lightning multiple times to ensure the survival of the Sorcerer, who then needed to use his magic to absorb the remaining lightning across his body in a fixed pattern, forcing the lightning to burn his core. </p><p>The result was a smaller, yet purer core with stronger output and more flexible magic. </p><p>I doubted it would work as described for me considering my weird yet beneficial relationship with the Lightning element. Still, it was worth a try. Maybe I could modify something for my preference. </p><p>Still, rather than leaving the room immediately, I continued searching for more. This time, the search wasn’t for myself, but for the girls. </p><p>This time, the research was far more fruitful. I had found many techniques that could quickly strengthen the mages toward the threshold. </p><p>It was already morning when I finally left the library, and stumbled toward the house. On the way, I first saw Astrid, who was only wearing her poorly-tailored underwear, the kind even a beggar would turn her nose, but somehow looking sexy in them. “Good morning,” I said exhaustedly. </p><p>“Are you okay?” she said as she dashed toward me immediately, her generous assets shaking beautifully enough to dispel my exhaustion. After spending a long night parsing complicated texts, I wanted to relax. </p><p>So, I grabbed her and pushed her against the wall. “No, but I’m about to be,” I whispered into her ear even as I ripped her ugly underwear off, leaving her pristine body naked once more. </p><p>“You’re quite motivated-” Astrid managed to utter before she was interrupted by a moan when I slipped two fingers inside her, feeling her growing wetness. She didn’t resist as I pushed her toward the nearest wall, her tits pressing against the marble wall, clean thanks to their effort. </p><p>“I spent all night trying to find the perfect tempering technique for you two,” I whispered even as I nibbled her neck, pushing my fingers even deeper inside her. “I earned a decent compensation.” </p><p>“As you wish, my lord,” she gasped as she twisted her neck to face me, her green pupils dilated with excitement. I pulled her away from the wall for a moment, just enough to put my hand between her tits and the wall, squeezing to enjoy their firmness. </p><p>Her legs parted open as I pushed my fingers deeper into her pussy, preparing for my invasion. Soon, her entrance was wet enough to allow my invasion, and I pulled my hand out, using it to remove my pants, which revealed my raging erection. </p><p>“The monster is once again out,” she gasped in satisfaction as I pressed the head against her entrance, her wetness embracing the familiar presence immediately. </p><p>“Yes. Let’s see whether the sacrifice would be enough to calm its rage, or whether it would search for more,” I added, making her tremble in excitement as I caressed her puckered hole, leaving no ambiguity about what I was referring to.  </p><p>“Maybe,” she gasped as slowly invaded her core, along with her moans. Considering she was a virgin just a week ago, not to mention a priestess forbidden to touch a man, she was showing amazing adaptability to my presence, like she was born to be mine. </p><p>I was so lucky. </p><p>“Faster,” she moaned as my shaft slowly invaded her entrance. Normally, I would have used it as an invitation to slow down even further, teasing her slowly, but this time, I was tapped out after an exhausting night in the library, and was looking for a quick release, so the moment the word left her mouth, I pushed deeper, extracting a loud moan of her. </p><p>Her entrance stretched to embrace my presence easier, along with her wordless moans, worshipping my presence. Even as I pushed deep, however, she pushed her hips out, quickening the process even further. </p><p>Being inside her was a divine experience, as usual. Silky and snug, she hugged my presence hard, trying to extract my essence. Unfortunately, that was not something that could be achieved immediately, so I continued to slam inside her, the sound of colliding flesh mixing with her cries. </p><p>Once I was completely inside her, I decided to change the pace. I stopped for a moment, then slowly withdrawing it almost all the way out, only to reverse direction and mercilessly slam the full length in one merciless push. </p><p>Then, Lillian walked in. “It’s the most interesting wake-up call I had ever heard,” she said mockingly as she sauntered toward us, her naked body glistening under the morning sun, her blonde hair almost golden with the reflection. When she came closer, she leaned to steal a kiss, something I was more than happy to accommodate. </p><p>“How was the library?” she asked after she pulled back, her hands already on my arm, delivering a gentle massage to resolve my tenseness. I was more than happy to respond in kind. “Any discoveries?” she continued after a long kiss, while I continued to slam into Astrid. </p><p>“Better than I expected,” I said. “I have found several useful spells, more importantly, tempering techniques to help you girls to get stronger faster. Along with the environment, I’m really hopeful. It shouldn’t take more than a few years to Ascend.” </p><p>“That’s incredible,” she cried, her eyes wide. Her excitement was understandable. While there were many Sorcerers younger than thirty in the Republic, it wasn’t a coincidence that all of them came from Rome or the surrounding countryside. Essentially, any family with reliable tempering techniques to enable ascension could also afford to live in the capital as a middle-rank family. And being a middle-rank family was much better than being a top-dog anywhere else. </p><p>Ultimately, Rome was the heart of the Republic. </p><p>“You deserve a reward,” Lillian moaned as she gave another kiss before kneeling down, and pressed her lips against the base of my cock, assisting the treatment. I switched my assault on Astrid, going short yet rapid strokes instead of long ones, but Lillian’s lips and tongue proved to be a great addition. </p><p>As I exploded inside Astrid, there was one thought in my mind. </p><p>Sometimes, studying paid its dividends. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>I sat alone in the school cafeteria, a dark yet amused smirk on my face. </p><p>The eighteenth birthday was supposed to be an important point in a young man’s life. Unfortunately, I received a rather unwelcome surprise in mine. I had learned that we were about to move to a new city due to my father’s promotion. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t exactly a person to awaken other’s sympathies, my life wasn’t exactly a drama. Not when I was a six-foot-three quarterback who was very close to breaking the state record, with a chiseled body and a handsome face. Combine with my overall popularity, and above-average intelligence that allowed me to keep my grades up despite endless practice an active social life, I doubted many people would waste their pity on me. </p><p>Luckily, it was just an unfortunate setback rather than something that ruined my life, because I already had offers from three universities thanks to my impressive play, so I didn’t need to join a brand new team for the last semester of my high school life. It would have been impossible to get the starter position as a quarterback, and even if I could take it, performing in a new team would have been impossible. </p><p>Still, as I looked at the new cafeteria, I couldn’t help but sigh in disappointment. One disadvantage of changing the school was that I was no longer the coolest kid in the school. I was handsome enough to join the clique, but popular people groups were always annoyingly hierarchic, which meant that I had to accept a weaker role in the group to pay my dues at first, wasting a considerable amount of time and money to woo the popular girls. </p><p>It was definitely not worth it. </p><p>It was why I decided to experiment with an alternative personality in my new school. Instead of wearing the tight, stylish shirts and expensive jeans, I wore an old plaid shirt that I used when I was doing chores, and a faded jean that was ripped because it was old, not fashionable. To make things even more fun, I had a backpack filled with books, more than a few belonged to AP track. </p><p>Since I was going to play the nerd, I wanted to learn something about the college, so that when I was in college, I could train more rather than study. </p><p>However, those plans were suddenly interrupted when I felt one of the chairs move. “Is this seat free?” a soft voice asked, unable to mask her shyness as she did so. </p><p>“Yeah, it’s free,” I said without even raising my head, expecting her to leave with the chair. Only when she murmured her thanks and sat on the chair, I deigned to raise my head, only to quirk my eyebrow in amusement. </p><p>It had been a while since a nerd dared to sit next to me. I never bullied them, but that didn’t mean that the others in the popular group —let’s call them friends, though it’s not very accurate— didn’t share my live and let live attitude, mostly because they weren’t as confident as their popularity. Bullying others was a way for them to clinch their spot. </p><p>And my uninvited guest was definitely a nerd, with her loose clothes, glasses, and hair that was simply tied behind. For a moment, I stayed silent, just gazing at her. I was planning to stay silent until she said something, but under my gaze, her already shaky self-confidence started to flicker. First, she avoided my gaze as the blush spread over her neck, then she shuffled in her seat, like she was preparing to stand up. </p><p>I pitied her enough to take the initiative. “Hey, I’m Chad, the new guy,” I said with my trademark smile as I gave her a little wave. </p><p>“C-Carrie,” she stammered as she reached her blonde ponytail and fixed it. Not that it was needed, but it displayed her nervousness. “W-welcome to Sunny High?” she added, no less choppily than her own name. </p><p>“A pleasure,” I answered, not bothering to hide my soft chuckle. It made her blush even harder, but she stayed on her seat, which positively surprised me. Still, I planned to say nothing else as we started eating. Then, I heard a suppressed giggle and paid a glance in that direction, only to see four other girls on a distant table, looking at us with blushing faces, giggling among themselves. </p><p>From their clothes and accessories —or a lack of them— I guessed that they were friends of Carrie, either impressed by her courage of talking the new guy, or dared her to do so in the first place. And I had a feeling that it was the second part. </p><p>“Are you in the AP Math as well?” Carrie suddenly asked five minutes into our silence, pointing at the book on the top of the pile. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I answered kindly. She was clearly shy enough to struggle to keep a conversation alive, so I decided to take pity on her. “I was a bit busy at my old school with the extracurriculars, so I never joined AP classes. But since I have time, I want to learn a bit more, to handle the college easier.” </p><p>“Smart,” she answered, then she took a deep breath, trying to gather her courage. “You can ask me if you have any questions. I’m in the AP classes for several subjects.” </p><p>“Smart, and beautiful,” I said with a charming smile, and her blush turned into an out-of-control forest fire, stammering helplessly. I complimented her because I wouldn’t say no to having a willing tutor. She wasn’t ugly by any means, she definitely had a pleasant, symmetrical face, though she wasn’t strikingly beautiful either. Certainly not with those ugly glasses. And her body was a total mystery under those loose clothes, but I didn’t expect much.</p><p>The rest of the lunch passed in relative silence. I asked a few inconsequential questions, she stuttered her answers. I made sure to smile at her after her every answer, but it seemed that it made things even worse. </p><p>What could I do? My handsomeness was my curse! </p><p>Just as she was about to leave, I grabbed her hand and wrote my number. “Don’t forget to text, and see you around,” I said as I stood up. As I left the cafeteria, she was blushing like she was about to explode. </p><p>I felt amused at the impact. As a popular guy, I dated exclusively with the hottest girls, and if there was one disadvantage of doing so, that they were far too used to being hit on. Dealing with them was always a challenge no matter how popular I was. The sudden change of pace was interesting. </p><p>Still, I went through the rest of the classes, and I wasn’t expecting much from my new acquaintance. She wasn’t interesting enough for me to chase, and I didn’t need a tutor. And even if I wanted to contact her, she didn’t send a message back, which made it impossible for me to connect with her unless I walked around the school, looking for her. </p><p>I certainly wasn’t going to do that. </p><p>When classes ended, I didn’t have any plan other than to go back home and do my daily exercise routine. Just because I got college offers, didn’t mean that I was going to get it. My physique needed to be up to par to make sure I was accepted. </p><p>However, as I was passing near the library, my phone vibrated. I flipped to open. It was Carrie, telling me that she would be in the library, asking me to drop by if I had the time. </p><p>‘Sure, I’ll be there in five minutes,’ I wrote back even as I immediately stepped into the library, but stayed behind a large shelf as I looked inside. After interacting with Carrie during lunch, I had a feeling that she wouldn’t be brave enough to send that message. </p><p>And it turned out to be correct, as I saw Carrie sitting on a corner desk, with four other friends next to her —the same ones from the lunch event— giggling while Carrie blushed. She murmured something to her friends that made them laugh even more. Pity that I was too far away to listen to them. </p><p>I watched as Carrie’s four friends teased her relentlessly for a while before they departed, leaving their friend alone, panicking enough that I was afraid she would explode. </p><p>“Hey,” I said as I walked toward her slowly after I appeared behind the shelves, giving her the time to calm her emotions, which didn’t work as well as I had planned. When I arrived, she was still fluttering in panic, so much that I pitied her. “Perfect that you texted me, one of the problems on differentials was driving me crazy.” Which couldn’t be farther from the truth, but I tried to make her relax by bringing the discussion into her comfort zone. </p><p>“Let me look,” she said immediately, ripping the book off my hands with surprising strength, missing my amused expression as she read the question. “Hmm, that’s a tricky one,” she murmured as she scribbled a few lines on the paper, her hands trembling. The question wasn’t that hard, but she still worked it excessively detailed, giving herself a chance to calm down. </p><p>I sat down next to her, listening to her explanation, which helped me to understand quite a bit about the subject. “Thanks, you’re a good teacher,” I told her after she finished explaining, along with a bright smile. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stuttered, her blush back full force. “Do you have any other questions, I wouldn’t mind helping more,” she added. “I have the time.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I asked her another question, enjoying the sudden change of dynamic. The experience was very familiar, one person desperately trying to make an excuse to spend time with their crush. I was frequently on the other side of it, especially when I was just a junior, trying to hit on the upperclassman. </p><p>I had to admit, switching the roles was rather entertaining. Despite her shyness, Carrie was doing her best to keep the conversation going, though mostly relying on the thick math book in front of us as a clutch. Still, I was impressed with her effort enough that I started to contribute whenever the discussion stalled, keeping the conversation alive with less serious topics. </p><p>It turned out we didn’t have much in common. She lacked any interest in sports, and my knowledge about the kind of books she enjoyed was shallow. Still, I was surprised that despite our differences, our chat turned out to be rather entertaining. She had an interesting sense of humor, which was shadowed by her shyness, and I was not half-bad at the empty talk —even if whenever she laughed at one of my jokes, it turned out a bit too enthusiastic, fueled by her crush. </p><p>To make things even more fun, I noticed that her friends were passing by the library door, unable to contain their giggles. </p><p>“… and if we link equation one to two, we get the answer,” Carrie said, finishing the explanation for yet another question. Then, her phone buzzed, and she immediately grabbed it —but not before I could read the message on the screen, telling her to touch my arm more. Apparently, her friends were helping her to ‘seduce’ me as she explained her questions. </p><p>“Smart,” I said, struggling not to laugh as she dragged her finger over my bicep. It was such a mechanical, rigid move that I started to suspect she was one of the cyborgs that were in one of the movies she had explained to me enthusiastically. Still, I smiled back at her rather than saying that explicitly, because I wasn’t a total asshole. She was clearly new to flirting —so were her friends, if their 60s Cosmopolitan advice were anything to go by— and I didn’t want to squash her hopes. Since I hung out with the popular crowds, I had seen some popular girls squashing the boys that dared to confess, and the shattered dreams that resulted were hardly pretty. </p><p>Another half an hour passed as we studied, and Carrie flirted me rather clumsily, exaggerated laughs, caressing my arm continuously, the whole works, but she was so earnest that it was amusing rather than annoying. So much that I decided to reward her for her bravery. </p><p>“That’s it for the day,” I said as I slammed the book shut, which made her look disappointed. But my next words were more than enough to fix her despair. “Thanks for your tutoring,” I added. “How about I buy you dinner as thanks?” </p><p>“That would be lovely,” she immediately answered with a smile. </p><p>“Do you have a car?” I asked. “Because my ride is in the shop.” Actually, my ride wasn’t in the shop, but resting in the garage, gathering spiderwebs. I thought that taking my high-powered bike to the school wouldn’t exactly help me keep a low profile. </p><p>“Yeah, I can drive,” she murmured, though hesitant. The reason turned out to be rather amusing, as her car was filled with books and loose papers, more reminiscent of a hoarder’s nest. </p><p>“Let me help you,” I offered as we quickly stuffed everything in the car in the trunk, and I earned a grateful smile in response. Once the car finally looked decent, I took the passenger seat, and we drove away. The dinner turned out to be an extension of the drive, where she tried to flirt with me clumsily, trying something new whenever she read a new message on her phone, no doubt receiving cues from her friends. </p><p>“How about if we watch a movie next?” she offered as we left the diner, and started driving once more. </p><p>“Sorry, I can’t skip my exercise routine. Maybe the next time,” I offered. As much as I enjoyed her offer, I didn’t want to skip my evening exercise, not when my whole life was on the line based on the physical tests I was going to undergo. </p><p>“I understand,” she said, but her voice was already trembling. My soft rejection managed to destroy the self-confidence she managed to gather earlier in the day. </p><p>I sighed. “Pull over,” I said, and she did so, but she must have misunderstood my objective, because she was looking even more distraught. “Carrie, look at me,” I said. </p><p>She did so, but with tears gathering in her green eyes. “I’m sorry,” she mumbled. “I thought that… I… It’s silly…” </p><p>I touched her chin, raising her head. “Sweetheart, you don’t have anything to be sorry about. You’re a beautiful girl, and I’m very flattered by your interest. However, I’m just going to be here for a few months, with a very busy schedule. I’m just not looking for a girlfriend right now. Believe me, if I did, I would be lucky to have you,” I said, using the same tone I used to convince many girls they were precious, usually just before pushing them on the backseat of a car for a very memorable night. Pity tonight was going to be a bit drier. </p><p>“Thanks, even if you’re just trying to let me go easily,” Carrie answered, but her tears started to disappear, which was a win. “I know I’m a terrible flirt.” </p><p>“Hey, it’s like Math. You just need to practice,” I said.</p><p>“D-don’t be ridiculous, “she answered. “Being popular is all about how beautiful and charismatic one is. How can you practice something like that.” </p><p>“Do you have any idea when a popular girl wakes up to make sure her make-up and clothes are up to snuff?” I said. “At least an hour before they leave for the school.” </p><p>“You got to be kidding me,” she said, shocked. </p><p>“I swear to god,” I said with a chuckle. “They even take two hours if they have something really important.” </p><p>For a moment, she looked interested in my words, but the gloom invaded her face once more. “Thanks for turning me down kindly,” she said, still on the verge of tears. “Still, at least I will have my cats as an ugly old woman.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” I said, feeling a bit annoyed at the unnecessary way she was putting down herself. “You’re not ugly.” </p><p>“But not attractive either, right?” she cut in sharply, looking at me angrily, catching on my pity. </p><p>“Well,” I said, trying to find a way that wouldn’t end up with tears, but every second I spent trying to come up with an answer, she moved closer to a breakdown. “As I said, you just need to work on it. The thing you lack the most is confidence. It affects everything. You just need to fool around a bit to generate confidence, kiss a few different boys, maybe a couple of girls as well to make it even hotter, and then you’ll have a string of boys begging for a date,” I said, which was my honest opinion. </p><p>“You really think so? You’re not just saying that to console me, right?” she said, a smile suddenly blooming on her face. </p><p>“Definitely not,” I said seriously, and after she nodded, I decided to lighten the air with a joke. “I wouldn’t mind tutoring you on kissing.” </p><p>“Really, you would,” she answered immediately as she grabbed my hand, her eyes shining shock, but tinged with excitement. </p><p>Her reaction came as a surprise for me, but looking at her enthusiastic expression, I felt that it was impossible to deny her. “Sure, as long as you remember it’s just helping you practice, and not a true relationship,” I said with a shrug, then gave her a smirk that made her tremble. </p><p>If we were going to play, I was going to play to win.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I woke up, it was already six, and the first rays of the morning were dancing over the lake surface. Anna was sleeping, once again wrapped in thick pajamas that contrasted greatly with her evening courage. I chuckled a bit as I quickly prepared a sandwich, then left after taking my practice notebook. </p><p>As usual, I spent the best hours of the morning practicing my drawing. Toward the end of the second hour, I once again noticed Anna watching me from the window, but I acted unawares, focusing on my practice. She watched me until I finished my work and started walking back.</p><p>She was about to prepare breakfast when I returned. “Are you hungry?” she asked, her tone once again surprisingly shy, to a degree that would have made me suspicious if I already hadn’t known about the reason for her almost crippling shyness, reliving her ‘solo’ adventure of the night. </p><p>“I’m a bit famished, but still, I’m going to skip the breakfast,” I answered. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>“I don’t like to swim with a full stomach,” I said even as I walked toward my section of the room, and pulled the curtain close. “Wanna join?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” she stammered. “I was planning to finish my book.” </p><p>I shook my head in surprise, still unable to believe how she could do what she did in the evening but feel hesitant to wear a swimsuit in front of me. “Come on, let’s break in your new swimsuit. The weather is perfect for a swim. You can finish your book later on.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to say, but when I opened the door, revealing my body, wearing only swimming shorts, her complaints staggered for a moment. It was enough time for me to leave the RV, without giving her a chance to answer. </p><p>“I don’t want any complaints. See you at the lake,” I said, and closed the door. </p><p>I swam for almost fifteen minutes, but she didn’t appear. Just when I was about to go back and make another attempt to convince her, I saw her leaving the RV, wearing the swimsuit. Unfortunately, she had her towel wrapped around her waist, and her arms were crossed around her chest to hide the tightness of her chest. </p><p>Though, when she came nearer, I saw that she was rather justified with her action, because the swimsuit was a bit smaller, and a lot more elastic, than I had expected. The red fabric stretched over her skin like it was painted. I acted like I didn’t notice her hesitant gaze and swam away from the shore, giving her enough time to drop her towel and dash into the water. </p><p>I only turned back when I heard her step into the water. “Cold,” she exclaimed in shock, and I turned to look at her, only for my eyes to widen. I hadn’t noticed when she was walking because of her arms, but the topside of her swimsuit was even more revealing than I had expected, so much that she was unable to pull the zipper completely. Instead, it barely passed the halfway line. In a different woman —with a more normal chest size— it might have looked normal, even modest, but with her amazing tits straining the swimsuit to the limit, it was a delicious view. </p><p>The swimsuit fit even better than I imagined, though it was a small miracle she managed to leave the RV wearing it. </p><p>Now that she was in the water, I decided to tease her a bit. “You’re finally here,” I said even as I swam closer to her, her blush increasing with each stroke bringing me closer. “Didn’t I tell you, the water is perfect.” </p><p>“You’re right, it’s perfect,” she murmured even as she sank deeper in the water, but it was an empty gesture. The lake water was perfectly clear, giving me a perfect glimpse of her cleavage as I closed in. </p><p>“You should listen to me more,” I said, punctuated with a dark, seductive smile that I frequently employed during college, often with spectacular results. I winked, but before she could answer, I started swimming away, giving her a bit of space to recover. Despite her habit of nighttime molesting, she was yet to reach a point of handling my teasing for an extended time. </p><p>So, I swam across the lake, though I made sure to swam closer every five minutes to deliver another teasing quip, some innocent enough to leave her giggling, some suggestive enough to leave her blushing. It was a pleasure to visit her, because as she swam, she failed to realize a very important detail. The swimsuit we purchased came from the bargain bin, and didn’t have the best zipper. Under the rather impressive pressure of her tits, enhanced by her strokes as she swam, the zipper moved lower and lower, creating an even more delicious cleavage. Miraculously, she managed to miss that detail, her eyes far too focused on my glistening back muscles. </p><p>So, I decided to bring my teasing to the next level. When she was swimming, I dived under the water, and closed in behind her, still under her. When I aligned under her, I switched to my back, so that I could see her face. Her eyes were closed to protect them from water, so she was wholly unprepared when I reached to touch her nose. </p><p>She barely managed to pull her head out of the water as she screamed in panic, slapping her arms on the water without balance, like she was about to drown. There was no risk of her actually drowning of course, she didn’t even swallow any water, but still, as I appeared from the depths, chucking, I used the opportunity to hug her in the guise of saving her. I even used the opportunity to pull her zipper even lower, which elevated her cleavage from daring to wholly indecent. </p><p>“What was that!” she exclaimed, scared and angry enough to miss the fact that I was hugging her tight enough to her inappropriate cleavage to my chest.</p><p>“Calm down, it’s just a little joke,” I answered, maintaining my smile. </p><p>“A joke,” she said stiffly, but before I could reply, her breathing got slower, and a panicked expression appeared on her face, realizing the intimacy of the position. She tried to pull back, and I let her go immediately, and she found herself dipping deep. This time, rather than saving her, I pushed her shoulders a bit, so that she sank even deeper. </p><p>“I’ll show you,” she exclaimed when she appeared on the surface, her blonde hair sticking to her face. She grabbed my shoulder and pushed me down. I could have easily resisted her, but that would run contrary to the aim of the teasing. I let her dip me down, which inadvertently pushed my face to the softness of her cleavage. I stayed deep for a while, before I grabbed her legs and dipped her, sinking her down with another playful cry. </p><p>That playful banter lasted for almost five minutes, until we managed to swim. “Enough,” she finally begged as she held my arm, trying to stay on the surface as she breathed hard. </p><p>“That was fun, isn’t it?” I asked even as I dragged her to the surface as I swam. “And you were going to stay in the RV to read.” </p><p>“You were right,” she admitted with a giggle, and we walked out of the lake. </p><p>“Come with me,” I suddenly ordered. “You look beautiful, I want to draw you,” I said, and rushed toward the notebook I kept near. I directed her to sit on her towel, her back arched, her elbows pressing on the ground so that her body was almost parallel to the ground while constructing a graceful arc, her head dipping down. </p><p>I quickly dried, wanting to start before she could realize the state of her cleavage, especially the way her pose stretched her swimsuit and enhanced her cleavage further. My pen was already on the paper when her eyes drifted down, and realized the revealing state she was in. “Don’t move,” I ordered as she started shuffling. </p><p>“But-” she started, but I was quick to interrupt. </p><p>“No, don’t move. Just close your eyes and enjoy the sun. It’s a perfect angle, we can’t waste it.” She stiffened at my words, but she lacked the determination to reject such a statement —though her activities of the evening doubtlessly played some role in this. </p><p>Still, as my pencil danced on the paper, creating a black-and-white portrayal of her beauty, she was barely keeping herself from trembling helplessly, clearly overwhelmed. Keeping her eyes was making it even harder. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t have pushed a model out of her comfort zone, but Anna had long spent her right to mercy. </p><p>Instead of comforting her, I deliberately closed in, and pushed my fingers through her hair. Her blue eyes popped open. “Just fixing your hair,” I said to her, but whispering throatily, staying close enough for my breath to caress her. She trembled again, but this time, not from discomfort but from excitement. Her nipples, suddenly stiffening enough to push against her swimsuit was the perfect evidence. </p><p>I pulled back to finish the drawing, which took another ten minutes, while she trembled with excitement. “Done,” I said even as I plopped next to her. </p><p>“Oh my!” she gasped as she looked at my drawing. “I can’t believe I look like this,” she murmured as her gaze danced over the paper, distracted enough to miss the significance of our closeness, even leaning against my chest. From this angle, I had the perfect angle to enjoy her cleavage, which was a different kind of delicious from her nakedness the last night. </p><p>Then, after almost a minute, she remembered the cleavage she was displaying on the drawing was the same she was displaying in the real-life, and hurriedly tried to pull it, which turned out to be a mistake. The cheapness of the swimsuit meant that it failed to resist her harsh pull, and snapped. </p><p>She exclaimed in panic as her zipper parted open, turning her swimsuit into a transitory stripper costume. I decided to pity her and passed her my towel —after getting the eyeful I deserved— and she dashed away to the RV. The way her hips jiggled as she ran away was the last piece of delicious bonus. </p><p>“You have nothing to be ashamed of, sweetie,” I called from behind, pleasantly surprised by my own swimsuit selection. However, I was curious how she would react after her accidental flash. She could either overcompensate and go back to wearing her thickest and ugliest clothes, or she might decide to push the envelope a bit now that she gave me a delicious glimpse of her body. </p><p>Either way, it was bound to be interesting. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched the naked and gasping figure of the most important woman of the Empire, the Mother Queen, my initial plan suddenly lost its importance. At this point, I was planning to reveal the truth about the ineffectiveness of her small trick before starting to bargain, but seeing her beautiful and vulnerable flesh, I decided to continue. </p><p>Taking down the queen completely was a temptation impossible to reject. I just needed an excuse to push forward. </p><p>Luckily, she gave me the excuse I needed by trying to poison me. As I stood in front of her, I made a show of stumbling, holding my head like I was suffering from vertigo, a sign that the poison was working, just not as quick as she hoped. </p><p>“Not bad, sweetheart,” I said as I sat down once more. “Now, as we talked, I’m ready to give you the location of a lesser item, just to prove my end of the bargain,” I added as I opened my arms, leaning back. I even closed my eyes like I was trying to recover from the poison, giving her the hope that I was about to fall unconscious, just needing a dash more excitement to trigger the poison. </p><p>“Give me a minute,” she murmured as she stood up, her legs trembling worse than my act as she tried to overcome her recent treatment. She stumbled toward the washbasin to clean her cum-covered face, also using the opportunity to clean up. Still, I had to respect her composure, as even after the treatment she had received, she continued her obedient role, walking away with a delicious sway in her hips, a sway that worked perfectly to resurrect my boner. </p><p>I watched as she quickly washed her face, and reapplied her makeup, nor did I missed that she pulled her perfume from a special container. The sweet smell filled the room, pumping my heart more. </p><p>I didn’t recognize the smell, but considering the effect, it was clearly a strong aphrodisiac, the kind that would cost a fortune for each drop. It was enough to turn a normal man into a panting puppy ready to do anything just for a hint of relief. For my case, it was the perfect way to accelerate the poison. Too bad for her that I had already purged the poison. </p><p>After reapplying her makeup, she walked to the decanter and filled another glass of poisoned wine for me. “You must be thirsty,” she whispered erotically as she passed the wine to me before trying to sit next to me. </p><p>“You’re such a thoughtful courtesan,” I said even as I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her on my lap, not giving her the space she required. She giggled in response, but her eyes were like blocks of ice, threatening to freeze me. Despite the treatment, her will was still strong. </p><p>I wanted to shatter that will. </p><p>“So, we were talking about the location,” she murmured as she leaned against me, giving me a better whiff of her perfume, quickening my heartbeat. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered even as I kissed her neck. “We need to make sure you trust me first before we could have a serious discussion about the Eternal Core.” </p><p>“I see,” she answered, stiffening slightly. “However, I have a question. How can you know the location of the Eternal Core? You’re just his business partner, right? How can you know his secret location.” </p><p>“Good question,” I said even as I tightened my arm around her waist, then take a gulp. But this time, rather than swallowing it all, I pressed my lips against hers, forcing her to share the wine. The panic flared in her eyes, but in my lap, she had no chance to reject it, not unless she wanted to reveal the existence of the poison before she could put me down. “I don’t know the location, but I have a way to track the location of the Eternal Core. That’s how I first discovered it in the Ancient Ruins.” </p><p>She looked at me in disbelief. “And you think we didn’t try that? Are you trying to swindle me?” </p><p>I chuckled. “Honey, you don’t trust me and that’s normal. That’s why I offered the first task to prove my trustworthiness. But to answer your question, unlike you, I know exactly how the Eternal Core works, including its magical signature. Such a strong magical item could never be hidden.” After giving the answer, I made a show of holding my head, like I was about to fall unconscious. Something that she didn’t miss. </p><p>“And how exactly are you going to track that signature,” she asked even as she grabbed the goblet and took a swig before pressing her lips against mine, sharing the wine. She was still a bit stiff as she did so, but the fact that she took the initiative was enough to show her desperation. She wanted me to fall unconscious, no doubt with a great number of revenge plans in mind. </p><p>“That’s a secret, sweetheart,” I murmured, smiling wildly as she wrapped her hand around my shaft, just to convince me to reveal some of my secrets. I looked down for a moment before smiling at her, like a wolf smiling at a trapped antelope. “I see you’re not satisfied with the earlier treat as well,” I whispered throatily, and her eyes popped in alarm. </p><p>“Actually-” she tried to say, but it died quickly when I threw her on the couch and parted her legs open. </p><p>I immediately pressed one of my hands on her shoulder to keep her in place, the other one slipping between her legs. Her eyes widened at the sudden change of pace, letting out a shocked yelp, but before she could say anything, I was already kissing her searingly. </p><p>She was trapped under me, shocked at the sudden change of pace, trying to gather her wits. It didn’t help when we shared another kiss filled with wine, and her excitement started to rise as well. Her legs lost their power to stay closed, parting open obediently. Her eyes widened as she realized the mistake of using such a strong aphrodisiac, but it was too late. Combined with my skillful treatment, her body was rebelling. </p><p>I didn’t rise from nothing to the top of the world by missing such amazing opportunities. I popped a couple of fingers inside her, ramming repeatedly in a frenzied pace to loosen her before the main even while my other hand sneaked down to her spectacular breasts that defied both her age and the gravity, sinking in their depths mercilessly. Less than a minute later, she was sopping wet, moaning with every push, but her tightness around my fingers was no less than her daughter. </p><p>“Damn, girl. You’re as tight as a virgin. How long it has been since you had a cock in there,” I asked even as I fondled her chest. She kept her eyes close, ignoring the question. Without losing a second, I slapped her tit, hard enough to make her cry. “Sweetheart, if we’re to cooperate, I expect you to answer my questions.” </p><p>She opened her eyes, looking at me furiously. She might be aroused, but that didn’t mean that she was going to submit easily. If it was that easy, she would have never keep a hold of the Empire. Too bad for her that I caught her in her most vulnerable position, unaware that her tactics were countered before she could realize. </p><p>Her overconfidence was her downfall. </p><p>Her moans, rising unbidden, were better than the celestial music for my ears, proving that she deserved the title of Holy Empress. If I had time, I would have let her continue, but I wasn’t willing to risk her getting even more suspicious about the lack of effectiveness of the drug. “Are you ready for the main event?” I whispered as I changed position, my shaft caressing her entrance as my lips caressed her ear. She whimpered deliciously like a virgin as I pressed my weight above her, trapping her completely. </p><p>I pushed my shaft deep inside her without waiting for an answer. Her hands found my shoulders, her nails sinking deep enough to draw blood. “Naughty girl,” I said as I pulled my head, examining her expression, only to catch a calculating glint in her eyes. She wasn’t just trying to punish me. She had ulterior motives for stealing my blood. </p><p>I might have ignored the possibility of her knowing Blood Magic if I hadn’t already watched her using a dark variety of Tantric magic to drain her enthusiastic watchers just an hour ago. With that, her possible expertise of Blood Magic wasn’t a surprise, despite it being an even darker variety with a worse reputation. </p><p>Sapphire was surprising me more and more. She was really a woman of surprising depths. </p><p>Too bad that she was trying to defeat a master of Dark Magic. For any half-decent dark magic practitioner, cutting the relationship between the spilled blood and the self was evident. It was a simple spell, but with a strategic drawback. The lack of magical presence in the blood would alert the enemy. </p><p>In my youth, I developed a better tactic. Instead of cutting the connection completely, I learned to create a dummy presence so that the attacking mages would still have a target, unaware that they would give me a way to track them down, or even use the same connection to reverse the impact. </p><p>It wasn’t a flawless way of counter-attacking. A sufficiently alert and skilled mage would realize the trick and cut the connection, but still, it was a good way to try, with no risk to myself. And I had a feeling that the Queen wasn’t a master of the art, not with the limited opportunities to try such dangerous magic. </p><p>So, I ignored her attempts to draw blood and hurt me at the same time, and turned my attention back to the beautiful way her slit was hugging my shaft. “You like to keep silent, don’t you?” I asked as I slowly pushed deeper inside her, trying to stretch her tightness as well as I could, which was surprisingly tight. “Let me ask again, how long it has been since you have tasted a cock.” </p><p>She looked disinclined to answer, so I started slapping her tits and her ass. They weren’t hard enough to actually hurt, but the fact that she was being spanked like a disobedient whore was worse than pain for her, a desire to revenge burning in her eyes. Her fingers sank into my skin once more, extracting more blood. </p><p>“It has been years,” she finally whispered. </p><p>“Damn,” I said even as I pushed even deeper, enjoying her tightness. “It’s like I’m taking your second virginity. It’s really an honor for such a poor citizen like me, serving my Queen in such a glorious manner.” </p><p>She opened her mouth, but I never learned what she was about to say. The reason was simple, I cast a simple spell to conjure her panties before stuffing them into her mouth, silencing her perfectly. “Just in case you make a sound,” I said mockingly even as I quickened my pace, enjoying the treatment. Despite her dislike, her eyes started to cloud as the pleasure built-up. Surprisingly, she didn’t show the slightest inclination to struggle, accepting the treatment with an uncaring display as I claimed her deeper and deeper.</p><p>However, despite the surface that lacked emotion, her body was much more honest, giving me all the signals that she was enjoying the treatment. I just needed to crack the surface of indifference to reveal the truth.</p><p>So, I continued slamming deep inside her repeatedly, underlining my ownership with occasional slaps to her bottom until both sides burned red. </p><p>Despite her best efforts to deny the pleasure, I could feel her rapidly near to the edge. In a different situation, I would have slowed down, torturing her with an orgasm that refused to finalize, making her beg for me to finish. Unfortunately, to her knowledge, I was poisoned, and needed to fall unconscious soon. I had to finish it quickly. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that I couldn’t have any fun. I pulled out without a warning, and before she could react, I flipped her, taking her from the back in doggy position, humiliating her even further. I started spanking her ass even easier, my fingers alternating between spanking and sinking into her flesh. While I did so, I brought an ink bottle and a feather with magic, and started drawing the map I promised on her back, using a cantrip to dry the ink, to prevent it from smudging. </p><p>While I was busy with drawing the map and writing the exploration notes, her armor of indifference started to crack, forcing her to let out moans, muffled thanks to the panties stuffed in her mouth. Soon, she started to shudder under the effect of an earthquake, one strong enough to leave her a confused, trembling mess.</p><p>Still, just because I couldn’t torture her with a delayed orgasm didn’t mean that I couldn’t have messed with her at all. “I’m almost finished,” I commented as I draw the latest lines of the map, but still continued to slam inside her, not giving the slightest inclination to pull back. The comment cut through her haze like a knife. She removed her panties and started speaking. </p><p>“Not inside-” she gasped in panic, but it was too late. I already started spraying her insides with my seed, feeling a great sense of accomplishment. Taking the Queen in such a primal way was the true meaning of victory. </p><p>I pushed a few more times, watching her tits jiggle unrestricted with each push while watching her weak struggle. Realizing she was too late to prevent it, she took it obediently, still trembling thanks to her orgasm. “That was a nice trade,” I said, punctuating it with a not-so-weak slap on her ass as she collapsed on the couch. </p><p>I dressed quickly as she lay on the couch, breathing hard, the poison she ingested making it hard for her to recover. She didn’t drink enough to make her unconscious, but she still took enough to make her confused. </p><p>“So, that’s it for tonight,” as I walked toward the door, stumbling badly enough to suggest to her that her poison was finally taking effect. </p><p>Her eyes widened as she realized the sacrifices she had made were about to be in vain. “Are you leaving this quickly? I was hoping for a … repeat,” she asked as she tried to stand, but her legs rejected the call. Instead, she sat down, her legs parted enough to reveal my seed dripping down, signaling my victory. She blushed like a shy virgin, reminding me of her daughter, but unlike her daughter, that mannerism was completely fake. </p><p>“Nice,” I said as I explored her naked body hungrily. “Too bad that I’m feeling too drunk for another round, and I have a very important meeting I can’t miss.” </p><p>Her eyes widened. “What about our deal?” she asked quickly as she struggled to stand. </p><p>“The map and everything you need to know is on your back, drawn to perfection,” I answered with a smirk. “You just need to follow it. When you guys finish exploring, I’ll visit you again.” </p><p>“But, what about…” she tried to ask, trying to keep me in place, but I cast a darkness spell, preparing to leave the room. </p><p>However, just as I opened the door, a curious idea appeared in my mind. Maybe I should stay inside, hidden in the shadows, and watch her?</p>",

    "content": "<p>When I walked back to the Hidden City, stumbling in exhaustion, wearing the leftover rags after the weird battle I had just suffered through, I was determined to immediately visit the library. The battle I had gone through was weird enough, but the recovery through the lightning rain was even more confusing. </p><p>Yes, I knew very little about the Sorcerers and their powers due to my rather limited background, but I definitely knew enough that being healed through a thunderstorm was unheard of. Even magical animals rarely had such ability, let alone humans. </p><p>However, when I walked into the city, I met with a sight that seriously challenged that determination. Lillian and Astrid were out in the front garden, lying to catch some sun, which was rather extraordinary under the almost-constant mist that covered the surroundings. They were both sleeping after a hard day of cleaning around —not to mention their delicious assistance in the bath earlier.</p><p>However, it was one important detail, or rather, a lack of one, that strained my willpower. Neither girl was wearing a stitch as they lay under the evening sun, enjoying the warmth that covered their skin, their eyes closed. It was very tempting to lay next to them, enjoying the soft caress of the sun, and maybe enjoy something else after they woke up… </p><p>Pity that I was facing a deadly threat that I shouldn’t delay. </p><p>I slipped inside, silently so that I wouldn’t wake them, and had a quick bath and a change of clothes before I moved to the library, ready to take the most complicated task of my life. Despite the centuries that passed, the wards of the library were still throbbing with power. </p><p>Also, considering it was built by Julius Caesar, who won some of his greatest victories through his feats of engineering, where he created a perfect blend of engineering and magical warding even under emergencies. There was a reason that despite his status as the Grand Traitor, the academies still studied his battle records, especially Alesia, where he sieged the city by building a wall around it while simultaneously defending against a sieging army by building another wall to protect themselves. The only reason those defenses held despite the endless disasters summoned by the Gallic Druids was the sturdy construction. </p><p>And since that battle was the last resistance of the Gallic Tribes, they threw everything they had, including their legendary Chief Druids, who were strong enough to face a Sorcerer one-to-one —it was said that due to the number of Chief Druids died that day, Gallic magic had collapsed completely, never to return to their peak. </p><p>Since Caesar achieved such a spectacular victory in a battle in enemy territory, where he was being assaulted from both sides and pressed for time, one could only imagine how sturdy a city he built as the last defensive bastion would be, especially when it came to the library, a place that held his most important secrets. Breaking through force was definitely not an option… </p><p>I stood in front of the main door of the library, which was deceptively simple-looking, lacking in ornaments. However, despite its simple look, the door was throbbing with magic, enough to fry anyone that would be stupid enough to open it without a way to pass the wards. I took a deep breath, extending my senses, trying to examine the ward structure without making contact. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured as I realized the first layer of wards was surprisingly simple despite the incredible power that passed through them. Simple enough that even an average first-year student could solve. I frowned as I started examining it. Such a simple design would surely host a deceptive trap. I was sure. </p><p>I was examining the ward for half an hour when I heard the footsteps closing in. “What are you trying to do?” asked the familiar voice of Lillian. A moment later, I felt her arms hug me from behind, pressing her chest against my back. I turned my heat to catch a soft kiss, before turning my attention back to the wards. “I’m trying to enter, but I’m not sure how to enter it,” I murmured, determined to find the trap. </p><p>I felt Lillian’s magic flare next to me, surprisingly resonating with my own flow. It was a soft, barely discernible effect, but not soft enough to get away from my enhanced senses. “It seems simple enough,” she murmured confusedly. “What’s the problem?” </p><p>“It’s too simple,” I murmured, still determined to break it. It was a ward designed by the great Julius Caesar. It was impossible for it to be that simple! Still, it wasn’t just that. There was something familiar in those wards that were tickling my mind, but I didn’t know what. </p><p>Lillian giggled a bit. “You’re too tense.” </p><p>“And? How’s that relevant.” </p><p>“You’re tense enough to miss an obvious detail,” she explained, and kissed me in the cheek before continuing. “It’s the outer layer they built to resist the surrounding chaotic magic. They couldn’t build anything complicated, or put any traps, because it would be triggered by the chaotic magic storms.” </p><p>“You’re right,” I admitted a moment later, and used a simple spell to crack the ward. The door opened immediately. “I just expected it to be more complicated.” </p><p>“It happens to best of us,” Lillian said, though she had a smug smile on her face as she said so, glad that she was finally able to show off. I smiled back, as after all the time we spent together, such a simple jab was simply amusing. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean I was going to let it slide easily. “You’re getting uppity,” I said as I pulled her on my lap, and spanked her naked ass without a warning, earning a delicious giggle in return. I let her stand once more after several spanks, when her humorous giggles started to turn into delicious moans that tempted me to change my decision. “That’s enough punishment,” I said as I let her go. </p><p>“Are you sure?” she asked as she leaned forward, presenting her delicious body in the best effect. “Maybe you should punish me more, just to make sure that I learned my lesson.” </p><p>I sighed. “It sounds very tempting, but I need to crack the library’s defense wards. I’m hoping to find something about Sorcerer abilities.” </p><p>“What’s the hurry?” she asked. “We should be safe here. There’s no chance that the tribals would risk entering here. After centuries, they would have discovered the location if they had the ability.” </p><p>“I don’t want to take the risk,” I answered. “You’re right about the tribals, but the same won’t apply to the Legionaries. If they are sufficiently brave, it’s not impossible for another Sorcerer to replicate our trick.” </p><p>“They wouldn’t take the risk. One wrong move, and they might lose a Century, along with a Sorcerer,” she stated confidently. </p><p>“I’m not so sure,” I answered. “You’re thinking in terms of Colonial powers. Back in Britanium, every Sorcerer is a rare resource. But whoever we’re facing against clearly strong enough to treat Sorcerers as normal mages. If they could send a Sorcerer to kidnap you, they can send a Sorcerer to explore this place. It’s not a risk we can write-off.” </p><p>“You think so?” she murmured. </p><p>“Yes, and even if they didn’t want to breach the area, we are still facing an important danger. The magical creatures that surround the place are very dangerous. I had just fought against a pack of Ethereal wolves,” I said. </p><p>She gasped in shock. “Are you okay?” she asked as she grabbed my bicep, squeezing tight. </p><p>“Yeah, I’m well, nothing I can’t handle as a Sorcerer,” I answered. At that moment, I decided not to mention the disaster-class wolf I had faced, as the mention of the ethereal wolves was enough to scare her. If I mentioned the disaster-class wolf, I was afraid that she would want to leave the hidden city. I already had too many things to handle without trying to convince her to stay in the mountain. Also, the existence of ethereal beasts was enough to prevent them from going for a walk. “Should we walk in,” I asked her even as I took the lead, casting a shield charm just in case. </p><p>“Yeah, let’s go,” she answered, and followed me slowly, watching her surroundings carefully. Admittedly, the way she dressed —or didn’t dress— was a bit distracting, but I didn’t ask her to dress. Breaking the secondary wards was going to be hard enough, so I wouldn’t say no to some eye candy. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel surprised when I stepped inside. The library was not perfect by any measure. The shelves were ugly and utilitarian, lacking both in polish and style, so much that any second-hand shop would have a better selection. The place was filled with dust, enough to make me sneeze, and quite a few books were just a strong jab away from falling into pieces. </p><p>Still, considering it was centuries since the place had a visitor, it was much better than I expected. I wanted to walk in and start reading, but a secondary ward was shimmering in my magical sight, covering the shelves, hypnotizing complex. “That’s what I’m talking about,” I murmured in fascination as I watched the rapidly-shuffling magical flow and runes. “It’s a masterpiece.” </p><p>“I’m starting to feel jealous,” Lillian said as she poked my side, but even as she said so, her eyes were locked on the wards as well. Then, she frowned. “Do you think we can unlock those wards?” </p><p>“We can,” I answered confidently. “It looks complicated, but most of its functions are about protecting the books and maintaining the place rather than defense,” I explained. Of course, even with that deficiency, breaking the wards was not the simplest thing to do. Lillian and I sat down, examining the ward even as the sunset and the darkness covered the streets, while Astrid helped us by preparing and serving us food —wearing nothing but her birthday suit after seeing Lillian’s lack of dress. Their relationship might have improved, but not to the point they stopped competing with each other. </p><p>The presence of two naked beauties helped to break the monotony as I filled paper after paper with formulas, occasionally running my findings by Lillian to make sure there was no calculation error. Toward midnight, our luck turned and we managed to fashion a key. Normally, breaking a military-grade ward would have been difficult, but we were lucky that it was erected centuries ago. Most of the methods that were probably cutting-edge military secrets were a part of the school curriculum, allowing us to break it successfully. </p><p>“That was exhausting,” Lillian murmured as she looked at the shelves, but the call of the sleep proved stronger than the call of the knowledge. “Are you coming to bed,” she said as she kissed me lazily. </p><p>“No, go ahead. I want to look around a bit first,” I answered, and watched her saunter away, still naked. Astrid had long left us, unable to understand the intricacies of ward-breaking. </p><p>I walked around, giving a cursory assessment of the books on the shelves, but I haven’t found anything that really impressed me. They were good books, but nothing precious enough to help a Sorcerer. </p><p>Soon, I found the reason for it. On the other end of the library, there was another door, guarded by a stronger —and much more complicated— ward, no doubt hiding the really precious books. And unlike the other books in the library, those books were secret from the other soldiers —or at least, I assumed so, because the ward that was protecting them was absolutely vicious. A wrong touch might have deadly consequences. </p><p>Still, I raised my magical presence and gave it a soft touch, just to understand the complexity of it. I didn’t expect to break it, of course. I doubted that I could even actually make an attempt without blowing myself up without months of dedicated study. Unlike the previous ward, this one was primed to explode, after all. </p><p>Surprisingly, the deadly ward that was supposed to take months of effort to crack suddenly melted, leaving me in shock. </p><p>What the fuck was happening!</p>",

    "content": "<p>For a long and glorious moment, I stopped to enjoy the looks of the busty beauty with caramel-colored skin lying under me, gasping in a mixture of anticipation and dread as she awaited my promised interrogation. From her brown eyes, I could read a hint of panic as she realized the lost control of her little game of seduction, mixed with an unwillingness to change the course. </p><p>“So, we were talking about the identity of our customer,” I whispered into her ear as I leaned over her, letting my chest press against hers. </p><p>“Is it really important,” she gasped even as she put her hand on my shoulder, dragging softly. “I can think of several more interesting things to do rather than wasting our time talking about the customers.” As she said so, she arched her back, making the sight of her body even more delicious. </p><p>“That does sound tempting,” I answered lazily, enjoying the way hope flared in her eyes, straining her willpower. After all, she was still suffering from my little trick that prevented her from cumming, while her body was covered in aphrodisiac massage oil. </p><p>It was delicious torture. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“Doesn’t it?” she said as her hands started exploring my body. </p><p>“It does, but the identity of the customer is more important,” I countered. “After all, we’re going to spend quite a bit of time together as we forged and aligned a personalized sword,” I commented. </p><p>“Yes, but don’t worry-” she started before she cut herself, frustrated. “I mean, what are you talking about!” </p><p>I chuckled. “Come on, sweetie. It’s obvious that we’re going to spend quite a bit of time with our customer, and creating a personalized weapon is the only reason to spend extended time together.” </p><p>“But how could you know that we’re going to spend time together?” she followed up. </p><p>I sighed even as I let my hand explore the delicious curves of her body. “Simple, if it was a simple order, you could have just given me a random name, and it would be done.” </p><p>“She’s going to kill me,” Oeyne murmured, revealing the gender of the visitor, which put a smile on my face. After all, if I’m going to spend extended time together with a stranger, I would vastly prefer a woman. It had many interesting potential combinations. </p><p>“Not if I make you die with pleasure first,” I whispered as I aligned myself to her entrance and pushed my hips, like I was about to slip inside her, only to pull back when she tried to meet in the middle by pushing herself up. “Not yet,” I whispered playfully as I slipped two fingers instead, teasing her womanhood as I moved down, intending to replace it with my tongue. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>Her response, which came in the form of a helpless moan, was simply divine. “Please, just move onto the main course,” she begged, but I ignored her begging in favor of moving down, about to treat her to a delicious oral service. She moaned helplessly as I flicked her labia, already primed. </p><p>I raised my gaze to meet her helpless looks. She tried to move, but I was prepared. A simple arcana spell restricted her limbs, preventing her from moving. It wasn’t strong enough to prevent it from breaking completely, but she was in no condition to actually exert her full strength, nor she gave a sign of actually doing so. A combination of her burning desire and her urgent need to enlist my aid limited her options very much. </p><p>“You look delicious enough to eat,” I murmured as I looked at her flawless body from my unique angle, enjoying the curves of her body. Just to reinforce my statement, I softly bit her inner thighs, though still leaving a mark. </p><p>“Hurry up and eat then,” she answered quickly, so quickly that if it wasn’t for my ability to catch deception, I would have been assumed she was just submitting to avoid questioning. But her burning desire was unmistakable. I kissed her clit, making her whole body jump, straining her chains. Despite the apparent submissiveness of the act, it was a pure act of domination, signaling that she was nothing more than a toy for my amusement. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle even as I dove down between her legs, nibbling and licking around her clit, teasing softly rather than searching for quick completion. When I added occasional thrusts of my tongue, her hips rose to meet my movement, her body clenching hard enough to crack the chains, forcing me to reinforce them magically. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[-165 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>“Please,” she moaned helplessly, begging me to stop, which was amusing. The chains I created were strong, but definitely not strong enough to resist if she strained her full strength. All she needed was to pull, and the magical chains would end up destroyed, but she chose to push her hips to my face, searching for a quick climax. </p><p>I decided to reward her obedience as I let my tongue slip inside her tunnel, giving her a preview of the activities that would follow it. She responded with a loud moan. It was a good opportunity to push the interrogation further. “Who’s the customer?” I asked.</p><p>“Not really important,” she answered. “She just wants to keep it confidential due to her family situation.” </p><p>“Family situation,” I murmured before returning to lick her nether lips, while my mind focused on the possible candidates. At first, I thought it might be one of the faculty members, but I rejected it. While Faculty members were strong, they weren’t politically strong enough that Oeyne would afraid of saying their names. Admittedly, there were some faculty members that deserved such reputation, but they were either mages themselves, strong enough to assist Oeyne’s forging, or they had enough reputation to ask for a favor of a graduated mage. </p><p>So, it must be either an illegal organization, or a part of the nobility. “You haven’t promised it to a criminal, right?” I suddenly asked. Considering her gambling addiction, I didn’t think that asking that question was unfair. Who knew if she sold a favor in exchange of her debts. </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered in indignation, putting that particular worry to rest. “How can you ask that!” </p><p>“Well, there are two possibilities for a client considering your tight lips, and if it’s not the criminals, it must be a noble client,” I asked, and received a positive moan. Unfortunately, that hadn’t exactly solved my problem. If it was noble, it must be someone like Cornelia who was facing dangerous problems with her family, and looking for a power-up. </p><p>Of course, that left another problem. How the hell a marginalized member of a noble family afford a personalized magical weapon. They were really expensive to produce, and worse, once their intended recipient died, they turned completely useless. I tried to come up with the identity of the client based on the intelligence I had collected on the noble families, but I came up short. </p><p>However, seeing Oeyne’s determination not to reveal the identity of her, I decided to focus on grinding her willpower before I pushed her for an answer. I let my tongue dance wildly at her entrance, until she was mewling like a kitten, begging for a release. “Please,” she gasped. “Let me cum!” </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>“Not yet,” I answered, ignoring the way her thighs tightened around my head along with the implied threat. Instead, I spanked her ass. “Behave,” I ordered. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she warned, but considering she continued to lay obediently, I decided I still had quite a bit of margin to push. As my tongue continued to dance, she fell into a daze, moans escaping uninterrupted, but whenever she fell too deep, I awakened her with a tight slap on her plump ass. </p><p>Five minutes later, I decided to ask again. “Tell me,” I ordered. “Who is the customer?” </p><p>“It’s the youngest lady of the Stilea family,” she said. Unfortunately for her, even under the best of circumstances, she wasn’t good enough to slip a lie when I was careful, let alone when she was panting helplessly, desiring for an orgasm. </p><p>I pulled my head away from between her legs, and spanked her tits as a warning. “Are you sure about that?” I asked. “You wouldn’t lie to me, would you,” I slowly asked as I twisted her nipples, making her shiver in a mixture of pleasure and pain. As she shivered, I pressed my shaft against her entrance, but didn’t slip in. “I would hate to stop here to punish you for your lie, after all,” I murmured. </p><p>Her determination lasted less than half a minute under the assault of her pending orgasm. “No, I’m not,” she gasped. “But, are you sure you want to learn? It’s going to be really big. Big enough to risk your life if you actually let it slip,” she warned me. </p><p>“Nothing I can’t handle,” I countered. Considering the number of secrets I was holding, what was one more. </p><p>“If you’re sure,” Oeyne said, surrendering to my interrogation. “Our client is Silvia. Silvia Romulus.” </p><p>That name surprised me. “Silvia Romulus,” I repeated in shock. “The same Silvia Romulus that is the oldest daughter of the current king. The Silvia Romulus that had just lost an intense battle with two of her brothers, losing her already slim hope of taking the throne as the Queen,” I murmured. </p><p>“Yes, the same,” she admitted. </p><p>“That is a bit more than I expected,” I murmured, overwhelmed with the sudden realization. “And she’s going to come here to get a weapon in a few days,” I said. That was not good. A hidden visit from a candidate to the throne was surprising, but nothing I couldn’t handle. However, considering the circumstances with the traitors in the faculty and the necromancer presence outside the walls, ready to assault at any minute, the situation turned out significantly more complicated. </p><p>The impending assault on the school was scary enough without the disaster that would follow if the visit of the Princess was revealed, or even worse, she was actually harmed during the assault. Yes, despite their name the Royal family was nothing more than a toothless beast when it came to controlling the Empire, but they still controlled the Capital with an iron fist, with a rumored magical arsenal enough to erase any noble family easily. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>There was a reason they were untouched despite their waning political power.  </p><p>But that was something to be determined at a different time. I had a more important task. I needed to reward Oeyne for her surrender. “Thank you, sweetheart,” I murmured softly. “Tell me, what do you want as a reward?” </p><p>“I want you,” she moaned immediately. “Fuck me!” </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked even as I slipped the crown inside her, enjoying her wet tightness. “I’m a jealous and controlling lover. Once you’re mine, you’re mine.” </p><p>“You need to be able to handle me first,” she moaned back even as she strained her strength, breaking the chains before she hugged me, pushing her hips upward. “There’s no need to talk when you collapse under me, dried after a long night.” </p><p>Rather than letting her succeed, I pulled back for a moment. “As you wish,” I warned her, declaring my intention, then slammed inside her, extracting a delicious moan off her. “I’m going to teach you just how well I can handle you.” </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 1%]</p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>“What do you want, slut?” I asked even as I impaled her mercilessly, again and again, starting with a rough assault rather than a playful push. </p><p>“I want you to fuck me,” she murmured through her gritted teeth. “Impale me with that big cock. Teach me the meaning of obedience, prove me your strength,” she said even as her legs wrapped around my waist, pulling me even deeper. </p><p>I chose that moment to break the spell that was preventing her from climaxing, and a surprise orgasm exploded like a geyser, leaving a devastating earthquake behind. However, since she challenged me to break her, I didn’t even slow down, continuing to drill her mercilessly. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 4%]</p><p>[+1500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>“How is it,” I asked as the minutes passed, and she gained a semblance of control, but it was barely enough to make her speak. </p><p>“It’s noth-nothing,” she stammered, trying to look brave, but after that spectacular orgasm, chased by an incoming one, her face was a mess. “Do your worst!” </p><p>“You’re daring,” I admitted with a chuckle. “Let’s see if you can handle my best,” I said even as I cast a conjuration spell, quite a bit smaller than my shaft, glistening with lubricants. Her eyes widened when she felt its presence against her puckered hole, slipping inside before she could react. </p><p>“That’s - that’s cheating,” she complained, interrupted by a moan as the plug was safely inserted into her backdoor, enhancing her pleasure further. </p><p>“You’re the one that claimed you can take my best,” I warned her, even as I cast another conjuration spell, this time a pair of ice cubes. I dragged one around her erect nipple, still red after all the twisting, and she gasped in shock. Before she could say anything, however, the contrast, assisted by the unfamiliar presence of an anal plug, triggered yet another orgasm in her. </p><p>She screamed in a desperate need as the climax hit her with all strength of a rabid elephant, leaving a shivering and moaning wreck. As she squirmed, I ran my hands down her breasts, my soft touch triggering even more pleasure from her, while she gushed helplessly around my shaft. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 7%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>I would have liked to enjoy her delicious body even more, but after her last orgasm, she collapsed back, murmuring before she fell unconscious. “I surrender.”</p><p>Pity, I thought even as I pulled out, strangely disappointed with my early victory. On the positive side, she was conquered easier than I expected. Considering her skillset and power, it was a definite win. Now, I just needed to make sure I could trust her about keeping the achievement a secret. </p><p>After dressing, I left the room, my mind focused on the possible implications of the princess’ visit, and whether it was somehow linked to the necromancer presence, or it was just a horrible coincidence. </p><p>I had a lot of work to do…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 364200 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699\tMana: 4914 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [82/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Once again, I was confronted with the difficult choice of deciding whether to play safe or push the opportunity to the limits despite the risk. </p><p>Once again, I came in favor of the latter. </p><p>How could I not, after spending weeks under the condescending attention of the woman in front of me. Now that she was in front of me, wearing such sexy clothes, willing to obey my desires for the next hour as she planned to drug me, how could I not push her to the limit.  </p><p>Then more… </p><p>“You were about to tell me about the location of a lesser item, to establish a working relationship,” Sapphire reminded me even as she twirled, straining the capabilities of her velvet top to contain her perky breasts. </p><p>“No wonder you can keep control of the Empire without royal blood, even after your dear husband died more than a decade ago,” I commented with a smirk. “You keep your mind on what’s truly important, not like those puffed up nobles,” I commented. “I wonder how you were raised to gain such a clear mind.” </p><p>“I’m just another of those —as you say— puffed up nobles,” she answered, quite quickly. “I just had the fortune of getting the attention of my late husband.” </p><p>“I understand,” I said. I could have questioned her pointless statement, but her words gave me an opening to push through. “Let’s see how you kept the attention of our dear king all those years.” I grabbed her velvet corset and pulled it hard without giving a warning, leaving her top naked, leaving only her skimpy panties for coverage. That, and the lacy mask that covered the upper half of her face.  </p><p>“You dare!” she exclaimed even as one of her arms rose to cover her breasts —which spectacularly failed considering the size of her bosom and thinness of her arm— while the other prepared to cast a spell. </p><p>“No need to be harsh,” I said even as I stood up. “I’m just offering a deal, nothing else. I can walk away if the entertainment is subpar.” </p><p>The blues of her eyes flared with anger, reminding me that she was the queen of an Empire, one that could easily mobilize hundreds of thousands of soldiers with one word. However, even more impressively, the flare was gone the next second, proving her abilities as a respectable opponent. </p><p>She let her arms fell, removing the threat of assault and her poor attempt to protect her modesty at the same time. I licked my lips as I examined her nakedness. Her body was delicious and perky, impossible to be positioned as a mature woman. I would have been surprised by it if I hadn’t watched her using Tantric magic to steal magic power from her watchers to reinforce her own magic, but through such an illegal method, it wasn’t too unexpected for her to maintain her looks. </p><p>I sat back and gestured her to continue, not bothering to utter even a word. She clearly didn’t like such a move, but considering her circumstances, her obedience was not surprising. She even managed to suppress most of her enthusiasm when I took a sip from my drink, leading her to believe that her plan to drug me was going to succeed. </p><p>However, I wanted her to pay, even for that illusion. With a bent finger, I gestured her to walk closer, and she did so while letting her body twist sexily following the soft music, a great contrast to her steely face —which was another part of her plan in my opinion. She was deliberately displaying her resistance inefficiently to make me underestimate her, therefore distracting me from her true weapon. Not a bad plan. </p><p>Too bad that she was playing a rigged game. </p><p>When she came near, I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her to my lap, interrupting her dance. She squirmed a bit, but not to a point that she could actually get away. “You prepared me a delicious drink. Too bad that the presentation is lacking,” I murmured before I pressed my mouth to the valley between her breasts, and poured some of the drink just below her neck. </p><p>She flinched as my lips touched her skin, but that didn’t prevent her from leaning back to allow me to drink it without a loss. After taking a gulp —and burning the poison subtly— I brought my lips to her nipples, dragging my tongue along. An involuntary gasp escaped her mouth as I felt her nipple harden between my lips and under the assault of my tongue. </p><p>I smirked. Finally an honest response about what she was feeling. </p><p>“Such a delicious drink,” I said even as I loosened my hold around her waist, confident that she wouldn’t escape, not when she bet herself on me consuming her drink. I decided to put my idle hand to better use and grabbed her ass aggressively, helping myself to her bountiful bottom. Her hips and ass were deliciously large, but her skin was still flawlessly pure. If I closed my eyes, I could have easily convinced myself that Aria was on my lap instead, enjoying my double assault obediently. </p><p>“Thank you,” she managed to utter between her gritted teeth. “I’m proud of my own mixing abilities.” </p><p>“Good girl,” I said even as I slapped her ass, the sound of the smack echoing loudly in the room, earning another angry glare, but it only made me more aroused, to the point that my pants turned into tools of torture. I took another sip from the drink to mollify her anger, once again through her tits, of course. “But you’re not leveraging your advantages to the limit,” I said as I grabbed her hand, and brought it to my lap. </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t lose time arguing before using her thin, delicate hands to free my cock from its imprisonment. Her soft, feminine fingers wrapped around my girth even though they failed to connect, and started moving up and down in a complicated rhythm, with alternating pressure. Delicious, I thought. It was certainly one of the best handjobs I had ever received, sending waves of pleasure through my body. And considering her competition was the professionals I could access as a Dark Lord, it was a rather hefty compliment. </p><p>“No doubt you could keep the old Emperor loyal, without even a concubine, for years,” I commented before biting her tits playfully. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she commented angrily. </p><p>I smiled, but it was a dark, cold smile that was packed with a threat. I straightened a bit, and put my drink to the side. “Oh, really?” I said. “I’m pushing my luck?” I uttered those words softly, indicating that she had managed to touch my nerve. A believable act, but it wasn’t true. She had touched my nerve long ago, I was just seeking the appropriate opportunity to fake an outburst to push her to the desired position without making her suspicious. “Do you really want to see how I push my luck?” </p><p>A fragile display of male ego was just what I needed. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she uttered immediately, her tone and cadence perfectly measured to awake pity and mercy by conveying a sense of feminine weakness. She was truly an amazing actress, enough to make me pity the bad hand I was forcing her to play. Anyone else, she could have easily played like a toy. </p><p>“Too late,” I said sharply. “I was going to treat you nicely, accounting for all the effort you had put to create such a beautiful Empire, but you just needed to push.” </p><p>“Please-” she started, only to be silenced by a spank on her bottom, this time hard enough to make her yelp in pain. She might be an amazing actress and manipulator, but she was not used to pain the slightest. </p><p>“From now on, I don’t want to you say anything else than yes, sir, and no, sir,” I said, doing my best to hide my reaction to the beautiful view of her shaking body. “Understood?” </p><p>If the looks could kill, I would be dead. Her angry glare was hot enough to melt steel, carrying the full weight of a Queen. Unfortunately, she was not in her seat of power, and lacked the ability to handle such a task herself. She was paying for her overspecialized skill set. “Yes, sir,” she finally said after almost a minute of silence, grudgingly. </p><p>“Good. Now, do you want to learn the location of the Eternal Core?” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she answered, this time immediately. </p><p>“Do you want to discover the location of the secret stash of the Dark Lord tonight so that you can assess the quality of my information?” </p><p>“Yes, sir.” </p><p>“Are you ready to show your sincerity in turn?” I asked even as I grabbed her ass, squeezing softly to remove any confusion about how she could show her sincerity. </p><p>“Yes, sir.” </p><p>“Are you going to be rebellious little slut?” </p><p>That made her stop for a moment, and I spanked her ass in a warning. “No, sir,” she answered, but her tone was flat. </p><p>“Nice reply. A bit slow, and your tone could use some work, but overall, passable. I’m an understanding man. After all, not every day a Queen needs to whore herself just to get some scraps of information.” </p><p>Her eyes were burning, but she nodded obediently still. “Thank you, sir.” </p><p>I chuckled as I caressed her ass, then grabbed my drink and took another sip through the beautiful valley between her breasts. “Good, you’re learning.” Then, without waiting for an answer, I started kissing and biting her tits recklessly, but it was just a distraction. Meanwhile, my other hand grabbed her panties and ripped them off with one smooth move, leaving her core naked, bereft of the last piece of protection. “On your knees, slut,” I ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said again, this time, her tone was trembling. </p><p>“Good, get down here and convince me just how much you value the information I’m going to provide,\" I said, enjoying the sense of superiority as she crouched between my legs, her trembling hands pressing against my legs. Just to give her a bit of hope, I drank the rest of the drink in one long sip, giving her hope that as long as she could excite me sufficiently, I would fall unconscious, and she would win. </p><p>What a coincidence that she was in the perfect position to arouse such excitement. </p><p>And what an excitement it was. I had the Queen of the Empire on her knees in front of me, resting her hands on my thighs, ready to give me the highest-class service I had ever received. I had seduced my fair share of strong women, heroines, duchesses, even Queens of various small entities, but the ruling Queen of the biggest empire of the world was something truly special… </p><p>I watched as she got closer and closer to my shaft, her eyes flickering weakly before she ultimately closed them. I waited until her lips pressed against the head to ask a question. “So, when was the last time you have given a blowjob?” </p><p>My question cut through her weakness, unearthing her anger once again. However, she was strong enough to murmur an answer. “It has been about two decades, sir,” she answered. </p><p>She didn’t explain more, but I could easily guess the circumstances. She was likely pregnant with her daughter at that time, and used it to keep the Emperor’s attention on her, preventing him from straying. It was my ‘honor’ to break such a long streak. “Good work, slut,” I commented mercilessly, while caressed her head with a softness that contrasted my words. “Now, start.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she murmured, following my gentle direction, hovering just inches away from my shaft before she parted her lips, her brunette hair —the original blonde still hidden with the spell— creating a screen. I didn’t want to miss the view, so I gathered her hair in my soft grasp. </p><p>Without further delay, she finally gave in, lowering her head and taking the crown of my cock into her mouth, her lips sliding across softly. I couldn’t help but groan in satisfaction, more about the sheer achievement of the moment than the physical dimension of the pleasure. If I hadn’t ‘warmed up’ beautifully thanks to the assistance of Princess Aria, I would have exploded with her first touch. </p><p>She stiffened as I groaned, but that didn’t prevent her from devouring the crown and the following inch before applying a steady suction. She then pushed her head back down, taking half of my shaft in one move, proving that while it had been long since she had delivered such a task, her skills were still sufficiently impressive. </p><p>My hips rose to meet her motion as she bobbed her head, turning her repeated movements into a true delicacy, especially as she slowly lost her ability to hide her fury. After all, no matter how calm she was, what I was doing had long past her bottom line. But a combination of two factors kept her going. First, she wasn’t unfamiliar with using her body to gain benefits, like dancing to steal the life force of other nobles, or using her femininity to seduce the previous Emperor, therefore rising to the throne. Second, and more importantly, she was convinced that I was poisoned, and she just needed to play along before she could exact her revenge. </p><p>Maybe she was even imagining locking me in her secret cell, imagining how to torture me along with the ‘Dark Lord’. Honestly, I was tempted to play along, just to see her face when she realized my identity. Too bad I had too many plans to risk something like that. </p><p>For a while, I stayed passive, letting her set the pace as she continued to bob her head, her lips gliding over my steely shaft. When she gave a slow, wet kiss that made my insides tingle, it surprised me a bit, even though her aim was obvious. Soon, her hands joined to the battle, caressing the bottom of my shaft repeatedly as she tried to bring me to completion, following the rhythm of the music. I had no doubt that if I let her continue like this, it would take just minutes for her to achieve her aim, progressing our little game to the next stage. </p><p>Too bad for her that I had a different method in mind. </p><p>I grabbed her head without a warning and pushed her down while simultaneously raising my hips, occupying her throat in a surprise invasion. Her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock as I rammed my cock deep into her throat, cutting her breathing, ignoring her ineffectual push. Her throat muscles tried to resist my invasion, but I was merciless, not allowing her a chance to succeed. </p><p>Despite wheezing and gagging, she managed to raise her eyes to meet with my gaze, with a look that promised pain and torture. Unfortunately for her, I already knew their limits in terms of torture, which was not even close to faze me even when helpless and under her control. While I was fucking her throat mercilessly, the same threat turned into a spice to color our rough dance further. </p><p>She was smart enough to realize that too under my victorious gaze, and closed her eyes, doing her best to act obediently as she swallowed my behemoth to the best of her ability. Despite her hesitancy, she did her best to open her mouth as wide as possible, trying to swallow me down. </p><p>“There’s a good girl…” I murmured as I let her pull back to catch her breath, caressing her hair kindly as another mocking gesture. Her relief was short-lived, however, as I pushed her down just seconds later, forcing her blue eyes to widen under my forceful and firm assault. Bit by bit, I pushed the entirety of my cock into her mouth and down her throat again, while Sapphire did nothing but gag and choke obediently.</p><p>My grin stretched wider and wider as she struggled in her task, her tits dangling freely as I forced her down. I was getting close… However, for the final, I had something unique in mind. Something simple yet impressive enough to deliver another hit to her already-flickering confidence. </p><p>Just as I was about to explode, I pulled out, pulling her hair at the same to make her raise her head, my cock aiming at her face. Then, just before I exploded on her face, I ripped the lacy mask off her face, revealing her royal face completely, also taking away the last piece of clothing, one that protected her self-esteem even if that was useless to protect her modesty. </p><p>From the sudden widening of her eyes, filled with vulnerability, it was clear that it worked even better than I had planned, which finally pushed me over the edge. I exploded on her face, covering her delicate skin with my seed as she desperately tried to breathe. </p><p>Only after I had expanded my reserves I let her go, letting her collapse on all-fours as she coughed and wheezed, trying to catch her breath. Meanwhile, my mind was on what to do next with the Queen of the Empire lay in front of me, covered with my seed… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as I walked toward Oeyne’s bedroom, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my aim of getting her in the bed was working even better than I hoped. Of course, a part of it was her intention, she was clearly trying to seduce me as I tried to do so as well. </p><p>The change of pace was very much welcome. </p><p>I knew that her attempts were not about my handsomeness —or, at least, not entirely so. Her sudden offer to share her forging secrets suggested she was in a pickle big enough that she couldn’t be sure to pull me in the mix without a personal connection. And considering the amount I was willing to pay her to craft my weapons, she had considerable leverage, but clearly it was insufficient for her request if her sudden change of attitude was any indicator. </p><p>My sixth sense was telling me that whatever the issue was, it was going to be dangerous, so much that, if it was just a few days ago, I wouldn’t have taken the risk. However, with the amazing benefits I received thanks to completing the companion process, as well as the last few levels, I was confident to face risks. </p><p>If I could risk fighting against the necromancers, I could handle whatever problems a blacksmith could have. </p><p>With that in mind, I once again focused on the present. In her bedroom, I did two things. First, I put my hand to my pack before casting a biomancy spell, creating a unique massage oil that would work excellently to relax and lubricate me at the same time. Second, without even turning my back, I removed all of my clothes except my underwear without looking back, and lay on her bed, my face buried on her pillow, which conveniently hid my smile after I heard Oeyne’s shocked hiss. </p><p>I was proud of my muscular body, one didn’t look like a mage at all. Oeyne clearly liked what she saw, even though she was surprised by it. </p><p>Still, my heartbeat got stronger when I heard the sound of leather hitting the floor, suggesting that she had got rid of her leather pants as well. Since she had already removed her top, it meant that she was standing only in her panties. But before I could even imagine that, another sound reached my ear, this time much softer, like a whisper. </p><p>Her panties hit the floor as well. </p><p>How interesting, I thought even as I listened to the sound of her applying oil to her hands. “Are you ready, big boy?” she whispered as she pressed her soft hands to my back —which was rather interesting considering her job, but considering the abilities of the System, it wasn’t completely unexpected. However, while her touch was soft, it didn’t mean that the strength behind it was delicate. Her hands wandered over my back rapidly with a pressure that would have cracked me if I was still level ten, though, despite that, it wasn’t unpleasant. Clearly, she was decently skilled in massaging. </p><p>“Of course,” I whispered back lazily. “I can handle whatever you can dish, no problem.” </p><p>“Oh, is that so?” she murmured. “Those words seem like a challenge for me.” </p><p>“Take it as a challenge if you want to taste defeat once more,” I answered smugly. She didn’t answer, though the sudden tightening of her hands was answer enough. Her pride clearly didn’t appreciate the reminder of her recent loss, nor did she liked the implications about the current challenge. </p><p>I felt a momentary worry when her hands left my body, but that worry was squished when I heard the sound of oil pouring. Still, it was weird, as she was pouring far too much oil. Apparently, she decided to compensate with excessive oil, which, unfortunately, was an amateur mistake. I prepared myself for an unsatisfactory massage experience. </p><p>Only to be surprised when I felt her climb on the bed, and immediately after, sitting on my back, her oil-covered skin teasing mine. Her torso pressed against my back, with a pair of globe-shaped presences pressing against both sides of my neck, once again covered with a generous amount of massage oil. </p><p>Generous, but definitely not wasted. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>She said nothing, but her pride was apparent as her delicious body rubbed against mine as she slowly moved down, as if she was trying to map her curves on my body. I let out a satisfied moan, conveying my thoughts and encouraging her at the same time. I was surprised by her initiative, bringing the massage to such a heated level so soon. I couldn’t help but feel curious about what she had in mind the next. </p><p>For the next few minutes, she glided up and down on my back, treating me to a delicious massage through the pressure of her breasts. I lay without saying anything, enjoying the glorious, uninterrupted treatment. Then, she spoke once more. “Switch,” she ordered even as she grabbed my arm, making me turn. </p><p>I was more than happy to turn under her control, enthusiastic about catching the sight of her glistening caramel body, but this time, my plans had been ruined. Just as I was about to catch a glimpse, she pressed a towel on my face, cutting my sight. How quaint, I thought in amusement. I could have dealt with it easily, but I decided to take the passive route. </p><p>Partially because I genuinely enjoyed the change in the pattern, being seduced rather than playing the aggressor, however, it was still mostly about watching her squirm. The spell to prevent her from climaxing was still on, ensuring that no matter how aroused she felt, she wouldn’t be able to reach orgasm before I let her. I was curious just how much it would take for her to reach that point. </p><p>[+150 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“How do you feel?” she whispered into my ear even as her tits rubbed against my chest, enough to turn my underwear into hell. </p><p>“Pretty relaxed,” I answered, my tone much lazier than my actual feelings to tease her, and if her stiffening was to be taken as an answer, it worked as well as I could have hoped. </p><p>“Relaxed?” she questioned as she started to lower herself, and suddenly, I felt her hand pressing against my bulge. “That doesn’t feel relaxed. I better help you.” Then, without waiting for a response, she dragged them down, freeing my erection. “You don’t mind, do you?” she asked with a playful, exaggerated giggle. </p><p>“You’re the boss,” I answered, but I failed to maintain my tone of disinterest when I felt the unfamiliar yet recognizable presence of her amazing breasts wrapping around my shaft, sliding easily thanks to the thick layer of massage oil. “That’s nice,” I murmured. </p><p>She giggled, but said nothing as she abandoned all pretenses of a massage and focused on my erection, teasing it with her tits, occasionally assisted by her tongue, enhancing my pleasure build-up significantly. </p><p>“You’re enjoying the treatment, right,” she murmured as she suddenly changed position, and lay next to me, replacing her tits with her hand. She pulled the towel off, letting me enjoy the glistening caramel wonder that was her body for a while, before pinning me under her chocolate-colored irises. She hovered above me, which presented her curvy body to the best effect, tempting me to eat her. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“It should be obvious,” I answered with a satisfied smirk. </p><p>“It is,” she answered with a matching smirk, though I could see frustration behind her gaze. I would have assumed that it was the frustration of her denied orgasm, but one important detail changed my mind. It wasn’t her unmet arousal, or at least, not only that. If it was so, she would have pushed things further rather than slowing things down. </p><p>No, she wanted something, and she decided it was the perfect time to do so. </p><p>“I’m sure you would like to make it a regular thing,” she whispered as she lay next to me, trapping my arm between her amazing tits while continuing her hand job. </p><p>“Well, to be frank, I wouldn’t mind. If this is the starter and not the main course, of course,” I said, my smirk widening even further. </p><p>The shine of interest in her eyes was impossible to fake. “That can be arranged,” she whispered. “How’s your schedule for the next few days.” </p><p>“A bit complicated,” I admitted. “But not so bad that I can’t squeeze a few short visits,” I suggested, and her expression flickered before she could recover. It was an important tell. Whatever she was trying to convince me, she needed it soon. </p><p>For a moment, she said nothing, just quickening the treatment of her hand. Then, she shifted, kissing my neck before trailing down, leaving a trail of kisses, tracing my muscles back and forth, paying particular attention to my abs. When she arrived at my crotch, she gave me a challenging smile and whispered. “Is there a way you can adjust your schedule a bit?” she whispered before giving a seductive lick across my length, her eyes firmly locked to mine as she did so. </p><p>When she swallowed my length without a warning, I was unable to contain the gasp of pleasure that escaped my mouth. The reason, the smooth way she swallowed my shaft, devouring half of its length in one move, suggesting that she hadn’t had a tame youth. I watched as she bobbed her head repeatedly, each repeat pushing her deeper and deeper, and soon, she was swallowing two-thirds of my length with each repeat. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“And what if I need you to stay more than a few short visits, to give me a hand?” she finally asked after five minutes of enthusiastic sucking, but I could hear the strain as she asked that. </p><p>It couldn’t be easy to stay on the edge for all that time. </p><p>“Depends,” I answered lazily, without bothering to change my lazy position. “What exactly you need me to do?” I asked. I was rather happy with her service, both in terms of forging and in terms of ‘massage’, but neither was critical enough for me to commit to a task before I knew the truth behind it, especially since she was being very careful not to reveal that particular aspect. Not when I was already beset with enemies on multiple fronts. </p><p>Rather than answering immediately, she continued to suck me, alternating between the shaft and the balls, however, that amazing service only made me more suspicious. The more she avoided, the more my sixth-sense warned me about the underlying dangers. At this point, the smartest thing to do was to ask her to stop, put on my clothes, and leave, never to return. </p><p>However, as usual, I chose the more dangerous path, and continued to lay as she devoured me. </p><p>It took five minutes for her to speak once more. “Nothing much,” she murmured. “I just have a challenging forging job, and your assistance will be useful,” she said. “It will be exhausting, very exhausting, and will probably require at least three days of forging, without even an opportunity to sleep. It takes a real man to handle such a grueling task.” </p><p>“That seems like a tough job,” I murmured, admiring her simple, yet effective trick. What she was asking for was indeed huge. For a normal mage, casting full power for three days would be indeed disastrous. The experience itself would have been exhausting enough, but the aftereffects of such effort on the body would put a normal mage out of commission for a week, maybe even more. Altogether, it was a sufficient reason for her to make that request in the bed, especially considering our mutual attraction made it an amusing challenge rather than a degrading chore. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>It was what made her offer insidiously clever. By asking it in such a distracting moment, while giving me a very convincing reason for it to be reasonable, she did her best to prevent me from digging deeper. Her dig on my manhood, while obvious, was also a nice touch, adding another layer of distraction. If it wasn’t for my own mastery in deception, I would have missed the slight quickening of her tone as she explained, indicating she was trying to hide something. </p><p>[Subterfuge +2]</p><p>Something big. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured. “It will be tough, but I trust my mana reserves. I doubt it would take more than two days,” I said lazily, like I had already accepted it. The smile that tugged visible despite her best effort showed her elation. Of course, with my regeneration and my ability to replenish her mana, I would be surprised if it took more than a day, even less if I could make decent progress in our companion process. “What are we going to forge?” </p><p>“A shield,” she answered, her tension draining even more as she answered. </p><p>“And who’s the customer?” I asked. </p><p>That made her stiffen. It was again a subtle movement, but for me, she might as well be waving a huge flag of alarm. My digging finally hit the vein. “That’s confidential,” she murmured. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked even as I lifted myself on the bed for the first time, slowly and deliberately, alerting her. She raised her body as well, but before she could react, I grabbed her shoulders, and pushed her on the bed, and put my hand between her legs, reversing the situation. “Who’s the customer?” I repeated the question, slowly and deliberately, even as my fingers slipped inside her. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>Her lips pressed shut, realizing her mistake, but that only galvanized me further. </p><p>An interesting interrogation awaited me… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 358700 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699\tMana: 4914 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [81/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I finally let my attention shift back to the strategic issues as I followed her toward the forge. In particular, why she had suddenly changed her initial estimation about the production of the dagger. “So, the last time we talked, you mentioned that you need three days to complete the dagger. Why the sudden change?” I asked. </p><p>“Is it really important?” she countered with a lazy, dismissive tone as she walked in front of me, her leather-clad hips shaking sexily with each step. However, it was her tone that caught my attention more than the beautiful dance of her hips. It was too dismissive, too even. </p><p>She was trying to hide something. </p><p>“Not really, just curious,” I answered. I decided not to confront her about it, even though the sudden change of delivery date was suspicious. Even more suspicious was the invitation to help. Previously, her determination to keep her secrets was clear, subtly but decisively rejecting my offer. Now, only a day later, she had changed her mind completely. </p><p>How interesting. </p><p>“How strong are your mana reserves?” Oeyne asked as she stood in front of the forge, a pile of processed magical reagents and an ingot of alchemical silver already prepared. “The forging process for your design is very mana intensive, and once started, it needs to be completed, otherwise, the structural matrix of the dagger would dissolve.” </p><p>“My mana reserves are quite decent, definitely top percentile,” I answered, and she nodded in satisfaction. Of course, without a qualifying statement, she no doubt assumed I was comparing myself to the students, while I was actually comparing myself to the faculty. </p><p>“Good, then forging the dagger together will be simple,” she answered. “But before starting, let’s do a practice run with a simple dagger,” she said, before grabbing an ingot of iron, completely mundane, and put it in the forge. </p><p>In a mundane forge, no matter how hot, an ingot of iron would have taken several minutes to melt. In her high-quality magical forge, it took seconds for it to reach a nice glowing heat with a soft consistency. “Watch carefully,” she ordered as she created a complicated web of arcana energy before wrapping it around the ingot, forcibly shaping it and levitating it magically to her anvil. </p><p>Once at the anvil, she kept her magic wrapped around the soft iron as she put low-quality magical ingredients inside. Due to its nature, the magical ingredients flared, pushing against the web, but she suppressed the effect forcefully through her arcana mana. Interesting technique, I noted. The working principles were simple, and the notes I had read on her shelves while waiting for her had already taught me the working principles behind it. Essentially, she was skipping several critical steps in forging through the application of the spell in a process that normally required letting the steel absorb the magic bit by bit. </p><p>Interestingly, none of the books I had swiped from the Guilds mentioned such a technique. Most of their blacksmithing content was about measuring the ideal amount of magical material for each round of forging, and possible ways to enhance effects, while guides on how to prepare said materials were spread between Alchemists and Enchanters based on the steps required and the source material used. Of course, Oeyne’s technique was not purely advantageous, actually applying it required a great deal of Blacksmithing skill and Strength, not to mention some magical aptitude. </p><p>The radical difference in their approach and Oeyne’s technique was interesting, and certainly explained the fight between Oeyne and the guilds. Oeyne’s technique required a combination of skills and not only did it cut through the traditional Guild boundaries, but also it was much quicker to get results. They couldn’t be happy about Oeyne perfecting the technique even further. </p><p>I continued watching Oeyne beating the iron of the dagger rapidly, each push smoothing the raging magical presence of the dagger. Five minutes later, a workable dagger appeared in her hands, and she dunked it in a large barrel filled with water, creating a large cloud of steam. Just as she reached for a second ingot, I cut her off. “Do you want me to try that one?” I asked, but without waiting for her to answer, snatched the iron ingot and threw it in the flames. </p><p>“Are you ready? Already?” she asked. Her shock only survived for a second, leaving its place to a cold intent to interrogate. </p><p>“Sure, as long as you just want me to maintain the spell matrix, of course,” I explained rapidly. Actually, I wouldn’t have minded trying my hand on blacksmithing, as while I lacked the skill, my stats should cover the deficiency, at least enough to handle crafting a simple iron dagger. However, doing so would have revealed my hand unnecessarily, so I kept hiding my hand. </p><p>Using a levitation spell, I dragged the ingot through the flames and put it in front of her, wrapping it tightly with my magic as she infused it with the magical materials. Honestly, it was even easier than I had expected, because the technique itself was rather straightforward, only requiring me to keep the matrix stable. And while I lack the practice with it, my magical abilities were simply superior to hers, making it an easy achievement.  </p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>[-15 Mana]</p><p>“Not bad,” she said, impressed as she turned. “But let’s see how you handle a real challenge.” With that, she slammed her hammer on the steel much harder than the previous times, creating a flare of magic through an intentional mistake. </p><p>The strength of the flare wouldn’t even create a flicker on my spell if I didn’t allow it, but I deliberately fumbled the matrix for a second, flooding the room with a flicker of magic, before I suppressed it again, for two reasons. First —and less importantly— I wanted to look my learning curve convincing. More importantly, I wanted to have a screen to confuse her senses as I let some of my mana stick on her body, infusing her leather top. </p><p>I wanted to play with her a bit. </p><p>[+2 Arcana]</p><p>[-24 Mana]</p><p>“Try to keep the lines more stable,” she commented as she continued to beat the glowing rod of iron, missing my little trick in her concentration. With that, our trial run continued. She made a couple more mistakes, but with lower intensity, allowing me to control them easily. </p><p>However, five minutes into our practice session, she started squirming. It was barely noticeable at first. I noticed it only because I knew what to look for, a lingering gaze here, an uncomfortable shuffle there. But as my subtle magic continued to tease her already-erect nipples softly, those little tells grew into a delicious show. Her nipples hardened enough to clearly show through the texture of her leather top like it was no harder than soft velvet. </p><p>Delicious, I thought, as she finished the dagger and we moved onto another ingot. “Let’s make sure you can handle it flawlessly before we move onto the real stuff. We shouldn’t waste the real materials,” she explained, her voice carrying the slightest hitch. </p><p>At that point, I assumed that she was going to hide her arousal as much as possible, which was why I was surprised when her fingers grasped the buttons of her top, and flicked open two in quick succession, creating a deep, delicious cleavage, more appealing than the best caramel dessert. “Working in a forge gets hot,” she explained with a smirk when I looked at her with a quirked eyebrow, surprised by her action. </p><p>“I see,” I answered, not bothering to hide my gaze as I focused on the recently-revealed caramel valley, matching her smirk. If she was going to play off her arousal like that, why should I play stupid, after all. A brief consideration later, I decided to push her as well. “You know what, you’re right. The heat is really uncomfortable,” I explained as I pulled off my shirt, revealing my muscular torso. </p><p>She was shameless enough to match my hungry gaze as she visually explored the curves of my torso. “It’s hard to believe you’re a mage.” </p><p>“I’m a surprising man,” I answered even as created another spell matrix to stabilize the iron ingot, flexing my body slightly as I did so to give the perfect pose, stretching my Charisma to the limits. “Let’s work,” I added with another smirk when I noticed her getting absent-minded just for a moment. I was proud of my body, and with the assistance of my Charisma, it was no wonder even an experienced woman like Oeyne was being affected. </p><p>“Let’s work,” she reiterated, but before she continued, she popped open another button, turning her already impressive cleavage into something borderline obscene, showing that she wasn’t exactly hung up on turning up the heat. Her hammer slammed repeatedly, her tits jiggling with each repeat, making my shaft rock hard, so much that I would be afraid about the final score of our little game if I hadn’t already rigged the game, making her loss a certainty. </p><p>[+300 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>I could see a subtle blush creeping up her neck as she continued her work, missing the significance of her growing arousal. Unfortunately, she still needed to get to the perfect temperature, so I turned my focus on the task at hand, namely, the spell matrix she had taught me. Now that I got a feeling about its objective, I started modifying it, weakening some aspects while strengthening the other parts. </p><p>[+2 Arcana]</p><p>[-65 Mana]</p><p>“You’re doing it wrong,” she commented as she looked at me, with a slight hint of disappointment coloring her looks. Apparently, she valued competency quite a bit even when it came to her pleasurable activities. </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t screwing anything up. “No, actually, I’m not,” I corrected her. “Try making a big flare,” I offered. “It’ll hold better than your rudimentary structure. I bet that no matter what you do, you won’t be able to break it through your blacksmithing skills.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” she murmured, the shine back in her gaze, with a considerable boost. I met with excitement instead of anger I had been expecting after I challenged her expertise. “You’re willing to bet on that, huh. What do you have in mind?” </p><p>I observed her sudden change of demeanor. Apparently, Aviada undersold her gambling habits. “Well,” I murmured with a wide smirk. “Since you’re going to lose, it doesn’t feel fair for me to make the bet. You should be the one to set the bet.” </p><p>She laughed. It was a clear, crystal laugh that made her body shake repeatedly —and considering her deep cleavage, creating a delicious view. “It’s nice to see the empty confidence of youth. How about if you lose, you’re going to help me with a task. With your skill, it shouldn’t take more than a week, maybe two,” she said in a manner that could have been easily mistaken as nonchalance, but my senses were too sharp to miss the subtle tightening of her tone. She clearly wanted my help, for something important if she was willing to sacrifice extract quite a bit of wealth off me. It made sense, especially her sudden decision to teach me about her secret techniques.  </p><p>“Hmm, sounds interesting,” I said. “A bit soft, though. Still, if you’re going to be a coward, I can only ask you to forge my sword for free. Anything more would be unfair.” </p><p>As expected, my words triggered her quite a bit, enough for her to slam her hammer to the anvil, creating another flare of magic as it damaged its structure. I used the opportunity to turn the heat on the little trick that was making her more and more aroused. “Big words for a little boy. Do you really think you can handle my full effort,” she said. </p><p>“Of course I can, little girl,” I said, mocking her right back, though I avoided mentioning her real age despite her dig. No need to ruin the deliciously heated atmosphere that way. “How about if you lose, you give me a massage. Body to body,” I offered, letting my eyes dangle down her body, cutting through the last flickering sense of professionalism. </p><p>“And if you lose, you stay in here for the night, following my every order,” she said with a smirk. “Every, order,” she repeated just to highlight her words. </p><p>“Deal,” I said as I raised my hand, casting the spell matrix again. Outwardly, it wasn’t very different from the initial form, with some cosmetic changes. However, the theoretical basis of it was completely changed. It was harder to cast skill-wise, but much stronger. “You have five minutes, do your best,” I said to her with a challenging smile. </p><p>“I only need one hit,” she boasted as she raised her hammer. Over her head, the hammer started to shine as she gathered her strength, and she slammed it. If I was using the matrix at the same proficiency I had displayed earlier, the flare of magic would have destroyed my restraints. Instead, it didn’t even make it stretch. She frowned as she slammed twice more, only to fail both times. </p><p>“Are you finished with the warm-up yet,” I asked her even as I gestured with my other hand, and levitated a chair, and sat with my legs crossed, just to drive the message better. It was a sharper challenge, but I was willing to risk it. </p><p>“Yes,” she said with a frosty tone, though her heaving chest didn’t agree with her coldness. She pulled another magical ingredient and threw it on top of the dagger, this time much stronger. Essentially, it was cheating, as a fresh ingredient would increase the strain several times, but ultimately, I was confident in my skills, so I said nothing. Since I had already taken the step to push her further, proving my capability was the better idea. </p><p>[-126 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>She continued beating the dagger, each hit stronger than the previous one, shaking her body beautifully. Each hit caused a flare of magic, giving me the cover to magically tease her further, softly tickling her breasts, a subtle intervention that could have been easily mistaken for the way her tits were rubbing against her leather top as she beat the anvil aggressively, trying to break my confinement structure.</p><p>Despite her attempts, every flare was successfully fed back to the dagger, strengthening it instead. Through that loop, it was even easier to contain the flares, keeping me from wasting too much mana. Her magical abilities were good enough to realize that fact, and she started alternating her rhythm in an effort to disrupt that effect, but got only partial success. More interestingly, as she did so, she forgot one important detail. Her leather top was already not optimized to hold her perky tits, and the amazing cleavage she had created didn’t help. When she delivered a particularly strong hit, one of her tits popped out of her top, creating a delicious view. </p><p>[+300 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>Before she could fix it, I made sure to flicker my spell, not enough to lose the bet, but give her just enough hope that she might ultimately win the bet if she distracted me sufficiently. Her hungry smile revealed that she understood that point. </p><p>“Damn, this top is too tight,” she murmured as she pulled it off, giving me the delicious view of her naked upper body. As she smashed the anvil, again and again, her tits jumped up and down, creating a delicious view for me. My spell matrix flickered with each beat, like she was succeeding in her task, but never taking the last step, my face stiff with a fake strain. Then, five minutes finally elapsed. </p><p>“And, time,” I said with a smirk as I met her gaze before letting my eyes drop down to her spectacular tits that defied her age and the gravity at the same time proudly. I couldn’t wait to see if they had the caramel taste like their color suggested. “It seems that I’m the victor.” </p><p>“It seems the case,” she answered grudgingly, but despite her defeat, her eyes were burning with excitement, Understandable considering she was on the edge of a climax, unaware the last step was cut off by a magical chasm. “Should we continue with our task,” she murmured as she grabbed her top once again, but didn’t put it on. </p><p>“Nope,” I said even as I turned and walked toward her bedroom. “I want my massage first.” I walked away, excited about the service I was about to receive. </p><p>“As you wish,” she called from behind as she followed me… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 357200 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699\tMana: 4914 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [93/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [81/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching the Queen occupying the stage as an exotic dancer was shocking enough to ruin quite a bit of my plans, especially after I watched her use a forbidden school of magic to gather power from her own citizens —though to her credit, targeting the parasites of the society called nobility. </p><p>After a moment’s consideration, I made another impulsive decision. I decided to confront the Queen. After all, she would never be as vulnerable as right at the moment, away from the palace, shackled with the fake identity of a high-profile exotic dancer to prevent her from acting out. </p><p>It was the perfect opportunity. </p><p>With that in mind, I left several gold coins on the table as I stood up, covering the payment as well as a generous tip. Spending stolen money was always easy. After leaving the money, I used the shadow trick and slipped into the main corridor, and then moved to backstage. Luckily, the Queen helped me indirectly in this matter. Thanks to the overwhelming number of customers, most of the security was at the main hall, ready to prevent any event, making it very easy for me to slip backstage. </p><p>Finding the Queen’s room was even easier, I just needed to find the only room for the dancers that had a guard in front of it despite its emptiness, and slipped inside without alerting him. </p><p>The room itself was surprisingly small considering the identity of its occupant. Or maybe not, as she kept her true identity hidden. One of the walls was covered with a wide range of clothes, while a comfortable looking couch lay on the other side, accompanied by a leather chair that looked extremely comfortable. The floor was covered with an expensive carpet that looked no less comfortable than the chair. All around, the room managed to give a sense of decadence despite the sparse furnishing. </p><p>I decided to wait for the Queen’s arrival in style, and pulled the chair to the corner, and extinguished the crystal that illuminated that angle, keeping myself hidden even after stopping the shadow spell. </p><p>I hadn’t had to wait for long. After a brief break, the door opened, and the Queen walked in, once again wearing her red robe, which hid the delicious velvet corset underneath. She was soft and ethereal as well, ignoring the presence of the bodyguards waiting at the door as she stepped across the doorway and closed the door. Only then her expression loosened, and her mysterious looks turned genuine. </p><p>“Finally,” she murmured as she slammed the door close, though her stance didn’t relax. Instead, it intensified until it reminded me of the royalty. She still kept the mask on her face, though. </p><p>I was preparing to cast a silencing ward, but she acted closer. After closing the door, she pressed against a hidden rune on the door, and several wards went up around the room, giving it absolute privacy and protection. </p><p>How convenient. </p><p>I waited until she was in the middle of the room before started clapping softly, simultaneously activating the crystal that to light my corner. I wasn’t afraid of being recognized, because while waiting, I had cast some spell to change my face sufficiently. The rest, I trusted the soft lights of the room to handle. </p><p>“Who’s there?” she flinched as she turned, appearing frightened, but underneath, she was ready to attack. Impressive, I noted. Not only she was ready to launch an assault, but she also kept her identity secret. Impressive reaction from someone in her position, if a bit conservative. </p><p>“An impressed fan,” I said even as I leaned back the leather chair like I was the owner of the room, exuding confidence. She was too smart not to pick that detail, and her looks changed. She realized she wasn’t dealing with an obsessive fan, but someone cold and calculative. </p><p>“Thank you,” she said immediately, even bowing gently. “But I don’t deserve your compliments.” </p><p>“Oh, but you do,” I said even as I waved my hand, and the chair floated toward the middle of the room without requiring me to step down. Her eyes changed once more, smart enough to realize the implications of my casual spell. The result was not hard to achieve, but only the extremely elite mages could achieve it with the ease I had displayed. I intentionally revealed a part of my combat standards, not wanting to alert her with my next words. “I never imagined that the legendary Queen Sapphire of the Empire was moonlighting as a skilled dancer, after all.”</p><p>“I beg your pardon?” she answered, faking a lack of understanding and derision perfectly. </p><p>“Such good acting, no wonder you’re such a good dancer,” I pushed. “I’m proud that our Queen is so skilled.” She tried to continue giving me the confused look, but under my sharp glare, it didn’t take long for her shoulders to slump. Her killing intent flickered, but she was too smart to act against me magically. After all, the wards around the room were sufficient to enable her privacy, but they could never hide real magical combat. If she tried to attack, her true identity would spread further. </p><p>Just because she was locked in the room with someone with greater combat capability she didn’t know —or she thought so— hadn’t meant that she would surrender or panic. Instead, after a momentary panic, her expression flickered before her stance changed, exuding the sense of a royal. “How can I help you, then?” the Queen asked. </p><p>“The wrong question,” I answered. “You shouldn’t ask what you can do for me, but what I can offer for you.” </p><p>Her expression stayed firm after my words, but she was smart enough to realize under the circumstances, if she acted wrongly, her identity might be revealed, creating a scandal too big even for her. As a Queen keeping the throne of a patriarchal society on the merits of marriage rather than blood, such a scandal would harm her power greatly, and that was only if it didn’t result in her losing power. </p><p>There was a reason she was pushing for the marriage between Aria and Lancelot. </p><p>“Okay, then. I’ll play,” she commented. “How can you help me?” </p><p>“Two words, Eternal Core,” I said, and suddenly. </p><p>The demeanor of the Queen changed completely, reminding me of a half-drawn sword. She might not have the skills of a warrior, but she surely had the demeanor of one. For a second, she waited, her expression twitching despite her control, no doubt thinking whether she could bluff her way out of it. “How?” she sighed in apparent defeat. </p><p>At that moment, I respected even more. Here she was, away from her power location, taking a risk to cast illegal empowering rituals, but even then, she was clear-minded enough to bluff. Her display of defeat was measured well, using it as a bait to relax me as I bask in victory, hoping to attain a scrap of information. “Smart,” I said. “But that information is not for free.” </p><p>“But you’ll reveal it?” she asked. “What will it cost me?” </p><p>“Sure,” I answered. “Serve me a drink first and we can discuss.” She nodded and turned toward the raised platform that held several drinks. “Also, drop the robe. I liked your corset much better.”</p><p>She once again impressed me with her decisiveness, removing her robe as quick as her daughter did under my order, revealing her velvet corset and small shorts. Unlike her daughter, however, she did so under her own steely control, seeking maximum benefit. I had to admit, it made me respect her more than I expected. I liked an opponent that could react to an unexpected situation.  </p><p>When she came to me with the drink, I patted my lap. “Take a seat,” I said. </p><p>This time, she hesitated slightly before smoothly gliding down my right thigh as she was very familiar with me, our faces inches apart. The fact that she was still wearing the mask made the situation even more delicious. I wrapped my hand around her waist, the soft fabric of her corset barely insulating her from my touch, before speaking. “You need to teach your son-in-law not to run his mouth when he’s drunk. He mentioned several interesting nuggets. Among them, the search for a certain legendary magical artifact was included.” </p><p>“I see,” Sapphire said, followed by an exaggerated gasp as she shuffled on my lap, trying to distract me. Admittedly, she succeeded in her task quite a bit. She smiled seductively. “And how do you know about the Eternal Core?” </p><p>“Well, I’m an enterprising freelancing businessman that usually works along the border, treading in rare commodities,” I mentioned, suggesting that I was a freelance spy. “And I had high-end clients, though unfortunately, I recently lost some of them, hitting my income quite badly,” I added, implying that I was a customer of myself. “I had helped the said client years ago in the acquisition of some historical artifacts, the Eternal Core being one of them.” </p><p>“I see,” Sapphire answered, suitably impressed by my explanation enough that when my hand moved down to caress the inside of her upper thigh, she let it slide without comment. “And now that your client is unavailable, you’re open for alternative commissions,” she stated. </p><p>“Exactly,” I answered after I took a long sip of the drink, while subtly running my magic in my mouth to burn it before I could actually put it in my mouth. The drink was delicious, but I recognized the hint of a weak poison easily, one that would put the target down to sleep after about an hour, but only if they get excited. No wonder Sapphire was playing along with my attempts to fondle her. My respect for her intensified further. Even with her current poor cards, she was putting an amazing defense. No wonder she managed to take me down. “Of course, I need clients smart enough to understand the risks of my business, and the steps I naturally took to defend my interest. I can’t work with kids like your son-in-law.” </p><p>“I understand,” she said as she put her hand on my shoulder, as she respected me. “Otherwise, you wouldn’t have gone all the effort to arrange a private meeting.” </p><p>“It’s nice to work with understanding clients,” I answered even as my hand moved up to the hem of her shorts, my thumb drawing circles, dangerously close to her crotch. She shivered, and I wasn’t entirely sure that it was a fake reaction. </p><p>“So, since you have mentioned it, I’m willing to believe you’re willing to deal with some information about the location of the item,” she commented smartly. If I was who I claimed to be, it would have been clear that I lacked the ability to get it from the hidden location. Otherwise, I shouldn’t contact her. </p><p>“Correct, but not immediately,” I countered even as I let my hand travel even higher, directly caressing her crotch, hard enough to wedge my finger slightly, making her shiver. “I believe it would be good for our working relationship if I shared the location of a lesser item, just to establish my trustworthiness, for a small favor, even.” Even as I said so, I devoured her body with my gaze, leaving no question about what I had in mind. “Maybe a private dance?” </p><p>“Such a kind businessman,” she murmured seductively, mostly, but not completely, artificial as she parted her legs, giving me better access to caress her. I used the angle to massage her entrance with my thumb aggressively. Meanwhile, I took another sip, giving her hope that her knockout drug, combined with her sacrifice would soon knock me out. She just needed to kill some time while exciting me. But her stiffening nipples suggested that I wasn’t the only one enjoying the moment. </p><p>“Any preference for the dance?” she asked while I dragged my hand to the small of her back before slipping my hand lower, dragging the waistband along, caressing the spine as I revealed her delicious bottom. When I cupped her ass, she gasped loudly. </p><p>“I trust your taste,” I answered. She stood up, only to suffer an unexpected loss. I kept my hold on her short, and their delicate figure ripped instantly, leaving her with her skimpy panties that left most of her ass naked, as well as showing the slight wetness in her crotch. </p><p>She stood up, wearing significantly less than what was fit for a Queen, her mask adding to the eroticism of the scene. </p><p>Luckily, the sound-suppressing wards in the room were one-directional, and we could still hear the music from the main hall, though it was quite faint. It was a soft, tantalizing song, and Sapphire followed the rhythm perfectly, moving her hips, swaying to the steady beat of the music. Her hands ran up her hips, before she turned her back to show me her plump ass. Then, her hands dragged along her sides until they were raised over her head, messing with her hair to add an erotic quality. Alluring yet classy, enough turn my hardness from rock to steel. She was taking the task seriously, hoping to knock me out with excitement. </p><p>I took another sip from the drink, enhancing that hope even more. In return, she parted her legs apart and leaned back away, showing her flexibility enough to show me her cleavage. She was arched backward perfectly, suggesting amazing times once I finally convinced her to share my bed —or her bed, as the Queen, she must have a very comfortable one. </p><p>“Excellent,” I commented as she slowly stood up, amazing me with her balance. Happy with my reaction, she continued to display her flexibility. She bent forward until she grabbed her ankles, tightening her posterior. Her panties were revealing enough under the normal circumstances, stretched under the stress of the move, they looked even better, stretching under the pressure, revealing even more. </p><p>As she undulated, her body started to react, and she started to show signs of genuine enjoyment. She was still doing it with cold-calculation, of course, just enjoying the process. </p><p>When she stood up, she once again turned to face me, her hands caressing the area hidden under her velvet corset, which was straining to contain her otherwise unsupported breasts, trying to get out. Unlike her sensual and soft show in the scene, she was moving aggressively, straining the limits of her top. </p><p>Then suddenly, she walked closer, surprising me for a moment before she took the drink off my fingers, and raised it to my lips. “Are my mixing abilities not to your satisfaction?” she whispered in my ear seductively even as she grabbed one of my hands with her free one, and dragged it to her hips, explicitly inviting me to molest her while she continued to shake them under the call of the melodic rhythm. </p><p>“The drink is nice, but I don’t like the cup,” I whispered as I took back the glass under her confused gaze, but she realized my point when I slowly dripped it on her neck, then licked it off there. I didn’t neglect to burn the poison magically once I took it in my mouth, of course. “It’s not a bother, is it?” </p><p>“Of course not,” she said, but clearly, it was forced. She didn’t like the implications of my move, mostly because it treated her like a disposable servant, something not pleasant for someone of her prestige. It was different than dancing where she still had control. Still, she was patient enough to wait for the poison to work, unaware of the evaporation of that particular plan. </p><p>I wondered just how much I should push her…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Half an hour after I started chasing the wolf, I started to reconsider the decision. It wasn’t the first time I was hunting an animal, but I soon learned that the difficulties of facing an ethereal animal were not limited to breaking through their magical resistance. </p><p>Tracking them was a true pain as well. </p><p>Since they were not fully physical beings, they interacted with the physical objects in weird ways, leaving almost no evidence. Another reliable option to track a magical creature was to follow their energy remains. Under normal conditions, such an aura would stand out from the environment to the senses of an experienced mage, but that method was out thanks to the unbearably thick and continuously shifting magical winds on the background. </p><p>Ultimately, I was able to track it only by luck. My enhanced senses were efficient enough to catch the slight smell of the burnt flesh and fur created thanks to my attack, allowing me to draw a general direction. It wasn’t exactly the most accurate method, but it was the best way to do so. </p><p>When I finally saw the damaged wolf standing in the middle of a valley, I should have felt satisfaction. After all, all my exhaustion and suffering paid off. Unfortunately, seeing the wolf reminded me of a crucial fact. </p><p>Wolves were not solitary creatures. </p><p>Actually, I hadn’t forgotten that fact. How could I, when one of my most vivid childhood memories was about trying to survive against a wolf pack with just a small blade when I was nine years old, while my grandfather observed from a distance, smoking his pipe? Still, I expected that even if it had a pack, an ethereal wolf should be the leader of the pack. </p><p>That assumption was ruined by the presence of a pack of eight ethereal wolves, standing in a semi-circle, preparing to rush forward, creating a force that was threatening enough to destroy everything that stood in their path. To make things even worse, they weren’t the scariest thing, which should have been impossible. After all, a single ethereal wolf would have been enough to destroy a town in its lonesome if it wasn’t for their dependence on the magical environment. Eight of them, capable of teamwork, angered by an earlier assault, was nothing less than a true calamity. </p><p>But even a calamity was paled against the hulking figure behind them. It was roughly had the same shape of a wolf. Of course, a wolf didn’t have ten-inch teeth, a fur thick enough to stop siege weapons, or a poison breath enough to kill an elephant when inhaled once, or blood so violently-magical that a drop of it enough to drive a mage into a frenzy. Nor a wolf was larger than a house. </p><p>It was a disaster-class wolf. </p><p>I cursed my luck. If an ethereal beast could threaten a town, a disaster-class beast could threaten a city. Like the ethereal beasts, they grew in magically-intense areas, but unlike ethereal beasts, they weren’t dependent on the magical environment in the short term, which meant that unlike ethereal beasts, their capability to bring ruin to civilization was not only theoretical. Some of the most prominent disasters were created by them. </p><p>For example, Pompei… </p><p>Naturally, my theory of them was lacking substance, and mainly relying on legends and second-hand accounts on the books, which made it unreliable. Still, there were many facts that were agreed on across those materials. First, no disaster beast was the same, their abilities and elemental natures wildly varied. Second, their behavior was highly influenced by their beast nature. Third, their strength varied wildly, but even the weakest of them could rival the strongest sorcerer. </p><p>In other words, I was screwed. </p><p>A weaker man would have turned his back and run away, hoping for a miracle, but I dashed forward instead. Ultimately, they were wolves. Their whole hunting strategy relied on exhausting the prey by chasing from behind. I certainly wasn’t fast enough to run away from a normal wolf, let alone a disaster-class one. I didn’t want to suffer a pathetic death, running away from a bunch of pathetic beasts, no matter how strong.  </p><p>Instead, I shouted loudly as I charged forward, raising my hands on both sides. “Come and get me, you bastards!” I shouted. My sudden forward rush and my voice startled them momentarily. They were clearly unused to crazy suicidal assaults. It turned out to be my luck, as other than the disaster wolf, every single one of them froze in panic, while the disaster wolf took a cautionary step back when a rush of lightning flew out of my hand, adding to the intimidation factor. </p><p>The wounded ethereal wolf panickedly took a step back while the others froze in indecision. I understood their reaction. After all, they were clearly one of the most dangerous creatures in the mountain, meaning they have hardly faced a situation they had to run away. Their slowness worked in my benefit, as I found myself in the middle of them before they could run away. </p><p>I did a full turn even as I forced myself to the limits, forcing lightning to flew out endlessly from my hands. It resulted in a lightning tornado. Pained cries of wolves, combined with a depressing smell of cooked flesh, reached to my nose. I wanted to laugh at my initial success, but my attention was caught by forcing me to make the tornado even larger. I wanted it to cover the whole area, killing the wolves before they could react. </p><p>It was a good plan, enough to actually catch several beasts in the immediate surrounding, but like every good plan, it was faced with an unexpected setback. This time, said setback came in the form of a huge paw, breaking through the lightning to hit my torso. I managed to raise a magical shield, but despite its strength, it cracked immediately, throwing me back in the process. </p><p>Still, even as I rolled uncontrollably on the ground, I was happy. I avoided the brunt of the attack that would have turned my torso into minced meat. The disaster wolf howled in anger as it kept its front leg raised, not happy with its burnt fur. However, compared to the ethereal wolves around, its wounds were nothing. Five of the ethereal wolves were on the ground. Three of those were twitching repeatedly, while two of them were motionless, dead. </p><p>Even with the pain spreading in my body, I felt proud. Taking down five ethereal beasts with one spell was a legendary feat worthy of legends. Too bad no bad would believe it. Even worse, it was very unlikely for me to survive to tell the tale. Still, desperation was not enough to make me stop trying. </p><p>Luckily, the arrogance of the disaster wolf worked to my benefit. Rather than rushing forward to finish the job, it howled. If I read the reaction of the remaining ethereal wolves correctly, it was ordering them to attack instead. As an apex predator, it didn’t like being hurt, whether serious or cursory. </p><p>I rolled away even as I created a screen of I gathered my magic, and when one of the wolves rushed forward, I sent a bolt of lightning to dissuade it. It dodged, but took a step back in fear, giving me enough chance to explore the surroundings. I looked around, and saw a small cave on the wall of the valley. I dashed forward</p><p>The disaster wolf howled threateningly once more, but didn’t try to follow me. Instead, three remaining disaster wolves rushed for me from multiple directions, trying to surround me. I sent rapid lightning bolts, but they proved too clever. The one that I aimed dodged without losing ground, while the others continued to rush forward. </p><p>I changed tactics and started creating waves and waves of lightning. It was magically consuming, enough to actually make me feel the tendrils of exhaustion, but it was also better than the alternative —being ripped into pieces by angry wolves. As an added benefit, the strong light prevented the wolves from realizing I was heading toward the cave until I slipped inside. </p><p>I prepared myself to release a thick lightning bolt, ready to take down the first creature that dared to step into the cave. Unfortunately, the wolves proved too smart to fall that simple trick, howling instead. I took a deep breath, trying to ignore the slowly disappearing pain, my recently-attained healing capabilities once again proving their worth. I focused on healing myself, feeling secure as the entrance of the cave was too small for the disaster wolf to enter. </p><p>It turned out to be another miscalculation. Because the disaster wolf walked to the entrance of the cave. I hoped that it would camp at the entrance, relying on its poison breath to kill me in the cave. I hoped that, because I had a lot of solutions against poison breath. I could delay it as I rested, before starting to dig a tunnel out of the cave, escaping the valley from the other side. It would have been exhausting, but not as much as facing against a disaster wolf. If it tried to track me, I could have created a defensible location to give me a fighting chance. </p><p>It ruined my plans by suddenly smashing its paw at the wall of the cave, breaking a huge piece off, widening it enough to allow it to walk in. “Fuck,” I murmured even as I cast an earth spell, strengthening the ceiling to prevent it from collapsing. As I did so, it smashed against the entrance again, widening it enough to enter, and I found myself facing a head bigger than my body just a few feet away, getting closer and closer. </p><p>I summoned the strongest lightning bolt I could conjure and threw against the wolf, aiming at its eye, using its lack of mobility. Unfortunately, it just closed its eyelids, and protected its eye successfully. Its magical resistance was unbelievable, as its eyelid was barely harmed. </p><p>Desperation was a good way to make people risk the unknown, and I was no exception to that. I knew that anything I could normally cast could never hurt a disaster wolf, so I did something I never planned to do, and delved deep into my magical core, which was created by the transformation of the dragon heart. </p><p>Suddenly, I felt magic flood my body, but it was much different than the regular sensation. It was much stronger than the regular magic I could use, but even more unwieldy. It felt like a wild thunderstorm was moving through my veins, with all the pain it implied. The pain was so bad that I lost control of my body, unable to even raise my hand. I tried to suppress the flow, so that I could at least get a rudimentary control, but failed. As a result, the magic flowed even wilder, with the enhanced pain it implied. </p><p>My vision darkened, and I wanted to laugh, darkly amused that my desperate gamble made it easier to be hunted. The wolf still attacked, its mouth wide open, displaying the full range of teeth, but among pain, I noticed a sudden panic in the movements of the wolf. Unlike previously, it was feeling a threat. Too bad I was unable to react. </p><p>Before the threatening set of teeth could connect with me, the pain became bearable. I opened my mouth and screamed, which was the limit of my movement capability. </p><p>Unexpectedly, a huge bolt of lightning, many times stronger than anything I could have achieved even with my enhanced capabilities, left my mouth, and smashed against the open mouth of the creature. Unfortunately, I lacked the slightest ability to aim, so rather than aiming it toward its eye, it hit its lower jaw. </p><p>The results were spectacular. The lightning bolt cut through its skin and bone like butter, leaving a charred and broken mess behind, The wolf let out a broken moan as it pulled back, rushing away. For all its capabilities, it was an animal, and an animal would never risk its life to take down prey that proved too strong to hurt it. </p><p>Or challenge a stronger predator without a burning need. </p><p>I didn’t know which one it thought, but regardless of the reason, it rushed away, leaving me to collapse on the ground alone, trembling helplessly, trying to stay conscious. I breathed hard, trying to control my body. Luckily, the spell drained the magic of my body, removing the risk of self-explosion. Even better, I heard the panicked howls of other ethereal wolves, getting more and more distant. </p><p>Somehow, the danger was resolved, but not without leaving even more questions about the mysteriousness of my abilities. I wanted to return to the hidden city. Despite the risks, I decided to break into the library, because if it continued like this, my lack of information about being a sorcerer would kill me sooner or later. Compared to its virtual certainty, the deadly wards of the library was an acceptable risk. </p><p>Since I was motionless, I decided to mediate to hasten my recovery. I tried to pull the external magic, but the suction effect was much stronger than expected. Still, the result was even weirder than that. Despite the clear sky, a lightning bolt fell from the sky. To make it even more unbelievable, just as it was about to fall on the ground in front of the cave, it took a ninety-degree turn and rushed at me like an arrow, and absorbed into my skin. I felt my body recover slightly, feeling the power once more. </p><p>No matter how weird, the results were hard to argue. I continued to meditate, and the lightning continued to fall, recharging me. It only stopped when I felt my reserves were approximately a quarter full, but by then, the lightning stopped to fall even if I tried to summon it. </p><p>Instead, I meditated, trying to complete my physical recovery before I traveled once more, marveling at my own power. Somehow, I could feel my power increasing even more.</p><p>As soon as I recovered enough, I was going to go back to the library. Solving the mystery of my own power couldn’t be delayed anymore. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After a quick yet very fruitful last tumble with Helga that left her laying on the bed with the consistency of melted butter, I left my room, once again dressed as a servant, moving through the crowd invisibly. When I finally arrived at the Hall, I didn’t immediately want to Oeyne’s room, no matter how much I wanted to drag my hands over her caramel skin. I walked around for almost three hours, changing my disguise repeatedly as I moved from section to section, trying to ferret out some secrets. </p><p>Ultimately, it wasn’t very fruitful in terms of material gain. I had managed to swipe several books across many different halls, from alchemists to enchanters, but none of the books were particularly secretive —or at least, I assumed so, considering they were laying in the middle of the room, or abandoned in a corner. The real precious stuff was hidden behind the wards, and I was guessing that the top-secret items had never been brought to Silver Spires, instead kept in their exclusive guild residences. </p><p>Still, in terms of other benefits, it was extremely beneficial. I had to change my disguise several times as I slipped from one hall to another without arousing attention, and considering the dangers —being hunted by several high-class organizations— I had made incredible gains through the process. </p><p>[Subterfuge +13]</p><p>[Speech +8]</p><p>It was very useful before I was about to launch into another deal with Oeyne. I wanted her to use the earth gem I had acquired as a part of the sword she would ultimately forge, but the previous deal of providing her two sets of material for each finished product would not work. Before, I could be extravagant because the materials I had shared was ultimately not that hard to get, requiring just one hunting trip to collect. </p><p>The earth gem was not like that. It was a true treasure with a value that significantly eclipsed everything I had managed to collect. Luckily, I had the ability to renegotiate such a deal in excess. </p><p>After wasting some more time in the Hall, I finally slipped underground, toward Oeyne’s room deep in the storage section, and knocked on the door with the pattern she had suggested to me the last time. </p><p>“Coming!” shouted Oeyne with a strained voice, suggesting that the previous hangover was not extraordinary. However, unlike the last time, the door didn’t open immediately. She kept me waiting for a couple of minutes before opening the door, once again greeting me with a disheveled look, wearing only a dressing gown. </p><p>Still, I had to hold back a smirk. Someone less experienced might have missed the effort that had went to today’s disheveled look. Her hair was a mess again, but this time, the mess was somehow arranged to put her face to the best benefit. Her face lacked any indicator of sleep, instead covered with a thin layer of makeup, enough to avoid the attention of a less careful man. </p><p>The dressing gown’s messy state was equally engineered. Its front was slightly open, giving the perfect glimpse of her otherwise naked chest, and one side of the bottom had ridden high enough to reveal that she was wearing panties this time. </p><p>The dark and lacy kind… </p><p>Ultimately, combined with her request, it was clear that she was prepared to impress, while trying to hide that fact. If it wasn’t for the cold, calculating glint in her eyes that was hidden for anyone but me thanks to my sharp eyes, I would have assumed that she was attracted to me. With the glint, I was inclined to believe that she had something to discuss, and wanted me to focus on her body during that talk. </p><p>Admittedly, it was a good strategy, as her body was excellent. She might be older, but her body was still at the height of her perkiness, not to mention her outrageous curves. Her caramel skin added a delicious diversity to the mix. Combined, she could have easily distracted me if it wasn’t for the rather memorable evening I shared with Cornelia, followed by the heated morning assistance by Helga and Aviada. </p><p>“Good afternoon,” I said cheerfully as I pulled the potion bottle filled with mineral solution. </p><p>“You’re amazing,” she said immediately in an honest relief as she grabbed my arm and dragged me with strength what would have left a weaker man broken. Despite her preparations, she was still hungover. </p><p>“Maybe I should pay you in hangover potions rather than materials for the next dagger,” I suggested in amusement. </p><p>“Deal,” she immediately answered without even blinking, leaving me amused, yet slightly shocked. I hadn’t expected her to value my hangover treatment so much. Maybe I should have offered a higher price. </p><p>I was expecting her to lay on the couch we had used the last time. Instead, she continued to drag me, and soon, I found myself in her bedroom. Unlike her rough workshop, her living space was furnished expensively, filled with purple velvet curtains and some expensive-looking paintings. However, I was more interested in the occasional spots with thicker colors, suggesting that they were holding similar paintings until not too long ago. </p><p>Her gambling problem seemed to be even worse than Aviada had mentioned. Combined with her sudden lack of income after her fight with the Guilds, she must treat me as a godsend. </p><p>A nicer man might have reacted differently, but as I watched her lay on the bed before pushing her dressing gown down, giving me access to her beautiful shoulders, I had much dirtier things in mind. I could even get a glimpse of her boobs from the side, making my shaft twitch in enthusiasm. </p><p>[+50 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>Taming her was suddenly sounded like a better idea. </p><p>“Hurry up,” she ordered as she looked back, giving me a seductive gaze, convincing me that she wasn’t just driven by her pain. She was intentionally trying to seduce me. </p><p>I smirked. I couldn’t wait until I could teach her the length of her mistake. </p><p>I poured a generous amount of potion into my hands and rubbed them repeatedly to warm them. However, while doing so, I cast another spell, turning the potion into a strong aphrodisiac, but one that would only act after a significant delay, starting to effect in one hour, peaking the effect in three hours. </p><p>Only then I gently pressed my fingers to her neck, caressing gently. Her moan came immediately, sexy and arousing. </p><p>But also artificial. </p><p>I smirked coldly, knowing she couldn’t see my face. She was trying to play with me, unaware of the beast she was challenging. I decided to teach her the lesson for trying to play me, especially in this particular arena. </p><p>Her moans started to have an echo of honesty even before I moved down to her shoulder. I had already used my healing abilities to completely cure her headache, but she made no mention of it, continuing to enjoy the massage. </p><p>I focused on her shoulders, once again unleashing the full range of my massage abilities, her moans turning more honest with each passing minute. I easily resolved the knots on her shoulders. The last time, I had stopped when I arrived at her shoulders, but this time I continued, slowly focusing on her upper back. “How does it feel?” I asked. “Any discomfort?” </p><p>“You have magical fingers,” she answered lazily as she stretched under my touch, which caused her robe to slid even lower. She looked at me carefully, though tried to disguise it as an accidental one, giving me permission to be even more aggressive. However, that didn’t tempt me, because it was still a rational decision. I wanted her to crawl in delirium, begging for me to take the next step. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>At first, she was clearly unhappy with my tame movements, trying to convince me nonverbally to go down by shrugging occasionally, which pushed her dressing gown even lower. And when that didn’t work, she muttered. “Maybe you can go a bit lower, that part is giving me trouble.” </p><p>“Understandable,” I answered lazily. “After all, blacksmithing is not an easy job, no matter how strong you are.” Still, even as I said so, I moved lower only a bit, and stayed strictly in the center, avoiding getting near her breasts. Her dissatisfaction was clear as a glacier, most of it hidden below the surface, but the visible part was more than enough to signal the inherent danger. </p><p>Like a glacier, it was impossible for her dissatisfaction to survive the warmth of my erotic massage. Soon, her moans quickened once more, and unlike the previous ones, they were completely genuine. She was finally under the effects of the wonderful sensation, captured by my skillful fingers, teasing her nerve endings to evoke her thrill. She was paradoxically relaxing and stiffening at the same time. Relaxing because her exhaustion and stress melted under my fingers, stiffening because of her growing arousal. </p><p>It was cute how she thought she could keep her sudden confused expression hidden behind her mask. She had not expected her ploy to turn into a genuine seduction, which was a big mistake. Just because I hadn’t pushed the envelope the last time due to respect for her abilities, she thought that she was good enough to play in the same league. </p><p>I was more than happy to teach her the mistake she had stumbled upon. </p><p>As I moved lower, she stopped shrugging, recognizing the danger. Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of letting her passivity stop me. I pulled down her dressing gown without warning, revealing her back fully for my fingers. Unfortunately, her ass was still covered by the gown, as doing so would have been too much. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>It turned out to be the correct choice. She opened her mouth as if she was about to argue, but stopped when she realized her bottom was still covered. A strategic mistake on her part, but she was yet to realize that. “Your back doesn’t look like I expect,” I lazily commented. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she said, interrupting a moan, alarmed. </p><p>“I expected your back to be more rough and clumpy, filled with muscles. Swinging a hammer every day couldn’t be easy. But instead, your back is shapely and curvy, with muscles hidden underneath. Much sexier than I imagined,” I explained, starting normal, but turning seductive toward the end. </p><p>My soft, throaty tone made her shiver. “T-thanks,” she stammered, interrupted when I pressed at her lower back, triggering another moan. I stayed silent, and she dedicated herself to moaning as I cut free across her back, assaulting and caressing repeatedly until her moans started to get louder and louder. She bit her lips desperately to contain them, but it only made her sexier. </p><p>Soon, she fell into a dichotomy—trying to convince herself to stop, but also desiring for me to go further. Her mind was slowly drifting into complacency while the very center of her being was so aroused that I could smell.</p><p>[+200 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>She clearly realized that it was going further than she intended, in feeling if not in content. If she were of right mind, she would have stopped it, but she just moaned, even when my fingers traveling dangerously close to her ass, every pass revealing more of her back by pushing the gown. Soon, I could see the edge of her panties. At this moment, I was sure that if I pulled the gown down along with her panties and plunged my fingers inside her entrance, she would have accepted it. </p><p>Unfortunately, it would also ruin my aim to teach her a lesson, and wasting all that aphrodisiac. So, without a warning, I pulled back, but not before adding a nifty spell to prevent her from climaxing easily under her own effort. Thanks to my growing magical presence, I wasn’t afraid of being found, especially with my unrestricted access to her body. “That’s it,” I said as I slapped her thigh softly and walked away. </p><p>[-14 Mana]</p><p>“W-what?” she stammered. </p><p>“That’s it,” I repeated as I stepped out of the room. “I’ll wait for you in the forge,” I said as I slammed the door close. Only then I started sniggering, imagining her ridiculous response. </p><p>Once again, I killed time by reading the old notes from the bookshelf. This time, assisted by the benefits of my scooping, I had learned quite a bit more from my adventures. Then, I felt a sound-blocking ward activate. I immediately cast a spell to tunnel a convenient access point inside, eavesdropping on her. Inside, I could hear her moan and gasps, starting enthusiastic, but soon turned desperate, tinged with frustration. She was clearly doing her best to finish it herself, only to fail spectacularly. And with me waiting outside, she didn’t have enough time to waste. </p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Oeyne walked in, trying to look normal, though she could have succeeded better if it wasn’t for her slightly damp hair, suggesting that she had to take a shower to quench her arousal, and the stiffness of her walk. She clearly wanted to climax after my arousing massage. Her clothing could be constituted as revenge. She was wearing a leather vest and leather pants, but both of them were considerably tighter than comfortable, revealing her curves perfectly. Especially her pants, which were tight enough to reveal the shape of her panties underneath. </p><p>She was clearly trying to get revenge by showing me such an arousing sight. I just nodded softly, acting like I missed the challenge she was proposing. “Shall we start?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, let’s start,” she said, challengingly, unaware of the trap she had already fallen thanks to the aphrodisiac mixed in her massage oil… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 356600 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699\tMana: 4914 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [93/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [75/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching Aviada lick the last drops of cum from Helga’s breasts was simply tantalizing. I watched with great interest as I climbed up to my bed, my shaft already coming back to life. Once seated, my shaft pressed against Aviada’s leg, earning a seductive look as she felt my presence. </p><p>“Oh,” she gasped seductively even as she gently bit Helga’s breast at the same time. I smirked before shifting a bit, dragging my erection across Helga’s belly. </p><p>“So tantalizing,” Helga murmured, ready for a real encounter. “I can feel your hardness all over my body.” </p><p>I smirked as I squeezed between two girls. Aviada moved to the side to give me some space, and I found myself squeezed between two beauties. “So, girls, any attention for me?” I asked. </p><p>“Greedy,” Aviada commented, and Helga chuckled, but that didn’t prevent them from grabbing my erection at the same time, Helga grabbing me along the base while Aviada grabbed the top. They started moving in tandem while I enjoyed the beauty of their supple bodies, completely exposed. </p><p>Their bodies were truly a marvel. I could waste days enjoying the expanse of their flesh, one fit and muscular, other soft and curvy, each more delicious than the other. Their fair skin was flushed with excitement, highlighting their curves even more. All the while, their enthusiastic treatment continued. </p><p>It was hard to resist the temptation of teasing them in turn. My hands found Helga’s breasts while I twisted my neck to bury my head between Aviada’s tits like a parched man diving into an oasis, earning a pair of synchronized moans. Occasionally, I raised my head to steal kisses from their ruby lips, while their bodies rubbed against mine. </p><p>“Does it feel good?” Aviada asked as her hand quickened, pumping me furiously. I nodded even as Helga followed her rhythm, my length being subjected to an amazing massage, giving me time to focus on their heaving —and respectably huge— breasts, occasionally teasing their pert nipples. </p><p>\"It gets me so turned on when he touches me like that,\" Helga commented as she looked at Aviada, acting like I was invisible. Very intentionally, if her mischievous expression was any indicator. Earlier in our journey, I might have tried to quash such a behavior, self-conscious about my positioning, but those days were in the past. Now, I just smirked confidently as Aviada giggled —an unfamiliar, yet beautiful tone. </p><p>“It can’t match at his expression when I finally wrap my lips around,” she added, earning a mirroring giggle from Helga. </p><p>“Not a bad idea,” Helga gasped as she immediately started to crawl down, her tongue pressing against my chest. Aviada matched her movement immediately, and they started traveling down, leaving a pair of parallel tingling lines, finally deciding to pay some real attention to my criminally-neglected erection. </p><p>A jolt of lightning pleasure passed through my body as Aviada grabbed the head of my shaft, while Helga focused on licking the base. So tender, yet so delicious. </p><p>I groaned in pleasure. It wasn’t just how it felt —though it felt amazing— but also the amazing view it created, their tits rubbing against my leg with each move with their every move, occasionally slapping hard enough to create a delicious echo. “Delicious,” Aviada gasped enthusiastically as she pulled away to breathe. </p><p>Unlike Aviada’s enthusiastic contributions, Helga pulled back after a brief interaction, watching us, utterly hypnotized while Aviada tasted me again and again, going deeper with every repeat. A couple of minutes later, Helga whispered. “That looks fun. How about I join?” she whispered. </p><p>“Go ahead,” Aviada whispered as she pulled back, but just a bit. When Helga lowered her head, she immediately followed her, and their heads at the opposite sides of my shaft, and started licking across my length, tasting and savoring the texture of every ridge and vein. They wrapped their wet lips around either side of my shaft, kissing the sensitive skin. Occasionally their lips would brush up against each other and they would exchange a playful kiss with my dick in the middle. </p><p>\"Unbelievable,\" I moaned, happy with the soft, playful service I was receiving. Their lips alternated to take the role around my shaft, bringing me more and more pleasure. As they did so, I once again gave my hands-free reign over their bodies, roaming and caressing mercilessly, until they started squirming helplessly. </p><p>“Maybe we should give you a better task,” Aviada suddenly offered as she pulled away from my shaft, taking a teasing trail up once again, her breasts caressing my stomach at first, then my chest. My breath was cut briefly as she pressed her tits on my face. But even that didn’t last long, as she continued to travel up, and soon, her muscular thighs on both sides of my head, and her delicious smell hitting my nose strongly. </p><p>Helga let up on my blowjob to watch as her rival’s hot core pressed down onto my expectant mouth. It was the perfect position to drive Aviada crazy with pleasure. All I could taste were the slippery-smooth texture of her nether lips and the sweet taste of her arousal. I lapped away at her enthusiastically, and the moans of her pleasure in response. It was intoxicating in a whole different way than just simply forcing her down and take her mercilessly. </p><p>I loved it.</p><p>The only disadvantage of the position was that I suddenly lost the pleasure of watching Helga at the same time, but I read them well enough to know that they were watching each other curiously as my tongue discovered the flavor of Aviada’s pussy. </p><p>Aviada’s moans intensified further when I grabbed her ass hard, my fingers testing the strength of her muscles. Meanwhile, Helga returned the task of serving my erection once more, bobbing aggressively. “Hmm, I’m still missing your presence in my mouth,” Aviada commented suddenly and changed positions, so that rather than seeing her amazing tits, I was watching the curves of her ass. Luckily, it was equally delicious.</p><p>Aviada took a deep breath and went back to work, lowering herself down to inhale my cock, smushing her tits against my belly in the process, all the while I continued lapping her delicious core. I felt Helga's mouth move lower to make room, happily licking and sucking my sensitive balls.</p><p>It was stimulation overload. I groaned loudly, finding it more and more difficult to hold back my pending climax.</p><p>I could feel Aviada was getting close, too. She began rhythmically humping my face and I responded to her increased activity with powerful licks around her knob. Having two girls slurping on my shaft enthusiastically made concentrating on Aviada increasingly difficult, and I could tell from Aviada's stilting sucking that she was likewise having trouble staying focused. But we both powered through the pleasure and picked up the pace, our ecstatic moans muffled by each other's bodies. And luckily, Helga was up to the task, compensating for Aviada’s loss of attention. </p><p>When she finally exploded, it was spectacular. She wrenched her lips off of my cock and howled in pleasure at the moon. Her pelvis spasmed against my mouth.</p><p>Seeing my poor desperate shaft suddenly unattended, Helga released my balls and focused at the main even. She assaulted me with her warm mouth and sucked like a vacuum. That proved to be too much for me, as I finally exploded in Helga’s sweet mouth, filling her mouth with my warm seed. Showing her improvement, she managed not to lose a drop, swallowing all. </p><p>Delirious in the grasp of her own climax, Aviada was too late to join the fun, gasping in disappointment. However, she was a decisive warrior, and before Helga could swallow the last drop, Aviada leaned forward and forced her tongue in Helga’s mouth, stealing a load. </p><p>Spots danced in my vision as I breathed deeply, enjoying the aggressive battle in front of me for the last drop of cum. With my endurance, it didn’t take long for my erection to come back to life. </p><p>“I win,” Helga gasped a few seconds later, breathing hard, exhausted, but still, carrying a big smile. </p><p>Aviada frowned, an expression so excessive that it was clear it was fake. “Damn,” she gasped in faux-despair. “What do I do?” Then, before Helga could react, Aviada jumped up to my lap, grinding her sopping wetness across my length. She smirked widely. “Maybe this?” </p><p>“Bitch!” Helga exclaimed as she tried to pull Aviada away, but it was no less fake than Aviada’s earlier sadness. She barely made a perfunctory attempt to pull Aviada off —nor that she could actually do so considering the sheer difference between their physical capabilities. Instead, after a couple of attempts, she stayed hugging Aviada from her back, her hands gently caressing her stomach. </p><p>Seeing them playfully getting along made me happy. Our threesome had weirdly turned into a team-building activity, and I was happy about it. After all, we were facing a dangerous situation, and a warm relationship might assist me further. Aviada and Helga were a perfect duo, with their advantages conveniently covering the weaknesses of the other. </p><p>Of course, the comparative strategic advantages of their combat capabilities took secondary importance when Aviada slowly lowered herself along my shaft, devouring it bit by bit, while Helga kissed Aviada’s neck playfully. </p><p>Her hot, sopping wet entrance wrapped tight around my girth, massaging the stiffness of my length the best possible way. “You feel amazing inside me,” Aviada moaned loudly, earning a playful slap to her ass from Helga, followed by a moan when I suddenly cast a spell on them. It wasn’t the same spell they had experienced during our threesome, but this time, it was Aviada’s sensations that were being reflected back to Helga. </p><p>“Naughty,” Helga gasped in shock before continuing to kiss Aviada’s neck, shivering at the same time. </p><p>I lay on my back as I enjoyed Aviada pushing deeper and deeper along my length while enjoying the view as well. I drank the view of their enormous breasts, jiggling with each step, creating a delicious scene of solidarity even as I invaded Aviada’s delicate folds. </p><p>Deeper I invaded Aviada, louder Helga moaned, driven by the sensation-sharing spell. However, that didn’t prevent her from hugging Aviada tighter as her hands traveled higher, clamping around her breasts. Impaling a brunette while the said brunette was being played by a blonde created an extremely delicious sensation. Their back arched, mirroring each other, as the pleasure built up. </p><p>Soon, I exploded into Aviada, triggering yet another climax, and the echoes of her climax triggered Helga. Three distinct moans danced in the room, creating a delicious show as Aviada collapsed against my chest, while Helga lay next to me. </p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 3. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>[Skill Share perk activated. Target Skill: Legendary Sword Mastery. Copied: Duration, 24 hours]</p><p>[Temporary Skill: Master Swordsman (100/100)]</p><p>“That was something else,” Aviada murmured hazily, letting out another moan as I kissed her neck. “Too bad that I need to be in the training field in a few minutes.” </p><p>“You can always visit us in the night,” Helga unexpectedly offered even as she gently caressed the small of her back. It was surprising for two reasons. First, it showed that their friendship had grown even more than I had expected, even after our interesting threesome. Second, Helga taking initiative to invite someone to my room was unexpected, showing that she was already thinking of it as our room, like we were a pair of newlyweds. </p><p>I spent a flickering second on that thought, and found that I wasn’t disliking the idea. </p><p>“That would be excellent,” Aviada said. “Barracks sucks.” She rested her head against my chest for a moment before raising it back immediately. “Ah, I forget to tell, but Oeyne also sent a message, telling you to drop by if you have time. She says that she could finish the dagger much quicker if you can help her in the casting process.” </p><p>“Sounds interesting,” I commented. I decided to go. After all, I was free in the afternoon, and the Hall of Craftsmen was the perfect location to improve my Subterfuge and Speech. Not to mention, Oeyne was a sexy, mature woman with a burning desire and an excellent skill-set, not to mention her importance as a source of experience. </p><p>Converting her from a remote friend into an ally was definitely an interesting prospect. </p><p>“The dagger?” Helga asked, and I realized that I was yet to explain to her about Oeyne. I gave her a brief breakdown of the meeting, though ignoring the massage part and focusing on the design part. Not that I was afraid of revealing my intentions about conquering such a delicious mature woman, but I had a feeling that if I did so, Helga would feel the need to prove herself, which, normally, a good thing, but I was a bit short on time. </p><p>Instead, I focused on the design of the dagger, also sharing some magical theories behind crafting. “That sounds interesting,” Aviada cut in as she stood up, her tone disagreeing with her words, “But I need to go training. Maybe I’ll drop by in the evening,” she suggested with a smirk. She quickly dressed, and left after stealing two kisses. </p><p>After she left, I continued to explain my plans about the dagger design with Helga, as despite our level gap, when it came to innovation, she was much better than me. She didn’t know much about crafting, but I had read quite a bit, and quickly distilled some major points to her. </p><p>However, as we walked, I slipped inside her, and she accepted my presence enthusiastically. It wasn’t the first time Helga was getting turned on by a complicated magical discussion. I also used our closeness to push some mana, giving her more experience. I wanted to level her up again. </p><p>[-925 Mana]</p><p>“The design of the dagger is magically promising, but do you really think she could craft that dagger?” Helga asked, interrupted by a moan as I pushed deeper.</p><p>“Franky, I don’t know,” I answered. “That’s why I need to experiment, and Oeyne is a skilled Blacksmith, with sufficient knowledge of magic to follow the designs.” Helga raised her eyebrow questioningly, but before she could comment on it, I suddenly shifted position and trapped her under me, mercilessly banging her as I delivered more and more mana inside her, flooding her mind with pleasure. </p><p>“More, more, more!” she cried enthusiastically as I flooded her soul space with mana to accompany the pleasure, and she squirmed beautifully, her soul space growing stronger, signaling another level up. I smiled in satisfaction at the results. </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17</p><p>Skills: Master Arcana, Expert Magical Theory, Expert Spellcrafting, Basic Research, Basic Mana Manipulation]</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 356000 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699\tMana: 921 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [80/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [75/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [42/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Helga barely managed to suppress her cheerful mood until we were safely behind the sound-suppressing ward in my room until she exploded in cheerful laugher. “It was … amazing!” she exclaimed as she jumped up, her legs wrapping around my waist as she started kissing. “I can’t believe that we had sex in front of the legendary Head Librarian while I taught her warding, and she just watched us! You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me,” she exclaimed as her lips closed around. </p><p>“And you are to me, sweetheart,” I answered. Unlike her statement, mine wasn’t completely true, but it was sufficiently accurate. Regardless of everything, Helga held a special place in my heart, and her progress made me happy. “What about your recent power-up?” </p><p>“I still can’t believe it’s not a dream,” she gasped as she looked at the distance, no doubt calling her stats. “A total thirty-five stat points at once, distributed evenly across my stats. Even in the stories, I never read something like this. It should be impossible.” </p><p>I smirked. “You should have learned by now. Nothing is impossible for me.”  </p><p>In response, she kissed me extendedly as we stumbled toward the bed. Since she was wearing only her robe, it was very easy to shed that halfway, so when I threw her on the bed, she was deliciously naked. “Yes, nothing is impossible for you,” she gasped, as I slid inside her. </p><p>One of the conveniences of my direct access to her stat was to have a better understanding of the current position of her level. Since she was already at eighty-five percent, it meant that just three thousand points of mana were enough to give her another level, a number I could easily generate without depleting my mana reserves even without factoring in my regeneration. With two instances of regeneration permanently active, I could easily recover it in ten minutes. </p><p>My perks were truly game-changers. </p><p>Even as I slid inside Helga once more, I couldn’t help but think about the source of my abilities. From what I could decipher from some of the most important achievements, I could understand that it was somehow linked to the past, well before the disaster that marked the beginning of the known history. I was yet to unearth anything about those supposed disasters, let alone the world before the disasters —though to be fair, recently I had much more urgent issues that took my time. I made a note to make more thorough research once the most immediate problems were resolved. </p><p>And my current most immediate problem was the sexy blonde that was laying in front of me, her legs parted, her entrance glittering invitingly. However, just as I was about to delve deep, I heard a knock on the door. How inconvenient, I thought even as I cast a spell to check the identity of my visitor, only to relax. </p><p>It was Aviada. </p><p> I walked to the door, much to Helga’s annoyed glare. “Can’t you just send her away?” she said even as she sat on the edge of the bed, her arms crossed under her breasts, a frown on her face. It was clear she was trying to look annoyed, but that made her look sexier. </p><p>“I can,” I answered, smiling wider. “But I won’t.” Why would I, when watching them bicker was so fun? </p><p>I opened the door, and looked at the brunette beauty on the other side of the door. As usual, she was wearing her combat outfit, which was not exactly feminine, but with a major difference. This time, she was wearing a leather vest, and she had unbuttoned it quite deeply, creating a delicious cleavage. “I came to take back my sword,” Aviada said, but her inviting smirk suggested ulterior motives in her visit.  </p><p>“Perfect timing,” I said as I gestured her to walk in. </p><p>Aviada did so, but her seductive smile melted when she walked into the main room. “Hmmph,” she gasped as she glanced at Helga, trying to look dismissive, but failing in the process. Her jealousy was clear. </p><p>Helga just smirked as she leaned back, her hands on the bed as she gave a better pose to Aviada to make her even more jealous. “Do you have anything to say?” </p><p>“Why would I be jealous?” Aviada answered even though she looked slightly self-conscious. She was clearly being affected by Helga’s radical increase in Charisma, which didn’t change her looks, but changed her demeanor quite a bit. Of course, Aviada was a straightforward person, so chose to deal with her problem in a straightforward manner. Her hand reached to the already loosened string of her top that was holding it together, and pulled it free, revealing her perky body underneath. She might not have the assistance of Helga’s Charisma advantage, but her amazing physical stats, combined with her endless exercising, turned her body into a masterpiece. </p><p>Helga looked at her, but her attempt to look disdainful was no more effective than Aviada’s attempt to hide her jealousy. </p><p>I just stood there, trying not to laugh out loud. Despite their aggressive demeanor, they weren’t exactly hating each other, it was more of a soft competition, which was a nice benefit of our time together hunting and our desperate battle against a band of necromancers. Shared danger —and shared bed— had a way of cutting down the hostilities. </p><p>Of course, seeing the potential amusement, I didn’t say anything, and let them bicker. After a couple of angry words, Aviada pulled off her top, and her pants and underwear followed soon after, matching Helga in nakedness. “Jealous?” she asked gloatingly. </p><p>“Maybe a bit,” Helga suddenly murmured shyly, which took the wind off Aviada’s sails. She looked at Helga questioningly. “Well, you do have a very tight body. Sometimes, I feel a bit…” </p><p>“Don’t be like that,” Aviada answered immediately, her gaze turning soft. “You’re very beautiful as well. Your soft skin, your silky hair, and your elegance…” </p><p>Helga looked like she was about to accept her explanation when I stepped behind Aviada and whispered her ear. “Why don’t you go and apologize to her more intimately,” I whispered, loudly enough to be heard from Helga, which made her blush intensely. Aviada was not much better. It wasn’t our first threesome, but the other attempt had been driven by my aggressive control, and I played the main role. This time, I was asking them to start, while I stayed as a spectator for a while.</p><p>Aviada didn’t move, frozen in sudden indecision. Helga’s sudden blush was not much better. “Go on,” I said as I slapped Aviada’s ass without a warning. “Go and help your friend, she’s feeling self-conscious.” </p><p>Despite their matching blushing looks, Aviada stumbled toward Helga, slowly at first, but getting more sure-footed the nearer she got. “Why don’t you lay down,” she whispered even as she put her hand on Helga’s forearm gently, still hesitant. </p><p>“S-sure,” Helga stuttered as she looked at Aviada hesitantly before laying back, her eyes pointing at the ceiling, trembling softly. It was clear that her thoughts were wondering as much as her eyes, dancing between me and Aviada. Aviada was not much better. Still, she let her hand wander over Helga’s supine body, slowly. </p><p>It was her shoulder at first, then her sides. When she arrived at her stomach, Helga trembled softly. “Is this okay?” Aviada asked, trembling. </p><p>“Yes,” Helga said simply while she glanced at me, while I had unzipped my pants and revealed my raging boner, and my fingers already around it. Seeing Helga shiver, Aviada also turned and noticed my activities, her smile suddenly turning confident. Apparently, my arousal gave them all the confidence they needed, because Aviada’s touch was much more confident as her hand passed the valley between Helga’s breasts, reaching to her neck for a moment before dipping back. </p><p>As Aviada’s fingers delved deep into Helga’s tits, Helga bit her lips, trying to contain a moan, only to fail spectacularly. Even more impressively, her legs parted open, revealing her glistening womanhood. Only for a moment though, as the next second, her legs met together, rubbing against each other mercilessly in an effort to quench her growing arousal. As seconds passed, her hesitancy melted. </p><p>Her nipples hardened with each passing second, enough to resist Aviada’s touch momentarily as she squeezed them. Unlike Helga, Aviada was not gushing with arousal, but also she hadn’t been just subjected to an amazing sexy encounter under the watchful eyes of her idol, so it was understandable. </p><p>Helga lay obediently as her wetness grew to a desperate point, and she tried to reach her entrance, her eyes closed. Aviada looked at me questioningly. I shook my head, asking her to stop Helga. The impact of the beautiful scene would get much lower if she were to be allowed to solve her own problems. </p><p>Aviada proved to be a sweet little soldier and grabbed Helga’s wrist before her hand could reach between her legs. She whimpered helplessly, but followed Aviada’s silent order without a complaint, keeping her eyes closed. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>She gasped in disappointment when Aviada pulled her hand from her tits, but that didn’t last long when her fingers landed on her tummy. Aviada explored the softness of her tummy while she busied herself with soft sighs, interrupted by occasional moans. And surprisingly, rather than delving deep, Aviada kept her movements slow, proving that she had learned quite a bit from our earlier interactions. </p><p>Our very special, very beautiful interactions. </p><p>Still, I would have been disappointed if she followed that direction forever. After all, her directness was one of the special things about her. Luckily, Aviada’s instincts were alive and well, and when her fingers finally reached the treasure spot between Helga’s legs, she assaulted Helga with sudden aggression. Her two fingers disappeared through Helga’s entrance, hooked to attain the maximum impact, her existing sensitivity working against her. </p><p>Helga kept her eyes firmly closed as she enjoyed the treatment, ignoring our presence blatantly to focus on her sensations, though I wasn’t unhappy about it. The pure eroticism it created was much superior to other aspects. Even better, her idle hand finally landed on her own perky breasts, slowly teasing herself, letting her moans mix with Helga’s. </p><p>I continued to pump myself as I watched Helga treating Aviada’s touch as electric, squirming helplessly under her merciless assault.  </p><p>Aviada was too distracted to notice when Helga sneaked her hand between Aviada’s legs, but it was impossible for her to miss when Helga finally slipped them inside her. She opened her eyes as Aviada shared an enthusiastic gasp, their gazes meeting. Aviada looked questioningly. “It’s not fair if I only get to play,” Helga answered with a gasp. </p><p>Despite everything, they managed to surprise me when Aviada leaned down and they shared a searing kiss, their fingers still between each other’s legs, pumping furiously. Such an enthusiastic show. </p><p>I couldn’t help but walk closer, their arousal like sweet nectar on my nose, enjoying the passion they displayed as they were lost in each other, writhing in ecstasy. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly a surprise to see them getting closer to a climax as the time passed. Helga even started shuddering under Aviada’s merciless assault, but Aviada didn’t stop. Nor did Helga, still pumping Aviada softly, methodically, with great contrast to Aviada’s style. When she opened her eyes, she was startled to see I was hovering over her, watching their every single move with great attention. Our eyes locked, but it didn’t slow her down after a brief stop, but only made her faster. I could hear her heartbeats easily. </p><p>I started to pump faster, desiring to cover her tits with my seed. </p><p>The sheer desire packed at the moment was simply unbearable. When Aviada started to shudder, it marked the end of my resistance as well. I exploded, covering Helga’s tits with my seed, staining her aggressively as Aviada’s toes curled visibly and her back arched. Her orgasm was powerful, though not as powerful as mine. </p><p>“Why don’t you help Helga clean up,” I offered to Aviada suggestively, and she didn’t waste a second before leaning down and tracing her dirtied tits with her tongue, showing her readiness for more. </p><p>So delicious, I thought even as I waited for my erection to return, my mind already filled with ideas how to leverage the moment fully. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 356000 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699\tMana: 4814 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [80/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [75/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [42/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 12/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>A little disappointment rang in me as I left Aria behind in her room, exhausted, tainted with my mark, buried in her soft bed. It was so tempting to stay back and spend more time with her, but I was afraid that one of my other jailers drop in and realize my freedom. It was not something I wanted to deal with before I could get a better understanding of the reality of the situation. </p><p>Instead, I went back to my cell, and spend my day establishing a veritable number of trap wards and spells, buried among the existing wards so that unless someone was looking for them explicitly, they wouldn’t notice. I was determined to make them pay for trusting a piece of magic artifact to keep me contained, however impressive. </p><p>It was risky to do so, of course, but not as risky as revealing my situation to Emma, so, I continued establishing a defensive location, made easier by the fact that the cell I’m in was not exactly a true prison, but a standalone cell embedded in their most important secret passage, therefore isolated fantastically from the outside. After establishing a defensive beachhead, I went back to my cell, and rested a bit. This time, I didn’t put on my chains, as several alarm wards would alert me about a visitor —and unlike the last time, I wasn’t distracted with a sexy blonde, so I wouldn’t miss it. </p><p>Only when it was nearing midnight I went back to the corridor that led to Aria’s room, prepared for a visit. Since it was midnight, I assumed she was rested enough. </p><p>However, just as I was about to enter, I felt a flare of magic in a very close location. I immediately summoned my trusty shadows and hid behind them, disappearing from the view in the poorly-lit secret passage. When I saw it was Queen Sapphire that left the room, I prepared to move before she could pass me, no matter the risks of getting noticed. If she passed me once, I would have significant problems finding her back. </p><p>Then, Queen Sapphire surprised me by moving away from me, rather than to me. She wasn’t going to my cell, but another location. How interesting. </p><p>Since I could easily visit Aria an hour later as well, I decided to follow the Queen, curious where she was going —from a reasonable distance to make sure I wasn’t noticed. Much to my surprise, we walked for almost ten minutes before she activated another secret passage. I decided to take the risk and slip in before she could pass, not wanting to be left behind. I had memorized the key for the secret passage, but I didn’t want to be alerted. </p><p>It turned out to be a good option, as the secret passage slammed immediately after she passed, leaving us in a weird basement. Somewhere outside the palace grounds, because I couldn’t feel the general protections of the Palace anymore. </p><p>And since I finally had the opportunity to gaze at her, I examined her looks. Curiously, she was wearing a dark gray cloak that hid all of her body successfully despite her amazing curves. It was suspicious. </p><p>It was even more suspicious when she suddenly pulled a lace mask that covered the upper half of her face, cast a spell to turn her hair color to black from the original blonde, then pulled on the hood of her cloak before leaving the basement. The hood was understandable considering her sneaking. The mask and the hair color change, not so much. Despite my curiosity, I was careful as I could feel the presence of four guards on the other side of the room. I watched as she unlocked the door with another spell, and then left the room. Luckily for me, this time, she didn’t bother to lock it while I stayed back. </p><p>Meanwhile, I felt the presence of the two guards leaving with her, the other two stayed on there. Luckily, I couldn’t feel any magical presence in them, so when I unlocked the door, a simple mind spell was enough to distract them until I could mix with the shadows once more. While they looked blankly, I closed the door and followed the corridor, only to meet with a huge surprise. </p><p>I was in a house of pleasure. A pretty high class one, considering the silk and velvet that covered the main corridor. </p><p>Why the hell the Queen was in such a place in the middle of the night, I wondered. She probably came here to meet with an informant, but even that was shocking. What kind of information was worthy enough of the queen to take the risk of leaving her room alone without a guard, and enter such an establishment. Yes, she had two guards right now, but even that was not enough. And considering the additional mask she put in, I wasn’t entirely sure that those guards knew her identity. </p><p>Unfortunately, the corridor had split into many different directions, making it impossible for me to find her. I didn’t even consider leaving, of course. The Queen of the Empire, visiting a high-class brothel for some reason… It was the opportunity of the century. </p><p>I just needed to discover why. </p><p>Of course, being dressed in prison clothes was hardly a way to mingle in such a high-class location. Luckily, I noticed the solution right away. A tall rich drunk stumbling toward the bathroom. He wasn’t as muscular as me, but luckily, he was fat, making sure that I would mingle. Still wrapped in shadows I followed him into the bathroom. Taking down a drunk without killing was not even a task mentioning considering my skill set, especially since we were alone in the bathroom. </p><p>A simple spell put him to his sleep. After stealing all of his clothes except his underwear, as well as his fat money pouch, I stuffed him into one of the cabins, and wrote a note to his head. Learn to gamble. I did so that, once he was discovered, the club would write it off as a mean joke from his compatriots after losing his money. Not exactly foolproof, but considerably better than leaving him in hereafter robbing him. </p><p>Since I had no clue about her location, I followed the music. I wanted to get a better understanding of the layout and the guards before acting, so I walked into the main hall, and walked to the nearest empty table, not wanting to raise any suspicion, since I was still wearing my stolen clothes. I didn’t want to be recognized by the friends of my victim, however unlikely it was in the low-light conditions of the room. There were many waitresses walking around, each dressed with semi-transparent outfits that glistened under the flickering lights, each sexier than the last. </p><p>It was a very high-class location. </p><p>I gestured to a waitress. “Wine, please.” </p><p>“At once, my lord,” she answered, and a minute later, she returned to me with a goblet of wine. Meanwhile, I entertained myself by watching the dancer in the middle of the raised platform, dressed in nothing but a flaring robe thin enough to be invisible, and her panties, dancing seductively. The place was really top-class. </p><p>“Do you want her to accompany you after her dance is complete, my lord?” she asked as she fluttered her eyelids. </p><p>“No need,” I said as I waved my hand lazily, dismissing her words without giving a thought. It wasn’t the first time I faked being a useless noble, after all. </p><p>She went away without saying anything, and I sat down, acting like I was watching the dance attentively, while I carefully watched the guards. What I had seen didn’t exactly make me happy. Even with a brief count, I could see twelve guards dressed neatly, concealed behind the decoration. If even the main hall was this crowded, I couldn’t help but think about the protection of the area the queen went. </p><p>Funny that a high-class brothel was giving me more trouble than the palace itself…  </p><p>I was just about to decide to take the risk, when I noticed the main hall was getting more and more crowded. Soon, hundreds of people filled the main hall, and each of them was rich nobles or merchants, obvious from their rich clothing. “What’s this about?” I asked to the waitress when she arrived with another goblet of wine. </p><p>“It’s almost time for the Seductress to take the stage, sir. Everyone is here to watch her,” she said, though I could feel her slight suspicion. </p><p>“Right?” I said, acting like I just realized it. No reason to alert her, even if she was just a waitress. No need to arouse suspicion needlessly. The waitress was gone, and I smiled, happy with my luck. Since the new dancer was popular to this extent, it meant the guards would pay more attention to the crowd surrounding the stage, giving me the opportunity to slip backstage and search for the dear Queen. </p><p>However, when the dancer walked onto the stage, those plans changed just a bit. “Well, isn’t that a shocker,” I murmured in shock as I watched a familiar brunette figure, dressed in a red, magically enhanced robe with illusions of flame flickering over as she walked forward, each step creating flickering lights. More importantly, she was wearing a very familiar mask, her blue eyes peeking behind her mask. </p><p>I didn’t expect to find the Queen that easily. </p><p>The shock went through me even as my attention focused on the voluptuous figure of the Queen as she started swaying under the enchanting tones of the music, the crowd already going crazy with anticipation, unaware of the identity of the figure. “Why the hell she is on stage, dancing?” I murmured in shock, trying to understand. Initially, I thought that she was here to meet with an important informant, or in the extreme, meet with a secret lover. </p><p>However, it didn’t take long for me to realize the reason. As she started swaying, I felt a sudden sense of adoration and worship rise inside me, one that could have easily mistaken for a rush of emotions if I wasn’t a cynical bastard that never felt such emotion. It was clearly external. Damn, I didn’t expect Queen Sapphire to be as innocent as her daughter, but casting Tantric magic while dressed as an exotic dancer, serving as eye candy for hundreds of people were out of my expectations.  </p><p>The only question was, why she was doing that. Curious, I slid my hand under the table and started casting a wide number of subtle detection spells, trying to understand why she was doing it. It needed to be a reason. </p><p>Of course, just because I was watching an amazing show didn’t mean that I wasn’t enjoying her incredible show. I had to admit, she was gorgeous. The silky clothes hang loose over her body, creating illusions of fire every time she turned, enhancing her striking beauty. She seductively spun in the middle of the scene, uncaring of the hungry eyes, spreading another tether of adoration. Her contours were highlighted as she turned and twisted, making my mouth water in anticipation. I couldn’t help but imagine her under me, just like the princess had been earlier in the day, but her expression was replaced by a sharper emotion. </p><p>She was surprisingly flexible, I noted as she sat on the floor, her legs spreading open, which also rode her robe high, giving a glimpse of her smooth thighs, the crowd rearing for more. </p><p>I was impressed. Even though it was partially with the help of magic, she could drive a crowd to a frenzy with a few simple moves. I watched, though not as mesmerized as the rest of the audience while she walked forward and turned, before suddenly bending backward. Her silky robe was thick enough not to reveal her skin, but also flexible enough to reveal the hint of her body. </p><p>Then, things got more heated. Her fingers reached the flimsy rope that was holding her robe together, and with a flick, untied it. Her robe fell on the floor obediently, revealing a dark velvet corset underneath, one that wrapped around her torso perfectly to hide her curves, and a flimsy short that put her legs to an amazing display. The crowd roared in excitement, their eyes blurred with fervor. </p><p>Then, a wicked smile appeared on the face of the Queen, even as her hands made a subtle move. I felt a sliver of my magic moving toward the Queen. I easily suppressed it, the rest, not so much. Hundreds of magic slivers flew toward the Queen, too weak to be noticed by anyone other than me. </p><p>Such an interesting trick, I murmured in shock as I watched the Queen devour the magic of the attendees like a succubus. Of course, unlike a real succubus, she was very restrained. Essentially, she was plucking a piece of fruit from every single tree, while a Succubus would have eaten all, and then pulled the roots of the tree for the good measure. </p><p>Though harmless, this kind of magic was essentially dark magic, falling under my domain. Such a naughty queen, I decided. </p><p>I watched as she walked around the stage, excitedly expecting her to get rid of her annoying corset, or her restrictive shorts. However, unlike my expectations, she kept the rest of her clothes on even as her back arched in a way that reminded me of orgasm after great sex. As the music slowed, indicating the end of the dance was closer, I felt strangely disappointed, while the rest raged and cheered feverishly, captured by her subtle magic, unaware that their sudden exhaustion was not just about their excitement. </p><p>The question, what should I do next? </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but feel disappointed as I left the hidden city behind, stepping onto the wild ground of Mount Pyrenaean proper once more. Without the protection of the wards, the magical storm raged around me, bringing the mists of the mountains to wrap around me, their fluctuations strong enough to bury a less competent mage. I doubted that I could have survived before my fateful trips, regardless of all the amazing tricks I had learned from my grandfather. </p><p>No wonder Ceasar had picked this area to establish a secret headquarter. </p><p>Even if he had been unlucky enough to be discovered, there was no way an outside force could attack against an established force hidden behind the wards. He must have shared my opinion, as he didn’t even bother to build walls around the city, relying on his wards. </p><p>It was unfortunate that I didn’t have anything that could be remotely called an army. If I even had a small team of expendable soldiers, supported by a couple of mages, I could have probably defended the area against the legionaries' invasion. Of course, even if those hypothetical competent and loyal henchman that was willing to die for my suicidal strategies appeared in front of me, it still depended on one very important detail. </p><p>Whether I could measure against a proper Sorcerer, especially an experienced one like a Centurion. </p><p>I was several times stronger compared to before I had interacted with the dragon heart, but that didn’t mean I could win against a Sorcerer. I had never interacted with a Sorcerer. Neither my family, nor any family I had the ability to contact had any Sorcerer in their midst. Naturally, any family that was actually capable of raising Sorcerers would never waste time on a colonial island, moving to either Rome one of the cities in Italia, enjoying the incredible perks of proper citizenship. The only Sorcerers in the Britanium was the high-ranking members of the Legion XXI, which was responsible for the protection of the island. </p><p>As a bastard scion of a local noble family, it wasn’t exactly a surprise that I wasn’t rubbing elbows with the Centurions. </p><p>All of those factors led to my current problem. I had no idea how strong a proper Sorcerer was. There was no doubt that I had ascended to the ranks of Sorcery, but I had achieved this point through extremely unorthodox means, therefore had no clue about whether I was capable enough to actually stand against a Sorcerer —especially one experienced enough to lead his own Cohort. </p><p>I didn’t even know my own limits, which was half of the reason I was taking this dangerous trip. I wanted to test myself as I searched for the mysteries of the mountain. </p><p>A misty breath left my lips as I continued to climb toward the peak, the chaotic waves of mist getting stronger with each step. It wasn’t exactly a genius guess to assume whatever the mystery of the mountain lay on the peak. Of course, that required me to actually arrive at that location without losing my life. I only felt a moment of alertness before I ducked, and a semi-transparent figure passed over me. Fuck, I exclaimed as I immediately summoned the familiar power of the cursed fire, which was my biggest trump card, intending to destroy it immediately. Ethereal creatures were more magical constructs than actual beings, almost immune to physical assault or normal spells. Only something like a cursed fire had any chance to defend against it. </p><p>However, the bolt of energy that left my hand was not the ominous flickering green of a cursed flame, but instead, a golden-colored ball of flame, surrounded by the crackling of lightning! </p><p>I prepared myself to roll, unable to believe I had somehow managed to miscast the cursed flame. The cursed flame was not a regular spell. It actually contained a sliver of life energy, forcing it to burn an immolate, creating an unholy existence. As a result, while it was extremely hard to cast, however, once the life energy was pulled successfully, the results were clear. The worst that could happen was the failure to contain the spell, hurting the owner rather than the target —which, unfortunately, happened quite a bit, hence its reputation as a forbidden spell. </p><p>Golden flame covered with lightning was completely out of expectation. However, before I could roll, the spell hit the ethereal beast, and it evaporated instantly. </p><p>“What the hell?” I murmured as I looked at the smoking remains in shock. I didn’t have extended knowledge about ethereal beasts, but I knew that they were very dangerous opponents. The only reason they didn’t destroy towns and cities like the other monsters were their heavy magical dependency. They could barely survive anywhere other than locations with extremely dense magic, but there, they were almost invincible. Even with my cursed fire, I was expecting to scare it enough to pull back. Not destroy it in one hit. </p><p>How interesting, I thought as I sat down a nearby rock, once again pulling a sliver of my life energy and replicating the process to summon cursed flames. Once again, a golden flame surrounded by lightning appeared. Even more, interestingly, it hovered above my finger obediently rather than raging without control, straining my willpower. </p><p>“It cannot be just about becoming a Sorcerer,” I murmured thoughtfully as I tried to understand the reasons for the sudden change. Sorcerers were much stronger than mages, but based on everything I learned —which, admittedly, not a lot— working principles between a sorcerer and a mage shouldn’t be this divergent, especially when it came to a primal spell such as a cursed flame. Curious, I cast a simple flame spell, and it worked like it supposed to —except the resistance I felt, forcing me to spend some mana to enhance its structure. I cast a rune of pure magic, and it worked like it was supposed to, and it worked easily. Remembering the ease I felt when I was facing against the legionaries, I cast a simple lightning spell, and it jumped out of my hands enthusiastically, flowing more obediently than water. </p><p>It was weird, I thought, repeating the same process for the other three main elements. Air, water, and earth spell similarly resisted my control. The pure magic was working as it was supposed to, but four core elements were resisting my controls, very pointedly. On the other hand, the fifth one, lightning, famous for its hard-to-control nature, was actually acting very obediently. Even more, my own life essence was creating a lightning effect. </p><p>I have never heard anything like that. </p><p>There were many esoteric magical branches, from soul to blood, but the two main schools of magic were elemental magic and pure magic. Pure magic, also classified as arcane magic, lay on the basis for everything that required immense control, such as runes and utility spells. Runes could also factor in the effects of the elemental magic, but only through containment and direction of pure magic, making rune effects several times costlier than just casting the elemental equivalent. </p><p>The elemental spells, on the other hand, were conjured through a mage’s connection with the world. A mage had the ability to use pure magic as a conduit to essentially communicate with the world, calling and directing the elements for his need. Effects of the elemental spells were much stronger than pure magic, because the main power came from nature, the mage was only responsible for directing the flow. It was both slower and less flexible than arcane spells, but the power difference made it a worthy tradeoff. </p><p>I was surprised with the experimentations of my result, because I had never heard that kind of elemental rejection. If it wasn’t for my extremely strong arcane capabilities, I couldn’t have cast any spell of four elements without significant backlash, but the fifth element, lightning, worked much smoother. People had their elemental affinities, most people limited themselves to one or two elements, but it was due to their personalities and their training. Each element reacted differently, and focusing on one to gain expertise was the easiest choice. Of course, very rarely people chose lightning despite its destructive potential, as it was by far the hardest element to control. Only through my grandfather’s sadistic training I was able to gain a competent ability across all five elements. Even then, I had never been particularly impressive when it came to lightning. </p><p>After a brief consideration, I remembered the fateful moment of my ascension. I didn’t like to think a lot about it, as it made me remember the excruciating pain I had gone through, but I still remembered how four elements tried to kill me to the best of their ability, while lightning rained from the sky and actually saved me. Apparently, it went further than that, changing my whole nature. Combined with Lillian’s limited explanations about the ascension process, it turned even more mysterious. </p><p>While there was no evidence, it wasn’t hard to assume that all of those somehow led to my foolhardy action of swallowing the dragon heart in the midst of desperation. Though it was possible that it was also about my mysterious ability to somehow survive the after-effect of swallowing the dragon heart. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I found myself in a very unique position, rejected by the four elements, blessed by the fifth. I still needed to get better control of my lightning abilities. Therefore, I moved forward, hoping to find another enemy to test the limits of my enhanced lightning capabilities. </p><p>The next opponent turned out to be another ethereal beast, this time a wolf. Suddenly, the mountain’s reputation as a dangerous place made even more sense. If there were multiple ethereal beasts roaming even before arriving at the peak, no doubt people were scared to explore. </p><p>“Come on, you little bastard,” I called even as I cast a lightning bolt, cutting through air violently. When it exploded against the shimmering skin of the wolf, instead of destroying it like my mutated cursed flame, it only pushed it back. Still, considering its ragged looks and pained yelp, it was more than I had expected. Angered with my daring, the wolf rushed toward me once more, only to abort its assault when I responded with another lightning bolt, this time thicker than my arm, bright enough to temporarily blind an unprepared observer. Unlike the previous probing attack, I had put my full strength behind the spell.</p><p>And the elemental response was even more spectacular than I had expected. The ethereal wolf dodged, but even with that, my attack left a charred wound on its side before going forward and exploding into flames, covering an innocent tree. </p><p>The wolf immediately, but I only followed after casting a water spell to extinguish the fire. There was no need to start a forest fire, after all… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I quickly went to my room and picked a towel and a change of clothes, and also a small piece of wire. The locks were not terribly complicated, especially the subpar ones that were used for inner doors. So, when I arrived at the bathroom, it took a couple of seconds for me to open it silently. </p><p>When I opened the door, I saw Eleanor in the bath, most of her body buried under the bubbles, but I managed to get a glimpse of her perfect tits before she buried herself in. “What the hell, Nathan,” she said in an angry whisper, barely holding her senses enough to remember not to shout. </p><p>“Sorry roomie, the door was unlocked, so I assumed it’s empty.”</p><p>“But I locked it…” she murmured, but her confused expression told me that she was revisiting that idea, probably blaming her anger for her mistake, not assuming my lockpicking abilities. Then, she continued in a sharper tone. “Anyway, as you can see, it’s busy.” </p><p>I closed the door, and locked it once again, but much to her shock, I stayed inside. “The shower is empty,” I said even as I moved forward. </p><p>“But-” she tried to start, but her expression was shocked. </p><p>“Come on, roomie, it’s not like it’s the first time we’re sharing a bathroom, or you seeing me naked” I answered. </p><p>“We were still in high school then,” she answered, but her voice trembled. </p><p>“The last time, I was twenty, and you were nineteen,” I countered, letting sharpness dominate my tone. She failed to answer, as my response reminded her of betrayal and abandonment, leaving me alone in a cold cell after I sacrificed my reputation for her. “Anyway, I’m sweaty, and I need a shower.” </p><p>She made a show of avoiding to look at me as I removed my shorts, revealing my shaft —with a respectable eight inches in size, and a corresponding thickness— rock hard thanks to the glimpse of her beautiful breasts, a sight that I had missed greatly. </p><p>“Would you mind closing your eyes so I can leave,” she said. Not expecting an intrusion, her bathrobe was on the other side of the room, meaning she had to walk naked to reach it. Something she clearly didn’t want to do.  </p><p>“Yes, I would mind,” I answered as I stepped into the shower, enjoying the warm blast of water, but kept my gaze on the bath. </p><p>She didn’t know how to answer my brazen reply, so she stayed in the bath, buried in the water, her eyes firmly closed. At first, at least. While I was busy with soaping my body, I saw her eyelids opening just a bit, enough to give her a perfect view of my body while still staying concealed. Unfortunately for her, I still remembered all her tells perfectly, including the way she stiffened when she concentrated on something. </p><p>Maintaining my full erection was easy. All I needed to was imagining what Eleanor looked like under the bubbles. Was she completely shaved or did she have a small, neatly groomed line that framed her entrance? Whether she was brave enough to suntan naked when she was alone like I had convinced her to once we were in a holiday together or whether she stained her perfect figure with a bikini line. I wanted to pull her out of the water to find out. Pity, it wasn’t time yet. </p><p>“How long is your shower,” she said exasperatedly. “You’re wasting water,” she added, like that excuse wasn’t completely transparent. </p><p>“I prefer a long, relaxing bath, but since the bath is occupied, I’m going to take a long shower,” I answered. “Unless you’re inviting me there, of course.” </p><p>“Dream on, bastard,” Eleanor murmured. </p><p>“Oh, I definitely will dream about it tonight,” I said, blatantly leering at her, which once again shocked her. I continued showering, but this time, she kept her eyes open. Maybe she was encouraged by my brazen acknowledgment that I would be masturbating for her memories tonight, maybe she was finally remembering the times we shared baths together, exploring each other. She opened her eyes, keeping them locked on my cock. </p><p>I continued showering, not reacting to her action. But the real fun started when I started to shampoo my hair. Believing that I was keeping my eyes closed, her hand started moving underneath the water, proving that despite years and decisions that separated us, she was still burning with a desire for my body. </p><p>I let the shampoo linger even as she bit her lips pointedly, watching as her face danced between expressions, giving the familiar signs of an impending orgasm as she bit her lips desperately, trying to keep herself from making a sound. I loved how beautiful she looked at the moment, and cursing the fact that it was too early to make a more aggressive moves.</p><p>Then the gods took mercy on my desperation, and a knock was heard at the door. “Honey, are you in,” called Devon. </p><p>Eleanor flinched badly, suddenly realizing that she in the bathroom with her supposed friend, in a position impossible to explain. She made a motion to me, begging for me to speak, absolving her, but I just smirked. I had no intention of letting go of this opportunity. “Yes,” she finally said desperately. </p><p>“Can I come in?” he asked.</p><p>“No!” she immediately cried, panicked.</p><p>Not knowing the circumstances, Devon chose to read that as anger. “I’m sorry, sweetie, I was out of line, please forgive me,” he started speaking. Eleanor, distracted by her husband’s speech, failed to notice that I turned the water off and sneaked toward her. Only when my hand dipped down the water, she realized what I was about to do. </p><p>“No!” Eleanor cried panickedly, this time not aiming Devon at all, but he chose to take it like that, unaware that her wife was being seduced by the guest that moved to their house hours ago behind the locked door of her own bathroom. </p><p>Devon started begging more emphatically, but I ignored it. “What are you doing?!” Eleanor whispered, shocked. </p><p>“Helping you finish what you started, like we did just before I took responsibility for the crime you committed, and you left me shamelessly,” I reminded her even as I dipped my fingers down. She pressed her legs together, but with arousal slowly rising, she lacked the power to keep them closed as my fingers started to caress her inner thigh. Her legs opened almost instinctively, and I pushed my fingers deeper. </p><p>“Are you crazy?” she whispered as my fingers found her labia, easily slipping inside her prepared entrance. “Get out of the bathroom and keep away from me!\" she added, but followed by a soft moan, it wasn’t entirely effective. I loved this about her, no matter what she said, she was weak against pleasure, especially the kind I could give her. </p><p>“Honey, please,” Devon said, distracting her enough that I could push two fingers deep inside her, pumping mercilessly. “I’m not going to leave until you open the door.” </p><p>I made a note to send Devon a bottle of good scotch, as unknowingly, he was doing his best to surrender his wife to my tender mercies. While Devon droned on, occasionally broken by the half-assed replies Eleanor managed to cobble together as she moved toward orgasm between her silent gasps. </p><p>Soon, Eleanor started to shudder, reaching orgasm through my touch, for the first time in four years. I stopped for a moment, examining the sexy expression I had dreamed of for the last four years. It was finally the time. </p><p>While she tried to catch her breath, I pulled her from the bath, and let her lay on the cold, ceramic floor of the bathroom. She was perfectly mellow after explosive orgasm, her ass pointing upward, her entrance glistening with a mixture of bathwater and her own arousal, all the while her husband begged from outside. </p><p>My cock was throbbing, begging me to take the final step, the one I had been dreaming for the last four years since I lost her. But this time, things were different. I was different. I wasn’t doing to seduce her, or woo her. </p><p>I was going to tame her. </p><p>As she lay doubled over, trying to gasp for air after her orgasm, I pressed against her entrance, all the while her husband droned outside, still begging for her forgiveness.  </p><p>Eleanor wheezed exhaustedly. “No, please, don't do this,” she whispered. </p><p>\"What's the matter, roomie?” I answered. “Don't you want to tease me, only to bail at the last possible time, abandoning me despite your promises?”</p><p>While she tried to come with an answer, I turned my attention to her body. For a moment, I let my eyes feast on her naked and wet body and its beautiful curves. Then, I grabbed her leg and forced them to part with brute strength, giving me a better look at the treasure between her smooth, long legs, giving me the perfect angle to plunder her riches. I was happy to note she was perfectly groomed, like she was prepared for my intrusion. </p><p>“Do you wax, or is it laser treatment?” I whispered smugly as I dragged my finger against her entrance, making her shiver helplessly. I trembled at joy at finally having her under my power after four years of separation. I let my fingers slide upward, caressing her flat stomach and delightfully cute bellybutton. </p><p>Then my fingers moved even further, meeting the sensation they had missed around her perky breasts, circling her pink areolae, perfect in size and shape, crowned by her stiff nipples, currently hard enough to cut diamond, suggesting that she wasn’t the only one aroused for the opportunity. </p><p>I finally had the opportunity to fix the mistake I made four years ago, I thought even as I brought my finger back, gently dipping into her pink entrance, enjoying the warmth. </p><p>“Oh, god, no…” she murmured. “Not this again, please!” she said, suddenly turning so that she was sitting on the floor, facing me, but my fingers were still inside. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said as I pulled my fingers and grabbed her nipples, twisting them hard enough that she yelped loudly. </p><p>“Is there something wrong, honey?” cried Devon from outside. “Should I break the door?” </p><p>“No!” Eleanor exclaimed, her face contorted with fear, clearly not willing to let her husband see the sight of her collapsed figure, still flushed after her latest orgasm. “I just stubbed my toe!”  </p><p>“Okay,” Devon said. </p><p>Meanwhile, I helped her to her feet, then before she could react, I pushed her against the door, with my body locking her in place, my shaft aligned at her entrance. “As I said, I’m not going to play with you anymore,” I whispered.  </p><p>When I pressed my shaft against her entrance, she tried to push me away, but her moves were weak, restricted by both the fear of her husband hearing what was going on, and her own arousal drowning her willpower. Even then, as my shaft considerably-sized shaft slowly pushed into her wet opening, she became frantic. It was obvious that she didn’t know what to say, or how to react. Her arousal was one thing, but also there was the presence of her husband, ready to be alerted at any moment. </p><p>“It can’t be happening,” she murmured in shock even as I pushed into her, finally giving myself the taste I had been missing for the last four years. </p><p>Meanwhile, her husband intruded once more. “Honey, please talk to me, I know I angered you, but I’m trying to apologize.” </p><p>“Devon-NN!” she said, trying to say something to her husband, only to devolve into a loud cry as I chose the opportunity to push deep into her. “I accept your apology, so go away,” she continued, gasping and moaning as I started impaling her rhythmically. </p><p>“I can hear you’re still angry,” Devon said, not even considering for a moment that his precious wife was being finally taken by their brand new guest. </p><p>“He’s a bit slow, isn’t he,” I murmured into her ear as I pushed even deeper into her, pushing her against the door, separated by inches from her husband. “You can’t believe how much I dreamed about this, honey, after you abandoned me without a warning, only to marry this useless sack of meat.” </p><p>“Nathan,” she whispered, her voice low enough not to pass through the wooden door, her disbelief clear in her tone. She obviously didn’t know what to say to stop me, maybe not sure whether she actually wanted to do so. She certainly didn’t bother to resist when I grabbed her arms and spread them forcefully, giving myself a perfect angle to take her. My heartbeat was crazy as I finally fulfilled the most important desire of my life… </p><p>“Please, no,” she suddenly whispered as I pushed deeper. “No, it’s too big!” she added, this time even louder. </p><p>“What’s going on in there, honey!” Devon suddenly asked. </p><p>Eleanor froze, and as much as I wanted to see her struggle, Devon’s presence was getting old. He had worked well to drive in the fact that I was taking her with the full knowledge of her marriage, but now, I wanted her to focus on me, not on hiding from her useless husband. “Tell him that you’re masturbating,” I whispered.</p><p>She somehow managed to look scandalized even with my shaft in her, pushing deeper and deeper, but that didn’t last long. She wasn’t in a mind space to come up with a better idea. “I’m masturbating because you left me hanging, now go away,” she shouted sharply. </p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want me to-” Devon started, trying to be seductive.</p><p>“No!” shouted Eleanor, probably helped by the sudden merciless push I made inside her, finally sheathing my full size, earning a loud cry.</p><p>“Okay, jeez, message received. I’ll eat out tonight, don’t wait up,” said Devon, followed by annoying stomping. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured into her ear, stopping my furious pumping for a moment, staying deep inside her to enjoy the sensation. “It seems that we’re alone tonight.” </p><p>“Nathan, please,” she gasped. </p><p>I pulled out, which earned a shocked gasp from her, though it was replaced when I suddenly grabbed a few towels and threw them on the floor, then pushed her on top of them. I wanted to take her in a way she couldn’t avoid my gaze, something she understood as well when I took the missionary position above her, ready to blast her mercilessly. </p><p>“I’m sorry what for what I have done,” she begged. “It was a mistake I had done in a panic. I was young then. I promise I’ll be nice and do anything you want, so please stop.” </p><p>“Oh, honey,” I said as I caressed her cheek gently, which contrasted greatly with the merciless way I impaled her once more. “You’re right about that, you’re going to do anything I want. You owe me for the last four years…” </p><p>“Please don't. Oh... no... you're too big...\"</p><p>“I know,” I said smugly. “But now, we’re going to share something special.” As I pushed, I could feel her clenching around tightly, showing the betrayal of her body. </p><p>\"Oh, god! No... Please. You're hurting me. Don't...\" she said, but her moans disagreed with her words. </p><p>But she was really incredibly tight. I thought about comparing his dick size with Devon, but decided against. No need to spoil this historic moment with the mentions of that wet blanket. Still, I pushed deeper, enjoying the pressure as I slowly overcome her tight resistance. \"Oh, honey. You taking me. Oh, god, you feel so good.\"</p><p>\"Ow..oh god... no,\" Eleanor cried with pain and joy, the emotional anguish from feeling my shaft in her married pussy contrasting with the obvious pleasure she was getting. </p><p>“How do you feel, roomie. Is it worth making yourself wait for years to finally have a taste,” I asked even as I lowered, even more, my lips just inches away from hers? </p><p>“You-” she tried to say, but I chose that moment to kiss her. It wasn’t a soft kiss. No, it was a merciless assault that tried to convey the struggle I felt staying away from her, just because she got the cold feet. My tongue invaded her mouth mercilessly. She tried to stay passive, but her body still remembered the way we kissed, and the more the pleasure built, the harder for her to reject the call. Soon, her tongue joined, slow and hesitant… </p><p>“Why are you doing this?” she gasped after I pulled away from the kiss, but her moans contrasted with her anger. </p><p>I put my finger to her lips, silencing her. \"Shush, be quiet, and stop pretending. You know this, I love you, enough to ruin my life, and you clearly still do as well. I’m going to make you mine, whatever the cost.\"</p><p>\"No,\" she whimpered, but her body disagreed with her if the way she was pushing against my hips were any indicator. Her pussy was more honest than her lips, welcoming my hardness and coating my cock with her affectionate arousal, traitorously helping me to penetrate even deeper.</p><p>Her words disappeared, replaced by moans and gasps as my cock visited her unchartered depths, teaching her the true meaning of sex. I could have pushed even harder, of course, but I didn’t want to hurt her, I just wanted to teach her what she had been denying herself. We were going to have a lot of opportunities to really explore the possibilities, after all… </p><p>\"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,\" Eleanor moaned in concert as the towels under her shift. She tried to avoid my gaze, but I grabbed her chin and kept her from moving. </p><p>“Look at me!” I ordered even as I devoured the sight of her beautiful eyes, desperation, and arousal battling… \"Look at me when I'm fucking you!\"</p><p>She followed my order, keeping our eyes connected. </p><p>“Excellent, now cum for me!” </p><p>“No,” she immediately replied, like it was something under her control. I could already feel her wetness intensifying, accompanied by her tightening. </p><p>“Cum for me!” I repeated, and chose that moment for another kiss. This one was pure primal instinct, no complicated techniques, no plays of domination, just a primal kiss to convey the sense of loss I had felt. Her determination not to climax disappeared in an instant, and she started shuddering under me. </p><p>After dreaming of this moment for four years, it was simply too much for me to reject. I pushed deeper into her, and soon, I exploded into her, filling her to the brim. I knew that she was on the pill, but even if she wasn’t, it wouldn’t have stopped me, not after waiting for four years. </p><p>“No… no…” she murmured, but with her body rocking with orgasm, it didn’t really help. I pulled out after one last lingering kiss, and walked back to shower. </p><p>“Do you want to join me,” I offered, only to receive a frustrated growl. She grabbed her bathrobe and dashed away, leaving me alone in the bathroom. The fact that she left it with my seed seeping down her legs made the moment even sexier. </p><p>I chose to say nothing as she left… There was no harm for her to process it for a while. We would have many opportunities to discuss it, after all…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching my ex-girlfriend Eleanor shuffle uneasily under my dark gaze was amusing. I wanted to share a smug smile, or even stand up in front of her and enjoy the way I towered over her, but I kept myself back due to her husband’s presence. Unlike my ex, Devon was looking at me with hopeful eyes, unaware of my ex’s discomfort, waiting for my decision. </p><p>“It seems okay, Devon. The room is beautiful, and it’ll make sense for me to give that rather than getting a studio in the city, but what if you change your mind?” I asked, acting like I didn’t know he had been asking more money from me than the room justified. </p><p>“We can sign a lease agreement, no problem!” Devon jumped while Eleanor shuffled in the background, holding herself back, not saying anything. Why should she, when she was the one that spent their life savings on her shopping addiction, forcing them to get a roommate. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, just tell your lawyer to send me a draft and I’ll let my lawyer go over it. When Devon looked hesitant at the mention of a lawyer, I continued. “Or if you prefer, I can ask my lawyer to prepare one and yours can go over,” I added. “As soon as you sign, I’ll transfer a year’s rent in advance.” Devon’s eyes brightened. </p><p>I knew his type. He believed himself smart enough to understand a legal document, therefore wouldn’t waste money to retain a lawyer.  And since I was his wife’s ‘friend’, there wouldn’t be a problem in the first place. “Of course,” he said. “Do you need any help carrying your stuff?” </p><p>It took a great effort not to give a pointed look at his thin arms and gesture him with my thick, muscular one, but from the way Eleanor gazed at me angrily, she understood my temptation and held herself back. While walking toward my car, I sent a message to my lawyer friend to send the contract we had prepared, the contract that was filled with loopholes and deadly traps, all designed carefully for my benefit. </p><p>After all, to make my dear ex payback for all the years of yearning, not to mention almost ruining my life, I needed leverage. </p><p>As I returned, carrying my boxes, I could see Eleanor and her husband arguing in hushed whispers. I stayed in the corner, listening to their argument. “At least let’s get a lawyer,” she begged in a tone she had probably assumed that I couldn’t hear. </p><p>“We are not in a position to waste any money,” Devon answered. “Even charging him double of what we could get somewhere else, after paying Big Mike, we barely have enough to make this month’s mortgage payment. We can’t afford a lawyer. And he’s your childhood friend, it’s not like he’s going to do anything to harm you.” </p><p>From their discussion, it was clear that Eleanor was yet to reveal our true past. She stilled for a moment, conflict clear in her face. For a moment, I was afraid that she would reveal what had happened between us years ago, which would undoubtedly cause Devon to break the deal and chase me away from his home with great haste. “You’re right,” Eleanor murmured in the end, making me sigh in relief, though not much of a surprise. Eleanor was not famous for her strong personality. </p><p>Still, I was happy. All my hard work setting things up didn’t go to waste. I made a note to send a gift to Big Mike. He might be a loan shark, but he really worked wonders when it came to helping a friend… </p><p>“Of course I’m right,” Devon said smugly. “I didn’t go to Princeton for nothing, you know,” he added smugly, ignoring the fact that he only got a useless degree in Art History, which had rather limited earning potential in the market. </p><p>With that, I moved downstairs, then climbed the stairs once again, this time with stiff and thundering steps, enough to make them aware of my presence. “Hey, bro,” said Devon even as he held a printout of the contract. “I have read the contract, and I have a couple of concerns,” he said, pointing at the contract. </p><p>“Let me look,” I said, and a perfunctory glance showed that he managed to miss the dangerous parts of the contract —which was buried deep in legalese— and instead circled a couple of meaningless red herrings my lawyer put there just to make him feel clever. “I don’t know,” I said, looking confused, which made Devon smile. He was three inches shorter than me, and missing about fifty pounds of muscle as well, so my stupid act gave him the reason to feel superior. I let him feel so. </p><p>“These are my concerns, and they are very important,” he said. </p><p>I frowned for a moment, then smiled wide, the way I liked to do whenever I met with business partners who thought that they were smarter than me, perfectly curated to reinforce their view. There was nothing I liked more than an overconfident opponent. “Why don’t you go to my lawyer’s office, he’s smart enough to know what to do. He’ll make the changes, and he’s authorized to make the payment as well, so you can go to the bank together and get the money,” I explained. </p><p>“Excellent,” Devon said, then turned to Eleanor. “Honey, why don’t you help our new guest get settled while I go and handle business,” he said, and then turned and left, leaving me alone with my ex-girlfriend. </p><p>With my very sexy ex, whose hotness peeked through the conservative clothes she had been wearing today. How couldn’t it, with her beautiful face framed by her red hair, her brilliant emerald eyes, and a face beautiful enough to be a model… Her body was concealed behind her loose clothes, but even without seeing, I could visualize her thin waist, her perky breasts, and her tight bottom, followed by her perfect legs. </p><p>Overall, she was the perfect specimen of femininity. </p><p>She shuffled in her place, clearly unhappy with my hungry gaze, but I didn’t even bother to hide it. After all, I never hid my attraction to her, even after she stabbed my heart and betraying me, ruining my chances of getting a decent life as she deserted me. Until I rose from the ashes doing stuff not exactly legal, of course.  </p><p>“Nathan,” she murmured, stumbling on her words, no doubt not expecting me to be that obvious. But she lacked the courage to confront me directly, just like the day she left me behind in the holding cell without a word. She said nothing else, but turned and left, leaving me to watch her ass swaying away. </p><p>I chuckled. If she thought that just turning away would save her from my attention, she was mistaken. I was here to make her mine, and I wouldn’t stop without succeeding. </p><p>///////////////</p><p>The rest of the day passed in a blur. Eleanor did her best to avoid my attention, while I stayed in my room, setting up my personal belongings. I stayed in there, no matter how much I wanted to go upstairs and teach Eleanor the error of her ways when she abandoned me four years ago. </p><p>When I received the message from my lawyer, telling me that her idiotic husband had signed the contract, I smirked darkly and left the room. Four years ago, I trusted her to be true to her word and stay with me, even risking everything to take blame for her idiotic mistake, only to stabbed in the back.</p><p>This time, things were different. If she didn’t want to be loved, then she would be owned. And I finally had the power to do so, thanks to the idiotic contract her husband had signed, unwittingly putting their house equity as collateral for the money I had given them. The fact that they were responsible for paying the double if they tried to kick me out was just the topping on the cake. </p><p>Now, I was going to see whether Eleanor was as willing to escape if doing so would lock her in an impossible debt. </p><p>I chose to wear loose basketball shorts and nothing else as I left my room, putting my muscular body on display. The moment I left, I saw Eleanor in the kitchen, preparing dinner. She was still wearing her boring loose clothes, but that failed to hide her attractive frame. Her perfectly measure body, tight, flat stomach, nicely curved buttocks, and full breasts were still discernible under her clothes. </p><p>Or I simply had an active imagination. </p><p>Still, I knew I was right. Eleanor was twenty-four, but she made sure to pay attention to her figure through daily strenuous exercise, making her beautiful enough to be a model if it wasn’t for her aversion to risk. She was wasted on a pathetic man-child like Devon. </p><p>As I undressed her with my dark eyes, my cock twitched wildly, imagining finally fucking her until she forgot all other names but mine. It was the dream that pushed me for the last four years, and it was so close to reality. </p><p>It was a dream of revenge, and reunion at the same time. </p><p>“Hi, beautiful,” I said as I stepped into the kitchen. She flinched at my words, only to be replaced by a blush when she noticed my naked torso, and my shorts with an obvious bulge. </p><p>“N-Nathan,” she stammered. “Is everything okay? Are you having trouble with the dryer?” </p><p>“No,” I answered with a smug smile. “Why?” </p><p>“Your … clothes,” she murmured, pointing at my naked torso as she blushed. </p><p>“I don’t like shirts, after putting all that effort working out,” I answered. “It’s okay, right? After all, you’re an old friend, married even, and nothing else.” </p><p>I didn’t put any infliction to my tone, but throwing her words from four years ago made her flinch. “R-right…” she stammered. </p><p>“Do you need any help?” I asked, but barged in, ignoring the desperate shaking of her head. I grabbed a chef’s knife. “I’m starting with the peppers and onions,” I said, then chuckled. “I remember how much you hate onions.” </p><p>“Right…” she murmured, trying to look anywhere but my face. Several minutes passed in silence, before she asked. “How are your studies?” </p><p>“As well as you can except in a community college you can enter with a criminal record,” I said, and she flinched. I continued. “But I’m not taking any classes this semester,” I explained. </p><p>“Why?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m doing some online part-time work, it’s making me a lot of money,” I answered. “Isn’t it great? We’re going to spend so much time together.” </p><p>Eleanor didn’t seem as stoked with the idea, but she also didn’t feel brave enough to point at the overwhelming elephant in the room, so I enjoyed our forced closeness. Whenever I turned my back, I sneaked a glance at her through her reflection on the window, and caught her eyes examining my back muscles every single time. </p><p>When I passed the container that held all the peppers, I made sure our fingers touched. She flinched. “Careful,” I said, my smirking making her blush even more. </p><p>“I’m not used to working together with someone in the kitchen, why don’t you and watch TV,” Eleanor said in a rare display of courage, pushing through her usual passivity. She must be really rattled to say something like that. </p><p>“As you wish, roomie,” I answered and moved to the living room. However, her fascination with my muscles gave me a better idea. I opened the TV, but rather than sitting on the couch, I started doing a complicated push-up routine: one-armed, cross, even clap push-ups, making sure I caught her attention. </p><p>Once again, I watched her from the reflection, this time from the small window of the TV unit, and her gaze started to get stuck more and more on my sweaty frame, her expression getting more and more confused, accompanied by a blush. “Nathan, wouldn’t you like to do that in your room?” she asked at one point. </p><p>“Not enough room,” I simply answered and continued my exercise routine. It was at that point Devon had arrived.</p><p>“Hi Nathan, how are you?” he asked. </p><p>“Not bad, killing time,” I answered between my labored breaths, not even bothering to look at him. </p><p>“Well, you can always borrow a book from my library if you enjoy Russian Literature,” not even bothering to hide the mocking edge in his tone, so sure that I too daft to catch it. I didn’t even get angry. Why would I, when I already took my revenge, a revenge that would show itself soon if Eleanor’s aroused expression, mixed with confusion, was any indicator? </p><p>“Honey, there’s still an hour until dinner. Do you mind helping me with something upstairs,” she said, and before Devon could even understand her point, she grabbed his arm and dragged him upstairs. Normally, such a thing would leave me burning with jealousy, but with the little surprise I left with the assistance of my lawyer, I only felt amusement. </p><p>Five minutes later, I silently climbed upstairs and neared their bedroom, only to catch a part of their discussion. “Still nothing?” Eleanor asked, desperate. </p><p>“No. I’m just not feeling it today,” Devon answered, proving that the little pill my lawyer slipped to him to kill his libido for a foreseeable future worked excellently. It was something extremely illegal, of course, but not exactly hard to find for me, or for my lawyer who made a career working with mafia. Now, all it needed was to see how he would handle his little guy not working.  </p><p>As they continued the fight, and I carefully sneaked toward their door and leaned to get a peek through the keyhole. Eleanor was wearing a boring teddy, a white, completely opaque, and ridiculously little cleavage, but with her red mane free on her shoulders, and her face burning with a mixture of desire and frustration, she was the sexiest woman alive despite her hideous clothes. </p><p>Devon was sitting in the bed, covers pulled to his chest protectively, like he was trying to hide from the shame of his inadequate manhood. They continued arguing, getting more and more heated as Devon lashed out. And for once, frustrated by her arousal, Eleanor didn’t just pull back passively. Realizing the fight was reaching its epicenter, I pulled back. </p><p>“But-” Eleanor tried to say after a particularly scorching remark, but Devon cut her off. </p><p>“Maybe you should try to wear something interesting for once, it’s getting boring,” Devon lashed out with insecurity, proving that he was going to handle that the worst way possible, by lashing out and blaming his partner. His very sexy, but also very vulnerable, partner. Eleanor gasped in shock, and Devon continued. “I’m going to take a nap.” </p><p>“Be that way,” Eleanor gasped, and I carefully hid in the corner of the stairs. A minute later, Eleanor left the room, wearing only a short bathrobe that put her delicious legs to display, her hips dancing sexily with each step that brought her far away, until she reached the end of the corridor and stepped into the bathroom, locking the door behind herself two times. </p><p>It was time to put the first phase of my plan into action. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Looking at the quivering blonde beauty that lay in front of me, still covered in my cum, my instincts started to boil up to the surface. Any reasonable person would have said that I had pushed my poor hand of the card as much as possible, and I needed to take my meager winnings and leave… </p><p>It was very hard to do when the princess of the biggest Empire of the world lay in front of me, completely naked, gasping and wheezing as she begged for me to make her cum. How could a wolf resist the delicious temptation of a lamb, even if he had to risk the shepherd's arrival? </p><p>I needed to have her. The only question was the way I took. For a moment, I was tempted to just push inside mercilessly, dominating her, and considering her personality, it would work. However, as much as that idea sounded nice, having Aria begging me helplessly for my cock was even more delicious. Not to mention, it would be more helpful in future manipulations if she thought that she was responsible for the final decision. </p><p>“So, you want to cum,” I whispered even as I cast a spell, telekinetically summoning a wet cloth, using it to gently clean her face. </p><p>She trembled under my gentle touch —not to mention the softness of the cloth, silk and velvet, probably more expensive than the yearly income of a low-class family— as I slowly rubbed her face, cleaning my cum from her face. She needed to be delicious enough to lick for the next step. “Y-yes,” she stammered. “Please.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I dipped down to her chest, cleaning her bountiful bosom, which was heaving in anticipation under my touch. She closed her eyes to enjoy the sensation, which was a mistake as I used the opportunity to get rid of my pants without alerting her. So, when I finished cleaning her chest and leaned down over her, taking the top role, she failed to understand the consequences until my shaft pressed against her entrance. </p><p>“We - we can’t!” she stammered in shock, but with my arms pressing on the bed on both sides of her, she made no move of pulling back. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s not going in, it’s just going to rub on the surface. It doesn’t count,” I whispered, followed by a gentle kiss to her neck which made her shiver helplessly. I needed to be careful, however, as she was already very close to the edge, her sensitive body ready to explode in my first mistake. But that only made my job more delicious, like trying to play a masterfully crafted musical instrument. </p><p>She was stiff as a board at first, but she slowly weakened as my hot breath teased her neck. Still, she weakly protested, “This is wrong.”</p><p>I didn’t say for a moment as I brought my lips to her ear with agonizing slowness. “So, you don’t want to cum,” I whispered, of which she replied with a delicious whimper. I dragged a finger down her arm, until my fingers arrived at her hand, grabbing it tenderly. Without waiting for her answer, I started moving slowly, my shaft rubbing against her entrance, slowly being coated by her juices as she gushed out. </p><p>Then, I leaned down, capturing her lips in a soft, lingering kiss, one that could be easily mistaken for a husband’s first kiss to her gentle wife as they started their life together. However, if the enthusiasm of her tongue was any indicator, Aria didn’t seem to mind too much that it was me in her bedroom, dangerously close to defile her as we shared a very intimate hug instead of Lancelot. Her enthusiasm burned brighter as the time passed, arousal dominating fear. </p><p>I chose to push forward at that exact moment, and slipped the crown of my shaft inside her, enjoying the tight and warm grasp of her entrance in the beginning. She tried to push me away panickedly, which was actually not a good move on her part as she almost made me deflower her accidentally. “T-that’s - too much,” she managed to stammer when I pulled back from the kiss momentarily. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Princess. It’s just the tip, it doesn’t count,” I said confidently, in a matter-of-fact tone, like it was a completely normal thing to happen. And since I had no sense of shame, I continued while making eye contact. “Do you trust me?” </p><p>“I do,” she answered, though I could feel the answer was more about her inability to handle confrontations than her honest feelings, though the fact that she was yet to have some time to process what had happened inevitably played a role as well, not to mention her raging arousal, dancing on the edge, impairing her decision-making process even more. Under the rush of pleasure, her already weak resolve melted away as our lips connected once more. Our tongues danced as she slowly forgot the exact circumstances and the unique danger they represented, losing herself in pleasure in anticipation of a big explosion. </p><p>Not for long, however, as she soon realized that her arousal was yet to arrive despite the intimacy of the situation. When I pulled back, there was a question mark in her eyes, though her blush signaled that even under the circumstances, she was unable to just ask the question. </p><p>“It’s hard without full penetration,” I explained, which was bullshit considering the number of times I made her cum just by my touch, but she was not in a position to argue against it successfully. “Maybe it’ll help if you move your hips in the same rhythm. It’ll enhance your pleasure.” </p><p>I stayed just enough to catch her blue eyes shining in shock and enthusiasm before leaning for another kiss, while her hips started to follow the rhythm of mine, trying to increase friction without it reaching a ‘dangerous’ point, the crown of my shaft dallying around her entrance but not finalizing the task. Minutes passed, and her arousal rose further, but never enough to actually push her over the edge. She even tried to push her hips further, but I was careful to follow her rhythm to prevent her from taking more of my length. </p><p>It must have bothered her as well, because when I pulled back for a quick break, frustration was the clear emotion on her face. “Can you go a bit … deeper,” she whispered. “Not deep enough to actually …” she added, only to came to a sudden stop, a stricken expression replacing her earlier frustration as she realized what she was asking me to do. </p><p>“Your wishes my command, Princess,” I said as I pushed a bit deeper, just enough to tickle the barrier that signaled her identity as a virgin, though at this point, it was more of a technicality than an actual fact. Her intention to take back her earlier statement was obvious, but under a renewed rush of pleasure, she failed to do so, her moans taking control. Her blue eyes begged for mercy, but ignoring that was trivial. </p><p>I still stayed in the missionary position as I dipped my head down once more, catching her lips in another searing kiss, letting time pass by. Under the renewed rush of pleasure, it didn’t take long for her hesitancy to melt away, leaving back desire. The smell of her arousal filled the room more and more, begging me to take the last step, a call I rejected. I wanted her to do that particular mistake. Also</p><p>Also, I was curious just how long she would be able to survive under my attention. </p><p>“I need-” she started when I pulled back from another kiss, but it instantly faded into another cry when I leaned down to bite a previously-discovered sensitive spot on her neck, making her shiver. Just inches away from a climax, she was unable to even speak, which didn’t improve as my lips moved lower to her delicious bosom, and my tongue flickering on her freshly cleaned nipples. </p><p>I took it as an opportunity to turn on the intensity. With her inexperience, it was a hopeless battle, her surrender foregone. It was just a question of when. “What do you need?” I asked moments later, not bothering to hide my mocking edge. </p><p>“I need to cum!” she shouted, surprising me with her reaction, even though it was mostly about the frustration she was feeling. </p><p>“Do you want me to go deeper, despite the risk?” I asked, which was enough to silence her. I smirked like I had just got an idea. “You know what, why don’t you wrap your legs around my waist and pull me deeper, so that we don’t have an accident?” </p><p>That was a terrible idea. “That’s a good idea,” she stammered, the extended state of frustration as she stayed on the edge making it hard for her to think clearly. Her plump legs curled around my waist, slowly pulling me deeper inside her, until the crown finally pushed against her barrier. She stopped, and I pulled back, only to repeat it again. </p><p>“See, it works perfectly,” I said before I returned my task of leaving a fresh set of bite marks on her beautiful tits while my fingers found her plump ass, enjoying the texture. “You just need to be careful.” </p><p>Of course, that was easier said than done. She was already half-drunk with pleasure, and the temptation to feel more must be overwhelming. More importantly, before yesterday, her experience with the opposite sex was practically nonexistent, only to get an overwhelming lesson in the last few hours. As a side effect, she was like a gambler who had just won the biggest pot of her life, distracted, confused, and most importantly, yearning for even more. </p><p>Not the best mood for decision-making, or maintaining the delicate balance in the game I had constructed. </p><p>I went back and forth repeatedly under the guidance of her legs, but with each repeat, I was moving just a bit deeper. At first, I was pushing against her barrier gently, then it started to stretch a bit under my pressure, said pressure increasing further with each repeat. I looked at her questioningly, only to find her eyes firmly shut as she tried to process the pleasure to push over the edge, only to fail spectacularly. </p><p>A mistake was inevitable, though it came even sooner than I expected. She was gently leading me deeper once more when I chose that exact moment to bite her nipple hard, which made her twitch, accidentally pulling me far too deep, turning her status from virgin to ex-virgin. </p><p>“No-” she gasped, which immediately turned into a moan as I used the opportunity to slide halfway in, and while she tried to say something else, I pulled back, only to impale her again, and she started trembling, finally pushing over the edge. She bit her lips to contain her moans, shivering helplessly, while I stayed in her, enjoying her snug warmth. “It can’t be, no,” she gasped once aftershocks were subsided. </p><p>“Come on, sweetheart, nothing to worry about,” I whispered into her ear after gently kissing her cheek. “You’re the most prominent healer of the Empire, you can easily fix it later.” </p><p>“But, it doesn’t count.” </p><p>“Of course it does, what we are doing is just practice, and you’re doing it to be better,” I whispered temptingly, this time her shivers not directly related to the pleasure she was feeling. </p><p>“We need to stop,” she replied as she put her hands on my chest, like she wanted to push me away, though she neglected applying any of her strength. </p><p>“Do we?” I added, just like a demon trying to mislead a saint. Though, considering the circumstances, it wasn’t too different from the actual situation. She was really a saint with her selfless healing, and I certainly had the qualifications to be a demon. “After all, it’s already done. What’s the harm of practicing a bit more, so you’re really prepared for your wedding night?” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she murmured, but her desire was clear. Moreover, as I started slowly moving inside her, forcing deeper into her tight grasp, her expression slid further and further toward a surprising ecstasy, with just a bit of discomfort as she tried to accommodate my girth. “It’s just training, right?” she asked, though she avoided my gaze as she did so, signaling she was aware just how paper-thin the excuse was. </p><p>“Of course, just training,” I said even as I moved deeper into her, while once again sealing her lips with a kiss. Surprisingly, her legs wrapped around my waist once more as I started pumping, showing just how amped-up she was after such a long teasing period. Each repeat pushed my presence deeper into her core, earning a louder moan in return, finally breaking my lips’ ability to contain them. Luckily, her room was covered with silencing wards to maintain total privacy. </p><p>It wasn’t the most exciting position I had ever experienced, but there was something special watching the way her expression changed under my care as she learned the true meaning of womanhood for the first time, arousal mixed with wonder, with a permanent undertone of shocked shyness. It was simply delicious. </p><p>Her lips opened for a cry that threatened to break through the sound resistance of the room, and I grabbed them with another domineering kiss, using the benefits of the position to the limit. Her cry vibrated in my mouth, tempting me to impale her even harder, which in turn made her moan even louder, in a divine example of positive feedback. Unused to the pleasures of the flesh, it didn’t take long before she started climbing toward another orgasm. </p><p>“Faster,” she moaned even as her legs tightened around me, surprising me even more. I stared at her face, her eyes closed but her trembling lips speaking volumes. I leaned forward and kissed her as a lover should, but even as our tongues danced, my hips picked up speed, pushing harder and deeper. “Yes, just like that,” she moaned, which was a sentiment I agreed. It was a delicious moment of connection to treasure. “Deeper, Byron, deeper,” she gasped. </p><p>For a moment, I had to suppress my laughter, as I imagined Lancelot’s expression if he heard his dear fiancee begging for me to fuck her deeper, her shyness finally lost under a rush of pleasure. To be fair, it was his own fault for leaving such a treasure leaving untouched even as they adventured together for months. I obliged Aria’s request, pumping in and out faster and faster, exploring her untouched depths, each repeat with a new discovery. Her moans got louder and louder, her faced blossoming into a radiant red. Her eyes never opened as she seemed to allow her body to just relax and enjoy the crests of pleasure I was bringing her. </p><p>When she finally tightened around me, signaling her climax, I was far too gone as well. Luckily, her legs were still around my waist, giving me an excuse why I didn’t bother pulling back as I exploded in her, staining her untouched depths for the first time. She just moaned, missing the significance of my ejaculation as I enjoyed the development of the explosion. </p><p>I pulled out of the kiss, staring at her beautiful face as she climaxed, her eyelids fluttering helplessly. At this moment, I could understand why some people spent their whole life learning to paint, or play a certain musical instrument. Creating a masterpiece was worth it. </p><p>Aria was definitely a masterpiece, with her beautiful blonde hair, her fluttering eyelids, and flawless face contorted with pleasure… </p><p>“Have nice sleep,” I whispered to her as I slid out of the bed, leaving one last lingering kiss on her cheek. As much as I wanted to stay next to her, I had already pushed my luck sufficiently, and I needed to return to my cell, just in case someone else decided by. </p><p>The only question, what should I do tonight?</p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t resist as Astrid pushed me toward the middle of the pool, not when she immediately took a position behind me, her hands on my shoulders, rubbing gently. Though, that wasn’t half as interesting as her hefty breasts pushing against my back, creating a heavenly sensation. “Mmm,” I murmured. “Not a bad start.” </p><p>Then, Lillian dived a bit deeper, and I felt a pair of hands around my crotch, one wrapped around my shaft, going up and down, the other gently massaging my balls. “How about this,” Lillian murmured. </p><p>“Nothing to complain,” I answered as I enjoyed the exquisite treatment of her hands, combined with the gentle caress of the warm water. “I have everything I want right here.” </p><p>“Really,” Astrid whispered to my ear before kissing my neck gently. “Everything?” she added even as her hands traveled lower, her body pushing even tighter against mine, until a second hand wrapped around my shaft, doubling the pleasure, her other arm staying wrapped around my waist to pull herself tight. Her body moved up and down just like her hand did, providing an unusual —but very enjoyable— massage to my back. </p><p>Things got even more heated when Lillian leaned for a kiss, but not for my lips. Instead, she met with Astrid, whose head was peeking above my shoulder. So, I watched a delicious make out session of a pair of divine examples of sexiness, one redhead and one blonde, from a very closed range, all the while their hands continued to caress my most sensitive location. </p><p>I knew it was their show, and I wasn’t supposed to touch them, but combined with the previous show, I was getting impatient. Combined with my limited ability to deny my baser instincts —anger and lust in particular— denying such a beautiful siren call, even for the promises of an even more spectacular explosion later on, was not possible. Not after I had already stretched myself to the limit just as I watched their amazing show. I leaned, pressing my lips on Lillian’s neck, while my right hand sneaked to her tits, once again enjoying their firmness. Meanwhile, my left hand trailed down her sides, enjoying her smooth curves. </p><p>“Impatient,” Lillian murmured as she broke the kiss with Astrid, only to replace her lips with mine, Astrid’s taste still present on her lips. Her hands quickened, enhancing the pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>“Very impatient,” Astrid whispered, agreeing with Lillian’s statement. She started kissing my neck and shoulders while her impressive tits still pressed against my back, making me enjoy her presence even more. Then, Lillian pulled back, while Astrid grabbed my hair and forced me to turn a bit, and took the position against my lips. I was expecting Lillian to take Astrid’s role, but she surprised me by diving underwater, and I felt her lips around my shaft, selflessly giving me an underwater blowjob. </p><p>The next several minutes passed in a delicious cacophony, as the girls alternated positions whenever I was getting used to their approach, keeping it fresh. I was impressed. They were definitely showing the benefits of all the risks I took saving them, kissing, licking, snuggling, and biting, all awakening great pleasure. </p><p>When it was Astrid’s turn once more for the kiss, she clamped around my lips, her arms draped around my neck while Lillian once again busied herself underwater with great results. I decided to reward the girls for their effort, not to be selfish, and brought my hands between their legs, one for each girl. A pair of shocked moans rose the moment I twisted my fingers, proving I wasn’t the only one feeling stretched trying to suppress the pleasure. </p><p>At first, Astrid was able to maintain the kiss, interrupted by the occasional moans, but soon, the pleasure became too much, forcing her to separate. I chose to focus on Lillian’s exquisite nipples, teasing their sensitiveness through uneven brushes of my tongue. </p><p>\"Yes!\" they shouted simultaneously as they enjoyed the treatment. </p><p>Still, Lillian didn’t stay over water for too long, and soon dropped below the surface, an evil smile twisting her lips. She knelt down underwater as she ran her tongue up and down my shaft. Honestly, at that point, it was hard not to cum. I only held because my instincts warning me that cumming first under the circumstances would signify defeat, which was not acceptable. And Astrid’s delicious moans, echoing in the bath, didn’t help any. </p><p>It was Astrid that surrendered first, exploding without a warning, her warmth distinct even among the warm bathwater. She staggered back, leaning against the edge as she sucked gulps of air, trying to stay conscious after the explosion. I put my hands under Lillian’s armpits and pulled her on the surface. “You’re alone, now,” I said with a smirk, nodding toward Astrid with a negligent gesture. </p><p>“Such a pity,” Lillian answered. “But I’m sure that even alone-” she tried to posture, but I easily threw her toward Astrid, following after her immediately. I spent a second enjoying the view. Astrid was leaning against the marble wall of the bath, facing toward us, when Lillian collided with her chest first. Lillian’s back was toward me, while her tits pressing against Astrid’s, creating the most delicious sandwich ever. </p><p>Teasing time was over. It was time for the main course. </p><p>Lillian gasped in anticipation as she felt my body pressing against hers, her moans rising even before I slid into her tight tunnel. The swollen head of my erection, throbbing with desire, disappeared first in her needy hole, slowly followed by the rest of my shaft. </p><p>“Aaagh!” she moaned as her willing and waiting tightness stretched around my throbbing, enthusiastic presence. Her cry of enthusiasm was short-lived as Astrid’s lips silenced her immediately with another vigorous kiss, her anticipation clear. </p><p>“Damn, girl. You’re even tighter,” I murmured as my shaft slowly disappeared inside her despite my size. It was the second time I was enjoying her depths, so it felt different, but definitely not in a bad way. The way she grabbed around me was exquisite, making my heart beat faster in anticipation. As more of my shaft disappeared inside her, her moans rose, stretching Astrid’s capabilities to contain her voice. Luckily, we were in the middle of the wilderness, protected by layers of wards, so there was no problem Lillian moaning until her vocal cords were bruised. </p><p>However, as I ravaged her, I could once again feel a connection forming, like the first time we spend together. My magic flowed in a weird pattern that I barely recognized, following my instincts, wrapping around her magic, melting into hers. Unlike the last time, where it flowed like an uncontrollable flood, this time it was a controllable river, though like trying to hold back a river, trying to hold it back would have caused some discomfort. </p><p>Once again, my magic wrapped around hers, giving me an intimate sense of her own magic. Unlike the last time, I could feel traces of my own power in her flow, the courtesy of the previous time. I examined them carefully, afraid that it might hurt her, but a careful investigation showed that unless I wanted to activate them maliciously, they would not harm her. On the contrary, they would help her development significantly. </p><p>What an interesting development. </p><p>Lillian was unaware of the target of my focus. “Yes, impale me harder!” she shouted, uncaring of the disgrace, making me wonder how her noble father would have reacted if he knew that his precious daughter had been lovingly suffering under a bastard’s cock, ignoring the decorum of her position, bringing shame to her role as an heiress. Pity I wouldn’t know that. Still, it wasn’t exactly a deal-breaker as I pushed my shaft deeper and deeper inside her, forcing her to stretch to the limit. Lillian’s moans took a pained edge, huffing and puffing as she tried to resist the invasion, but her ass pushed back enthusiastically still. </p><p>She cried with pleasure as I grabbed her hair, pulling hard. “I’m about to move,” I warned her as I pulled back, only to slam back immediately, forcing the air of her lungs. Her eyes widened, her mouth hung open, and her cries echoed on the pristine marble walls of the bath. I pushed forward mercilessly, gyrating my dick inside her, teasing her from a different angle with every repeat. Soon, she lost herself in a string of repetitive cries.</p><p>Astrid watched us, her mouth parted open. “Be careful, you’re going to ruin her,” she warned with a giggle, unable to hide her fascination as her hands danced over Lillian’s body, occasionally roaming on mine. “But I’m surprised that she can take your monster as easily in her second time. I’m impressed.” </p><p>“Well, you weren’t any worse,” I reminded her. After all, just several days ago I had helped her graduate to the ranks of womanhood, and she had shown an exemplar performance. </p><p>“True, but I grew up in the wilds, and hardship was something we’re used to. Not so much for this little blonde thing,” Astrid said mockingly, though, from her tone, I could sense that she was saying those words with no ulterior aim. It was just old fashioned ribbing. The girls had really become good friends during this period. Of course, Lillian didn’t even react to her words, too busy gasping and moaning as she steadily climbed toward an orgasm. </p><p>I decided to mess with her a bit in Lillian’s stead. “Well, if it’s such a hardship, maybe I should skip you,” I offered with a smirk. </p><p>“No!” she shouted immediately, though mollified a bit when I laughed. “Asshole,” she murmured. I was tempted to say anything else, but Lillian chose that exact moment to explode into deafening cries, signaling her climax. “My turn!” Astrid exclaimed enthusiastically. </p><p>“As you wish, sweetie,” I said, but instead of pulling immediately, I made sure to analyze Lillian’s magic to make sure there were no side effects, and while doing so, added some more magic to her. Only then I helped Astrid to push Lillian on the edge of the bath, and she lay down, gasping hard, trying to catch her breath. Before Astrid could move, I already moved in front of her, my arms on her both sides, locking her in place. Her eyes widened, but before she could act, I pushed forward, pushing inside. After the extended foreplay, and the amazing show she had just watched, my shaft slipped in easily, though it was still a very snug fit. </p><p>“Damn,” Astrid moaned. “I missed this.” </p><p>“Then let’s load you up so that you don’t miss me too much in my journey,” I whispered into her ear even as I pushed forward, ravaging her insides. </p><p>“You’re going away?” Astrid cried, though I wasn’t sure whether my words or the invasion of my shaft made her cry loudly. </p><p>“For a few days, at least,” I explained even as I brought my hands to her hips, pulling her closer, giving a true taste of my invasion. Under my assault, Astrid staggered for a moment, her words disappearing under the assault of a fresh wave of joy. </p><p>However, Astrid impressed me by shaking it off. “You can’t. This mountain is far too dangerous to explore.” </p><p>“Sorry, sweetie,” I said, even kissing her for a fleeting moment. “We’re facing against an enemy of unknown size. We can’t just sit and ignore such an important possible advantage. I know it’s risky, but apparently, they somehow managed to build a city here. Every secret I grasp, however small, will give us a significant advantage later on.” </p><p>Astrid looked at me rebelliously for a moment, no doubt trying to come up with ways to prevent me from doing so. If it was for something else, I would have punished her severely for her disrespect, but knowing she was worried for my safety, I decided to cut her some slack. Instead, I quickened my pace, turning my already-impressive shaft into a weapon of destruction, each push extracting a louder cry. Soon, her worries melted away in a rush of pleasure, and her thoughts evaporated, leaving only passion behind. </p><p>I wondered whether I could replicate the same trick with Astrid. I called my magic in the same pattern, wrapping around Astrid’s core. The sensation was different. Unlike Lillian’s magic, Astrid’s didn’t lash out immediately, trying to coax more of my magic to flow. However, it didn’t surprise me. I was expecting that, since neither Astrid’s first time with me, nor the time after my Ascension, had created such a result. </p><p>I suspected it was about Lillian’s bloodline. Maybe it was resonating with the source of my power, the Dragon’s Heart. After all, there needed to be a reason why they kidnapped her, and why their kidnappers had such a rare treasure with them. Lillian’s power being somehow interacting with it explained quite a bit, especially with that mysterious captain’s insistence about leaving Lillian untouched. It was by no means a definitive conclusion, but it was far better than anything else I had. </p><p>Astrid moaned repeatedly, enjoying the sensation of being filled to the brim while I leaned down, biting her bountiful tits. Leaving my red mark on her pale tits was definitely enjoyable. </p><p>Even as I played her body like an instrument, I focused on my magic, trying to recreate the effect with Lillian’s magic. It wasn’t simple, but after several repeats, I managed to attain elementary success. Our magic mixed together, leaving small scraps of it in her magic flow. However, since Astrid’s magic was far less developed compared to Lillian’s, the relative effect of it was even bigger. Even without any additional support, I didn’t doubt that after a week of careful meditation, Astrid could double her strength. </p><p>What a convenient ability. </p><p>Soon, Astrid exploded in cries as well, which was no less loud than Lillian’s earlier tone. As she hugged me and shuddered, trying to keep herself upright, I made eye contact with Lillian, who had recovered in the meanwhile, and was watching us with steamy eyes, her fingers disappearing repeatedly between her legs. “You’re attending yourself. Be careful, or I might feel inadequate.” </p><p>“Then come and attend my needs,” Lillian moaned as she lay on her back, her legs parted invitingly. </p><p>“How can I turn down your noble invitation,” I said even as I pushed Astrid out of the water, and pushed her directly on top of her. Before Lillian could react, I was already in front of them, and slid inside her with a smooth stab. </p><p>Lillian might be surprised by the sudden weight on her, but it didn’t prevent her from crying in pleasure. Meanwhile, not wanting to neglect her, I brought my fingers down to tease Astrid’s poor, neglected pussy, which was still shuddering after her latest orgasm. This time, the moans that filled the room was even louder, making me smile widely. No matter the danger, no matter the risk, having two top-grade beauties in front of me, wet and naked, begging for my attention, was an amazing sensation, especially after spending years faking incompetence with little attention from ladies. </p><p>Normally, I would have just stopped at this point, but the potential implications of my latest discovery were too tempting to deny. So, I spent the rest of the afternoon playing with their magic and their bodies in equal measures, leaving two exhausted, but thoroughly satisfied, ladies in my wake. </p><p>After finishing, I dragged them to a makeshift camping bed, and covered them with a blanket, not even bothering to dress them, leaving them in a naked hug. Since they were already getting along great, it wouldn’t be a problem. </p><p>Before leaving, I wrote a detailed note, ordering them to stay inside the Villa no matter what, and meditate. Also, I explained several exercises to Lillian, and asked them to teach those to Astrid, who, unlike Lillian, lacked a proper magical education. If I was going to carry her along with me, I wanted her to be as competent as possible. </p><p>After that, I quickly dressed and made myself a bag, leaving the Villa just as the sun finally sank below the horizon. </p><p>I wanted to explore the mountain in the dark, curious of the secrets it might reveal… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once again, I lay naked, carefully watching her from the reflection of a small mirror. The moment I closed the curtain, she abandoned her flailing attempts of innocence, leaving its place to worry and anticipation as she carefully watched the curtain. As I watched her, I had to struggle not to explode into laughter, though that amusement soon left its place to arousal as I watched her slowly remove her top, revealing her amazing breasts, clad in the baby-blue underwear I had picked for her. Hidden behind the flattering clasp of a lacy bra, she somehow looked even sexier than when she was naked, begging me to unwrap it. </p><p>The impact only got stronger when she removed her sweatpants, showing her matching panties, which were stretched to the limit thanks to her generous curves. Simply delicious. I still couldn’t believe that this girl was somehow unpopular, even untouched as she prepared to go to college. </p><p>She was lucky that she had me as a guide… </p><p>She sat down in her underwear for half an hour, her attention split between her phone and her e-book reader, unable to focus on both. Still, I wasn’t bored, as I watched curiously as her nipples getting more and more erect as time passed. Considering RV was rather warm even with the windows open, it didn’t take a genius to eliminate the other possibilities for the reason. </p><p>“Michael,” she whispered loudly just as we passed the half an hour mark. “Are you awake?” I naturally didn’t answer, not even a grumble, giving her the confidence that I was already asleep. She waited a couple of minutes before repeating it, this time louder. “Michael, are you up?” </p><p>Seeing that there was no answer to her inquiry, she gasped in anticipation as she walked forward, tiptoeing toward my bed. She turned off the lights in the RV, leaving only moonlight spilling through the gaps of the closed curtains, giving her beauty an ethereal edge. With a lazy push, I changed the angle of the bedside mirror before she arrived, just to avoid an accidental realization. Just as I did so, she pulled open my curtains, looking like a naughty goddess. </p><p>I watched through my cracked eyelids as she pulled down the covers quickly, without fear. Apparently, after last night, she assumed that I was a heavy sleeper. While it wasn’t correct, I was very happy for her to think that. I appreciated her curves, hugged by the moonlight, while she gave the same treatment to my body, her breaths quickening in a visible degree. I was surprised when rather than touching my erection —which was raging hard before she pulled open the curtain, thanks to the beautiful view of Anna wearing underwear— she started caressing my arm gently, trailing my muscles. </p><p>“So strong,” she whispered in fascination as she reached to my fingers, and only then I realized it was the same hand I had used to caress her back while we shopped. It was good to know that it left an impression.   </p><p>I continued to lay silently, carefully not making a move even though I wanted nothing more than to grab her wrist and pull her to the bed, teaching her a lesson about poking a sleeping bear. Pity, it was too early for that. </p><p>“You’re so handsome,” she murmured as she looked at my face, then let her gaze move down between my legs. “And so big…” </p><p>At this point, I expected her to repeat the last night’s activities and reach to my shaft for another furious hand job, or maybe another blowjob if she could gather enough courage. Which was why I was surprised when instead of doing so, she lay next to me, her torso pressing against mine, her heartbeat alone frantic enough to wake me up if I had been sleeping. I had to struggle with my desire not to hug her back as she put her arm around her chest, squeezing me gently. </p><p>But to my shock, it was just a beginning. Soon, she put her head on my shoulder, breathing repeatedly like she was trying to memorize my smell. She followed that with a tender kiss to my neck, soon moving to my shoulder and biceps, while one of her hands started to caress my chest muscles. </p><p>She might be a hesitant beauty, but as a molester, she was really brave! </p><p>“I can’t believe you called me beautiful,” she murmured even as her free hand reached toward her waist, and pulled down her panties, which was stained wet with her arousal. She didn’t throw them away, instead of wrapping them around my shaft, and started jacking me off. Another naughty detail that suggested that she might be inexperienced when it came to real relationships, probably didn’t apply to the digital world. Her selections were curiously on point. </p><p>Playing possum was difficult when I had a sexy bombshell laying next to me, doing her best to drive me crazy by giving a hand job using her soft lacy panties, or when my arm trapped in the valley between her spectacular breasts, large enough to suffocate him if she pressed them to my face. Her tits felt softer than a bag of marshmallows, but somehow they defied gravity effortlessly. </p><p>“It’s all your fault,” she whispered softly even as she continued to play with my erection. “If you didn’t treat me like I’m a beautiful girl, I wouldn’t be burning with a desire that was impossible to quench with just my fingers. Now, you need to suffer.” </p><p>I was tempted to answer that she was blaming me wrongly, as her naughtiness started well before our shopping trip, when she decided to masturbate to the sight of me exercising. But life wasn’t fair, especially when it came to giving a pass to a sexy blonde when she said something wrong. Especially if said blonde was currently had nothing but her underwear, with her panties around my shaft to tease me toward an explosion. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I would leave it unpunished. Since she was already laying on top of my arm, it was a simple task to curl it, and locking her body against mine. “Michael! Are you awake!” she gasped in panic, but luckily, she had enough presence of mind not to shout, which would have forced me to wake up to prevent my ploy from becoming too unbelievable. But since she didn’t shout, I didn’t reach other than a senseless murmuring, acting like I was still asleep, and it was just a sleeping reaction. </p><p>She sighed relaxedly, only to stiffen once more when I rolled, trapping her underneath my weight. She wiggled, trying to get away, but failed to do so. The only benefit of her action was to bring my shaft closer to her entrance, rubbing against it threateningly. “No,” she gasped, but from her tone, I could read excitement rather than panic. Impressively, rather than trying to get away from underneath me, she started jacking her hand faster, trying to make me cum, likely assuming that if I did so, I might roll once again. </p><p>Not a bad assumption. Too bad that I had more interesting plans in mind to punish her little naughty adventure. </p><p>“You’re finally back,” I murmured softly, trying to fake sleep-talking. It seemed to work, as while she stiffened, she didn’t explode in panic. My excuse in place, I let my hands dance over her body, and since she was convinced that I was acting in my dreams, she felt safer, her hand around my shaft picking up speed, trying to push me toward climax sooner. </p><p>I had no intention of allowing her to succeed easily. I started moving lower. It, unfortunately, prevented my shaft from rubbing against her entrance, but it allowed me to bury my face between her tits, which was a win. She shivered as my teeth clamped around her bra while my fingers wormed toward her back, flicking it open with great ease. It was something I had great practice in, so much that I could do it in my sleep. And since Anna didn’t react in panic, she must have believed I actually did in my sleep. </p><p>Still, she gasped as I pulled her bra off with my teeth, leaving her naked under my weight. It was tempting to throw away the illusion and teach her the dangers of teasing a virile man, but playing with her slowly was far too amusing to stop. Instead, I did something I had been wanting to do for a long while. I started kissing her breasts repeatedly. I started softly at first, creating a large circle, before I slowly spiraled in, my kisses lingering longer and longer the closer I got to the center. </p><p>“I can’t believe it,” Anna gasped in shock, still a whisper, but she made no effort to actually pull under my body. Instead, her hand around my shaft quickened further, while her other hand disappeared between her own legs, making herself shiver. </p><p>Just as I was about to bite her nipple, I suddenly stopped and reversed direction, only to shift to her other breast when I finished the first. Her bosom was a treasure, and deserved to be treated as such during our first encounter. </p><p>“Hmm…” Anna moaned as she got closer to her climax, struggling to keep her voice down. I chose that moment to finally assault her nipple, my teeth clamping around just hard enough to trigger a jolt of pleasure. A cry of pleasure escaped her mouth as she pushed me back reflexively, her body trembling helplessly. Since I didn’t want to reveal my real status, I didn’t resist her push, rolling to my back obediently. </p><p>She immediately rolled off the bed, watching me with wide eyes, biting her lips in panic, no doubt thinking that she had finally pushed too hard, but her breathing relaxed when I continued breathing deeply. “That was close,” she sighed, and turned. After that excitement, she would have left, if I hadn’t suddenly put one hand to my chest. </p><p>While still holding her bra… </p><p>“Fuck,” she gasped, the shock enough to crack her aversion toward crassness. She reached and tried to pull it from my fingers, but I held it even tighter, even as I murmured in my ‘sleep’. She stopped soon, a frown on her face. I could have let her win an easy victory, but after her earlier daring, I was feeling curious about her next action. “If I make him relax, maybe he’ll loosen his grasp,” she murmured, her eye once again turning toward my midsection. </p><p>She proved that her surprises weren’t over by rather than moving to the feet area, she climbed to my bed, her slit hovering above my chest, before she leaned down and captured my shaft, her thick lips wrapping around my girth once more, her head bobbing. </p><p>I had no idea why she picked such a difficult position to maintain, though I wasn’t unhappy about it. It presented her freshly shaved pussy just inches away from my lips, still smelling deliciously of her recent climax. I licked my lips in anticipation, trying to decide whether a gentle payback would be too much and would alert her. </p><p>Then, while searching for a better position, she pushed her ass even farther, her wet lips an inch away from my tongue, taking the decision away from me. If she was going to present me such a beautiful gift, who was I to reject, especially when she was the one that climbed to my bed, completely naked. </p><p>A shocked gasp escaped her mouth as my tongue brushed against her entrance, and she pulled back panickedly. I made sure to keep my eyes closed tight, just in case she might notice something amiss. The silence stretched for a while, enough to make me suspect that I had finally pushed her too much, but that thought went away when I felt the presence of warmth inches away once again. Still, I cracked my eyes open only when I felt her lips around my shaft once more. </p><p>Since she was comfortable with the idea of an equal exchange of service, I let my tongue dart out once again. The moan that escaped her mouth was heavenly, especially since her lips were still around my shaft, the vibration adding a new layer to my pleasure. My tongue explored her entrance aggressively, though I didn’t use any complicated trick, as I was still supposed to be asleep. I circled her knob lazily several times, making her moan each time. </p><p>In response, she pushed her hips back more, her bottom smashing hard against my face. Even if I was suffering from a sleep disorder, such a move would have been enough to wake me up, but Anna seemed to miss that fact under the fresh rush of pleasure. I didn’t want to blame her, considering it was the first proper head she received in her whole life. Her hips moved in the response to my tongue beating, grinding her pussy against my face with choppy, forceful movements. Her inexperience made the situation even hotter, especially while her lips did their best to cover my shaft with her mark. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she murmured dazedly when she pulled for a quick breather, the pressure of her hips increasing even further. I was so tempted to sink my fingers to her hips, testing their firmness against her breasts. Pity that I had already pushed too much. I was afraid of spooking her. “Please don’t wake up, Michael. Please…” she gasped before returning to her task, her tongue licking across my length, making me throb in anticipation. I was getting close…</p><p>I didn’t know why, but every passing second, I was getting more and more excited. Maybe it was the tricky nature of our game, or maybe it was watching such a sexy girl slowly shedding her innocent ways through interesting means, but I could feel arousal growing in me, much more than I experienced even when I was spending time with top tier models after a painting session. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I could feel my arousal growing to a dangerous point. Naturally, I had my pride, and wanted her to climax before I could. Still, even as I was forced to unleash my skills to push her to a climax, I couldn’t help but feel fascinated about just how delicious she tasted. I could spend hours slowly teasing her as she lay on the bed, handcuffed, spread-eagle, and begging for a release. </p><p>And considering this was just the second night of our travel, and we supposedly had twenty-eight nights more, such a scene wasn’t exactly impossible. I just needed to convince her to do stuff she was doing with me when she knew I was awake. Shouldn’t be that hard. </p><p>I was already close to a climax, and my imagination churning interesting scenes one after another didn’t exactly help. To ensure fairness, I let my tongue jump out, exploring the curves of her nether lips aggressively, lapping her juices. Her cries rose louder and louder, but even as I increased the pressure, she made no attempt to pull back, convinced that my delicious service just the reflection of a dream. </p><p>“Oh, yes. Just a bit more,” she moaned as she pulled her head for a fleeting moment before her lips returned around my shaft once more, her head bobbing repeatedly. It was just seconds later I finally exploded, filling her mouth with my seed. Luckily, the taste of my seed proved to be decisive, assisting my tongue-assault and she started shuddering, her juices flowing uncontrollably. She continued to suck my cock, determined to drain me, missing the significance of the mess she left on my face. </p><p>Only after she swallowed the last drop the realization hit her. “Holy hell,” she gasped in shock as she stepped down, her body covered with a delicious sheen of sweat, which made her look ethereal under the gentle illumination of moonlight. She gasped in shock, and reached for the nearest item in her reach, which was her bra. She quickly dried my face with its soft side, which worked sufficiently well. There was nothing she could do about the taste on my tongue, of course, but I doubted whether she even thought about it. She could have licked it off as well, but it wasn’t shocking that she lacked the courage to do so. </p><p>“I can't believe I did that,” she murmured in a horrified fascination as she carefully dried my body, uncaring of her beautiful tits swaying with her every move, tempting my shaft to awaken once more. “I can't believe it. And he still hadn’t wake up. Maybe… It’s not like he’s going to know,\" she murmured as she looked at my shaft, which was already going back to its erect state. “No, that’s too much,” she finally said, disappointing herself and me at the same time. </p><p>Pity. I was curious how exactly she would top her last action. </p><p>She soon finished her self-appointed task of cleaning, pulled the covers on, and sighed as she watched me. “Maybe the next time,” she murmured as she walked away, pulling the curtains behind. </p><p>In her wake, a smile bloomed on my face. The next time it wasn’t going to be as simple as she assumed…  </p>",

    "content": "<p> I had hoped that distracted by her new gifts, Anna would be distracted enough to fully close the curtain. Unfortunately, that proved to be the exact opposite of the reality, and Anna pulled the curtains extremely tight, making sure they were closed. </p><p>A pity. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that all was lost. I started walking around the store once again, this time with a hungrier gaze. I picked four skirts, starting from knee-length and getting progressively shorter, the shortest one right in the qualification line between a mini skirt and micro skirt. I didn’t expect her to wear it off, but I wanted to act like I picked it accidentally, wanting to see her face. </p><p>But after a brief consideration, I put the more conservative two back on the shelves, and threw the more revealing ones to my own bag, betting on the fact that I would be able to convince her to wear them later on. Luckily, they were in deep discount, so they didn’t cost me much. I even picked a pair of knee-length black boots, also at a deep discount. Neither their material nor the brand was the best, but considering I was buying them blind, it was definitely beneficial. </p><p>Since I decided to build her a secret wardrobe, I tested several dresses, but unlike the skirts, they weren’t conservative in the slightest. They did look relatively normal at the first glance, but I dated with a number of girls with generous assets and knew from experience that dresses didn’t look half innocent on them, with their generous curves stretching those dresses in unexpected places, both enhancing the cleavage and shortening the skirt, which gave me plausible deniability about why I picked such a revealing dress. In the end, I picked two dresses. One light green sundress that looked innocent but actually a ticking time bomb, waiting for a wrong move to create the most delicious wardrobe accident, but it couldn’t rival the second one. </p><p>A little black dress that would turn Anna into a delicious toy on my arm, fit to be presented for even the most trendy club. </p><p>I put everything I had picked into my own personal bag, and dropped it by the checkout counter. “Your girlfriend is a lucky girl,” said the cashier girl with a flirtatious smile, and I matched with one. Pity that I wouldn’t spend a few days in the region, as she looked like a fun brunette. </p><p>When I returned from my shopping, I found Anna in front of a mirror, trying to look at her bottom, which was tight enough to look like it was painted on. “It looks nice, you should definitely buy it,” I commented, and she flinched in shock. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, but she avoided my gaze. </p><p>“Well, if you want to be sure, you need to try it with that tank-top. This t-shirt doesn’t bring its benefits.” </p><p>“Really?” she murmured. “But it’s too revealing.” </p><p>“Come on, you shouldn’t feel self-conscious about it,” I said, then chuckled as I gave her a playful glare. “Especially after watching me while I exercised topless. It’s nothing compared to that.” </p><p>“You saw that!” she gasped in shock, which was understandable, considering what she had been doing as she watched me, absolutely sure that she had been seen. </p><p>I decided to give her an exit. “Well, actually I didn’t, but you just admitted to it, so…” I said with a widening grin. </p><p>“You … jerk,” she murmured as she slapped my shoulder, but despite her words, she was smiling widely, relaxed that she hadn’t been caught. Or at least, that was what she had thought. I let her think that, otherwise, how could I enjoy her unintentional shows as she perved on me. </p><p>“Still, since you admitted it, put on that black tank top. I want to see if it’ll look as beautiful as I think,” I said, maintaining eye contact as I did so. I wasn’t surprised when she nodded obediently. After all, people were easier to convince when they were feeling relieved, and the supposed close-call she had experienced had definitely put her in such a state. </p><p>She disappeared behind the curtain once more, but this time, she was much more hurried, failing to close the curtain all the way in, allowing me to get a glimpse of her beautiful body through reflection. It was a fleeting moment, but still, it showed just how well the baby blue bra I had picked for her fit, hugging her large breasts perfectly, presenting them in the best light. I felt a stirring in my pants as I imagined myself ripping them off her body, my mouth watering as I did so. </p><p>When she came out, her eyes were firmly on the ground, her shoulders slouched once more, her arms around her chest. “Are you a bad student? Maybe with really poor grades?” I asked in a cold tone. </p><p>“W-what?” she stammered, raising her gaze, anger flickering, though she kept her arms folded. “No!”</p><p>“Then why are you ignoring my lessons?” I asked. “Head raised, arms relaxed, shoulders straight. It should be simple to remember.” </p><p>“S-sorry,” she stammered, as she followed my direction, but it took a while for arms to get down. “How do I look?” </p><p>“Let me get a better view,” I said even as I grabbed her hand, and twirled her, much to her shock. “Hmm, not bad,” I said after giving her a long look that left her with a blush that threatened to knock her unconscious. “Calm down,” I said consolingly, though if my hand landed on the small of her back as I said so, pulling her close, I was sure that it was completely accidental. “You look beautiful, it’s nothing to be ashamed of.” </p><p>“You think so,” she murmured. “But everyone said that-” she continued, but I cut her off. </p><p>“I don’t care what a bunch of snot-nosed high school boys or jealous cheerleaders who lost their ability to think due to excessive dieting thinks,” I said. “I’m a professional when it comes to beauty, and believe me, you look exquisite,” I whispered. “Believe me. If I had the funds, I would have hired you to be my full-time model, letting all my competitors die of jealousy.” </p><p>The compliment was a bit excessive, but not mistaken, I noted as I felt her melting against my arm as her eyelashes fluttered. “Really?” she murmured excitedly. </p><p>I leaned down like I was about to steal a kiss, and she froze immediately. More importantly, she made no move to escape, her rosy lips parting invitingly, her breathing picking up speed. I could easily steal a kiss at that moment. Too bad that if I did so, she would soon implode in panic, and call our trip off, ruining my plans along. I knew those excessive-thinker types quite well. So, instead of kissing, I whispered before pulling back. “Yes, you’re simply exquisite.” </p><p>I stood next to her, trying to hide my amusement as her emotions battled on her face, relief against disappointment… Still, to her credit, she managed to recover quite fast. “Thanks.” </p><p>“So, are you going to buy the tank top, or should we continue looking.” </p><p>She gave a lingering look at the mirror, her eyes dancing between her figure and my arm, which was still around her waist with my hand resting on the small of her back. “I think I’ll pick this,” she said in a rare burst of courage. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, even though I felt quite a pity. If she stayed undecided, I could easily imagine convincing her to wear a revealing spaghetti strap. “Let’s go.” Just like that, we walked away, and she carefully not made a mention of my hand resting on the small of her back, clearly enjoying the closeness. </p><p>That didn’t mean our shopping came to an end, of course. As we walked, I noticed a special corner, feeling a sudden inspiration. “Do you have any swimwear?” I asked her. </p><p>Just like that, her newfound confidence was destroyed. “N-no,” she stammered. “Why?” </p><p>“We have several lakes on the way, and I’m not planning to miss them. We even have one on our destination tonight, so I’ll be swimming quite a bit tomorrow before we hit on the road. You would be bored without a swimsuit,” I said, then hit her with the deadly final touch. “Unless you prefer skinny-dipping, of course.”</p><p>“No, definitely not!” she exclaimed panickedly as she dashed toward the swimsuit area, once again too panicked to notice the simple decision trap I had set up. It was a common fallacy, that when panicked, people tended to pick the more palatable of the two options, not stopping to think whether there was a third one, such as just stating she would skip swimming. </p><p>“One-piece or two-piece,” I asked her, once again relying on the same trap, though this time a bit trickier. </p><p>Before she could even say one piece, I had already picked a red one from the front. Like the dress I had picked, it looked decently conservative at the first glance. It had a zipper going down on the front rather than the back, though the wearer could keep it closed. Or at least, that was what I hoped Anna would think, because there was no way in hell Anna’s bust would fit in there when closed. She would inevitably have to unzip it down quite a bit for it to fit. “One piece,” she said, though she looked slightly disappointed at my selection, no doubt hoping that I would force her to something slightly more revealing. I hid my smile, wanting that surprise to be revealed later. </p><p>“We can also pick a two-piece along with it,” I offered, but she shook her head. </p><p>“No need, let me try this first,” she said. </p><p>I made a show of checking my time. “Actually, we’re a bit behind the schedule. Do you mind just buying it without checking? It’s just five bucks, not exactly a deal-breaker even if it doesn’t fit.” </p><p>She nodded, quite a bit calmer, and just a dash disappointed. “No worries.” </p><p>When we arrived at the register, the cashier girl smiled once more, but this time, her smile had a glassy quality to it, clearly not enjoying the transformation Anna experienced now that she was wearing a pair of tight jeans and a tank top —a normal one, but on Anna, it turned into a master example of innocent sexiness— looking several times better than her look when she came inside. Luckily, she did nothing more than grumbling under her breath as she rang our purchases, and we left. </p><p>“What was her problem?” Anna asked as she snuggled closer, still pointedly not making any mention of my hand resting on her back, earning glares from both genders as we walked through the mall. </p><p>“She was clearly jealous,” I said. </p><p>“Of you?” she asked, but on her tone, it was clear that she assumed that to be a done deal. </p><p>“Partially,” I said, and she looked at me questioningly. “She clearly hoped to seduce me, and when we walked in, she thought she had a hope to do so,” I said. </p><p>“And while we left? What changed. Did she try to get your number and struck out?” </p><p>I chuckled. “You need to be more confident. She was like that, because after you changed clothes, she realized that she had no chance of peeling me off your side,” I said with a chuckle. “You’re simply beautiful.” </p><p>“Y-you’re just saying that,” she stammered in shock, but underneath, I could see the beginnings of the smug smile that always adorned the cheerleader and other women who thought themselves to be the top dog, confident in their sexuality. It was just a seed, trying to take root, but still, it was good progress. </p><p>“Whatever you say,” I answered, but my smile was soft and seductive, something Anna didn’t miss if her fluttering eyelashes, followed by a panicked step back trying to hide her blush was any indicator. </p><p>We walked separate the rest of the way, with Anna carefully examining her feet. Distracted, she didn’t even ask what I had bought, maybe assuming it was some men’s clothes, maybe not even noticing. Regardless, it carried several cheaply-picked treasures that would enhance her beauty significantly. </p><p>The moment we were back at the RV, Anna dashed back to the bathroom, quickly changing into her sweatpants and t-shirt combo, hiding her delicious body behind layers of clothing once more. I was tempted to tease her, but I held myself back. I had challenged her way of life enough for one day. </p><p>The afternoon drive passed in silence, with Anna keeping her nose buried in her book and me watching the surroundings carefully, my mind on how I could use the lake for my benefit. Still, I continued to watch her without letting her know, only to see her shuffling uncomfortably, like there was something she wanted to do, but she kept herself back. I could barely hold back my laughter as I recognized the tell-tale signs of arousal, of which she was too inexperienced to hide from my gaze. </p><p>I expected her to disappear to the bathroom for a while to ‘handle’ it, but her hesitancy proved to be stronger. She maintained her act of reading as I drove, even as I parked the RV to a concealed spot that nonetheless had an amazing view of the lake, or when I picked my drawing equipment and left, starting to sketch the way the sunlight danced on the surface of the lake water. I knew, because I could still see her reflection from the side-view mirror, and she was still sitting in her seat. </p><p>However, she didn’t maintain the same act when the sun finally set and I got rid of my shirt, and started exercising once more. She once again hid behind the curtain, her hand disappearing under her sweatpants as she watched me sweat. I bit my lips in excitement, wondering whether she was still wearing the baby-blue underwear I had picked for her. </p><p>I exercised for about half an hour, and she watched me uninterrupted, almost dazed. When I stopped and returned to RV, she once again buried herself under the blanket, trying to hide her blush by dipping her head low, unaware that her neck and ears were glowing as well. I said nothing, choosing to take a quick shower. Unfortunately, this time, she wasn’t courageous enough to peek at me. However, from the small gap I left on the door, I watched her, only to notice her walking toward the burner with a hesitant expression, like a small child about to raid the cookie jar. </p><p>I watched curiously, only to see her prepare two glasses of warm milk. For a moment, I thought that she had added something in it, but I watched her almost uninterrupted through her reflection, and she added nothing. She still looked guilty and anticipatory, though. Only after a while, it clicked. She was hoping that after a relaxing glass of warm milk, I would sleep deeper. So devious, yet so innocent…  </p><p>Her gaze trailed me carefully when I left the shower with a loose towel around my waist. “Do you want some warm milk,” she offered, stammering, tempting me to squeeze her cheeks. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I grabbed the glass, aware of her gaze, trying not to focus on my muscles, glistening after the shower, but failing spectacularly. “It’s delicious. You’re very thoughtful,” I said after I quickly drained it, then went back to the bathroom and brushed my teeth, letting the small towel around my waist to rise up ‘carelessly’. Then, I went back to my section.</p><p>“Have a nice sleep,” I said as I pulled the separator curtain halfway, then smirked. “Don’t forget, don’t come to this side unless you want to face a big surprise,” I warned her with a smirk before pulling the curtain down, curious whether she would pay another nighttime visit, and if she did so, how far she would go… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as the architect of the situation, I could scarcely believe I was getting away with ramming Helga repeatedly in front of Titania, with absolutely no effort of actually hiding what was going on. It was incredible. </p><p>“T-this point is one of the most dangerous locations,” Helga said, though unable to prevent herself from moaning in between, tightening around my shaft just to push the situation deeper. </p><p>“Do you think we can reinforce it without compromising the integrity of the whole structure?” I asked even as I slid my hands down, cupping her ass to support her graceful jumping, allowing her to focus solely on her presentation. </p><p>“Maybe-” Helga said, once again cut by a moan. “If we can establish an isolated structure with opposite nature, the whole scheme might stabilize without intervention from the other wards.” </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 79%]</p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>[-84 Mana]</p><p>This time, Titania actually glared at us with a slight annoyance, which I took as a win, because this time, her light magic was slightly slower in neutralizing the emotion, making her actually experience the tendrils of jealousy for a moment before it was drained. </p><p>Also, that wasn’t the only interesting finding. I was constantly observing her, and I noticed that the emotional isolation of her light magic was weakening whenever it needed to remove a strong flare of emotion —such as resulted by an old partner recklessly fucking another girl in front of her without even the decency of trying to hide it. Moreover, while it slowly recovered, it didn’t take any mana from her existing pool, just relying on her regeneration capabilities, which wasn’t enough to completely compensate for its weakening. I wondered whether it was just due to the nature of the light magic, or it was a way of keeping Titania unaware of its existence —though the latter raised quite a few poignant questions. </p><p>Regardless, it gave me a clear way of going forward to weaken its effects. I needed to run interference, but to do that, I needed to have some mana in her soul space. “How about this location?” I suddenly interrupted as I reached toward the other side, which required me to push Helga against the table for a fleeting moment as I reached, but it allowed me to brush my finger against Titania’s before she could pull it, making me succeed, while also giving Titania a better view of what was going underneath the table for a moment. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 82%]</p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>[+2 Subterfuge]</p><p>[-18 Mana]</p><p>“It’s a satellite node…” Helga continued after a huge moan forced due to sudden push. While she explained, I focused on my successful infiltration attempt. Maintaining control of my mana from a distance was significantly harder. I doubted that I could have succeeded if it wasn’t for my enhanced mana manipulation capabilities thanks to the temporary skill from Helga. I used that mana as a scalpel to carefully block the connections between her mana and the emotion-devouring light magic structure, carefully observing its reaction. I didn’t try to destroy it, because it would regenerate, and also, it risked being noticeable to Titania. </p><p>But interference was much harder to detect, avoiding the attention of both her and her little emotion-blocking parasite. The recovery of the blocker slowed significantly, making me smile widely. It was going to be fun to strain it —and her— to the limits. </p><p>To work on that aim, I let my hand crawl up under Helga’s robe, groping her tits aggressively, making her gasp repeatedly to interrupt her discussion. This time, thanks to the dwindling performance of her emotion-blocker, her annoyance was obvious. “Focus,” she ordered. </p><p>“Hey, she needs mana to do it,” I countered. “You don’t want her collapsing halfway, do you?” </p><p>[+2 Speech]</p><p>Titania didn’t answer verbally, but her angry glare was answer enough. I smirked at my success. Just moments ago, it was impossible for her to maintain any emotion. Her anger drained only after several seconds, leaving a thick frustration behind. </p><p>I continued pumping even as Helga walked Titania through all the faults she had found in the ward layout, her genius innovation working wonders in underlining the mistakes of the ancient wards, to the point of distracting Titania from the fact that Helga was being impaled through her explanation —though not completely, as the annoyed jealously slowly became a fixture on Titania’s face. It shone brightly, thanks to her lacking experience when it came to handling her emotions. </p><p>“Now, about how we can fix - IT!” Helga said it after completing her explanations, but I timed it perfectly to make her climax, allowing her to cover the last of the distance with a sudden twist of her nipple over her bra. She shuddered helplessly while Titania gasped in anger, her fingers shining with the distinctive flair of her light magic. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 86%]</p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>[-72 Mana]</p><p>“Give her a minute to catch her breath,” I said with a chuckle even as I decided to push it further, happy with the sharp increase in the Companion Progress. My fingers danced down across her chest, unbuttoning her robe and her shirt as it went down. Titania growled and Helga gasped, but neither stopped me as I removed Helga’s robe and shirt, leaving her wearing nothing but a bra and a skirt. “So, sweetie, tell us about what you have in mind next,” I said to Helga as I grabbed her tits once more, but unlike previously, there was no shirt to hide the dance of my fingers. </p><p>Finally, I saw the emotion I desired reflected on Titania’s face. Jealousy, tinged with arousal. Titania’s breathing quickened as she watched me maul Helga’s rather generous tits. I had to keep myself from snorting in amusement when she gave a passing glance to her own modest bust, flaring her jealously even more. </p><p>“I - I think we can fix the scheme by…” Helga started, her explanation interrupted frequently by her moans. Titania listened, but she couldn’t fully focus on the explanation as well, too distracted by the show that was going on in front of her. I decided to intensify the show. Removing Helga’s bra was trivial at this point, giving Titania a full view of Helga’s delectable upper body, my fingers disappearing in her soft flesh, extracting a fresh set of moans in return. All the while. Helga continued to jump up and down on my lap, while explaining her notes to Titania. </p><p>Luckily, Helga was meticulous when it came to note-taking, which allowed her to make her presentation without losing her place. For Titania, however, understanding it had been significantly more difficult, especially since she was battling with an unfamiliar set of emotions, and her growing arousal didn’t make it any easier. Once again, I watched as the indomitable Head Librarian slowly fade away, her place taken by an innocent woman who was yet to learn about her own body… The more the emotional isolation effect faded, the more hesitant she became. She tried to focus on Helga’s explanation, but it was impossible for her to be successful with Helga’s tits swinging like a pendulum, marking the time until her eventual defeat…</p><p>Such a delicious opportunity to be the teacher, I decided, and placed my hand on her stomach before pushing her forward. Helga gasped as her tits pressed against the cold surface of the table, her ass pointed upward, her skirt barely enough to cover it. But even that much of coverage was abhorrent to me. With my strength, ripping off her skirt was simply trivial, leaving Helga completely naked under Titania’s gaze. </p><p>“W-we need to work on the wards,” Titania stammered, a spectacular blush covering her face as her mouth fell open, her earlier coldness destroyed completely. I could feel her emotional-blocker trying to calm her down, but with the blocks in place, it failed to gather enough power to renew its strength, getting weaker every passing second. At this moment, Titania was nothing more than an innocent schoolgirl. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 89%]</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Daring Display. Take a risky position to seduce a potentially hostile target. +2 Charisma, +500 Experience]</p><p>In one smooth movement, I thrust my hips forward, sliding inside Helga once again, which had been surprisingly difficult because she had tightened significantly as her naked body was displayed in front of one of her idols, reducing her to a simple slut. Impressively, she still managed to give a broken explanation about the planned improvements. Less impressively, Titania could only stare as my hands clutched her hips as I thrust rhythmically, each push shaking the table, one of the documents on the corner toppling on the floor.</p><p>“Do you mind picking it up,” I said to Titania as I gestured at the file. </p><p>[+3 Speech]</p><p>Titania did so with an absent-minded nod and left her seat, taking a couple of steps before she leaned forward to pick up the file on the floor, a string of moves that brought her much closer to Helga’s body. Titania pulled back after an absent-minded second, but very slowly, her eyes firmly stuck on the location where my shaft disappeared inside Helga repeatedly.  </p><p>Unconsciously, she bit her lips as she watched, no doubt remembering how her own body had stretched under my attention just a few days ago, where she had lost her virginity under my ingenious treatment. She sat back, but her legs stayed suspiciously close, rubbing against each other in an attempt to quench her growing arousal. It would result in the opposite effect of what she desired, but from the way she watched us, hypnotized, I was willing to bet that she wasn’t aware of that particular fact. </p><p>Helga’s explanations slowly lost their vigor, proving that even her bookworm tendencies had their limit. She grabbed the edges of the table in an effort to handle my merciless fucking, each push making it harder for her to think… Her ass jiggled with each smash, the sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room, loud enough to suppress the occasional word Helga could utter, finally removing all pretenses of the moment. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” Helga moaned in joy. “Harder, faster, fill me!” </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 93%]</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>“As you wish,” I said before turning my gaze to Titania, curious of her reaction. Surprisingly, she didn’t even comment on the sudden change, too fascinated at the scene, her lips covered with bite marks of her own doing. Without a warning, I spanked Helga’s ass. Helga moaned, while Titania flinched at the sudden move, her eyes meeting with mine. “Mana transfer requires a lot of effort, as you remember,” I reminded her, and her delicious blush intensified further, clashing with her raven black hair. </p><p>“I - I see,” she stammered. “Can’t we just wait for her mana to recover?” she added, finally managing to gather a wisp of will. </p><p>“Impossible, we need to finish this as soon as possible before we go and visit the Headmistress. The necromancer incursion is of vital importance. We can’t delay,” I said, which made her expression shift. The explanation was ridiculous, but Titania, battling against her unfamiliar rush of arousal, was not in a position to push back against it, helplessly nodding in response. </p><p>“Let’s change the position a bit, to make sure we get a better mana flow, I said even as I pushed back my chair, and sat down. Helga jumped up to my lap immediately, facing at me while her ass pointed at Titania, giving her the uninterrupted view of my shaft disappearing inside her repeatedly. She was even slicker, making me groan as I slipped inside her, spreading her wide. </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>After another searing kiss, I hooked my arms around her waist, and let her lean back, her tits thrusting to the ceiling, swaying sexily with my every push, giving Titania an even better show. Time lost its meaning as I slammed inside her again and again, enjoying the way she trembled against my body, while she finally shuddered under the effects of an explosive orgasm, her moans filling the room. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 98%]</p><p>[+600 Experience]</p><p>I gave a glance at Titania, who was watching us with widened eyes, trying to process a scene she never imagined let alone expecting to come across, her expression radiated a horrified fascination along with ever-increasing arousal. Her hands were clutched on her desk, her fingers pale with pressure, like she was trying to convince herself it was just a dream. Of course, that didn’t prevent her legs from rubbing furiously against each other in the hope to attain an unfamiliar high. </p><p>She deserved an even better show, I decided as Helga trembled under the effects of the arousal. I whispered to Helga’s ear to warn her before standing up, and her legs wrapped around my waist immediately to support herself, easily hanging on me as I started walking around in the room, providing Titania with our view from several angles. “You like it, don’t you,” I whispered into Helga’s ear, using a small flare of mana to make sure Titania doesn’t hear it. “You like it when Titania watches you, helpless, wishing to be in your place, but lacking the courage to admit it, and replace your slutty ass.” </p><p>“I do,” Helga answered even as she picked up even more speed, her moans rising unbidden. It was like beautiful music, aggressively rising toward its crescendo. Luckily, I was already on the edge, so I had the perfect way to accompany her beautiful music. I exploded inside her, filling her with my seed, her body responding with trembling helplessly… </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 100% - Final Stage Completed +20000 Exp]</p><p>[Permanent Perk Established: Mana Regeneration]</p><p>[Permanent Perk Established: Skill Share]</p><p>[New Perk: Teleportation]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Master Arcana, Grandmaster Elemental (5), Basic Mana Manipulation] </p><p>“Finally,” I grunted even as I selected Arcana for my next ability, because my various illusions and supporting skills were lagging behind. Helga’s mouth opened in shock, no doubt trying to process her most recent achievement gain, very similar to Cornelia had acquired, giving five points for each mental stat and two points for each physical stats. Even under my touch, I could feel her getting stronger. </p><p>“You’re finally filled to the brim,” I said mockingly as I let her step on the floor, my seed dripping down her legs. </p><p>“Yes, I am,” she answered with a matching smirk as she turned and walked toward the table, uncaring of her nakedness as she leaned down, and cast her illusion once more, gasping at her own performance. She was lucky that Titania was too distracted to actually notice the huge jump in her abilities to cast illusions. </p><p>Meanwhile, as Helga explained the rest of the possible improvement areas to Titania, I called the details of her abilities to finally examine it directly. </p><p>[Helga - Level 12/17 - 85%</p><p>Skills: Expert Arcana, Expert Magical Theory, Expert Spellcrafting, Basic Research, Basic Mana Manipulation</p><p>Perks: None</p><p>Strength: 4 / Precision: 6 / Agility: 5 / Speed: 5 / Endurance: 8  \t</p><p>Charisma: 12 / Perception 13 / Manipulation: 14 / Intelligence: 22  / Wisdom: 17]</p><p>Overall, I was satisfied with her distribution. She was weak on combat ability, but it didn’t matter with my presence. Especially with her latest stat boost, even with her poor skills, she had sufficient ability to defend herself against an emergency. It was especially important with the new perk, Teleportation, which was supposed to be a very difficult ability. I didn’t know the exact limits, or the way it worked, but I was confident that I could figure it out. </p><p>As I considered the implications of the new perk, Helga quickly finished explaining the rest of the points, Titania yet to recover from her shock. And as much as I wanted to walk behind Helga for a second session, I decided to take pity on Titania. Also, Helga was about to finish her explanation, and with that complete, I didn’t have an excuse for a repeat. </p><p>“I hope it was helpful,” I said even as I gave her robe to Helga, but left everything else on the floor. She smirked as she put the robe on, fixing it so that her nakedness underneath wasn’t peeking. </p><p>“Very,” Titania managed to stammer, doing her best to hide her frustration —and failing spectacularly. “Is there anything else?” she added, trying to kick me away. </p><p>“Actually, there is,” I said as I pulled one of the earth gems from my pocket, testing Titania. She tried to look ignorant, but she couldn’t prevent a shocked gasp —a very obvious one, thanks to her emotional control being ruined through my interference. “However, your talk with the headmistress about the wards are more important. Just let me escort my sweet assistant back to her room, and we can talk about it another day. Send another message when you have some time to discuss,” I said to her, however, as I did so, destroyed the blocks I had established on her emotional blocker. I didn’t want her to have that discussion with the headmistress impaired, mostly because I didn’t want the Headmistress getting suspicious. After all, I could easily apply the same trick the next time. </p><p>Then, I turned and left the room without even asking for her permission. </p><p>[+3 Speech]</p><p>Helga leaned against the wall the moment I closed the door. “That was…” she murmured in a trembling voice, exhaustion and excitement battling. </p><p>I leaned in for a kiss, even as I magically monitored the room, watching as Titania let out a frustrated growl, burning the remaining clothes of Helga with one spell, followed by slamming her desk. Even more interesting, she stood up and walked away while removing her robe on the way, showing just how frustrated she was feeling. Even better, she slammed the bedroom door behind her.  </p><p>“That was just a start,” I whispered to Helga as I chuckled, dragging her away. As much as it was tempting to go back to her room for the main course, things would be much more delicious once she had time to experience the aftermath of our show without the clutch of her emotional isolator. “Pity that we still need some time for the main course…”  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 356000 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699\tMana: 4814 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [80/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [75/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [42/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 12/17]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Titania’s message couldn’t have come up in a more opportune time, as the artificial monster horde I had discovered last night was a rather dangerous development that needed to be discussed before I took the risk of talking with an unknown quantity like the mysterious headmistress of the school. Also, the opportunity to face Titania again was a nice opportunity, especially considering I was finally strong enough to actually content with her with the level difference. There was no doubt that we still had a huge level cap, but at this point, my stats were high enough to compensate for it.</p><p>However, rather than directly going to her room, I first changed the destination to my own to pick up the plans, and maybe also bringing Helga along. After seeing the incredible benefits of finally completing the companion process with Cornelia —and completing with her first had been a real surprise considering the nature of our initial contact, though maybe it was fated considering her aggressive and ill-considered foray in the library had changed my destiny— so I wanted to complete the process with Helga as well. </p><p>Of course, that left the problem of unlocking the progress for the fourth stage. At first, I was planning to use Cornelia as the bait, allowing Helga to experience their old deal from the other side, hoping that giving her a sense of power against her old dominatrix opponent, though I believed it to be a long shot. I had no doubt that Helga would have enjoyed that, as she had suffered under Cornelia’s sexy toys for too long not to nurse a grudge, but that didn’t mean that it would unlock her fourth stage. </p><p>My amazing display of power against the monster horde had worked for Cornelia, but that was because Cornelia had a personality that worshipped power. What I had done there was the purest display of it, not to mention I had achieved that through fire magic, the purest display of power for Cornelia to understand. </p><p>The same wouldn’t work directly for Helga for the last stage. She was different than Cornelia, yearning for prestige and trying to carve a place for herself through her unique perspective. She wanted to prove herself against everyone that they were wrong throwing away her innovative approach to spell-casting to favor the inefficient ancient styles critically dependent on skills. </p><p>Also, as I walked away from Cornelia’s room, I noticed that I could still feel Cornelia’s presence, and that sensation was not blunted by the distance. Excellent, I thought. Having real-time access to her exact position and her mood might prove vital in protecting her. I definitely didn’t want to lose her after putting all the effort to raise her. </p><p>I let my mind wander on the solution as I walked to my room and opened the door, and saw Helga stretching cutely on my bed, the towel around her body barely hiding the deliciousness underneath, her hair glistening wetly, suggesting she had freshly showered. “Morning,” she murmured as she stretched further, which ‘accidentally’ undone her towel and it fell down, pooling around her waist, leaving her vast bosom naked. “Oops,” she murmured as she raised her hand to her mouth, the other wrapping around her torso like she was trying to hide them from my view, though it would have been classified as a spectacular failure if her intention was to actually hide her beautiful peaks. </p><p>“Did you rest well?” I said as I strode toward her, and leaned for an extended kiss, our tongues dancing as I delivered a generous boost of mana, which I converted to experience for her. </p><p>[-452 Mana]</p><p>“Perfectly,” she said. “I couldn’t wait to return to study the wards. Despite the faults, they are so interesting. The application of Mordin’s theory on triple connections alone…” she murmured, bursting into an exciting explanation, her tits dangling freely as she waved her hands excitedly. It was amusing just how easily she could lose herself in the intricacies of magical theory as easily as the pleasure of the flesh. </p><p>A light spell exploded in my mind as I watched her, illuminating an interesting path. Maybe her excitement toward the theory, along with the desire to prove herself, was the best way to finally step into the last stage. Bringing her along to the meeting with Titania would achieve both, especially since I no longer feared Titania in terms of the difference in power. Revealing the existence of Helga was no longer dangerous, especially since I was Titania’s only reliable ally against the necromancers. “I’m going to meet with Titania in five minutes, do you want to come with me?” </p><p>“Titania?” she said before it clicked in her mind and she stammered. “D-do you mean the H-head librarian,” she stammered in shock. </p><p>“Yes, silly. I’m talking about the head librarian. We’re going to have a talk about the necromancers,” I explained even as I leaned down to steal another kiss from her shocked lips. “Get ready, you only have five minutes.” </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“Right!” she gasped as she jumped up, while I moved to the desk that was piled with the defense blueprints of the school as well as the copious piles of notes Helga had created during her analysis, though I kept my attention on her. Watching her as she hurriedly dressed was fun and sexy at the same time, with a large dash of cute mixed in. “I’m ready,” she said as I chuckled. </p><p>“No, you’re not,” I countered as I took a step forward and slipped my hand under her skirt, only to rip her panties off with one pull. “Now you’re ready.” </p><p>She opened her mouth to say something, but when I leaned forward, she canceled that in favor of parting her lips excitingly, rewarded by another searing kiss. Her moans intensified further when my hand slipped under her skirt to tease her naked entrance. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said after pulling back, leaving her primed for more. “We’re in a hurry.” </p><p>“O-okay,” she stammered and followed me out of the room. </p><p> This time, I didn’t bother disguising myself. At this point, putting a simple illusion combined with a change of posture was more than enough for me to disappear into the crowd, faking ordinary perfectly. “Try not to act too shocked when with Titania. Don’t forget that I’m going to be there to keep the heat off, and don’t reveal anything about our unique way of leveling, or about the mysterious book you’re trying to decipher,” I reminded her. At this point. I was confident to weather the storm it would bring. At absolute worst, I could easily escape into Mount Dread to hide from the people, and it wasn’t a likely outcome in the first place. Even if Titania discovered it, it wouldn’t be her benefit to reveal the secret of her only ally to outsiders until the current disaster was concluded. </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>I planned to be strong enough to be untouchable before the current crisis could be solved —not to mention developing a better, more intimate relationship with Titania in the process— so revealing that particular secret wasn’t exactly scary. </p><p>I knocked on her door when we arrived at the destination, and reached the final target. The door opened, and I stepped inside, only to see Titania already sitting on a large table, wearing a fresh set of robes, though she wasn’t good enough with restoration spells or makeup to hide her exhaustion from me. “Who’s this,” she asked in a scary tone when Helga walked in, making Helga freeze in fear. </p><p>“She helps me study magic,” I said as I walked forward, ignoring her tone, gesturing Helga to follow me. Titania’s expression lacked emotion, but a sudden pressure filled the room, a mixture of charisma effect and pure mana pressure. Helga gasped in shock, too weak to handle such a rush. I sighed exaggeratedly as I brought my own pressure forward, blanketing Helga for protection effortlessly. “Are you done posturing so we can start the discussion,” I said even as I gestured Helga to sit next to me. </p><p>[+2 Subterfuge]</p><p>Titania’s outward reaction was so small that even with my enhanced senses, I was almost tricked that she wasn’t surprised with it. Even then, I would have probably underestimated the impact if I hadn’t had an excellent secret trick in form of a growing Companion System, of which I was getting a better understanding with each experiment. After the enlightenment provided by the adventure with Cornelia, it was hard for me to miss the sudden rush of anger and shock, or how they faded immediately as a side effect of her light magic. Truthfully, I wasn’t sure whether she actually felt them for a moment before her unique magic erased them. No wonder she was emotionless. </p><p>Though, that made my eventual victory tastier. I still remembered this impeccable woman cumming around my shaft as she mewled innocently, her raven hair stuck to her petite body, her gray eyes widened with pleasure. </p><p>“Why is she here?” Titania asked again monotonously while Helga flinched. </p><p>I grabbed Helga’s hand under the table to calm as I answered. “She’s here to give her findings about these,” I said even as I threw the blueprints on the desk. </p><p>“Where did you find them,” she asked, once again monotonous.</p><p>“A necromancer base,” I said, which earned nothing more than a raised eyebrow. Apparently, not even the secrets of the school in the hands of Necromancers was enough to break her forced calm, through my Tantric senses, I could feel her panic for a moment before it was swallowed by her light magic. Apparently, it worked for all emotions, not just positive or intense ones. I gave a quick breakdown of the base adventure. </p><p>“It’s worrying,” she said. </p><p>“What’s worrying is that our defenses have more holes than aged cheese,” I answered before turning to Helga. “Why don’t you give a breakdown of your findings to our dear librarian so she understands the true weight of the issue. Use illusions to create a three-dimensional model to be through.” </p><p>“I’m not sure my mana is enough,” Helga answered, though only after she sent a hesitant glare at Titania, still unable to process her position completely. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I can transfer some mana,” I answered, earning a surprised gaze from Helga, and more surprisingly, a sudden flare of jealousness from Titania —which was once again quelled immediately. I turned Titania with a questioning glare. “You don’t mind, do you?” </p><p>[+2 Speech]</p><p>“Why would I mind?” she said in the same inflectionless tone. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I gestured Helga to start. </p><p>First, Helga took a deep breath and cast a complicated Arcana spell, creating a lingering light-based illusion that was visible to all, though it strained her quite a bit. Despite its small size, the level of detail it contained was not simple. “To begin, I don’t think this diagram represents all of the defenses,” Helga said. “Essentially, there are two tiers of wards, one to stay active indefinitely, one to be raised to defend against a dangerous assault, but both schemes have suspicious gaps,” Helga explained. </p><p>“Like what,” Titania said monotonously. </p><p>“Like these three points,” Helga said as she cast an additional spell, and the illusion expanded. Helga dragged her finger across several locations. “For example, at these three points, the wards folds in a way that was impossible to maintain unless they were wrapped around a spell pylon, but there’s nothing on the plan.” </p><p>“Maybe the plans neglected it,” Titania said, though I felt a flare of panic. </p><p>“While it’s possible, it’s extremely unlikely,” Helga countered immediately. “Such a pylon needs to be really strong to handle such interference, and around it, there’s no ward to justify the existence of such support. It clearly exists to support another set of the dormant ward, probably quite a bit stronger than the first two layers.” </p><p>At this point, I sent a warning glare at Titania through flaring my magic, because I could feel hers bubbling like she was about to attack. It was sharp and focused, so Helga didn’t even realize just how close she was to death. “Very good discovery,” I said. “Do you think it’s likely the necromancers discovered the same?” </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“Debatable,” Helga answered. “A ward expert would have probably noticed, but it needs to be a peak expert. I have no idea undead have access to such a thing.” </p><p>“And is the existence of the third layer of wards secret?” I asked Titania. </p><p>She looked reluctant, but still answered. “Not among the key members of the faculty.” </p><p>“So, we need to assume that it’s known by the enemy from day one, but they are still making a move,” I pondered. “Is there a special meaning to the third layer of wards?” </p><p>“I don’t know, they haven’t been raised for at least three centuries, where they needed to resist against an unprecedented horde led by frost giants that destroyed most of the Northern Fortresses. The rest of the details are only known by the Headmistress.” </p><p>“Such wards are likely not without its cost,” I murmured, but rather than continuing, I gazed at Helga when her illusion flickered. “Are you getting tired?” </p><p>“A bit-” she said, only to gasp in shock when I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her onto my lap, and kissed her aggressively, transferring enough mana to refill her reserves. “You don’t mind, do you?” I asked lazily to Titania, amused at her sudden flare of jealousy —once again suppressed by her light magic. </p><p>[-154 Mana]</p><p>“No, it’s logical not to waste time waiting for her to recover,” Titania answered. </p><p>[+10 Experience]</p><p>“Definitely,” I answered, though the sudden experience gain surprised me for a moment. Helga was clearly too weak to actually provide any experience. Then it occurred to me. Helga was weak, but Titania wasn’t. Apparently, frolicking with the third lady in front of the others worked well as well, though significantly less than what I would have gained through kissing her. Still, every little bit counts, especially if collected in such an entertaining manner. “So, about the wards?” </p><p>“They are likely not without their cost,” Titania continued, her mannerism unflappable. “No ward with such an incredible strength is. I expect that at a minimum, it would put the Headmistress out of commission for several days through exertion. But it shouldn’t matter, as doing so, she would definitely push the attack back.” </p><p>“It matters,” I frowned even as I cast a spell to unzip my pants and slipped through Helga’s wet entrance easily, making her moan under the unexpected rush. “Even that leaves too many motivation for such </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 76%]</p><p>[+40 Experience]</p><p>“How so?” Titania asked while I enjoyed the combined rush of getting more experience and finally bringing Helga into the final stage. The gamble I took was the correct one. </p><p>“Simple,” I said even as I started pumping inside Helga, making absolutely no effort to actually hide what was going on under the desk, softly bouncing Helga on my lap. “It might be that they are trying to assassinate Headmistress during the activation, or they might actually just rely on her exhausted state to do whatever they were planning to do in Silver Spires through their secret agents and retreat, neatly avoiding her wrath. The second part works well with the shade they tried to put in the library, or your ambush. It means that they have something to do, and they either require some significant time to activate, or they require more time than your forays to the wild give them.” </p><p>[+3 Speech]</p><p>“Do you think that’s the case?” she asked. </p><p>“Maybe,” I answered. “However, it can easily be something else completely. We don’t know the identity of their ally on the inside, we don’t know who leads the necromancers. We don’t even know who is the leader of their little alliance, or if is there really one?” </p><p>“Isn’t that obvious, necromancers are the leader.” </p><p>“Not obvious enough to rule other options out,” I countered, even as I lazily pumped into Helga, enjoying the moment. “Not unless you have some ironclad evidence that you’re yet to share with me, such as the identity of their supposed underling,” I said, and she fell silent. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 77%]</p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“I don’t have such evidence,” she answered, and I smirked. </p><p>“We don’t need to waste time discussing that particular topic then,” I said. “That we can leave after talking with the Headmistress and getting a better understanding of the impact of this supposed ultimate layer of wards.” I couldn’t help but scoff, as the first two layers of wards were hardly impressive, reducing my expectations toward the third layer. </p><p>“Helga, please continue about the details of the protective structure of the wards,” I said, even as I considered just how far I could push the situation before Titania finally reacted to the jealousy she was feeling…  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 26    Experience: 332000 / 351000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 44</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3562 / 3562\tMana: 4311 / 4680        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [78/100]         </p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [33/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25]</p>",
