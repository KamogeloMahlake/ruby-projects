    "content": "<p>Finding a place to live was easier than I expected. After all, while we made some enemies, enough to blacklist us from the inns, it required our followers to follow us and alert the places in advance. Disguising ourselves before getting a room in a cheaper inn had been easy. </p><p>I left Pearyin in the room with two basic takedown moves to practice, enough food to keep her sated for a few days, and even gave some money for emergencies — one I received directly from Lannayin and not from the System, as the rules for the System gifts were more stringent. </p><p>I didn’t want to trigger another punishment.  </p><p>Once that was done, I went to the battle arena. </p><p>Finding the arena was easy. It was the third biggest building of the city, right after the huge manor of the city lord, and the military keep of the city guards. It was larger than a modern stadium, easily enough to house a hundred thousand people. </p><p>Even if it didn’t hover in front of me, I could have found it by following the vast crowd moving toward it. The people surrounded the building, purchasing and redeeming tickets, making bets, and discussing their favorite fighters. </p><p>I had already realized that fighting was an important cultural event, but seeing the passion of the people was still shocking. </p><p>I went to a different gate, one with no line, because while observing people, I noticed people with the same token I had used that one. “You can’t just—” one of the guards started, only to stop when I revealed the token Lannayin gave me. “Come, lead the honored guest to his seat,” the guard said, signaling to a servant. </p><p>I followed him, and soon, I found myself in a private area right at the edge of the field. Unlike the rest of the stadium which was stuffed to the brim, the large private area was a place of luxury. Comfortable chairs, silk curtains, and a huge buffet spread on a long table that put last night’s discussion into shame. </p><p>The people that were in place were equally impressive. Several people were inside, dressed expensively, and my arrival was enough to earn their gazes. Not because I was famous enough for them, but because I was too shabbily dressed. </p><p>“He’s the guest of Master Lannayin,” the servant that was leading me said, his tone smooth enough to feel respectful, but I didn’t miss the disdain in his tone. The others looked at me with even deeper disdain, almost disgust, but none of them dared to say anything. </p><p>I didn’t miss their fearful glances toward the door the servant had been leading to me, showing that, while she was not liked or respected, she was truly feared. Which, I had to admit, was a weird status. </p><p>I didn’t waste my time thinking about it, and instead followed the servant into the room. Once I stepped in, I saw two guests. Lannayin, and another woman that was wearing some kind of plate armor made of volcano steel. It was forged by Lannayin. </p><p>“So, this is the famous scholar Arthanum that caught your attention, my friend,” she said, though I shivered under her gaze. </p><p>“I wouldn’t dare to claim fame. I’m just a wanderer, nothing more,” I said, trying to use the same charm that had been enough to win the attention of Elsana and Lannayin, but it only earned a dismissive glare. </p><p>Not someone that appreciated poems, clearly. </p><p>“Take some food and sit,” Lannayin said as she pointed to the empty seat next to her, their chairs positioned in front of a window that had an excellent view of the arena. “I made you lunch.” </p><p>Her friend didn’t miss it. “Really, you missed lunch? Yet, you were late to our meeting,” she said, the disapproval in her tone sharp enough to scare me. </p><p>It was best not to anger her. </p><p>“Yes. Master Linnayin’s skill using the forge inspired me in my art. I was even inspired to compose a poem for her,” I said. I didn’t want to be killed by a mysterious swordswoman who wanted to protect her friend’s chastity.</p><p>“Really,” both of them said at the same time, Lannayin fascinated, the swordswoman disdainful. </p><p>“May I read it?” I asked, and they nodded. Luckily, I was prepared. “Where fire bleeds from earth’s raw might; she bends the flame, her hammer bright. Steel whispers, molten dream; A blacksmith queen, in embers’ gleam.” </p><p>Once again, it was not exactly amazing, but the near-perfect delivery helped it to feel somewhat more believable. </p><p>“See, I said that he’s good,” Lannayin declared. </p><p>“He’s not terrible,” she answered, but otherwise, she didn’t even look at me. “We were talking about the next order. I still need you to forge another hundred swords for the elites of my regiment…” </p><p>With that, they started to discuss business. Most of the details they discussed were too complicated for me to contextualize, so I went to pick some food, sat back, and started eating. </p><p>It didn’t trigger the System. Why, I had no idea, but it was inconvenient. I hoped that it was not because of Lannayin’s emotional shift but something else. </p><p>I ate the food while they continued to discuss their plans for the huge order for Lannayin to forge. Their discussion was interrupted by a huge bell, ringing. </p><p>“No, Falnaher. I don’t care. I can’t guarantee you a hundred Mortal-Peak Swords. Ten Peak, and ninety High grade is best, I promise. And you need to find me three fire-natured bone essence pills before I start. That’s the best I can agree,” Lannayin said. </p><p>“We will discuss more once the fights are over,” she said, and they both turned their attention to the field as two people walked toward the center, one wearing a tunic with a stylized wolf print, the other with some kind of demon. </p><p>“Muscle Reinforcement artists already?” Lannayin said. “Are they still fighting? I thought the city lord was supposed to interfere with it.” </p><p>“It’s difficult. Since the master of the Crane school is gone, the balance is ruined. The great schools don’t want to miss the opportunity.” </p><p>“A pity. I wonder how long Wolf Claw would be able to resist with only one Connate Master,” Lannayin said, but at that point, the fight had already begun. </p><p>I turned my attention to the battle as well. The disciple of the Wolf Fang School pulled his dagger and dashed forward, feeling just as dangerous as a wolf. I could see his essence gathering around his blade. The Demon Claw disciple easily deflected the dagger with his hands, his essence reinforcing some kind of metal plate covering his hands to resist the blow. </p><p>With that, an intense fight began. The way they fought was completely different. The Wolf Claw disciple was fast and agile, circling around repeatedly to find an opening, while the Demon Claw fought from a more stable position; both were determined to display the advantage of their fighting style to the limit. </p><p>I tried to capture the way they fought, but it didn’t work. It felt like trying to understand how a car worked by watching a car race. </p><p>So, I turned my attention to the external displays of their essence. The Wolf Claw disciple focused on exerting it outside to reinforce his dagger, while at the same time reinforcing his legs for enhanced speed. The Demon Claw disciple, on the other hand, focussed exclusively on his upper body, relying on the strength of his metal claws. </p><p>Their essence felt different as well. Rough and thorny for Demon Claw, sharp and bloody for Wolf Claw, but after having a deeper understanding of Volcano Hammer as well as Tiger Claw, I wasn’t surprised. The martial arts essences carried some kind of concept to reinforce its effects. </p><p>“Wow, a vicious blow,” Lannayin said. </p><p>“Really, do you mind explaining why?” I asked, enthusiastic about turning this into a lesson. </p><p>“Of course. The Demon Claw relies on—” Lannayin started, but Falnaher interrupted. </p><p>“I can’t watch the fight while you try to explain how to fight to a bookworm that doesn’t even know the basics of the Demon Claw,” she said as she looked at me with pure disdain. </p><p>“He’s from overseas. It’s normal that he’s not familiar with the styles,” Lannayin said, quick to my defense. </p><p>“He would have if he didn’t spend all his time reading books,” she said with disdain. She looked ready to kick me out, and I had a feeling that, if it wasn’t for her upcoming deal with Lannayin, she would have done so. She pulled a small booklet from the satchel, and passed it to me. “Here, all you need to know is here. Since you’re a scholar, you are supposed to be good with books. Just learn it from here,” she said. </p><p>Lannayin looked annoyed, but I took the booklet with a smile, happy with it. </p><p>Well, more accurately, I was happy with the chain of notifications I had received. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Insult Bonus - 10]</p><p>[60x Return - Tiger Fist Martial Art, Complete, Mortal-Low Grade]</p><p>[60x Return - Dragon Saber Martial Art, Complete, Mortal-Low Grade]</p><p>[60x Return - Demon Claw Martial Art, Complete, Mortal-Low Grade]</p><p>[60x Return - Crane Leg Martial Art, Complete, Mortal-Low Grade]</p><p>[60x Return - Wolf Fang Martial Art, Complete, Mortal-Low Grade]</p>",

    "content": "<p>It didn’t take long for me to realize I managed to jinx myself, because when I arrived back at my inn, I only came across the small luggage I had purchased, and Pearyin waiting for me with a sad expression on her face.  </p><p>“What’s going on?” I said with a frown. </p><p>“We have been kicked off,” she said. “I don’t know why, but the head waitress said something about offending the wrong people.” But, as she raised her arm, she flinched badly. </p><p>“Did someone beat you?” I asked, unable to keep my anger down. </p><p>“No, no!” she gasped, then blushed. “I have been practicing…” </p><p>Which was good, because I already had an idea about who was responsible for my kicking out. The last thing I needed was a reason to escalate. I could … but I didn’t want to unless I had no choice. To escalate, I had to break through, which would cost me my precious multiplier. </p><p>“You need to be more careful,” I said as touched her shoulder, and felt the strain of her body. My knowledge of medicine was limited, but I could feel that she had overdrawn the energy of her body. </p><p>She just needed rest. </p><p>“Follow me,” I said as I gestured to her and grabbed the luggage. </p><p>“Y-young master, you can’t carry it—” she started. </p><p>“Nonsense, just follow me,” I said. </p><p>I thought about going back to the inn and trying to get the advance I had paid, but decided against it. A refund wouldn’t trigger the system. Also, they didn’t force Pearyin into the servant contract again, which was more or less a sign that they didn’t want to offend me too much either. </p><p>I decided that it didn’t matter. A few gold coins were nothing after Lannayin’s not-so-subtle gift — though I wondered what she had been thinking by putting the money directly into my pouch? Maybe she thought I would just assume I had counted wrong. </p><p>However, I soon encountered two troubling situations, forcing me to care about more important things. One, there were two people following us, trying — and failing — to stay hidden. Two, several inns had already refused to admit us, even after I promised to offer double. </p><p>I realized that I might have miscalculated. It didn’t feel like something a mere disciple should be able to do. Either the disciple in question had another identity with more pull than I realized, or I had actually angered Elsana with my little trick. </p><p>Either way, it was troubling. If it wasn’t for Lannayin, I would have considered leaving the city. Instead, I waited until we were near an alley that I could use to disappear, lifted Pearyin into a bridal hold, and disappeared into the alley. </p><p>As for the luggage, I left it behind. It only had a few books and clothes, both completely useless. </p><p>“What’s going on?” she gasped. </p><p>“We’re just avoiding our pursuers,” I said. </p><p>“We are being followed?” she gasped. </p><p>“It looks like it,” I said. “Haven’t you heard anything about something about me,” I said. She blushed, and I realized she had heard the same gossip about my cowardly nature. “Anything specific about Snow Blossom disciples, and me rejecting their challenge,” I said. </p><p>“Nothing about that.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said. I would have expected that to turn into a bigger gossip, but I decided not to pay attention to that. After a few more turns, we stopped in an alley. “I will stay around, but it’ll get too complicated. Do you want me to help you get out of the city first? Or, do you have somewhere you can hide?” </p><p>She looked at me resolutely. “I want to stay with you and learn martial arts,” she said. </p><p>“Really?” I asked, surprised. “I don’t even know who I offended. It can be dangerous, and I might not be able to protect you.” </p><p>She looked at me with a surprising determination. “I’m willing to take the risk. This is the only opportunity for me to learn martial arts,” she said. </p><p>“If you say so,” I said. Then, I paused for a moment, and finally used the opportunity to trigger the forging lessons I had earlier, starting with the Ordinary Forging.   </p><p>The flood of information was … shocking. I already expected to learn quite a bit considering it covered quite a bit of information, but the amount still shocked me. In a second, I turned into an expert that I could forge anything I wanted as long as it didn’t include any essence. </p><p>I could easily forge something with Mortal Medium-Quality from ordinary steel as long as I worked hard … which meant I could earn tens of gold every day. Minor Accomplishment was truly fascinating, even when building ordinary equipment. </p><p>Then, I triggered the other class, and even more information flooded into my brain, mixing with the ones I had already received. Yet, despite receiving several times more information, I felt like I barely scratched the surface of Volcano Forging … which not only included far greater details in terms of materials, but required the ability to manipulate essence. </p><p>Meaning, it couldn’t be performed below the Muscle Reinforcement stage. </p><p>No wonder Lannayin was so proud of feeling like she could break into Minor Accomplishment. </p><p>I didn’t have a hammer, but I shook my hand while it was empty, trying to replicate the first four hammering moves, the practice techniques that corresponded to the Initiate stage … which was another reason for Lannayin’s lack of apprentices. </p><p>The hammer swings were weird. They couldn’t be used in combat, and the knowledge I received made it clear that they couldn’t be used for forging either. Meaning, that during the Initiate State, Volcano Hammer was useless.</p><p>Worse, as I practiced them, I felt my body get dangerously warm. Nothing I couldn’t handle now, but if someone tried to train themselves without sufficient talent, there was a high likelihood of injury.  </p><p>Maybe Lannayin’s lack of apprentice was not just about her poor teaching ability. </p><p>“I want you to practice the first stance again,” I said, and as she shifted to it, I caressed her back, using my limited massage abilities to assess her essence flow. My smile widened as I found what I had been looking for. </p><p>Volcano Hammer gave me a different perspective on how essence worked, allowing me to check her situation even better. </p><p>Cheating was the best. </p><p>I didn’t dare to manipulate her essence directly, but I could already feel some tricks to hasten her cultivation … and just like that, an interesting prospect appeared in my mind. </p><p>What would happen if I could help others breakthrough. Using System resources was problematic … but doing it directly would be different. But, first, a little test. </p><p>“Wait for me here, and continue practicing,” I said as reversed my shirt and messed my hair a bit. Enough that no one would link my looks to the arrogant young master. I could have put on a better disguise, but that was unnecessary. </p><p>I left Pearyin alone. Soon, I was at a street stall. “Hey, friend. I want eight skewers of savage beast meat,” I said. </p><p>“Twelve gold,” he said, which I paid promptly, though still shocked by the difference in prices. In a town, it was merely twenty-five silver, and here, one and a half gold for one. </p><p>He pulled eight skewers, but I pointed to two with lower quality, mixed with ordinary meat. “Not those two,” I said. </p><p>He said nothing, but realizing his little trick was caught, he changed it silently. Though, once he replaced that, I had to admit, the quality was decent. Almost Mortal Middle-Grade. </p><p>When I returned, I found Pearyin panting from exhaustion while she practiced. “Eat one,” I said, but she stopped halfway, already hitting her limit. </p><p>It was hard for an ordinary person to digest savage beast meat unless its quality was higher. “Now,” I said as I suddenly hugged her from behind, and put my hands on her stomach, massaging gently using the ordinary technique, but letting just a touch of warm essence slip through. </p><p>I was trying to see if I could use Volcano Hammer Technique to break the food in her stomach, something that I only dared because I knew it was safe. </p><p>Manipulating the food was much safer than manipulating the passive essence in her acupuncture. </p><p>“Now, it’s your turn to teach me, Master,” I whispered as I used the massage technique trying to help her digest the food, my essence, changed by the Volcano Technique, helping her to break down and absorb the essence locked in the savage beast meat and help her absorb it quickly. </p><p>Something that was supposed to be impossible without cooking the food of far higher quality. There was a reason they said Martial Arts were for the rich. </p><p>“Is it appropriate, young master—” she said as she looked around. </p><p>“No, call me student,” I said, preventing her potential tirade before she could start. </p><p>I had little hope to trigger a System return … but there was no harm in trying. </p><p>“Perfect your stance, Master,” I said even as I caressed her belly while I used the warm essence I had deciphered thanks to the brief lesson I had received from Lannayin. “Tell me if I’m doing anything wrong during the massage.” </p><p>She followed that suggestion,, her beautiful body trembling as my fingers infused her body. She looked spectacular enough that I regretted our current location. It could have been far more entertaining if we were in our room. </p><p>But, I still needed to go to the Arena thanks to Lannayin’s invitation, and see how people actually fought. I couldn’t afford to see the martial artists in action the first time when we fought. </p><p>Helping her digest and divert the energy through the modified technique turned out to be easier than I had expected … and even channeled the essence across her body, which increased her chances of making a breakthrough greatly, which, under more ordinary circumstances, required weeks even for the geniuses based on the information I collected. </p><p>Then, I realized the problem. The essence I had gathered in my chest had dwindled significantly. I had spent over ten times the energy that had been contained in her body. </p><p>Unfortunately, this time, I failed to trigger the System. </p><p>Luckily, at this point, I could easily afford the payment. I helped her digest all the food I had purchased, leading her body to brim with excess energy. </p><p>“Now, let’s find a place to live,” I said. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After seeing Elsana’s Apothecary, I had some expectations for Lannayin’s forge, expecting to find another walled compound, filled with a small army of disciples and servants. The location of it, near the center of the city, didn’t change it. </p><p>To my surprise, I found a sole, almost ruined building, with its immediate surroundings empty. It looked like someone had transported the building from some kind of ruin. If it wasn’t for the signboard in the front, Volcano Forge, I would have thought that I arrived at the wrong location. </p><p>The signboard was as potent as the Snow Blossom Apothecary. Just by looking, I fell into a boiling heat wave, forcing me to look away. </p><p>The door was closed, with a sign marking the place as closed. I knocked on the door despite not having an invitation. Lannayin was a direct woman, and I used it to my benefit. I had to knock three times before I received an answer. “Who is it?” a strained voice came from inside, one that gave me an interesting nugget of information. </p><p>Martial Experts also suffered from hangovers. She still sounded sleepy. </p><p>“This is Scholar Arthanum, from the previous evening’s feast,” I answered, but I was already prepared to leave. My surprise visit was already pushing it without waking her up from her sleep. And, when there was no answer, I turned to leave. </p><p>Before I could take a step away, the door opened. No one was on the other side. “Come in,” she shouted from inside. </p><p>I entered, taking a glimpse of the place. I expected to find a storefront, maybe a few servants. </p><p>There was only one person inside. Lannayin, currently leaning against the forge. The hangover was affecting her hard. She still wore the same clothes she did the night before. They didn’t look messy, like they were slept in, but I assumed it was more about the superior quality of her clothes than anything else. </p><p>“What are you doing here?” she asked, though her tone was more surprised than scathing. </p><p>“Master Elsana had invited me to lunch —” I started. </p><p>“That bitch, trying to win the bet,” Lannayin growled, followed by a slight expression of panic realizing she had slipped something. The subject of the bet was easy to guess. </p><p>“Did you say something?” I asked, acting like I didn’t hear what she said, acting like I didn’t understand what she had been driving at. I didn’t want to ruin the excellent setup they created for me. </p><p>“Nothing, continue. You were saying Elsana had invited you to lunch? Why are you here, then?” she asked, though I didn’t miss her push out her considerable chest with pride. </p><p>“I already wanted to come here, but I didn’t dare to ignore the invitation from a Master of her stature,” I said, shamelessly lying while also admitting to being a coward. She had an expression of disdain on her face, not liking my cowardly admission. </p><p>“Then, what happened?” she said. </p><p>“Well, one of her disciples was at the door, trying to challenge me to enter,” I said. </p><p>“Don’t tell me that you were cowardly enough not to dare fight one of her soft disciples. They are nothing in a fight.” </p><p>“Of course not. But, since I already preferred my time with a fascinating expert Blacksmith, I used it as an excuse and tested my fortune instead.” It was a stretch, but last night had already shown that she was rather gullible, and targeting her pride was an easy way to make some headway. </p><p>However, tricking her was not as easy as it first sounded. She might be gullible, but she also looked reckless enough to punish someone when angered. And, if someone truly targeted her, they still would have to worry about her friend Elsana’s reaction. </p><p>“You are interested in forging, really?” she said, excited. “Really?” </p><p>“Well, not the forging directly, but the techniques behind it. I’m a mere scholar, after all,” I said. She looked dissatisfied, so I revealed a bit more. “For example, I’m fascinated by the way the low but continuous blows, combined with the endless blows, could be used to extract the essence out of silver to reinforce the Initiate stage weapons designed for martial artists,” I said, using some information from the System reward. </p><p>It was actually a technique that belonged to her Volcano Hammer Forging Technique, but I didn’t reveal my full knowledge. Just enough to convince her I was not a complete beginner with forging. </p><p>I was afraid of revealing too much and make her expecting things from me. The ability to trigger the System through Pampering had been nice, but I didn’t know whether it triggered despite Pearyin expecting my help … or due to the fact that she had forgotten everything but pleasure at that moment.</p><p>Or maybe, she had just lost herself in the role of the Master enough to convince the System.</p><p>Unlike her, Lannayin wasn’t a blushing virgin who would forget everything at the moment she faced with a little pleasure. Worse, just by looking around the state of her living space — a true mess everywhere but the forge, which was flawless — I could see that she had cared about her job more than anything. </p><p>I would have no hope of actually triggering the System if she believed that the discussion between us was an exchange of information. I wanted to know more about forging, not because I wanted to make an honest living, but because I wanted to prepare for the future. </p><p>If there was a problem, no one would assume that an arrogant and lazy young master and a mysteriously skilled blacksmith were the same person. Making preparations for the future was the smart thing to do.</p><p>Her babbling about a topic to seduce me and win her bet was far more appropriate to trigger the System. Hopefully, it would be enough not to trigger any kind of suspicion out of her, and even allow me to focus on getting some lessons out of her. </p><p>Even more importantly, as long as I maintained her good mood, I could get a few more gifts, and rely on the System to multiply it further. </p><p>I had the time to slowly think and consider all. At the moment, she was convinced about my interest, she started talking about forging, powering through her hangover. She was hesitant at first, but as she saw my fascinated expression, she continued talking about the finer points of forging. </p><p>Unlike the last time, she wasn’t drunk … but that made it tracking her talk even more. Whenever she asked me a question, I had to answer with a poem to distract her from the fact that I didn’t even understand her point, followed by a few pointed questions to drive the discussion back to the basics. </p><p>I was glad that I had spent some time reading the books Pearyin collected for me, which allowed me to know which topic was basic, and which topic was advanced, therefore changing the topics accordingly. </p><p>“It’s such a pity that I don’t have any fate with forging,” I sighed when she finished yet another complicated explanation, and during that, forged a simple dagger. I continued mentioning my pity not to lose her emotional investment even though she continued to flirt with me in her own unique way. </p><p>“Here, take it,” she said once she attached a hilt. The dagger was small and easy to hide, and it looked fascinating. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Volcano Steel Dagger, Yellow Medium-Grade]</p><p>I smiled as I accepted it, though my happiness was more about the multiplier I had received from her gift than the gift itself. It was merely a Mortal High-Grade weapon — though it could still be sold for a hundred gold.</p><p>I wasn’t wasting my time for nothing. </p><p>Once she gifted me the dagger, I asked her another question about ordinary forging, and kept the class going. The more interested I looked at her explanation, the more passionate she got about explaining; which was understandable, as she was truly a terrible teacher, jumping between topics without a warning, assuming a higher level of knowledge without prompting. </p><p>I was starting to believe that her lack of apprentices was not a choice. </p><p>She only stopped talking when she noticed the sky was darkening. She gasped. “I forgot. I have a meeting at the city lord’s manor,” she gasped, looking regretful. </p><p>Ending the lesson and triggering the System response once more. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Ordinary Forging Technique Lesson, Beginner - Minor Accomplishment]</p><p>[70x Return - Volcano Forging Technique Lesson, Initiate, Beginner]</p><p>[70x Return - Volcano Forging Technique Lesson, Muscle Reinforcement, Beginner]</p><p>“It was fun,” I said, doing my best to see that I hadn’t spent hours trying not to fall asleep listening to the lesson I understood nothing. Then, I took a deep breath, and sighed in despair while I mumbled a statement. I tried to make it look like I was talking to myself, but I knew she could hear that easily. </p><p>“I wish I could stay here a few days longer, but I’m almost out of money.” </p><p>Her eyes widened as she heard that, but said nothing while she played with her hammer. But, when she passed next to me, I felt a sense of pressure in my pouch. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - 700 Gold Piece]</p><p>Just like that, I was rich. </p><p>I hid my elation while she returned to her earlier location. “It has been fun, talking to someone that appreciates the art of forging,” she commented. “Do you have anything to do tonight?” I shook my head. “Good,” she said as she flicked some kind of token toward me, one that didn’t trigger the System return. “I have a room reserved for tonight’s fight. Come watch it with me.” </p><p>“It would be my pleasure,” I said, giving a soft bow before leaving. </p><p>Surprised by how easy my trip was shaping up.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Now, the first thing about the Forest Dance technique is the basic stance,” I said as I put my hand on her back, and she shivered. Of course, what I called Forest Dance was the mixture of Judo and Aikido that I could remember, modified through my newfound combat talent. </p><p>Feeling like a genius was fun. </p><p>“Is it supposed to feel awkward and uncomfortable?” she asked, still hesitant. </p><p>“Yes,” I said as I took the same stance, feeling like I was a tree, impossible to uproot. “The basic stance is what everything grows from. If the root is weak, the rest will be unstable,” I said, once again relying on weird phrases to sound wiser. </p><p>When in Rome… </p><p>“Understood,” she said as she repeated the stance, following my words with rapt attention. I put my hand on her spine, correcting her stance … and felt her essence react. It was merely a flicker and nothing more. </p><p>Ironically, only through my growing knowledge of massage, I knew exactly what to look for. Massaging was the art of manipulating the acupunctures of the others, which allowed me to feel the subtle flow of her essence. </p><p>But I didn’t dare to manipulate it directly, afraid of creating some kind of problem. Instead, I gave several direct advice. “Try to tighten your leg muscles a bit more, shift your center…” </p><p>It helped her fix her posture, but her essence didn’t react as much as I hoped. So, I copied the style of Tiger Fist Manuscript. “The basic stance embodies the harmony of the world. A tree standing tall, resisting the rain, flood, and storms. As long as the roots are planted on the ground correctly, a tree is immovable and invincible.” </p><p>I still mixed some ordinary corrections with the poems and indirect descriptions. The movement of her essence sped up slightly, suggesting that we were on the right path. “Good. Don’t forget. You’re rooted to the ground, yet you’re open and adaptable. Your mind and body are united in the search for inner peace.” </p><p>Why we needed to punch things to attain inner peace was a mystery to me, but I didn’t question it. The ability to punch through the walls was hard to argue against. I continued explaining to her the basic stance for half an hour.</p><p>“Continue practicing it,” I said as I sat down, once again pulling my book on various plants. “Don’t forget, that true mastery takes time and dedication. Be patient with yourself and never give up.” </p><p>She nodded, and I started reading. I expected her to get bored after a few minutes and start asking how to throw people around, and interrupt me. Of course, it was not something I would have bothered with … but that didn’t apply when it came to her. She worked hard enough to earn my goodwill. </p><p>Moreover, I still had a selfish motive. I wanted to see if I could still trigger the pampering effect … and for that, she needed to feel spoiled. </p><p>So, before she started asking — or stopped working on Martial Arts and started seducing me as the easier path — I wanted to read as much as possible about herbs, medicine, and pill refining based on beginner knowledge. </p><p>To my surprise, she didn’t complain in the slightest, and constantly repeated the same stance while allowing me to study. It looked like I had misjudged the attraction of Martial Arts to her, even after underselling the benefits of my teaching. </p><p>With Pearyin lost in her own training, I kept focused on my work, only taking occasional breaks to correct her mistakes. </p><p>Then, it was time to visit Master Apothecary Elsana. </p><p>“Continue practicing the basic stance,” I said. “If you impress me enough, I’ll show to the first move.” </p><p>With that, I went to the wardrobe to put on a different outfit, and she walked toward me to help. “Continue practicing,” I said as I quickly changed. Letting someone else dress me felt weird. </p><p>As I left the inn, I could see a lot of other waitresses looking at me, but I ignored them. Pearyin was an unexpected development, and I didn’t want to end up trying to bring around a squad of maids around. </p><p>Rather than calling for a carriage, I walked, and to check the city and see if there was any opportunity to trigger the System. </p><p>As I walked, I was met with a surprise. People were talking about me. </p><p>I expected people to gossip about me somewhat after the last night, but the number and the intensity shocked me … and it was mostly negative. There were already some talks about me being a useless rich playboy that will suck up to rich and powerful the moment I faced some adversity.</p><p>The word mooch, wastrel, and prodigal were being thrown around quite a bit. </p><p>Apparently, my upcoming visit to the Apothecary had turned into public knowledge, and been discussed with a negative slant. It wasn’t inaccurate per se, not after Elsana’s expression while inviting me, but that didn’t make it any less of a surprise. </p><p>Gossip shouldn’t feel this unified. It felt deliberate. </p><p>Why? How? I had no idea, but I left that to the expert in question. She was the one that invited me in both cases. Gossip was her problem more than mine.  </p><p>As for being called names… Well, it wasn’t like they were inaccurate. I was going to visit to visit a strong and prestigious woman, for the express purpose of keeping her happy and receiving a few gifts in response. I wasn’t going to convince myself and act like it was something I wouldn’t have done without the System.</p><p>I expected the gossip to slow down once I got away from the inn, expecting the gossip to be centered on my temporary residence. The opposite happened, and the closer I got to my destination, the more people gossiped about my shamelessness, providing me with a wonderful theory about the source of the gossip.  </p><p>Therefore, I wasn’t surprised when I arrived at my destination, Snow Blossom Apothecary, I wasn’t surprised to find there was a tall, intimidating man watching me with angry eyes. He was clearly a Martial Artist, but how strong, I wasn’t sure. His white tunic with the word Snow Blossom etched marked him as a member of the place. </p><p>The moment I saw him, I knew he would try to block my passage, likely by challenging me into combat, but I acted unaware of that and walked at a leisurely pace, using the opportunity to examine the place that had suppressed my already high expectations. </p><p>I expected a large building. Maybe two, one functioning as a shop, the other a house. After all, the Apothecary was close to the center of the city, which represented prime real estate. </p><p>It was why I had been surprised to see a vast complex that covered about ten acres, with its tall yet elegant walls. There was only one gate from the direction I approached, and on top of it, there was a signboard with the name. </p><p>The writing was mysterious. Just by reading the name Snow Blossom, I felt a chill hit me, as I had stepped onto a chilly mountaintop. That feeling disappeared once I looked away. </p><p>It was not the most mysterious thing I had ever seen since my arrival, but seeing mere letters having that kind of impact was something else. </p><p>Soon, I arrived at the entrance. “I’m here for a meeting with Master Elsana,” I said, doing my best to keep my tone light, yet respectful. </p><p>“A worthless leech like you can’t enter here,” he declared. “This is Snow Blossom Apothecary! Take this and never darken those steps,” he said as he threw a gold coin to the ground. An insult from his perspective. A treasure from mine. </p><p>As he said that, he raised his fist, ready to fight. I would have been surprised by the exact sequence if it was my first day, but I had understood enough about the culture of this new world to understand that it was an indirect challenge. He expected me to challenge him after that insult, and once he defeated me, his social status would rise. </p><p>He couldn’t kill me in such a challenge, but broken bones were acceptable. </p><p>“Alright then,” I said, as I refused it. Technically, rejecting would have a negative impression on my reputation, but I didn’t care. Instead, I bent down to pick up the gold. I hoped he felt pity to trigger the return … but even if he did not, gold was gold. </p><p>[Insult Bonus - 100 (Capped)]</p><p>[100x Return - 10 Gold Pieces]</p><p>I paused a moment in front of him, surprised by the unexpected discovery from the System besides confirming his cultivation was equal to, or lower. </p><p>Neither changed my plan. I turned and started walking away, though I watched him from the corner of my eyes, ready to dodge in case he attacked me from behind. It wouldn’t be honorable to start a fight without an official challenge, but I wouldn’t rely on the perceived honor of a man I didn’t know for my safety. </p><p>He froze, unable to react for a moment. “W-what do you mean, alright?” he said. </p><p>I smirked. The ethics surrounding ritualized combat wasn’t the only thing I had learned. What he was trying to do was tricky. There would be no big consequences for him as long as I accepted his challenge. Even defeat had a different context. But, there were more painful things I could pull. “It means I didn’t know the true master of the Snow Blossom Apothecary disapproved of my visit. Since you can refuse entry to someone who was invited by the exalted Apothecary Elsana, who am I to fight against you?” </p><p>He clearly wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, and it took a moment for him to understand what I meant. I was already near an alley when what I did clicked, and he started chasing me. </p><p>The moment I took a turn, I started running as well, taking the first sharp turn before he could arrive. </p><p> I didn’t know if my cultivation was faster, or if it was the running technique I came up with, but I was much faster than him, so a few sharp turns through emptier streets were enough to leave him behind.</p><p>His reaction showed that Elsana had not ordered him to keep me out, but she might have implicitly ignored it as an opportunity to test me … but that wasn’t my problem. I was willing to jump through some hoops to receive her attention, but fighting through a gauntlet of self-important martial artists was not one of them.  </p><p>Once I finished that, I picked an alternative path, wondering if Blacksmith Lannayin would appreciate a surprise visit. </p><p>If not, they were not the only rich and bored ladies determined to show off their status.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up when my bed partner started stirring. </p><p>Another benefit of martial arts skills, a couple of hours of sleep was enough to feel refreshed, as long as I didn’t push myself too much with martial techniques and deplete too much essence. </p><p>Then, I looked at the beauty in my arms, and couldn’t help but wonder what would happen now that she lost her virginity. Considering just how aggressively she had been pushing to seduce me, it caught me flatfooted. </p><p>It probably had a lot of social implications, but I left it for the future. Ultimately, the situation was simple. Either she was trying to be adventurous and making a poor call in her excitement, or she was trying to trap me into marriage. If the former was the case, I should be strong enough to save her from the consequences even now, let alone once I received a few more rewards. </p><p>And, even if the latter was true, I was sure I could still escape in a way that still left her happy. </p><p>I owed her. Not just for teaching massage while triggering the System, but also helping me by inadvertently helping me to discover a new feature of the System. </p><p>[Pampering Bonus - 25 (Capped)]</p><p>[25x Return - Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Familiarity]</p><p>Not only Pampering had a better multiplier, but it was easier to trigger consistently. An excellent reward. </p><p>I didn’t know if Pampering and Pity could be triggered together, but even if they did, it wasn’t something that could be triggered in her easily. The only reason she pitied me was a very long and complicated story about distress, temporarily making her forget that, even with that, I was far luckier in life. </p><p>While she lay, still wrapped by the towel, I triggered the lesson, and once again felt a new set of information settle into my mind, turning me into a true expert in ordinary massage. However, the fact that it was just called Minor Familiarity surprised me.</p><p>This new world clearly had a higher idea about what should be counted as true expertise.  </p><p>I wondered if the impact would be far more pronounced if I manipulated the essence during the massage … but I didn’t want to experiment on my partner. The lesson on medicine had taught me just how dangerous manipulating essence wrongly could have been. </p><p>Soon, she woke up. She shuffled comfortably. I watched her expression carefully, while I kept my hand on her back. A gentle position that nonetheless allowed me to check her heartbeat. I wanted to see if she tried to trick me. </p><p>I might not be planning to punish her, but that didn’t mean I would let her play me for a fool. </p><p>Then, the moment she woke up, her eyes widened in shock. Her heartbeat picked up as well, which told me that her panic was not fake. “G-good morning, young—” she started as her panic turned into despair. </p><p>“No more talk of it, Master,” I said as I leaned to kiss her cheek, but slow enough to allow her to pull back if she wanted. I was aware that, with her social situation, it might be tricky to reject me outright. </p><p>She leaned into the kiss, her expression losing some of its intensity, replaced by hope. I said nothing once I pulled back from the kiss, and just hugged her tight. She said nothing as well, but her hug was desperate. </p><p>“Now, Master. Why don’t you tell me what you have in mind?” I said, and she trembled. “Tell me. I promise I won’t be angry,” I consoled her … but I had to repeat a variation of it for almost five minutes for her to relax. </p><p>“I … I tried to seduce you,” she finally admitted. I barely held back a joke about a successful mission, and only because she was too tense. “I wanted you to free me from my servant contract to make me a concubine...” </p><p>It took a while for me to get the rest of the details, but it soon turned clear. Apparently, she had been a serf from a small family in the village, but beautiful enough for it to be dangerous in a world where laws were more of a suggestion for the powerful. </p><p>She signed a servant contract with some kind of warped recruitment company that trained her and put her in the current upscale inn. A girl was supposed to collect enough money to free themselves, but the girl in my arms had a father with a gambling problem, which prevented her from collecting the money. </p><p>Now, with her contract was about to be over, she was desperate. She was afraid of which business would buy her contract next, pushing her into a complete unknown. </p><p>I also subtly asked a few more questions subtly, to understand exactly what a concubine was. I knew it was some kind of lower-ranked wife — which was a weird concept to me — but that was the extent. Researching marriage laws hadn’t been my biggest priority. I just knew that polygamy was the law. </p><p>Her explanation surprised me, and not in a good way. </p><p>Apparently, while wives had some legal protections  — far less than I would have expected — concubines had next to none. The husband in question could order a concubine to live in a wooden hut for the rest of her life and only give her enough food to survive, and she had to follow the arrangement of her husband. </p><p>“Tell me, do you want to be a concubine, or do you want to be free of the servant contract?” I asked. </p><p>“Being your concubine would be an honor—” she said, before I interrupted her. </p><p>“That was not my question, Master,” I said, using the term just to relax her. </p><p>“I want to be free,” she admitted after a long pause. </p><p>“Alright. You have taught me how to massage, and as a scholar, I have to pay it back,” I promised. “How much is to free you from that contract?” </p><p>“F-fifty gold,” she said, looking hesitant. </p><p>“Coins or pieces?” I asked. </p><p>“C-coins, of course,” she answered, like it was obvious. It was not. The economy here was weird. </p><p>“Good, I will handle it,” I said, but I didn’t pass the money immediately. “Will the inn put it in my tab?” I asked. “Yes, young master,” she said. “After the last night, they will definitely give you face.”  </p><p>“Excellent. Do I need to tell them, or can you arrange it?” I said. </p><p>“I can arrange, young master,” she said. </p><p>“Good. Do that,” I said. I didn’t give the money from the System directly unless I had some other choice, because I didn’t know how it would be treated. I didn’t want the System rewards to block once more. </p><p>With my upcoming visit, I should be able to get enough to make that not a concern … and if not, I could always bring her away and escape the city. </p><p>“And then?” she asked, trying to push down her excitement. </p><p>“You’re free to do whatever you want,” I said. “You can go back to your home, stay in the city, whatever you want,” I said. </p><p>She looked at me. “M-may I stay with you?” she asked. </p><p>“You can stay here until I leave the city, but I won’t take you with me,” I said. I wanted to help her because she helped me with the System, but I was not looking for a long-term girlfriend. “Do as you wish. You’re a free woman.” </p><p>“I … I will stay with you until you leave,” she said, her face looking determined. </p><p>“Go and handle your business then, Master,” I said, the term enough to bolster her confidence. </p><p>Once she dressed and left, I reached for the book that described the common herbs, their harvesting methods, and the other stuff. </p><p>She returned barely ten minutes later, excited as she passed the contract at me, but her tenseness returned once I started reading the servant contract with a frown on my face. I frowned, not because the contract was difficult, but because I didn’t like the punishment clauses embedded.  </p><p>What a merciless world. </p><p>I ripped the contract, and she gave me a big smile. “Now… Pearyin,” I started, chuckling slightly as I realized I didn’t have the opportunity to ask her name, and had to learn from the contract. “Any plans?” She shook her head. “Why don’t you sit down and read a book?” I said. She froze. “What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“I don’t know how to read, young master,” she said, quick to panic like she had made some big mistake. </p><p>I had an hour to kill. “Come here, I’ll teach you,” I said, and she looked excited. “Or, would you prefer if I taught you martial arts?” I said. Not the Tiger Fist, of course, but I was sure that I could teach her some basic takedown moves based on what I remembered from a smattering of judo and aikido, enough to bring her to Intermediate Initiate if she had the potential to learn. </p><p>I broke through boxing, after all. </p><p>“You would teach me martial arts?” she gasped. </p><p>“Sure,” I said. “Making a breakthrough is not likely, but it should be enough to at least defend yourself in an emergency,” I said, not mentioning anything about helping her reach the Initiate stage. </p><p>I assumed it was possible, but it was not a certainty. </p><p>I didn’t like over-promising. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Her gasp turned even more beautiful as I stood up and she took the full view of my nude body. I had worked hard to sculpt it to perfection even before my arrival, and my martial abilities helped me to look even better. Even the other martial artists didn’t have a body as sculpted at me, because my workouts after my injury were more focused on how I looked than actually looking functional. </p><p>“Get on the bed, Master,” I ordered, and she shivered once more. The enjoyment she drove from the title of respect was far more intense than I expected. </p><p>It was probably about the social context. With the rigid social context, it was one of the things that the people in this world simply didn’t do. It was like a deeply religious person cursing in the name of god, forbidden. </p><p>And, just like a lot of forbidden things, it was even more exciting in the bedroom. Her hips sashayed as she walked toward the bed, her ass swaying attractively. Halfway in, her dress slipped, and her attractiveness multiplied. </p><p>A lithe body, not a drop of excess weight, a smooth skin … she looked spectacular as she lay on her back. “Come here, my apprentice,” she whispered throatily, her tone seductive yet desperate. </p><p>I followed her rapidly and climbed onto the bed. Her legs parted open invitingly, ready to forget about the massaging. I was tempted as well, but two things stopped me. First, it was important for me to actually put the things I had learned into practice for both the ordinary technique, and the Mortal Low-Grade technique. </p><p>Also, foreplay was even more fun when my partner was moaning and squirming for more. </p><p>“Let me show you how much I learned, Master,” I said, and she shivered again. I put my hand between her shoulders, starting the massage like she had taught … and my fingers danced smoothly. After all, it wasn’t the first time I was massaging a sexy lady. </p><p>For the first section, I kept myself limited to an ordinary massage, strictly following her suggestions without using any of the Essence Tricks. I wanted to focus on what she could teach me first. </p><p>“Now, Master. Tell me, what am I doing wrong?” I said without stopping my massage. </p><p>“T-there’s not much to tell,” she said, which turned into a moan as my hands slipped to her shoulders. “Are you sure it’s the first time?” </p><p>“I’m a quick learner,” I said, cutting that track quickly. I didn’t need her questioning my learning speed. “Now, tell me.” </p><p>She paused for a moment, took a deep breath, then started talking. “While focusing on the shoulder, stay a little longer, until the blood flow recovers…” </p><p>I caressed her naked body for almost two hours, and she continued giving advice … which got more and more limited as it went, the things she could catch getting fewer and fewer. Ultimately, she was not a true expert, but a waitress with some extra skills. </p><p>“I … I think that’s all I can correct,” she moaned once I pressed her inner thigh, a moan escaping as she parted her legs. “Your Master needs her reward!”   </p><p>[Pampering Bonus - 25 (Capped)]</p><p>[25x Return - Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Familiarity]</p><p>“Very well,” I said, glad that her face was still buried in the pillow, so she missed my shocked expression. I didn’t expect to system to give me a different bonus. </p><p>Pampering. </p><p>A new, mysterious feature, one that I would pay attention to in the future. First, I need to reward my beautiful waitress properly. I was tempted to put my head between her legs and reward her, but after an hour of naked massage, she didn’t look like she had the patience for it. </p><p>I made things a little more fun. “Now, let your apprentice show how glad he is to have such a beautiful master,” I said as I flipped her, finally giving myself a beautiful view of her body. Her legs parted open, with my knees in between to close them. </p><p>I grabbed her hair. She moaned, which died quickly when I pressed my lips against hers, cutting it short. My tongue jumped into her mouth, and she accepted greedily … though I was surprised. She was surprisingly unskilled when it came to kissing. </p><p>I pushed my hips forward, only to realize her lack of experience was not too surprising. “Are you—” I asked, only for her to look at me shyly and nod. Which was a surprise, as I certainly didn’t expect for it to be her first time. </p><p>It probably had a lot of social implications, but I left it for the future, and focused on my pleasure. “Sexy,” I said as I leaned for another kiss, enjoying her enthusiasm. She might not be skilled, but she was sexy and enthusiastic enough for it not to matter. </p><p>Her body trembled, and a breath escaped her mouth explosively as her body parted to accommodate my presence. I pushed slowly even as I brought my hand against her entrance, which enhanced her pleasure even more, adding a little excitement to the monotony of the missionary position. </p><p>There was a reason the classics maintained their popularity. </p><p>I let her get used to my presence as I started kissing her neck slowly and steadily, and once she was used to my presence, I picked up speed. She tried to moan and cry, and it was only my lips that prevented her from alerting the rest of the inn. </p><p>As I moved back and forth at a steady pace, it didn’t take long for her to climax, her body rocking in pleasure. Inevitable, considering our long foreplay and her lack of experience. I would have continued, but I was merciful and pulled out. </p><p>I lay next to her and pulled her to my chest while she gasped, trying to control the shaking of her body. “D-does it supposed to feel this good?” she whispered. “I … I heard it was supposed to be painful.” </p><p>Not the most appropriate question. “It is when it’s with me,” I said smugly. Regardless of the circumstances, I always treated keeping my lovers happy and satisfied as a matter of pride. “Now that you had your break, let’s continue,” I said as I flipped her, pinning her prone under me as I slid in and out repeatedly. “Now, how does this feel, Master?” I whispered, fascinated by the way she tightened the moment I called her Master. </p><p>Even though our current position certainly didn’t feel like she was the one that’s teaching. </p><p>I wondered if the sexy and trained way she could walk could be translated into a proper cowgirl position. She had a lithe, elegant body, but she still had the assets to make it fun. “F-faster,” she whispered a while later, unaware of my plans. </p><p>“As you wish, Master,” I said, enjoying her reactions as she received the benefits of her passive positions to the limit. I lowered my head to nibble her neck, the combination forcing her to pull the pillow close and bury her face to suppress her cries. </p><p>I was already planning to test several more positions, but the ragged nature of her breathing changed my mind. She was already getting overwhelmed, and I didn’t want to exaggerate it too much. </p><p>Instead, I brought my lips higher and nibbled her ear. “Climax for me, Master,” I ordered, and she did, her sudden gushing enough to push me over the hill as well. Unfortunately, as much as filling her was tempting, my situation was complicated enough without adding the complication of a child. </p><p>I pulled out, painting her back with seed … and the moment I did, I felt her back being covered with a generous dose of Essence as well.</p><p>An amount that would have put a sense of urgency at me if my Inventory wasn’t filled with a lot of high-essence food to compensate for it. </p><p>“So, that was fun,” I said as I collapsed next to her, waiting for the other shoe to drop about her virginity, but she said nothing. Couldn’t say anything, I realized, as the climax had proved too much, pushing her to the land of unconsciousness. </p><p>A good idea, I decided, leaving the potential problems to future me. I put on underwear and wrapped a towel around her in case she was one of the girls who felt self-conscious about her nudity. Then, I closed my eyes, pulled her against my chest, and fell asleep. It was almost morning, and I wanted to sleep for a couple of hours before waking up to study. </p><p>I still had a lot of work to do.  </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>There was another hot bath prepared in my room. A nice touch. My excessive generosity was showing its benefits. </p><p>I didn’t expect a knock on the door barely half an hour later. “Your books are here, young master,” the waitress said. “May I come in?” </p><p>“Yes, come in,” I said, not bothering to leave the bath. The bathroom door was open as well, but the flower petals had covered the surface to make the scene acceptable. “Bring the books here,” I said, not wanting to leave the comfort of my bath. </p><p>After camping for over ten days, the comforts of civilization were too good to resist. </p><p>She entered, a small pile of books in her hands. Eight, I counted. Not a bad number, but something else than the books had caught my attention. She had changed her outfit, something that might have been appropriate looking when tied correctly, but certain parts of it had loosened while she had been carrying books, creating a large slit that revealed her soft thigh to an inappropriate amount. </p><p>Even if I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume it was an accident, I could not, as she also found time to reapply her makeup. </p><p>Someone was determined to put in some extra service. </p><p>Risky, but tempting. </p><p>“I have found those books, young master,” she said as put them on a chair, using the opportunity to make her top slide, and give me a deep glimpse of her cleavage. </p><p>Daring, and tempting. I thought about accepting her invitation … but then, I wondered whether I could hit two birds with one stone, and test the System more while also relaxing a little. “Massage my shoulders. I’m feeling stressed,” I ordered. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said enthusiastically, and moved behind me. But, as she moved behind me, she adjusted her clothing a little more, widening her cleavage. She had a clear idea of how the night would end. </p><p>I had a different idea … maybe not about the final destination, but certainly about the path that I had to go. Instead of pulling her in the bath like she expected, I grabbed one of the books about apothecary techniques that looked simplest, and started reading with rapt attention … even huffing and puffing in the process. </p><p>Reading about the absolute basics of pill refinement was an interesting experience after the System’s advanced lesson. </p><p>I was never the most efficient student when studying alone — or in general — and the book I was reading was written poorly enough to make it even more difficult. It wasn’t filled with mysterious poems and diagrams like the Martial Arts technique, but that wasn’t enough to make it a good book. That the concepts that were described in the book went against every scientific principle that I remembered from the occasional biology class I dropped by was supposed to make it even harder.  </p><p>Yet, I could understand the weird concepts with surprising efficiency, even catching several mistakes. </p><p>It wasn’t a stretch to assume that the System-assisted lesson handled my sudden burst of insights. Just like it did for cooking, it allowed me to generate some kind of intuition that required some serious effort to develop. </p><p>Unfortunately, it differed from the sensation I received when I had been reading the Tiger Fist manuscript. At that time, even the most troublesome parts felt like they could be deciphered as long as I practiced for a while. Like I was a veritable genius. I already knew that it was the benefit of the Martial Aptitude pill. </p><p>A benefit that clearly didn’t include herbology. </p><p>Luckily, my cheat wasn’t just one time. </p><p>I wanted to add skills for two reasons. First, as far as I could tell, based on my experiments, the System only cared about the cultivation stage and not my power. It was something I noticed during the week I worked with Marana. By working on the Initiate realm punches of the Tiger Fist repeatedly, my potential combat effectiveness rose significantly, yet there was no change in the cultivation multiplier. </p><p>Since I was afraid of increasing my cultivation realm, adding new skills was a good way to increase my safety. The attempt to drag me back into the inn was a good warning. At that time, I was saved by my enhanced senses, but I might not be that lucky the next time. </p><p>Also, there was a flip side to it. I could also use poison to defend myself. I still wasn’t sure whether I could kill someone even if I faced personal danger, but using a mild poison that would leave them unconscious for a moment was far more acceptable. </p><p>As for the System, convincing people to gift me sleeping drugs and poisons might be more difficult than making them give me a book. </p><p>The second advantage was equally important. I wasn’t planning to stay in Markas forever. In the next city, I could try to pull the young scholar's role again … but that had its limits. More skills meant a bigger flexibility. </p><p>With everything concluded in my mind, I turned my attention back to the massage I had been receiving. Her hands were dancing on my shoulders skillfully enough to show that she had been trained.</p><p>I wanted to ask her to teach me. But not immediately. First, I needed to put her in the right frame of mind. </p><p>It was why, while I had been reading about the apothecary, I was making a point of acting stressed and desperate; turning the pages sharply, gasping, groaning… All to somehow trigger the pity of the waitress, which was difficult considering that, from her perspective, I was more fortunate. </p><p>Difficult, but not impossible. </p><p>Back on Earth, I remembered many women pitying their favorite celebrity because of their difficulties, even if said difficulties were trivial. Considering the interest she had been showing me was outside her job definition, I hoped to trigger a similar effect. A useful experiment to better understand the limitations of the system. </p><p>More importantly, it would give me a very useful skill. </p><p>“I’m ruined,” I muttered as I slammed the book close, doing my best to sound desperate, acting like I had forgotten her presence. </p><p>Rude, but she didn’t seem to mind. “I-is there something I could do to help, young master?” she said, her concern genuine. It felt believable. </p><p>I sighed. “I didn’t expect to get the attention of two dangerous masters. Now, I need to impress them, or I’m ruined …” My words and tone implied some significant negative consequences, which certainly didn’t exist, but I needed to distract her. </p><p>I couldn’t afford her asking for payment once I asked her to teach me to massage, or the System wouldn’t trigger. Worse, it couldn’t even her expect that implicitly, or fear the consequences of rejecting, or the System wouldn’t trigger. </p><p>Freeloader System, indeed. </p><p>“A-actually,” I stammered, doing my best to sound small and pathetic, trying to elicit her sense of pity deep enough to overwhelm everything else. I even turned my best puppy-eyes gaze at her. “C-can you teach me how to massage? Maybe it would help?” </p><p>“Of course, young master,” she said, her face shining with sympathy. It looked like a success, but I said nothing, just maintained that desperate expression. “The first thing you need to know for a good massage is the general location of eight gates and one hundred and eight acupunctures that handle the natural energy flow of the body…” she started. </p><p>With that, she started going through a surprisingly detailed explanation, peppered with a lot of stuff about different types of gates, acupunctures, yin and yang energies, and other concepts I would have written off as complete nonsense if I wasn’t able to throw magic punches that could shatter trees. </p><p>More interestingly, her explanation fitted well with my knowledge of the Tiger Fist, particularly the Initiate realm. The more I listened to her, the more I realized those poems and diagrams were about manipulating energy through different channels. </p><p>The manuscript didn’t explain those in detail for the same reason an advanced physics book didn’t explain how to do addition. It was supposed to be fundamental knowledge. </p><p>There were some gaps, but they were filled by medicine knowledge from the System lesson, as it was another way to manipulate the essence in the body. </p><p>I couldn’t help but shiver as I realized the only reason I didn’t kill myself was the pill I received from the System while I practiced martial arts, making me a genius when it comes to manipulating my essence. Without that, I might have ruined myself. </p><p>The cute waitress read the reason for a sudden shiver differently. “Don’t worry. I’ll do my best to teach you,” she said as she continued explaining, doing her best to be comprehensive. I asked several questions, both making her explain every theoretical aspect she knew, and also making her go through every single technique.  </p><p>Thanks to my own Martial Arts experience, and some assistance from the advanced apothecary knowledge, I could get a hang of the techniques she showed relatively easily. </p><p>“That’s all I know, young master,” she said, almost four hours later. “The rest is practice.” </p><p>[Pity Bonus - 10 (Capped)]</p><p>[10x Return - Massage Technique Lesson, Beginner]</p><p>I triggered, and once again, my mind was flooded with external knowledge, like I had been receiving a much more focused lesson from a true expert. </p><p>The difference in learning was incredible. The quality and the detail level of her teaching effort had made a great difference, allowing the System reward to be enhanced appropriately. Even better, my own experiences with massaging also helped, allowing the System lesson to focus on the other details.</p><p>The more I knew, the more efficient the System classes were.  </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said, smiling widely as I grabbed and kissed her palm. Her blush was spectacular. “How about we try those techniques, Master?” </p><p>Her blush was spectacular, but not as spectacular as the sudden arousal in her tone as she gasped. Using the traditional title of respect affected her even more greatly than I expected. </p><p>Fascinating.  </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>“… and that’s how I found my way through the forest,” I said, finishing another tale that I had shamelessly plagiarized from the stories. </p><p>“Another amazing tale,” Lannayin said as she downed another glass, her words slurring slightly, enough to show that she had been enjoying my stories greatly. Elsana wore a calmer expression, sharp enough to realize that I had avoided giving out too many details and stayed generic. </p><p>She likely assumed they were all fiction. To be fair, I doubted that Lannayin actually believed them, or she just enjoyed the stories. </p><p>Either way, I didn’t care. The system didn’t treat the stories as payment for the feast, which was all I cared about. Rather than finishing my food, I sampled through a lot of different dishes, which triggered the System every time. </p><p>In the end, I had twelve different Mortal Peak-Grade, and two Profound Low-Grade food safely in my inventory. The best I could do without breaking the character. I had no doubt that, if sold for a fair price, they would cost thousands of gold coins as a minimum … but selling them was problematic. </p><p>It was hard to exchange such objects. </p><p>I was careful with the number I tasted. I was determined to hide my level, because I could still fake my way around with boxing while I displayed my skills as an Initiate. Anything higher, I couldn’t hide the Tiger Fist, which was far too distinctive. </p><p>No need to invite disaster just because of greed. Especially since Mortal Peak-Grade food should be enough to see me through any emergencies, and I didn’t want to breakthrough further.  </p><p>Interestingly, the pity counter flickered during dinner. Not much, mostly between five and ten. It was important to show that it took their emotions at that exact moment the return was triggered into account rather than the time they ordered, matching with the beats of the story I had been telling. </p><p>“So, what are your plans in Markas, stay until you run out of money?” Lannayin asked. Elsana threw a warning glare at her, as it was quite rude. But Lannayin, who drank a shocking amount of alcoholic drinks, missed that. </p><p>“Not much. I just want to discover and learn more before I eventually have to return,” I said, deliberately avoiding mentioning the financial aspect, but with a blush to show that I cared about it significantly.  </p><p>I didn’t know if they were actually attracted to me or if they were just interested in having an exotic guest from afar, but either way, acting self-conscious about ordinary concerns like money would make me look like a better target in their eyes. </p><p>Hopefully, they would come up with a way to solve it without offering me some kind of work, which would prevent the System from triggering.  </p><p>“You should come to stay with me as a guest—” Lannayin started, only to stop when Elsana poked under her. “What, it was the bet, wasn’t it?” she said, but didn’t bother to whisper. Elsana looked at me, the first sign of a genuine expression on her face. </p><p>A shy blush. </p><p>“Sorry, she doesn’t get out much, always obsessed with breaking through to Minor Accomplishment,” Elsana said, excusing her friend, not expecting her friend to actually get drunk. It looked like she used the bet as an excuse to bring her away. </p><p>“I’m not. I’m almost there,” Lannayin answered, defending herself angrily. Elsana looked even more self-conscious about her friend’s outburst.  </p><p>Not that I minded much. </p><p>Also, it was impressive. I knew little about the technique mastery and how it was actually determined, but I had at least heard about the stages. It went Beginner, Minor Familiarity, Major Familiarity, then Minor and Major Accomplishment. </p><p>The minor accomplishment was a significant step. </p><p>“Naturally a challenge,” I said, then smirked as I realized I had been facing an excellent opportunity. “Actually, I have a suggestion,” I said, then winked at Elsana, like I was just making an excuse to distract Lannayin. “When I’m trying to solve a difficult problem, I feel it helps to explain the basics. Why don’t you teach me some about the basics of forging? Maybe it’ll be an epiphany.” </p><p>“Really,” she said. </p><p>“Of course. Returning to the basics is a fundamental part of any mastery,” I answered, and added another poem to be convincing. “Foundations strong, the tower ascends; each brick laid true. Success transcends. Ignore the basics, risk a fall; true mastery rests on them all.” </p><p>Not exactly a great wisdom, but delivered correctly with perfect oration, it was enough to trick a drunk. </p><p>“E-excellent idea,” she said. “First, you need to know how to heat the heat correctly …” she started, while Elsana mouthed her thanks, happy that her drunk friend had a better excuse. </p><p>She was not afraid of her friend slipping any secrets. Not only did everything she said sound like the stuff that would be done by the apprentices, but she also babbled enough to turn that into a mess. Even if she slipped a high-level secret, it was impossible to understand. </p><p>I listened with rapt attention, but I understood nothing. Not that I cared. The real value would only come if she triggered the System. I hoped it would, but even if it didn’t, it still gave me some goodwill from Elsana for helping her handle her drunk friend. </p><p>“… and, that’s how you forge a proper volcano steel weapon,” she said, finishing her explanation.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 15]</p><p>[45x Return - Volcano Hammer Forging Technique Lesson, Beginner]</p><p>That surprised me, as considering the choppy delivery, I wasn’t expecting it to turn into something with such an impressive name. I kept it in my Inventory. “Now that we finished, maybe we should go and rest,” Elsana said. </p><p>“No, I need to see if I can breakthrough,” Lannayin answered. “Let’s go. I’ll … show you.” </p><p>“We will go, but first, Mistress Elsana also has to finish giving a lesson first. You don’t want to win by cheating, do you?” I said, which was perfectly logical from the perspective of a drunk. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I was tricked. “Yes, I need to give a lesson first,” Elsana said, and started explaining. Her lesson was far more smooth and consistent as she explained the basics of creating medicine out of precious plants and savage beasts, and how the wrong combination could cause a trigger. </p><p>I was actually able to follow the explanation. There was nothing actually useful in the stuff she had talked about, a few safety measures, the basic pills and how to distinguish, the storage conditions. Once those finished and Lannayin were still awake, she started explaining how to refine the most basic essence pill, which was apparently something that was a more efficient — but expensive — method for martial artists to replenish their essence. </p><p>She stopped once Lannayin put her head on the table, finally falling asleep.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 10]</p><p>[40x Return - Ordinary Medicine Refinement Technique Lesson, Beginner]</p><p>[40x Return - Superior Basic Essence Restoration Pill Recipe, Initiate]</p><p>“I beg your forgiveness, Master Elsana. I have abused your generosity enough,” I said, once again using her title of respect as I stood up. I had stayed here enough, and extracted a lot of benefits. With her friend drunk, pushing my luck further was unnecessary. </p><p>I was certainly glad that her reward sounded more basic than the other class. </p><p>“Yes, but you have to visit my humble workshop tomorrow,” she said, inviting me to visit. Though, it felt less like an invitation, and more like an order. </p><p>“How about the afternoon? Or would you prefer for lunchtime?” </p><p>“Lunchtime is preferable,” she said. Then, I noticed her smile transform into one that I had seen on the faces of many bored housewives in their late twenties, surprisingly predatory. </p><p>A surprising change compared to the rest of the night. Maybe I had read her earlier attitude wrongly. </p><p>I didn’t ask a stupid question like whether she needed any help with her friend, and left the room. A waitress arranged for a carriage, and while I was on it, I finally triggered the two lessons I received. </p><p>The flooding information was quite interesting. With cooking, it was a smooth understanding that not only gave me the ability to prepare and cook ordinary meat but also savage beast meat.  </p><p>I had expected for it to hold true for forging, or refining medicine, after both lessons came with the tag of beginner. </p><p>The results were more complicated. It still gave me a good understanding of advanced concepts … but without the knowledge of related concepts. An interesting feeling, like I didn’t know how to do addition, but still knew how to do limits. </p><p>That was especially true for forging, as whatever Volcano Hammer was, it was too complicated to even start making sense. While the medicine refinement lesson was somewhat more comprehensive, I did not know what herbs were required; how they were picked and prepared; and what the criteria were for the final assessment.  </p><p>It looked like, even with the System, I needed more than some drunken ramblings to develop new skills. </p><p>“How was your evening, young master?” the same waitress greeted me, interrupting my thoughts. </p><p>“It has been a beautiful experience,” I said with a gentle smile, and passed her a gold coin. “Buy me a few books on the basics of forging, pill refining, and medicine in general. I want them ready for the breakfast,” I said. It was a good time to shore my basics, if only to decide what to target next. Then, I raised another gold coin. “And, here’s a reward if you can bring earlier.” </p><p>She smiled widely, as what I asked wasn’t exactly expensive — well, for the standards of the rich. The prospect of an extra gold coin was not small either. I didn’t hide my purchases. From the outside, it would look like I was just trying to suck at the experts that paid attention to me. </p><p>If I was lucky, it might even give people ideas about gifting me books. My greatest need. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>After the first poem, there were several other gifts from the crowd downstairs, but I had turned them categorically, which made the first two older ladies even more smug. After all, they were the only ones that had been ‘given face’ while the others failed.  </p><p>Of course, that was once again based on my request. I had made it clear to the waitress that I wouldn’t receive any more gifts from their customers on the lower floor. The first one, I accepted to further my disguise, and my choice of poem made it very clear that it was a show of respect for the city itself rather than the other customers. </p><p>Accepting others would have been lucrative with my Freeloader System, but I didn’t want to settle for it and end up like some kind of performer. The System was very insistent about valuing the gifts of the strong over the weak. </p><p>I just needed to maximize that benefit. </p><p>Honestly, I was still mulling over the words of that mysterious voice. This was supposed to be punishment, that much was clear … but how I had absolutely no idea. Even if this new world was more dangerous than I could ever imagine, it still felt like a reward. </p><p>I shrugged and returned my attention to what was important. People in the teahouse. </p><p>After refusing the other gifts from downstairs categorically, their frequency of gossip only increased further, their guesses getting wilder and wilder. I was happy to notice the guesses about being a Martial Arts master disappeared completely, focusing more on scholarly guesses, like traveling alone to experience the world. </p><p>There were no other gifts for the next hour. I expected it would be for the night, which didn’t surprise me too much. It was just the first night, and the gossip needed some time to spread. </p><p>That changed when the discussion was cut like a knife. Curious, I looked down, and saw two women enter. Their gazes might as well be daggers as they looked at each other. Both of them had been dressed expensively, though their details were different. </p><p>One of the ladies was muscular and surprisingly tanned, with a few burn marks on her arms she displayed proudly. She was tall for a woman, almost six feet, and she had a sense of presence. Late twenties, but aged very well — though she might be even older based on her cultivation slowing her aging. </p><p>She was wearing pants and a tunic, but there was no hiding their expensiveness. Though, while she was tall and strong, it would be a sin to call her manly. Her curves left no doubt about that. </p><p>Her sense of fashion contrasted with the other women, who preferred loose robes and dresses. Such a strong diversion from social norms had to mean that she was someone with some kind of power, especially combined with the reaction of the others. </p><p>Interesting, but not as interesting as her furious expression as she looked down at the other woman who came with her, who was a blonde woman with a lithe figure, beautiful. She looked demure, but I didn’t miss the tense looks the crowd was throwing her way either. </p><p>Two dangerous women. </p><p>They climbed the second floor immediately, making the waitresses burst into action, their panic and excitement furthering my guess about their social status. They were too important to visit such an establishment. </p><p>My plan was to work faster than I expected. Dangerous, but I smiled. </p><p>The way they looked at each other, one smug, the other angry, gave me the impression that they were friendly rivals, and they had some kind of friendly challenge about me. </p><p>I hid my smirk. It wouldn’t be the first time I was the subject of a bet between two rich ladies. It was faster than I expected, which meant I wasn’t fully prepared, but with their attitude, I could play them to each other. </p><p>As long as they were willing to buy my attention. </p><p>Outwardly, I continued reading the book, not paying attention to their arrival even as they had been led to a private room, while the kitchen burst into action, bringing them several trays of food and drinks. </p><p>The smell was enough to reveal them as Mortal Grade food, mostly Low and Medium, with some High Grade mixed in, though the amount of essence they contained was harder to determine. I recognized them easily, even at a distance. An unexpected benefit of the cooking lessons I learned from Marana. I sighed, hoping that she had escaped successfully after my warning. </p><p>The food delivery made me even more enthusiastic. To request food made from savage beasts, they had to be martial artists. More importantly, their cultivation was likely not low. </p><p>While the delivery continued, I listened to the gossip, which revealed their identity. Lannayin, one of the premier blacksmiths of the town, and Elsana, a famous apothecary. Though, the discussion that was going on downstairs showed that they were famous for two things. Being unmarried, and always competing for prestige.</p><p>The gossip lacked any suggestion of having a lot of lovers … which was interesting. I wondered exactly what they had in mind for their presence. </p><p>I thought about rejecting when a waitress finally arrived and conveyed their invitation, hoping for even more hype, but one thing stopped me. Listening to gossip, it was clarified that Lannayin had an explosive temper, enough to make people bet on what she would do if I refused the offer. </p><p>I decided not to test it. </p><p>“Ladies, I thank you for your invitation. It’s an honor for a poor scholar like me,” I said once I entered the room, bowing and gesturing as a greeting … keeping it perfect to convey that, I didn’t come from a family that was superior to them. It was a calculated display of weakness.  </p><p>I still remember the first hunter I had met, and how he triggered nothing because he was afraid of consequences of insulting me. I didn’t want them to flatter the mysterious force behind me, and ruin the whole point of my acting. </p><p>It helped that having a lower status compared to them still left me quite a bit of wiggle room about my fictional background. Just by the food they consumed, it was clear that they were strong Martial Artists, and their respective crafts were highly respected. </p><p>“No need to waste words. Sit down and join our feast,” Lannayin said, her attitude dismissive even as she gestured. From her attitude, I could see that it was her general attitude and not some kind of calculated disrespect. </p><p>“As rough as always, my friend. You should learn how to talk, and not to insult a refined scholar,” Elsana said before turning at me. “My apologies. My friend can be rough, but she means well,” she added, defending and insulting her friend at the same time. </p><p>Interesting friendship.  </p><p>“Truth of the world lies in action, not words,” I said, accepting her apology in a cool, scholarly manner, playing my role perfectly. However, even as I greeted them as my social superiors, I didn’t bother waiting for them to insist before I sat down and reached for a Mid-Mortal dish. </p><p>What food to reach was a surprisingly complicated decision. I was tempted to reach a High-Grade one, excited by the return multiplier, but a decent portion of High-Mortal food was made of savage beast meat, essence dense enough to satiate a starving Peak-Initiate completely, and I clearly wasn’t starving. </p><p>No need to exaggerate the situation too much. </p><p>Instead, I reached Middle-Grade one, which implied that I was at least an Intermediate-Initiate Martial artist, potentially an Advanced one. </p><p>It wasn’t a random thought. After all, traveling alone was dangerous, and I needed to have some kind of assurance to dare to move alone, especially since I didn’t have any visible weapons, yet dared to walk around without guards. </p><p>Of course, for a commoner, reaching the Advanced stage in their early twenties was a significant achievement, the same didn’t apply to the child of a rich family. They could pay for more resources, and anything less than Peak-Initiate was ordinary. </p><p>A suitable compromise between prestige and keeping myself reasonably harmless in their perspective in case their strength wasn’t too high. </p><p>The moment I touched it, the System gave me a reward. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 5]</p><p>[35x Return - Golden-Deer Stew, Mortal Peak-Grade]</p><p>Well, that was clearly not a requirement, I realized as I noticed the multiplier. They were strong, either at Peak Skin Refinement, or actually at Bone Forging — which one I didn’t know due to the System’s unclear methodology. </p><p>They didn’t pity me much, but that was not a bad thing. Unless they were as soft-hearted as Marana, they wouldn’t interact with someone they pitied intensely. My current situation as a ‘struggling’ rich kid due to some kind of family issues was just right. </p><p>“Well made,” I complimented as I ate the stew slowly even as I looked for other dishes to target. </p><p>“You look like you have traveled for a long time,” Elsana commented. “Why don’t you tell us some stories?” </p><p>“Of course,” I answered. “Once upon a time, I was in a ship called Black Pearl, with an enterprising yet weird captain called Sparrow…” </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>“It’s shocking just how good it feels to finally be clean, and slept in a proper bed,” I said even as I checked myself in the mirror, making sure nothing was out of order. The first set of clothing I had ordered arrived while I slept, and now I was about to go out. </p><p>It was barely evening, and I slept less than I had been dreaming … unfortunately, the physical improvement from Martial Arts meant that ten hours of sleep was more than enough to get rid of the exhaustion I accumulated several days.</p><p>At least, the physical portion. The same didn’t apply to the mental part, but I had never been someone who could relax by staying locked in a room.</p><p>… not when I was alone. </p><p>“Have you reserved a table at the Blossom teahouse?” I asked the waitress once I went downstairs, the book about the poems I had ordered already in hand. A little nerdier than I preferred, but in a world filled with Martial Artists, I doubted wearing a tight t-shirt would give me my usual mileage. </p><p>I wasn’t stupid enough to ignore Marana’s suggestion and reveal my knowledge of Tiger Fist.

She certainly should with the amount of tip I had been dropping. Looking rich and irresponsible was not a cheap affair. The clothes, the room, the tips, I had already spent over twenty gold before I even stepped out. </p><p>Getting the attention of a rich and beautiful woman was not a simple process. Looks weren’t enough. In a way, especially during the first steps, I was holding the same function as an expensive handbag. Technically functional, but really about the branding value. </p><p>For the same reason, I ignored the subtle signs from the waitress, implying she would be happy to serve me in a more intimate manner. A reputation for sleeping around would only reduce my value. </p><p>If I was going to be a trophy, I needed to be the one to be chased.</p><p>A five-minute ride in a four-horse carriage cost me another half of a gold coin, but once again, it was needed.  </p><p>It was already evening, but the streets were not dark, with several torches that were spread around the road, though they were too bright and uniform to be normal. After a glance, I ignored them, and focused on the book of poems. With one good, and bad thing. </p><p>The good thing, apparently poems, ancient sayings, and parables were culturally a very important part of the language, enough for the language jade to include a general understanding of them. I could feel that it was nowhere near the level an actual scholar had to possess … but then, I was supposed to be a rich kid with the title of a scholar. </p><p>Equivalent to a guy who was admitted to Harvard because his father granted the school ten million dollars. Title was compulsory, and competency was optional.  </p><p>The problem lay in the poetry book. Apparently, it was written by one of the previous city lords, about the beauty of the city. Even with my limited understanding, I could see their terribleness, but I couldn’t say that. </p><p>“Welcome, young master,” someone greeted me at the entrance of the tea shop, leading me to a table on the second floor, some kind of balcony that allowed me to look down at the first floor. The lighting was designed carefully to highlight the people that were seated, to reinforce the subtle message that they were superior to the guests on the first floor. </p><p>An interesting trick. </p><p>I ordered a pot of tea, ignoring the annoyance I felt from the price. Two gold coins … and that was when I ordered one of the middle-grade ones. Tea was similar to wine in this new world, pointlessly expensive, but important to distinguish the classes between rich people.  </p><p>So, when their equivalent of a sommelier came with a steaming pot of tea, and served me a cup after a small ceremony that lasted about a minute, I took a sip. It had a bitter and sharp taste. It was layered and strong, even more complex than some of the more expensive wines I drank while I was dining with my rich lady friends. </p><p>I hated it, just like I hated those expensive wines that required years of classes to appreciate. The teas of this new world were clearly the same acquired taste that required a lot of studying to appreciate.</p><p>A waste of time, but I couldn’t say that without ruining the fake persona of a traveling young master. Unfortunately, the waitress also expected some kind of comment. </p><p>“Passable,” I said and made a dismissive gesture, doing my best to channel the attitude of a snob who didn’t find his favorite vintage, and had to settle for an inferior one. I couldn’t take the risk of describing in detail even if I had some classical phrases, because I did not know which aroma overlapped with which part. </p><p>It was not a problem distinguishing the aromas. That part was handled by my Martial Cultivation, which increased my tastebuds. Not to the level of my direct strength, but the improvement was still decent. </p><p>Maybe in the future, if I could find someone to give me a lesson as a gift, the System could handle the rest.  </p><p>I sipped the tea slowly while reading, acting like I was too focused on the book to pay attention to my surroundings, especially the gossip about me. There weren’t many customers on the second floor, but the few were focusing on me, throwing theories about which city I had come from based on my looks and behavior. </p><p>The people on the first floor were even more reckless, creating theories about why a rich young master was traveling alone, confident that I couldn’t hear them when they whispered. Well, I could, easily. Some thought that I was running away from an arranged marriage, some guessed some kind of internal family issue, and some even claimed that I was clearly a true scholar and wanted to experience life. </p><p>A few even theorized that I was a hidden Martial Arts master, but deliberately hiding to get inspiration. I was glad that those had been silenced easily. </p><p>An hour later, my pot of tea was long cooled down, untouched other than a half-finished cup. A waste, but I hated the taste, so I wasn’t in a hurry to finish it. More importantly, even if I truly enjoyed it, I wouldn’t have consumed more than one cup.  </p><p>I needed to be a rich young master who’s slumming, ‘giving face’ by drinking garbage — even if that garbage cost more than the yearly income of an entire village. </p><p>The income gap in this new world was truly ridiculous. </p><p>Soon, the waitress came again, carrying a new pot of tea, the smell even more bitter and disgusting, but from the fancy material of the teapot, it was clearly more expensive than what I had purchased earlier. “A welcome gift from our valuable guests,” the waitress said as she pointed downstairs, where two women in their forties had been sitting. They were dressed well, but from the way the other people glanced at them, I guessed their social class was not particularly high. </p><p>The moment I touched the pot, a notification appeared.  </p><p>[Pity Bonus - 4]</p><p>[4x Return - Blue Pear-Blossom Tea, Mortal Low-Grade]</p><p>“Generosity is always appreciated,” I said. “May this scholar Arthanum read them a poem in return,” I said, but made no move to actually stand up and join them, which I also used to finally give them a fake name. </p><p>“That would be the honor of this poor establishment, young master,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, loud enough for the people on the first floor to hear. I could see the older ladies who sent me that gift looking disappointed. They clearly hoped for me. Unfortunately for them, they were neither rich nor strong enough to make it worth it. </p><p>And I didn’t work hard on my bait to settle for canned tuna. </p><p>“Let me read a poem that was written by one of the past lords of the city.” I took a deep breath, putting the cadence of my voice to perfection — another thing my Martial cultivation helped — let my magically-sourced language capabilities channel into my voice, and spoke. </p><p>“Stone walls rise, tall and steep; defying wind, and frost, they will not yield. Bricks and stones stacked, strong as iron; protecting Markas, peace and joy they keep.” </p><p>Honestly, I didn’t need my extra magical context to know the poem was bad, but no one could say that and insult one of the old lords of the city. Also, as a foreigner, reading a poem glorifying their city was always good. A little nod to their hometown pride. </p><p>What did the work was my perfect cadence and delivery. My voice was smoother than I could ever thought possible, conveying the emotions that the writer tried to create but failed. </p><p>The place fell silent for a moment, shocked before they started clapping. Once that ended and I returned to my reading, the gossip was more heated than ever. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I found an opportunity to change into a clean set of clothes. Dressing as a poor villager was safer when I was traveling, but a young scholar was safer in the city. Not to mention, it would allow me to get in contact with people with higher cultivation. </p><p>I also buried the Tiger Fist Manuals in that hidden spot, afraid of being searched. </p><p>Once I started walking closer, I paid greater attention to the city. The most attention-grabbing part was that, while the city itself was large enough to hold hundreds of thousands of people, there was a significant ghetto around it, probably for the people who didn’t want to pay the entrance fee. </p><p>That wasn’t without its consequences. The buildings were damaged, several with burn signs, and several people wearing colorful clothing walked around. </p><p>Gangs, obviously. </p><p>More interestingly, there was no guard presence in the ghettos. The city was clearly sending the message that, they didn’t care about anyone that wasn’t willing to pay taxes. None of those gang members approached the main road even as they moved around. </p><p>Once I paid my entry fee and entered the city, I felt like I had teleported into a new world. The streets were clean and paved; the buildings were tall, painted, and well made, the guards around every corner. </p><p>Not all citizens looked at the guards fondly, and people did their best to avoid the people who were dressed rich, carried weapons, or were otherwise distinctive, but I avoided the mess as I searched for a decent inn where I could have breakfast before sleeping for twenty-four hours straight. </p><p>I missed the feeling of a bed. </p><p>A couple questions, and I went toward one neighborhood in the middle. Not cheap, but not for the rich either. A good place for a young scholar from a well-off family that was trying to make his mark. </p><p>One advantage of being in a city … I was served by a pretty waitress rather than an ugly waiter. A vast improvement in life quality. </p><p>“Rough day?” she asked with a big smile while I took a seat. </p><p>“I hate traveling,” I answered with a shrug, but I didn’t neglect to hit her with an attractive smile, one that got even more effective thanks to martial arts increasing my physical control. </p><p>She blushed prettily. “I love it. Too bad it’s not safe,” she said, which made sense. I had heard enough stories about what might happen to careless travelers while helping the caravans, and I doubted being a pretty lady made traveling any safer. </p><p>I ordered some food, which cost me half a gold. A villager could probably live a full year. Not a small expense, especially for ordinary — delicious, but ordinary — food. It hurt me to spend that much, but ultimately, I was trying to sell a story, and spending money was a part of it. </p><p>“So, what brings you to Markas? You’re clearly not from here,” she asked. </p><p>“I’m the youngest son, so there’s not much to do on the estate,” I said. “I wanted to travel awhile before I return and my father arranges a marriage and a job for me.” </p><p>Entitlement and lack of responsibility weren’t supposed to be attractive qualities, but they worked surprisingly well when paired with a lot of spending money. The waitress blushed even more. </p><p>“Are you going to stay for long?” </p><p>“A week or two? A month?” I said, lazy and noncommittal, once again doing my best to use the lessons I had learned from my freeloader days. Be available, but not too available, while implying a lack of consequence. </p><p>Waitresses gossiped. </p><p>“Now, why don’t you tell me around the place?” I said. </p><p>“What exactly do you have in mind?” </p><p>“A tailor, for one. My idiot escorts lost my baggage, so I need to buy some new stuff,” I said. “Somewhere other than any gardens or libraries. Maybe an alchemist?”  </p><p>“Unfortunately, our city doesn’t have the luxury of having an alchemist,” she said, which didn’t surprise me. I learned that an alchemist meant a cultivator special cultivator, and they were clearly rare. “But we have a few superb apothecaries if you want to visit them,” she said, clearly proud of their existence. </p><p>Understandable, as apothecaries were the martial artist version of alchemists, and they could do valuable stuff. How useful or valuable, I did not know, as gossip was not the most valuable source of information. </p><p>“How about martial arts?” I asked. </p><p>“We have five famous martial arts schools here,” she said proudly. “Three chapters from great martial art sects.” </p><p>“Oh, which ones?” I asked. </p><p>“Dragon Saber, Tiger Fist, and Demon Claw,” she said proudly. “Also, there are two local schools. Crane Kick, and Wolf Fang. Of course, the Dragon. Saber is the best!”   </p><p>The way she spoke felt familiar. I had many friends introducing their local football team with equal fervor, suggesting the martial arts were not only useful, but also culturally significant. </p><p>“Really?” I said. </p><p>“Of course, their inner disciples have the longest win streak in the arena, and they are the most selective in recruiting. It’s almost impossible to join.” Then, she lowered her voice and looked around. “Tiger Fist and Demon Claw only get their rejects.” </p><p>I understood why she didn’t speak loudly. What she said could easily be taken as an insult. And this new world didn’t have a fondness for free speech. </p><p>Or, from what was deduced from the stories, human rights. </p><p>“How about the library?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, the city lord’s mansion has one. Martial arts schools should have some. Every apothecary certainly has one … but I don’t know if they would allow visitors.” </p><p>“Bookshops?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, we have several,” she started. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I pushed a gold coin toward her. “I want you to buy a poetry book, but it has to be written by someone who lived in the city before.” </p><p>“We can do that, young master,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent. How about the gardens?” I asked, keeping the discussion moving. The other waitresses looked unhappy at first, but my casual way of spending money soon turned that into excitement, especially once I rented a room for the full week and paid in advance. It put me twenty-one gold coins behind. </p><p>Three golds for a night, and it wasn’t even the most expensive inn in the city. The income inequality in this world was truly shocking.</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t avoid skimping on spending money if I was to establish myself as an interesting foreigner to the socialites, or what passed as socialites in this town.  </p><p>Once I spent a lot of money, despite my relatively poor clothing, and was happy to leave the waitress chatting with me. I could have questioned her more about martial art schools, but not only it would be suspicious but also she was not the best source of information. </p><p>Instead, I questioned her about the social scene of the city. </p><p>Apparently, the arena was the most popular location during a fight, but it didn’t happen every day. When there was no fight, the crowd was split between tea houses and brothels. I ignored the brothels and focused on the tea houses, which fascinated the waitress. </p><p>Apparently, the tea houses were treated as the more high-culture locations. Though I had to admit, I was more surprised because the brothels were even in the competition as a classy location than the fact the victory of the tea houses. </p><p>I would have ignored the brothels either way because of my personal preferences — more about enjoying the chase and general health concerns than any great ethical objection, if I were, to be honest — but I didn’t have a choice. </p><p>I was searching for a wealthy sponsor with a willingness to fund the holiday of a rich kid, preferably one softhearted enough to pity me even more once I ‘suddenly’ receive some bad news from home to multiply the System rewards.  </p><p>In a brothel, money flowed in the opposite direction. </p><p>After I finished breakfast, I asked them to draw a bath for me and went to visit the tailor. I wanted better clothes to fit the local fashion, and more importantly, I needed another vector to spread the gossip about my arrival in what counted as a bored housewife crowd here. </p><p>I ordered three sets of clothes, which set me back twelve more gold coins despite using relatively cheap fabrics. I might have gone ten times as high easily, and once again, that with no kind of material from savage beasts or other martial arts nonsense. </p><p>Apparently, that was a thing. </p><p>Though, while chatting with the tailor, I learned that even the most utilitarian Mortal High-Grade stuff was sold for hundreds of gold. This, considering the exponential nature of the prices, suggested that the Profound Grade cloak I had in my storage likely cost ten thousand gold coins … maybe even higher. </p><p>Making me really glad that I didn’t bluff anyone while wearing that. </p><p>Once I arrived back at the inn, the waitress greeted me with a big smile. “Your bath is ready, sir. Do you need me to wash your back?”</p><p>I didn’t, not even with the implicit promise of what might follow. I just wanted to sleep. “Maybe later, beautiful,” I said with one of my best smiles. </p><p>No need to be rude. </p><p>“Finally,” I groaned once I reached my room, and found a bath prepared for me, even going as far as adding some flowers and perfume that smelled amazing. I dipped down, slowly getting rid of the dust and grime of very long travel.  </p><p>However, the real treasure was the soft, fluffy bed that was calling me. </p><p>I hoped no one interrupted me. If someone did, I might embrace the nonchalant attitude of this new world where the murder was concerned.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Thank you for all the free food,” I said as I bowed at her, then turned, ready to leave. Her panic was too thick for her to just worry about me. They were clearly here for her. I didn’t know the story between them … and I didn’t have the time to ask that. </p><p>“It was a pleasure for me as well,” she said as she reached under her stall, fumbling. “Don’t use Tiger Fist in any cities, they have dojos everywhere,” she said, then pushed a small bag into my hand. “Now, go.” </p><p>I didn’t need to check the contents of the bag to know exactly what was inside. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 20; Pity Bonus - 30 (Capped)]</p><p>[50x Return - Uncooked Savage Meat Skewer, Mortal High-Grade]</p><p>[50x Return - 10 Gold Pieces]</p><p>[50x Return - Carving Knife, Mortal Medium-Grade]</p><p>“Take care of yourself,” I said, and walked away. I wanted to run, but it would make people remember. They were still a distance away, and staying under the radar was the smarter choice. </p><p>Halfway, I looked back and saw the stall was empty. </p><p>Marana was gone. </p><p>“A pity,” I said, but the moment I was away from people, I started running toward the general direction of Markas, stopping my hiding spot to get the Tiger Fist manual. The city was quite a bit of a distance away. It would take more than a week if I ran as long as I didn’t burn essence desperately, but I did, so I could arrive at my destination soon. </p><p>There was no point in staying in the wilderness. It was the city that allowed me to truly act around. </p><p>Running endlessly had a nice benefit. I could focus on replicating the sensation I had tried to capture while I had been running fast to deliver the news. The more I focused on the sensation, the faster I got…</p><p>It occurred to me that I was in the process of creating a new Martial Arts, one that had focused on running. As I focused on it, it clicked easily. In a way, it was like the sensation of breaking through when I practiced boxing during my arrival … but at the same time, it felt more profound. </p><p>Why, I didn’t know. Running fast felt good. </p><p>***</p><p>I didn’t slow down until the next morning, traveling all night to make sure I had put enough distance, even burning essence all the way, consuming five skewers. Her reaction suggested that they had been searching for Marana, but it only made sense that someone would babble about her regular customer, and they would try to find and interrogate me. </p><p>I wanted to be out of the search radius in case they decided it. </p><p>Even now, I didn’t plan to sleep. I was just resting before deciding on an action plan, whether staying in the forest was the better idea, or I should go to Markas. There were some sections that were supposed to be dangerous, but nothing that an Initiate couldn’t handle even without joining a caravan.  </p><p>And, at worst, I had the cloak and the carving knife for emergencies. </p><p>“A good time to test those cooking lessons,” I decided, not wanting to waste the uncooked meat skewers Marana had given me. I might have better ones in my Inventory, but that didn’t mean I should waste food. </p><p>I triggered the cooking lessons, both for ordinary and Mortal Low-Grade. They were far more detailed than the music lessons, carrying a lot of information about how to perfectly handle the meat. The ordinary one alone was enough to make me a decent cook. </p><p>The savage meat cooking lesson was even more interesting, teaching me how to maintain the essence of a savage beast, a process that included a lot of information about how to butcher, store, and cook. </p><p>I raised the knife she had given me, making some cutting motions, still fascinated by the way my fingers moved, as smooth as a professional chef's after a few practice swings.</p><p>The system-enhanced lessons were incredible. </p><p>I started a fire, and soon, I had five savage meat skewers, each filling enough to allow me five Tiger Ascend punches. A significant amount of energy, but my cooking wasn’t as delicious as Marana’s. </p><p>I would miss her. I just hoped that the warning was enough for her to get away. </p><p>I passed by several beasts that I could have hunted, but I passed them without wasting too much time. Hunting them was a pointless affair, especially since none of them were savage beasts — something I knew from the descriptions of the others, but they were supposed to be distinctive enough. </p><p>I pushed myself hard while I was moving through the forest, but soon, the wilderness behind me, was replaced with open fields and farmland, which running at full speed far too flashy. So, I changed kept my old clothes, and started walking. </p><p>Being an idle scholar from a rich family was a good identity, and ultimately, I planned to change back to it. No one would expect me to fight, and while I potentially had money, the story of punishment would imply not too much. </p><p>However, a scholar traveling alone would be remembered. A peasant would not, with many other similar-looking people walking around. If someone questioned me, I was going to the city to find better work. </p><p>No one did, even after I found the road and came across many people. A brisk pace allowed me to cover quite a distance. I passed a few towns, but I didn’t stop by any of them. I had enough resources to make any benefit marginal at best, and disguising myself again and again would take too much time.  </p><p>As for disguising myself and buying a horse, there was a simpler problem that prevented that.</p><p>I didn’t know how to ride one. </p><p>With that, as the darkness fell, I stopped by a town, and went to the cheapest inn I could find, which was outside the walls. But, before I even entered, a waiter appeared. “Do you have money?” he asked. </p><p>“A bed and a dinner. How much?” I asked.</p><p>“A silver and five copper piece,” he answered, which was more expensive than Dumassa when factoring in the place's quality, but the proximity to the city made everything more expensive. I paid the money, which revealed little other stuff. “Another hopeful to the city?” he asked. I nodded. “What a waste of money,” he said. </p><p>The city required a silver piece, or ten coins, for the entrance of a non-resident, which was not a small amount. </p><p>“Better than getting old in a godforsaken village,” I said as I entered. </p><p>“I hear you, brother,” someone interrupted. I looked, and saw a middle-aged man with a big, friendly smile. Too big, too friendly. “A young man has to have hope.” </p><p>“As you say, senior,” I said with a nod, but rather than interacting with him, I went to the table the waiter had pointed. He was either a thief or a scammer — likely the latter — and I didn’t want the trouble of dealing with him. </p><p>As for why he targeted me, it was clear. I was a villager trying my luck in the city, meaning I should have enough money to pay the entrance fee, and a little pocket money to tide me over. </p><p>The waiter brought me my food. I wouldn’t have paid attention to him if the tankard of water he brought with me with the stew hadn’t smelled weird. And, once I paid attention to him, I noticed the waiter giving a subtle nod to the scammer. </p><p>A good trick, I realized. The waiter’s offhand comment at the entrance confirmed that I should have money somewhere, and also created an opportunity for his partner to introduce himself casually. And, if that failed, drug their drink. It smelled weird, but only because I was a Martial Artist, which enhanced my senses considerably. </p><p>I wanted to test my guess, and doing nothing else, I reached for the tankard, and the expression of the scammer brightened. </p><p>I acted like I took a big sip, then I grabbed the spoon and acted like I ate, but my spoon was always empty. I smelled nothing wrong with the food, but I didn’t want to count that. My martial essence was supposed to neutralize low-class drugs, but I didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>Once I ‘finished’ my dinner, I left the table, murmuring about taking some fresh air, but the moment I went out, I walked around the inn, and walked away rapidly, mixing into the shadows. </p><p>“I wanted to sleep in a bed for once. Was that so much to ask?” I muttered as I found a nice hiding spot behind a tree. The scammer had appeared out a minute later, searching for me. But, after searching for a while, he admitted failure, and went inside, looking for his next victim. </p><p>I didn’t intervene. I didn’t have the luxury of spreading justice before I understood exactly what the hell was going on. There was no way to pull such an obvious scam without the guards or the owners turning the other way, and it was better to avoid the mess altogether. </p><p>For the rest of the night, I walked without stopping, even occasionally running. It was already morning when I climbed over a hill, and came across a walled city. </p><p>Markas. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“… and, you need to be really careful about how to hold your knife. Never let your finger leave on the path of the blade. Always pay attention to the fire,” Marana, the mysteriously strong food stall owner explained as she tried to teach me to cook. </p><p>It had been a week since I returned to Dumassa, and my life had fallen into a routine. I visited the stalls in the morning for breakfast, then went near the gates, looking for work, usually to unload the grain or load furs. The kind of unskilled work that earned a few copper coins, not even enough to actually pay for my food. </p><p>However, working for a lot of odd jobs meant that no one really knew about how much I earned, so it explained the extra silver or two I earned by disguising myself as a beggar from the nearby passing carts. Though, during that, I understood the rules of the System more. </p><p>One experiment showed that — which I started by dropping some money to the path of a caravan before going to beg, to see if it would make them extra — if I gave anything that was given to me by the System to someone, it created some kind of deficit, and prevented the rewards until it was accumulated again. </p><p>Worse, that stopped the System completely until I accumulated enough to compensate for it directly. </p><p>In contrast, I could give the things that triggered the gift away without punishment. However, they didn’t trigger the reward again if they were given to me again. No infinite gift loops. </p><p>Afternoons, I spent practicing Initiate chapter of Tiger Fist. At first, it was more to put on a show for Marana than to expect anything. After all, I had already learned the punches, and there were limited benefits I could gain without a sparring partner to help me learn the more practical aspects. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to realize that I was wrong. I had already learned that increasing cultivation allowed me to understand the mysteries better … but after a while, I realized that practicing the Initiate Stage punches also had the same impact. </p><p>The more I practiced the simple katas, the better I understood the poems … and the stronger my punches got. </p><p>Without using more essence.</p><p>It was not the only benefit. </p><p>Marana was not a talkative person, but she was nice, always adding a few extra skewers to each meal. After a week, I had almost fifty Mortal Middle-Grade skewers in my Inventory. I had eaten one of them to test, and it gave me enough essence to barely support three Tiger Ascent punches, but digesting them took mere minutes.</p><p>It was likely because they were not made of savage meat. The benefit from the quality in terms of the total energy was limited. Still, it was more than enough to keep me full for a long while. </p><p>Similarly, begging in disguise allowed me to grow a nice egg nest to move to Markas. It was a place with more money, more resources, and stronger people that could trigger higher multipliers. As much as I liked the nice little corner I had, working as an odd-job worker and living in a cave in the wilderness was not my ideal life. </p><p>It was why, yesterday morning, I took the risk and asked her to teach me how to cook. Naturally, the risk was she started asking me to work for her in exchange for more food, which would ruin the nice multiplier effect. Today was the second cooking lesson. </p><p>Knowing how to cook would help me move around. “That’s enough for today. I still need to prepare for the lunch rush. Go to your work.” </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 20; Pity Bonus - 30 (Capped)]</p><p>[50x Return - Cooking Technique Lesson, Ordinary, Minor Accomplishment]</p><p>[50x Return - Cooking Technique Lesson, Savage Meat, Beginner]</p><p>A second set of lessons joined the first one in my System, but I let them linger. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to hide the sudden jump of ability and reveal something. I wanted to store a few of them and activate when necessary. </p><p>Though, receiving two distinct lines was unexpected. It was the second time I was receiving that, but I still didn’t know why lessons worked that way. </p><p>After visiting the outer gates for an hour, I disappeared and changed into my beggar clothes, run some distance away from the town — still annoyed that I could run a hundred meters in three seconds, while I spent two years to drop from 10.02 to 9.98 before my injury — and started searching for a caravan. </p><p>Then, I saw another group. This time, it was not a cart, but three men on horseback, traveling at a leisurely pace. They looked strong, but they were clearly not caravan guards. They dressed too expensively for that. </p><p>“Jackpot,” I said as I smirked. They looked rich enough to throw a silver or two to a poor traveler. However, I didn’t rush toward them immediately, but pulled another set of clothes from the System space — I asked for some clothes during my begging, so I had five sets ready to be used — and changed. </p><p>There was a reason for that change, a lesson that I learned a long time ago. People empathized with people they could understand. A poor person pitied a homeless person because he knew he was just a bounced check away from the same fate, while a rich person just treated as lazy vermin. </p><p>A down-on-his-luck scholar had a much better chance. </p><p>Once I changed and cleaned my face somewhat, I went to the road, and started walking, still with a walking stick to act wounded. Though, I changed the bandage so I had a sprained ankle rather than an infected wound. I walked the opposite side, as I didn’t want to take the risk of entangling with them. </p><p>I strolled, and soon, they made a turn, appearing in front of me. “Fellow traveler, may I take a moment of your time,” I called before they even got closer, once again changing my accent, this time using a posh one. </p><p>“Of course,” they said, their expression alight with surprise. “How can we help you?” </p><p>“I was just going to ask if you have seen a carriage being pulled by four horses from the direction you came from,” I asked. Another deliberate trick, as carriages being pulled with horses rather than oxen was apparently a status symbol, and I carefully attached myself to it. </p><p>“No, we did not,” they answered. </p><p>I sighed. “I really should learn to gamble better,” I muttered, like I was speaking to myself, but loud enough for them to catch me. </p><p>“It looks like there’s a story,” one of them said. </p><p>“Nothing much, I am afraid. I gambled, my teacher decided a scholar shouldn’t gamble, and taught me a lesson. He tasked me to either catch up with them, or return to the city by myself.” </p><p>The scholar part was deliberate. Apparently, most kingdoms here had some kind of central examination to assign government workers, and their status wasn’t too low. Not as high as actual rich people or martial artists, but enough to be treated as human rather than nuisance. </p><p>“Did he broke your leg to slow you down?” </p><p>I sighed. “That part is my stupidity, I’m afraid. I tried to take a shortcut through the forest, and didn’t notice a rabbit hole until it was too late. It was why I’m trying to catch up with them.” </p><p>“Can’t you just ride a horse?” one of them suggested. “A gold or two should be enough to buy one that wouldn’t keel over.”  </p><p>I sighed even deeper, and patted my sides, showing my lack of money. “I’m afraid my teacher is clever enough to prevent that, and took my money pouch.” </p><p>“Ouch, I hate when teachers get clever,” one of them said. “You know what, since it’s fate that brought us to you…” he said, reached his pouch, and flicked a gold coin toward me. It landed right in front of me, and I looked at him, shocked. “Come on, fellow traveler, it’s just a coin,” he said dismissively, nothing to be worried about. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to look like I was affected by their generosity. The truth was more dangerous. As he flicked the coin in a showy manner, I recognized something in the way he acted. </p><p>He was proficient in Tiger Fist.  </p><p>“It might not be a lot of money, but it’s the intent that matters,” I said, trying to hide my fear. I rattled a few common phrases from this new world about snow and charcoal until they looked satisfied with their achievement. “I better not keep you from your travel,” I said. </p><p>“Take care, and be careful while gambling, they chuckled. While they rode away slowly, I leaned down, picked the gold coin he threw my way. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 5]</p><p>[35x Return - 3 Gold Piece, 5 Gold Coin]</p><p>The money I had received was supposed to be a merry occasion, giving me the capital I needed to survive in an expensive city. Their identity changed everything. </p><p>The moment they disappeared, I went into the forest, changed into my daily clothes while considering what to do. I knew that learning their Martial Arts was a problem — though I still didn’t know about the scale of it — so their presence meant nothing.</p><p>The smartest thing was to just disappear. But also, it would mean that Marana had no warning about their presence. Maybe they were coming to help her … but maybe not. Worse, the System showed that his cultivation was higher, and they had the numbers. </p><p> I might be a Freeloader with some very loose ethical guidelines, but putting someone that helped me into mortal danger was not one of them. </p><p>I needed to warn her. </p><p>My journey back was even faster, as I had burned some of my precious Essence to move even faster. The more I pushed myself, the faster I got … and I felt like I was deciphering some kind of new martial arts, one that allowed me to run faster. Unfortunately, I was too tense to properly focus on that sensation. </p><p> Once I arrived at the outskirts of the town, I slowed down, not wanting to get everyone’s attention by dashing desperately. I directly went to her stall. </p><p>“Hungry already—” she started, then caught my expression. </p><p>I did nothing to hide my nervousness. “Can I ask you a hypothetical question?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she said. </p><p>I considered trying to stay indirect, but after some consideration, I decided against. The situation might be too urgent. “Theoretically, if I had stumbled across a martial arts book in the forest, and learned it, how much of trouble I would be in?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, not much as long as you keep it to yourself,” she started. </p><p>“And, what if a few disciples of that Martial Art were currently traveling to the town?” I asked, and she tensed. </p><p>“Are you sure?” she asked, her voice filled with distress and shock. </p><p>I was about to tell her a story about a guard recognizing it, but I decided against it. “They are a couple of hours away unless they moved faster. I borrowed a horse to get away,” I said, confirming I had seen it myself, though fibbing my capabilities a bit. </p><p>No need to reveal too much in case they were not her enemies, but her expression left no doubt about it. </p><p>“You need to disguise yourself and run. They will kill you if they realize it,” she said. </p><p>Which answered my question about just how serious of an issue it was. </p><p>Very. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I returned to Dumassa the next morning, after spending the entire night reading the Tiger Fist manuscript dozens of times, focusing on Initiate and Muscle Reinforcement sections, trying to see if there was a way to detect others and hide my ability. </p><p>A significant time investment, but not for nothing. There were two benefits; one immediate, one conceptual. The immediate benefit, after reading the confusing poems again and again, I discovered one of them had been discovering a way to compress the energy in my chest so that it wasn’t detected easily by anyone, even in the realm of Skin Forging. Discovering its existence took ten hours. </p><p>Learning took ten minutes. </p><p>The conceptual benefit was more interesting. The more I read the Initiate and Muscle Reinforcement sections, the more those poems started to make sense, and I saw some kind of meaning in them. </p><p>That understanding strengthened my muscles. </p><p>An interesting benefit. Unfortunately, I didn’t have it back on Earth. I would have studied far harder for literature if reading Shakespeare made me a better boxer. </p><p>I was feeling confident when I returned to Dumassa. Not only I had a way to hide my Martial Cultivation reasonably well, but also I had an action plan. Earn the pity of the mysterious sexy older lady, so she gave me some freebies, let the System multiply it so that I had a decent storage of food in my storage. </p><p>Most importantly, it delayed breaking through the next stage not only to keep my consumption down, but also not to lose the precious cultivation multiplier. </p><p>“Good morning,” I said, my smile wide as I approached her stall, deliberately using a rich accent — once again glad for the language jade for the comprehensive language information it granted — to play on my role as a previously rich man that had fallen into dire straights for mysterious reasons. </p><p>Naturally, I once again changed back in the rags to make myself more pitiful. </p><p>“You’re here again,” she said, looking disinterested, but I noticed she was observing me. What she was looking for was obvious. She had been looking for the signs of Tiger Fist, but the technique from the book, combined with my pill-enhanced martial talent, allowed me to erase all signs. </p><p>I didn’t want to look like some kind of genius to her. It was hard to pity a genius. A hardworking, incompetent rich kid with no idea how the world worked, on the other hand, was a much better idea. </p><p>“Yes, I had come across an Opportunity —” I started, then made a show of freezing before trying to fix my words. “A … a job opportunity. There’s some work at the warehouse,” I said, doing a terrible job of fixing it. An Opportunity — with capital letters — was a big deal, and talking about it was a worse idea than bragging about stealing from criminals. </p><p>I let it slip deliberately.   </p><p>I was playing the role of the handsome yet gullible young man, a role that paid great dividends when I was making a living seducing rich ladies. A woman might appreciate intelligence in a long-term partner, but a boy toy worked on different principles. </p><p>To be more accurate, that worked on a subset, like if the lady in question was not married, or her husband was more permissive to her dalliances. The ones that wanted to have hidden affairs had different tastes. </p><p>Ultimately, however, the seduction thing was more of a dream than a plan. I needed her to believe that I was a hardworking yet gullible young man to continue helping until she got bored with supporting me. </p><p>“Good,” she said. “How many do you need?” </p><p>“Five,” I said after I counted six copper pieces and twenty copper coins carefully. There was something in counting coins one by one that underlined my current lack of wealth, and I wanted to push it as much as possible. </p><p>She passed six at me. “One is on the house,” she said. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 20; Pity Bonus - 30 (Capped)]</p><p>[50x Return - Meat Skewer, Mortal Low-Grade]</p><p>“Thanks,” I said, giving her the biggest smile I could, happy that the System gave me a reward for the free one. Still, it was frustrating to see that the System had already lost some multiplier after my breakthrough.  </p><p>Also, this time, the skewer was an ordinary one, limiting the multiplication even further. A loss, considering the difference between Low, Medium, High Grades was not measured by percentage, but was significant.  </p><p>I savored my food, doing my best to show my appreciation of her gift. Showing the effect of a gift was a good way to keep them coming — another important lesson from my successful life as a boy toy. It helped that I was hungry. Martial Arts burned a lot of energy. </p><p>As I ate, I observed her just like she did me, but my observation was more beneficial. She might be stronger than me, but she wasn’t working as hard to hide her actions, and I could catch several subtle tells of her martial arts. </p><p>I wasn’t knowledgeable enough to understand her true strength — though based on how the System counted things, it was either late Skin Refinement, or early Bone Forging — but other details were more obvious. </p><p>One important one, her Martial Arts style was not Tiger Fist. </p><p>It was very likely an important difference … but how important, I did not know. My knowledge about the world was limited to a very good command of the language with limited context, and the gossip I overheard. </p><p>I knew that stealing others’ Martial Arts was bad, but whether it was bad like shoplifting, or bad like murder, it was harder to guess. </p><p>I shrugged. A question for another time. </p><p>“If you don’t have anything to do, chop these onions, and I’ll give you two more skewers,” she said. </p><p>“Sure, can I have it now? I promise I’ll do my best,” I said. She passed another one. It was clearly an excuse to give me another one. I waited for the System to give me another one …</p><p>It did not. </p><p>I wanted to curse. Dicing a few onions for a minute was clearly not an equivalent exchange for almost three copper pieces, but apparently, the System didn’t calculate it like that. It counted it as trade. </p><p>Not only annoying, but dangerous. It would ruin my whole plan here if she tried to create such unequal exchanges. I needed to prevent it, using one of the most evil tools in the arsenal of men against women. </p><p>Weaponized incompetence. </p><p>I had lost the count of the stories about men that had never washed dishes after breaking a few prized plates of their wives, putting an expensive cast iron pan into dishwasher and ruining it, or breaking a family heirloom or two while vacuuming. Doing a job badly enough meant that it was never granted again. </p><p>Though, it needed to be used with care, considering, most of those tales, I heard not from the husbands, but wives in questions, usually after a nice tumble in a hotel room, or in their bedroom — even wearing the favorite lingerie of the husband in question if she was feeling vindictive. </p><p>It was difficult to pull off, especially when I was reliant on her pity. I couldn’t just fuck it up.  </p><p>She passed the blade to me, and I started peeling the onion while holding the knife like a pen, to make it look like I was doing domestic work for the first time in my life. Luckily, it fit my general fake identity as a young man from a rich family. </p><p>With the class structure even more strict than my old world, it wasn’t absurd that it was the first time I was using a knife. I chopped the onions slowly and carefully, doing a work that would take her seconds in longer than a minute. </p><p>Still, I did it flawlessly. “I’m sorry,” I said once I finished it. “I … I never — I’m not the best at cooking,” I said, doing my best to show that I took my poor performance badly. </p><p>It was a cheap manipulation, but I literally couldn’t afford not to trigger the System. </p><p>“At least you tried. It’s what matters,” she said, trying to console me. I smiled at her, but it was another fake one, one that showed the despair of failure behind it. </p><p>“I … I think I need to return to work,” I said as I beat a hasty retreat. If all went well, she would be more careful about offering me extra work. The occasional free promotion was all I needed from her to build a nice pile of mortal grade food. </p><p>As for money, disguising myself to beg the passing caravans was not the most lucrative, but earning a couple silvers for an hour of work should be easy, which would be enough to get me three meals from her. </p><p>Three meals should be enough to meet the consumption of Tiger Fist for a few hours … as long as I focused on practicing the six punches of Initiate realm. Otherwise, three meals wouldn’t even be enough to use the first punch of Muscle Reinforcement. </p><p>Which was okay, as I didn’t dare to practice the Muscle Reinforcement section. I was afraid of a breakthrough, which would not only increase the amount of food I needed, but would also ruin the nice multiplier I had been enjoying. </p><p>Being a Freeloader required careful work. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, it was not a bad haul,” I said as I looked at another town. It was a week away from Dumassa with a walking pace, but I arrived it late afternoon … and that was with stopping by every caravan and traveler group on the way for begging. </p><p>Not all of them gave anything, and the ones that gave something limited themselves to copper pieces and leftover rotten food. Though, one group I gave me a bunch of old clothes. Though, one group also gave me a set of their old clothes as well to replace my rags. None of them had a higher cultivation, meaning I was limited to ten times the pity multiplier. </p><p>I threw away the leftovers, and ate all the Ordinary-Grade food, keeping one loaf of ordinary bread in the System along with the Cloak. The rest of the food barely gave me enough energy to throw one more Tiger Ascend punch at my full strength. </p><p>While the small skewer had been digested, giving me enough energy to punch almost thirty times even after helping me recover from the drain of the breakthrough.  </p><p>The difference between the grades was even higher than I expected. Meaning, while moving between carts and begging was easy, the benefits were ultimately limited. </p><p>Also, I had learned enough about the towns that muscle reinforcement stage artists were rare and revered, and skin refinement artists were non-existent, which made the state of that stall owner even more of a mystery. </p><p>A mystery for the future. I didn’t want to go back before I was confident that I could hide my Martial level, or at least enough time had passed for my improvement to be merely exceptional rather than miraculous. </p><p>Before going into the town, I once again washed before changing into the clothes provided by the System. They were still ordinary grade, but after the improvement of the System, they looked much better. A clean set of linen, better than what the guards had been wearing. </p><p>It was another reason not to wear them while on the road. The towns were reasonably safe, but the number of nameless graves I came across didn’t fill me with confidence. </p><p>I put the rest of my clothes, my blade, and the Tiger Fist Manual into a cloth bundle I made from the clothes, and walked toward the town gate, and joined the line. “What’s your reason for visit?” the guard said. </p><p>“Traveling,” I answered, which didn’t seem like an appropriate answer considering the suspicious glare of the guard. Still, he didn’t bother saying anything else when I passed two silver coins at him and just moved onto the next visitor. </p><p>I walked inside, with little money in my pocket, still not completely sure about my strategy of acting as the runaway groom, but it explained my situation well enough. I just needed to be careful not to convince them that my background was too strong. </p><p>As my experience with the villager had shown, the System didn’t work when they feared my background. </p><p>However, a hot meal was the best idea when it came to it. Hopefully, the other people would be chatty enough to give me some idea about what was going on. </p><p>I found a reasonably upscale inn, mostly filled with guards and merchants rather than drivers and workers. No one stopped me as I walked inside, as I looked like the other clients. I found an empty table, and soon, a waiter came. “How can help you?” he asked. </p><p>“How much for a meal?” I asked, and he immediately frowned. </p><p>“Seven copper pieces for a stew. But if you can’t afford —” he started, quick to react to my perceived inability, but stopped when I pushed a silver coin as well. Not exactly peak customer service. </p><p>“Give me some wine as well,” I said, not bothered by it. Instead, I waited in my seat, listening the gossip of the other people. The merchants were the most talkative ones, and they were more interested in the price of their goods, mostly comprising grain to sell, fur and dried meat to buy. </p><p>The trade content showed we were away from the power circle. </p><p>I also learned other, vital things, like the current year, 1072, and sixth day of Month of Cricket; the name of the political entity, Zaim Kingdom; and the nearest city, Markas. The way they talked about the cities implied that the place was mostly feudal, though there were several of mentions of Martial Art schools, and a few hushed whispers about mysterious cultivation sects. </p><p>There was other news I grabbed. A Martial Arts competition that would happen soon in Markas, of some kind of border skirmish which several merchants mentioned when they were trying to explain why grain was more expensive, and a blood duel between two famous Martial Masters. </p><p>Though, the repeated tales of bandit attacks suggested traveling might be more dangerous than I first realized.</p><p>Information I gathered was better than the food I received, which was delicious, but barely better than an ordinary piece of meat to recover essence. Which surprised me a bit, then I heard one guard that looked stronger than the others ordering a meal called savage beast steak. He paid twenty-five silver for it. </p><p>And, from a distance, it looked like Mortal Low-Grade. The higher grade food had a different, more intense smell. </p><p>Even if the inn was more expensive than other places, it was still clear that Martial Arts was an expensive work. </p><p>I was musing about the best way to make money quickly so that I could improve my Martial Arts level enough to travel without being afraid of bandits, when a voice interrupted me. “Hey, fellow traveler. Why the long face?” </p><p>It was some kind of musician, carrying some kind of string instrument, though it was smaller than a guitar. My music knowledge ended there. He looked bored. “Just trying to reach Markas,” I said. </p><p>“Wow, a long way for a lone traveler,” he said. “Any reason why?” </p><p>A musician was a suitable target to pull that nonsense about runaway groom. “I had a lady friend … until her father caught us.” </p><p>The intensity of his wince suggested he was experienced in such matters. “I found out that traveling helps in such cases,” he said. “So, why Markas?” he said. </p><p>“There was supposed to be one of my uncles there, but I never met the guy,” I said, acting like it would be the first time I would be there. “But, travel turned out to be more expensive than I expected, cards turned their back at me, and I ended up stranded.” </p><p>“Tough turn. It’s why it’s always important to learn a skill,” he said, patting his instrument proudly. </p><p>“True,” I said with a deep sigh, putting my voice as pitiful as I could. I expected nothing from a traveling musician, but it would be enough if I could mellow him enough to answer my suspicious questions. It would be the best. “I always learned how to play an instrument, but my father never allowed me, forcing me to count coppers in his office all day.” </p><p>“Ah, taste of freedom, my friends,” he said. </p><p>For the next ten minutes, I sucked up to him, trying to channel the attitude of a music nerd. The guy clearly had an ego, as he listened to my compliments with an ever-growing smirk.  “Well, I can teach you some if you want,” he said. </p><p>“That would be incredible,” I answered. I wasn’t as enthusiastic as my words implied, but I still listened with fake rapt attention as he passed me his instrument — a lute, apparently — and taught me enthusiastically until one of the waiters reminded him it was the time to play. </p><p>I was about to write the information gathering session a bust — as once his ego was stroked, he lost himself in the enthusiasm of teaching music — when the System gave me a surprise.</p><p>[Pity Bonus - 5]</p><p>[5x Return - Lute Technique Lesson, Ordinary, Beginner]</p><p>That was an unexpected benefit. Normally, after paying a small fortune to enter the town, I had been planning to find a cheap room and finally sleep under a roof, but a new feature of the System was too tempting to ignore. </p><p>There were no checks while leaving the town, which was a welcome change. I used the road for a while, and only when there was no one, I took a turn into the forest. I didn’t know exactly how it would look when I pulled weird concept such as a lesson from the System Space, but I wanted to be prepared. </p><p>In the end, that preparation turned unnecessary. I reached to the System space, and what followed was a flood of information, similar to Language Jade, only smoother and more instinctive. I felt like I had received a class from a more competent teacher.  </p><p>I doubted I could play anything with that as well, but that didn’t prevent my wide smirk. An ordinary lesson from a bored bard might be nothing … but what about a lesson from someone stronger, on a more important topic… </p><p>Like, a lesson on Tiger Fist from that mysterious stall owner. </p><p>The return suddenly felt far more tempting. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>When the dawn arrived, I was still reading the book. I had understood every word easily despite the unfamiliar, complicated style of writing that put Chinese and Japanese to shame — based on my very limited understanding — but that didn’t make understanding the fighting technique described any easier. </p><p>“In the dance of combat, a graceful figure forms. Tiger ascends, a beacon descends,” I read, trying to understand exactly how that linked to the weird drawing of a punch. “Who the hell describes fighting technique with poems?” </p><p>Trying to understand the book by reading wasn’t going well, but at least reading it gave me a basic understanding of how the world worked. Apparently, there were two general ways. Cultivation, and Martial Arts. </p><p>There was little information about Cultivation in the book. The only thing I really understood was cultivation required something called Qi, and it was significantly superior to Martial Arts. </p><p>Meanwhile, Martial Arts was separated to five stages according to the book. Initiate, Muscle Reinforcement, Skin Refinement, Bone Forging, and lastly, Connate; with each stage having multiple steps. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Peak.  </p><p>They probably had some equivalent cultivation stages because the System treated stronger martial arts as cultivation difference as well, but it was not something that was described at the book. </p><p>The book in my hand was damaged, and described only the Initiate Stage completely, and Muscle Reinforcement partially. The introduction section implied that it could be practiced until the Bone Forging Stage, but skin refinement and bone forging techniques were missing. </p><p>However, the description of the Initiate state was interesting. Based on how the book described the effect, I managed to reach to the peak of the Initiate stage just by practicing some boxing; an achievement that was supposed to require months of work and some special resources. </p><p>The pill I received from the System about Martial Aptitude must be truly miraculous.  </p><p>Still, it explained why I was getting that hungry, as improving as a Martial Artist consumed the essence of the body, and needed to be replaced. It was like exercise burning calories, but only more magical. </p><p>I wanted to check the book I had received from the System, hoping that it was easy to understand, but before that, I went back to the depths of the forest. Only after passing a large meadow that would have revealed the presence of an observer, I took the book out of the System. </p><p>To my slight disappointment, the existing parts are exactly the same rather than being a superior version that could be understood easily. At the same time, I wasn’t in a position to complain too much, because unlike the other book that only went partway into muscle refinement, it explained every stage until the bone forging. </p><p>I immediately ripped the cover of the both books and put the new contents to the old one, and used some dirt to make the pages older. Then, I stuffed the old pages into the ripped fabric I had been using as a bag along with the ripped cover. </p><p>Maybe they would come useful. </p><p>Then, I started practicing the Tiger Fist from the beginning. The first initiate described a basic punch, but it was accompanied by a long and flowery poem I had trouble understanding. Yet, I mastered the first Initiate exercise easily … then the second, the third, the sixth. </p><p>As I practiced the sixth exercise, something clicked, and I realized that the poem was describing how to gain the awareness of my essence, and use it for something more than just the passive improvement I had been enjoying as an Initiate. </p><p>I felt warmth being pulled from all over my body, a warmth that felt like the whisper of a roar, and gather in the middle of my chest. Just like that, I stepped into the muscle reinforcement stage, and I could use that energy to channel into my punches, not just to leave indentations on trees, but to break them. </p><p>It would have been glorious … if I hadn’t suddenly started to sweat a black, oily substance. Impurities, the technique described, but they definitely undersold the amount that would be generated. </p><p>I went to a nearby spring — glad that the location had an abundance of water sources — to wash, ignoring my hunger. As I broke through, the hunger returned with a vengeance. I felt like I could eat a dozen of those huge boar legs. </p><p>The moment I got rid of that disgusting smell, I pulled the skewer from the System, and devoured in a few bites, curious just how big was the difference between Mortal-Low and Mortal-High grades. </p><p>It turned out to be a lot. Despite feeling far hungrier, one skewer was not only enough to sate my hunger completely, but also digested faster without leaving me hungry. An interesting combination.  </p><p>I settled in the water for a moment, feeling the energy in the center of my chest grow. It was hard to measure the size, but the growth was substantial. </p><p>“Note to self, the jump between grades is no joke,” I said as I settled near the spring, and started practicing the first punch of the Muscle Reinforcement stage. It was called Tiger’s Ascent. At first, it was similar to the nameless first punch of the Initiate realm. Some kind of straight jab, but it was accompanied by a different poem. I repeated it about fifty times, punching a tree, each hit adding another deep mark…</p><p>Once again, the understanding clicked, and some of the energy that was gathered in my chest flowed to the punch while my essence felt like the roar of a tiger, disappearing forever as my muscles devoured it.  </p><p>The tree cracked. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if I was facing a normal human, not only they would have died, but their head would shatter like they were hit by a sniper rifle. </p><p>“Damn, it’s no joke,” I said as I calmed down and took a deep breath. The punch was fascinating, but it depleted almost one fourth of the essence I had. </p><p>I stopped practicing the Tiger’s Ascent, afraid of ending up hungry once more. The book had several warnings about depleting the Essence, and I didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>Instead, I practiced the first and second punches of the initiate realm several times, making sure they didn’t drain my essence. </p><p>They did not. More importantly, after I reached Muscle Reinforcement, I could even control their passive drain, making them turn into ordinary punches as well. I could disguise myself as a Beginner to Peak Initiate stage easily. </p><p>The book had some exercises for that exact purpose, but the impression I got was they were supposed to be difficult to practice, requiring weeks and months and not just minutes. </p><p>Underlining the value of the Martial Aptitude pill from the System once more. </p><p>Still, as I thought about my next steps, a saying from the language of jade drifted into my mind. “Poor studies while rich practices martial arts,” I said. It made sense, considering each punch consumed more food than it would keep an ordinary family fed for a month. </p><p>I needed money and resources. </p><p>Which, technically, I could gather by hunting. With my new strength, I should be able to find a job that paid well. One of the caravan guards was at most at the Peak Initiate stage — since he didn’t trigger the cultivation difference return — but he was able to find work. </p><p>But that meant working hard. Before my injury, I would have chosen that path, but back then, I was young and prideful. </p><p>Or, in other words, stupid. </p><p>Why should I work days and weeks doing hard labor, when I had a shortcut? My so-called punishment. I had no idea what that divine being had in mind while giving me that, but I had every intention of abusing it. </p><p>As for the warning about great evil that came along with the System … well, that was a problem for the future, once I was strong enough to intervene safely… I didn’t abandon the people I cared about, but I was not a mindless crusader. </p><p>I considered returning to the mysterious stall owner that gave me the book and display my skills, but if the martial arts were as important as I was starting to realize, all it would do would be to destroy the pity she was feeling for me. </p><p>She might even offer me a job, which wasn’t likely to trigger the System. I was yet to test that … but considering it was called Freeloader System, I wasn’t holding my breath. </p><p>Not to mention, there was no guarantee that she wouldn’t have worse intentions. She helped and pitied me, but it was when she saw me, a pitiful and soft young man down on his luck. There was no guarantee she would feel the same once she realized how good I was learning Martial Arts. </p><p>I didn’t even know whether she could detect my breakthrough. </p><p>No, ditching the town was the smart idea. I didn’t ask anyone about the location of the nearest town, but I could just follow the road and question the other travelers. At the same time, I changed into the same wounded, poor village outfit and fashioned another walking stick. </p><p>The day was long… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked toward the town, I decided on a simple role. A young man who decided to travel to escape an arranged marriage. I was handsome enough for it to be believable, and an overprotective family was the best excuse I had for any big mistake. </p><p>Hopefully, it would be still enough to make people pity me while throwing a few scraps in my way, and let the System upgrade it. </p><p>I had no idea what that divine voice was thinking when she granted the Freeloader System as punishment, but there were many ways I could use it. My little trick with the caravan guards showed that I could easily lie about my status and situation, and the System would still trigger. </p><p>Talk about playing for my strengths.</p><p>Before I arrived at the town, I pulled the silver that was granted at me from the System. It was much smaller than the copper coin, the text on it denoting it as one silver coin. I didn’t go into the town immediately, remembering the villager mentioning that it required two silver coins to enter. </p><p>Instead, I walk around the town, checking the buildings outside the walls. There were a few large buildings that functioned as inns, some with large enough courtyards for the caravans to wait. Additionally, there were several stalls around. </p><p>I walked around to find a stall with a tempting smell, while also listening the shouts and calls of the stall owners, giving me an idea about the general exchange rate. It was simpler than I expected. Ten copper coin was called copper piece, and ten copper pieces made one silver coin. </p><p>Most stalls were selling their wares for around a copper piece, which, to my best guess, meant that a copper piece was worth around a dollar. Though, even as I thought that, I could imagine the reaction my old Econ professor would have if I wrote that in an exam, responding with relative purchasing power and other pointless nonsense. </p><p> As I walked, I finally saw a stall that was being operated by an older woman. Likely in her late thirties, but she looked good for that age. Short black hair, a beautiful face that was free of makeup, a strong stature, certain parts that clearly defied gravity. The rich ladies I had been hanging out with would have killed to look that good.  </p><p>It was a good target to get some information. </p><p>Though, as I approached, I saw her eyes tighten slightly. I recognized that, from the women that was used to being hit on constantly. I didn’t change my target. Information was more important than seducing a beautiful older woman — no matter how much it hurt me to say that. </p><p>“How much is for a skewer?” I said as I approached. </p><p>“Fourteen coins,” she said. </p><p>“Three … no two,” I said as I pushed the silver toward her, but I noticed her examining my palms carefully before shifting her attention to my face, a thoughtful expression on her face. I understood what she was looking at. My hands weren’t exactly hands of a worker. They weren’t perfect and smooth after all the time I spent in the gym, but I kept them smooth and attractive for the happiness of my lady friends. </p><p>Still, it was interesting that a stall owner was attentive enough to catch that immediately. </p><p>She said nothing as she passed me two meat skewer and a lot of copper. I didn’t count them before taking them, playing on the lost rich kid with no idea how the world worked. Initially, I was planning to ask her a lot of questions, but she was more attentive than I expected. I didn’t trust myself to question her subtly enough for her not to catch up. </p><p>That didn’t mean I planned to do nothing. I played a role I had developed to perfection after my injury. Prideful yet vulnerable young man. I didn’t say anything as I ate my food, slowly savoring its taste like I hadn’t eaten for a couple days — which wasn’t hard to fake, because with the speed my body was burning food, I was already hungry, and just needed to exaggerate further — while I kept my expression stiff, but with occasional trembling. </p><p>A young, handsome man who had fallen into dire straits.</p><p>I noticed her adding another skewer to the fire, but she pulled it from a different drawer. It smelled much better than the other ones, reminding me of the boar leg I had received from the System. She added it closer to the fire, and inevitably, it charred too much. She turned her back, acting like she didn’t notice it. </p><p>“Heavens,” she grumbled exaggeratedly as she pulled the burned skewer of the fire. “It’s ruined.” Then she looked at me. “Why don’t you be a good young man and finish it. It’s a sin to waste food.” </p><p>“Y-you’re right, it’s wrong to waste food,” I said as I took it.  </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 20]</p><p>[50x Return - Savage Meat Skewer, Mortal-Peak]</p><p>Success. </p><p>A scary success, as the cultivation difference suggested she was quite a bit stronger than me. </p><p>Still, it was good to see my patented method of awakening the pity in an older woman of authority worked in a new world as well. A handsome face and a pitiful expression was an excellent combination.  </p><p>I might have baited the reaction, but I still appreciated the intent behind it. She not only gave me food that probably cost at least a silver for free, but also she went the trouble disguising it to not to hurt my pride. Not necessary, but still appreciated. </p><p>Also, her cultivation was high enough to give a thirty-times multiplier, which was another surprise. I might not know how it was measured, but I believed it was significant. She was hiding from something … or I misunderstood just how strong the people of this new world. </p><p>I shrugged as I finished the charred skewer, delicious despite its burned state. Unlike the other two skewer, it managed to break my hunger. </p><p>“It was delicious,” I said as I bowed slightly, then walked away. I was tempted to stay longer, maybe try to get some more, but frankly, I was intimidated by the cultivation difference between us. I knew too little about this new world to make a judgment. </p><p>However, as I walked away, I felt my skin crawl. Somehow, I knew that I was being watched. I didn’t give a reaction, but I didn’t dare to move too far away from the town, either. Instead, I found a tree with nothing around, and sat down.  </p><p>I was still close enough to the town that I would be heard if I shouted … as for whether someone would come to my support, I had no idea. If things really went badly, I would pull the cloak from the System space. Maybe it was strong enough to make a difference. </p><p>I squinted my eyes, doing my best to look like I was asleep, forcing my heart to slow down — something I was able to do since that weird breakthrough. Still, I had to wait for thirty minutes before my follower had shown herself. </p><p>The woman from the stall. </p><p>I didn’t react to her presence, but I still calmed down. She was stronger than me, and she helped me before. Combined, I didn’t expect her to do anything, so I didn’t react even when she was just a few steps away, sneaking without making a sound. </p><p>I didn’t expect her to pull a small book from her chest, put it next to me, and walk back. I didn’t react to that for almost twenty more minutes, before I faked a restless shuffle, and touched the booklet. I acted because I could feel that she was still watching me.  </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Tiger Fist Martial Art, Complete, Profound Middle-Grade]</p><p>Once I touched it, I made a show of jumping in fear. “Who’s there?” I gasped in fear as I pulled my blade, but there was no one. </p><p>Only after looking around carefully, I paid attention to the book. It was an old, damaged book, and even without opening, I could see the marks of battle over it, including some blood that was relatively new. Not as short as days, but not as long as years, either. </p><p>“This lowly one thanks the mysterious senior for the opportunity,” I said as I bowed to a random direction away from the town, my command of the knowledge giving me exactly how to thank for it. </p><p>While having no real idea what any of those actually meant. </p><p>I immediately started a fire and started reading the book, glad that the language jade I received from the System taught me how to read as well. </p><p>Once I started reading, the sensation of being watched finally disappeared, but I didn’t stop reading the book. It was the first real chance for me to understand how this world worked. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The caravan I noticed at a distance wasn’t too large. Eight carts, each pulled by a pair of oxen and driven by one person, and two people on horseback with swords in their belt, clearly guards. It was filled with bags that looked like grain, but I didn’t care about their trade product.</p><p>I cared about it, because the caravan was a good way to test the limits of the System and understand what counted as a gift to trigger it.</p><p>I couldn’t trade for it, or the hunter would have triggered it as well. A sense of superiority from the gift giver seemed to be a factor, which fitted well with the name Freeloader System.</p><p>“Well, let’s experiment,” I said.</p><p>I could have rushed forward directly, but instead, I grabbed some dirt, messing up my hair and my face to look like a desperate traveler. I made myself a new walking staff and even bandaged my arm to look like I was wounded.</p><p>Not exactly a decent way to act, but it was one thing that my own injury taught me that honor and pride were luxuries. It was even more true as I found myself in a new, unknown world with magic; accompanied by a warning about a great evil.</p><p>I used my new staff as a clutch as I moved as fast as a desperate man with a leg wound could. The oxen-pulled carts didn’t move fast, and soon, I managed to close in the distance.</p><p>One of the guards finally reacted to my presence when I was several hundred feet away. He rode back before standing in front of me. “Halt,” he said. “Who are you?”</p><p>“I’m a poor villager, great warrior,” I said, doing my best to copy the attitude of the hunter that faced me, fear and fascination. “I’m traveling to Dumassa for healing.”</p><p>“Are you sick!” he said, and I didn’t miss his tenseness.</p><p>I realized my mistake immediately. He was afraid of a transmitted disease. “No, my lord. A wolf bit me, and the wound infected,” I said, giving the easiest excuse.</p><p>“Why are you trying to get close?” he said.</p><p>“I was hoping that you might let me ride one of the carts, great one,” I said, trying to look as pathetic as possible.</p><p>“No,” he answered immediately. “How can I know you’re not working for bandits?”</p><p>“You are wise, great warrior,” I said even as I flinched, faking disappointment. Luckily, I wasn’t half bad at acting, as his gaze was filled with pity.</p><p>“Here,” he said as he threw a piece of half-rotten apple at me. I had no doubt that he kept it to feed it to his horse. “At least you can eat until you arrive in the city.”</p><p>I could have caught it, but I deliberately failed to react, and let it fall to the ground. “Thank you, great warrior,” I said even as I grabbed the apple, treating it as a treasure.</p><p>[Pity Bonus - 5]</p><p>[5x Return - Apple, Ordinary Low-Grade]</p><p>“Thank you, great warrior,” I said shamelessly, like he had just thrown me a treasure even as I carefully wrapped the apple. He said nothing, his expression colored with disdain, but he flicked a piece of copper at me before returning to the caravan.</p><p>[Pity Bonus 10 (Capped)]</p><p>[10x Return - Silver Coin]</p><p>I let the caravan move away before I slipped back to the forest, considering my findings. Some things about the working principles started to get clear.</p><p>One, someone had to be giving a gift out of a place of emotional superiority, or at least equality — I didn’t know it was exclusive to pity —  because the hunter didn’t give anything whether I was trading or not.</p><p>Two, the strength of the other party was important, and, since the text explicitly mentioned cultivation difference, it was probably a relative difference. The guard didn’t trigger it, but I didn’t automatically assume it would mean I could defeat him. Especially since I never fought with anyone except fistfights.</p><p>Three, the value of the initial gift was very important, as it was the things that triggered the value of the others.</p><p>Based on my observations, I even got a general sense of value. Ordinary was the lowest, then there was profound with a possible another category in between, then there was yellow, followed by black and earth.</p><p>Though, I wasn’t completely clear between yellow and black. They might be the reverse based on the value of the aptitude pill and the language jade. Still, it felt reliable.</p><p>Once the caravan drifted away sufficiently, I reached the System, and pulled the apple. Unlike the rotten piece that he had given, the apple was bright red and juicy. It didn’t look ordinary.</p><p>I ate it quickly. It was delicious. Unfortunately, it didn’t fill me as much as a rabbit.</p><p>I went back to the road and started walking once more, this time determined to pass around the caravan. However, this time, when I caught up with them, they had camped for the noon. I was about to take a wide turn, when the guard gestured me. “Stop,” he said.</p><p>“Yes, great warrior,” I said.</p><p>“Wait, and you’ll get the leftovers,” he said.</p><p>“Oh, thank you, great warrior,” I said, making a show of bowing repeatedly.</p><p>“Enough, don’t make too much noise, just clean the place once we leave,” called the other one in disdain. I said nothing, watching as they slowly roasted and ate half a pig. The eight cart drivers each ate normal portions, while the two guards each ate more than ten pounds of meat.</p><p>I only went to where they dropped their leftovers, though there was only one leg meat with some kind of meat left.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 5; Pity Bonus - 15 (Capped)]</p><p>[20x Return - Roasted Savage Boar Leg, Mortal Middle-Grade]</p><p>Once they left, I moved back into the forest, and went deep enough to avoid any potential observer, wondering whether the other guard was to trigger cultivation difference bonus, or the system summed them together.</p><p>A question for the future, I decided as I reached the System.</p><p>And ended up holding a whole roasted pig leg, one that smelled spectacular. It looked like the System filled the gaps first before enhancing its grade. “Excellent,” I said even as I ripped a leg and started eating, expecting it to eat all of it before I felt the gnawing hunger weaken slightly. So, I was surprised when I barely ate an eight of the leg before I felt truly full.</p><p>It was probably the difference between the ordinary and the mortal grade. Or maybe boar being savage made a difference?</p><p>“Let’s practice,” I said as I started going through the boxing routines I remembered. Straight, jab, hook, hook, straight…</p><p>Twenty minutes, and I experienced another shift in my body that was accompanied by increased strength, followed by another burst of ravenous hunger. This time, I finished half of it, and started practicing once again. Another session that took two hours, before I felt that sense of shift once more, and felt even stronger.</p><p>And, finished the boar leg.</p><p>“Wow, it takes a lot of food to improve as a martial artist,” I said, but I didn’t dare to practice more before I found a more consistent source of food.</p><p>I didn’t know whether I would go around begging, or find a better way to receive gifts, but either way, a town was a much better place to experiment.</p><p>But first, a test. I walked near a tree, punched … and rather than breaking my hand, I left a deep indentation on the tree, showing just how much stronger I got after my latest breakthrough — another concept I knew from the language jade.</p><p>Rather than following the road, I run through the forest. “Damn, that’s fast,” I said, fascinated by my own pace. Spending a decade of my life as a sprinter taught me about roughly guessing my speed, and now, I was running a hundred meters below five seconds comfortably…</p><p>And that was while running through a forest without pushing myself, each step refining my running technique further. Fascinating, though I would have been more impressed if I hadn’t met with that woman who could run fast enough that I couldn’t even register her movement.</p><p>However, as I moved, I came across bodies across the forest three times. One killed by beasts, but two carried signs of human intervention, their valuables gone.</p><p>Another reminder that it was a dangerous world.</p><p>The town was supposed to be two days away, but that was by walking. Running comfortably, I managed to arrive in the town before the evening.</p><p>The town was larger than expected, probably holding more than fifty thousand people, and it was surrounded by wooden walls. There were several carts that was lined against the gate, waiting for their turn. Though, unlike what I hoped, there wasn’t a crowd of beggars at the entrance that I could mix in between conveniently, forcing me to search for a small river to clean my face and give a better impression.</p><p>I also thought about pulling the cloak from the System storage, but after some consideration, I decided against it, afraid that it would be valuable enough to bring some dangerous attention. I didn’t want to pull the lost rich guy routine.</p><p>As I cleaned myself, I wondered what would be the best identity…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I started moving at dawn, feeling more relaxed and stronger than I ever felt, moving toward the nearest village even as I tried to come up with an ideal way to introduce myself to a bunch of strangers. </p><p>A way that simultaneously showed that I was best left untouched, yet was not a threat. Unfortunately, it also needed to explain where I was in the middle of nowhere, with no money, no shirt, and no shoes…  </p><p>“Feels like a tasteless frat prank,” I said with a chuckle, then my eyes widened. It made perfect sense. “I’m a rich kid that was abandoned by his friends as a poor joke. Excellent.” Even better, it might help me get a few pity gifts from them.  </p><p>I doubted a bunch of villagers had a lot of treasures, but it would be different after the System multiplied it. </p><p>As I walked, I twirled the broken branch I had with me, treating it as a staff. I didn’t know how to use a staff, but as I moved it with mock movement, I somehow deduced a decent pattern, one that felt like it might actually work in a fight. </p><p>As I got nearer the village, I found a thin path. I took that, not wanting to sneak. Once I saw a hunter at a distance, I raised my arms and shouted. I stayed near a tree, ready to jump behind it if he lifted his bow. </p><p>He didn’t. “Who are you?” </p><p>“I’m from the city,” I answered, deliberately deciding to not to give any detail, not even a name. “We were having a feast, but once I got drunk, my friends pulled a prank on me and dumped me here naked,” I said. </p><p>He said nothing for a moment. I walked closer slowly, my hands raised. He looked suspicious at first, but the closer I walked, the more he paid attention to me. I noticed he was paying a particular attention to my hands and my cloak. </p><p>Something clicked, and his eyes widened. “Young master, my apologies for the slow response. This one is stupid and slow.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said as I walked closer, feeling calmer. Unless I was facing someone that could act well enough to get an Oscar, I could see that he was too scared of my presence to do something. Luckily, the language jade gave me a general impression of how to talk to people of lower status — mostly without a care, and expecting to take them in my words as order. “Just give me some food,” I said. </p><p>I didn’t enjoy talking like that, but I was hungry, and the guy didn’t look like he was about to die of hunger. “I-it’s not to your taste, young master,” he said, but he still hurriedly pulled some bread and dried meat, giving it to me. </p><p>I didn’t thank him, mostly because I knew it would actually scare him more. I didn’t want to torture the guy mentally. </p><p>I waited expectantly as I took the bread, but it didn’t trigger the System. Either it was about his weakness, or the System didn’t take it as a gift. I devoured it. The bread was the foulest I ever tasted, dry and lumpy, but I was too hungry to care. I ate faster than ever, yet felt unsatisfied. </p><p>“Is there anything else you want, young master?” he asked. </p><p>“Your clothes,” I said. He looked surprised. “I’m going to give you this, and you’re going to give me your outfit,” I said as I pointed at the cloak. </p><p>His eyes widened. “I wouldn’t dare,” he said again, but this time, I noticed greed as well. </p><p>“Look, I don’t care about this garbage,” I said as I pointed at the clearly expensive cloak. “Feel free to use it or sell it. One of my idiot friends left it with me. But I need to return to the city without being noticed, so I don’t shame my family,” I said. </p><p>He repeated the fact he wouldn’t dare several times, but his excitement was clear. I insisted a few more times. “Would those be alright, young master?” he said as he pulled some spare clothes from his bag. </p><p>“Good, pass them to me, and your shoes and your knife,” I said, pointing at the ripped leather mess. He didn’t blink before he removed them, passing them to me. I threw the cloak at him. He grabbed, looking shocked and fascinated by the trade. </p><p>His excitement worked to my benefit as he turned chatty. I learned that the closest town was called Dumassa, and it was barely two days of walk away. Apparently, one needed to pay two silver coins to enter, which was a significant amount of money for the villagers. </p><p>Also, to my surprise, I learned that the forest was supposed to be very dangerous, with a lot of wild animals, but they were scared away after a weird lightning. Though, unlike the earlier magic lady — cultivator, according to hunter’s babbling — he cared little about it, treating it as some kind of cultivator spell. </p><p>Apparently, such things were more common than I expected. </p><p>After two hours of walk through the forest, we arrived at a dirt road. “Just follow the road, young master, and it’ll bring you to Dumassa. From there, I’m sure you can find a caravan that goes to the city.” </p><p>“Very good, you can leave,” I said. He left, holding the cloak tight like it was a treasure. Maybe it was. I had absolutely no idea how the economy worked here. </p><p>Instead, I started walking while I started playing with the knife I had received from the hunter. I started swinging it, and realized that, just like boxing and staff-combat, it felt smooth and natural like breathing. </p><p>Earth-rank was apparently more fascinating than I first realized. Not that I was unhappy about consuming it. If it was too expensive, trying to sell it would create too many questions. And, as far as I could feel from the languages that were dumped into my mind, personal combat power was an important part of social status. </p><p>I slowed down half an hour later. Not because I was exhausted — I felt like I could run a marathon while breaking all the records easily — but because the hunger felt crippling. </p><p>I walked away from the road, picked a broken log as a target, and started practicing knife-throwing. The blade I traded for was not a throwing knife. It had a poor balance, and even poorer edge, yet ten minutes of practice was enough for me to hit the target every single time. </p><p>“Incredible,” I said, once again revising the efficiency of the earth-grade pill upward.  </p><p>With that, I moved a little more inside and started hunting. I had never hunted before, but it turned out to be easy. Five minutes later, I had noticed a rabbit hidden behind a bush. A flick of my wrist later, it went down. </p><p>Starting a fire and preparing the rabbit to be cooked was more difficult. Martial aptitude didn’t translate to prep work. It took ten minutes for me to start a fire, and that only worked because I rubbed two sticks together with a speed that was impossible to attain for any young scout on Earth. </p><p>The rabbit was large enough for a nice group meal, yet, once I finished, I was still hungry. I was full to the point that it felt uncomfortable, but it didn’t solve my hunger. Helpless, I continued walking … but that sensation of being stuffed disappeared after an hour. </p><p>Apparently, my superpowers also included super digestion. I hunted two more rabbits during the next two hours, and only after that, I felt somewhat sated. “It looks like I’m going to spend a lot of money on food,” I said. “A little more practice, then back on the road,” I said, and once again started boxing. </p><p>I stopped barely a minute later. The moment I started practicing, I felt the gnawing of hunger return. Food was important. And, it looked like even a basic practice was enough to set my situation back significantly. </p><p>I paused for a moment, considering my options. The easiest thing was to stay in the forest, hunt, and forage while slowly practicing martial arts as some kind of hermit. But not only that was hard work, it would also expose me to the risks in the wilderness.</p><p>Or, I could go back to the town, and test the limits of the mysterious System that brought me to the new world. Combined with the introduction of the System I received from some kind of goddess before I was thrown into a new world, it was clearly supposed to be an insult.  </p><p>Too bad. I was an expert, shameless freeloader. </p><p>I extinguished the fire and started running. I only slowed when I noticed a group in the distance. Several oxen-pulled carts, moving toward the town at a leisurely pace. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t want to move, but think about what had happened. However, if there was one useful habit I had gained from my time as a student-athlete, that it was always better to be moving. </p><p>However, first, I consumed the pill she had given me. I didn’t expect it to be poison for two reasons. First, she could have killed me easily if she wished. Second, the system — despite its annoying name — roughly confirmed its nature as something to enhance my abilities. </p><p>I trusted it … because I didn’t have any other option. </p><p>I pulled the bottle open, and the most delicious smell I had ever enjoyed wafted into my nose. “In for a penny…” I murmured, and swallowed the pill. Warmth immediately spread into my body, forcing me to hold against the nearest tree. I started sweating and trembling at the same time, but it only lasted a few seconds. </p><p>Once it was gone, I found out that there was no difference. I thought about trying to get the other one from the System, but I decided against it. There was no guarantee that the magic lady from earlier couldn’t somehow sense it. </p><p>And, I couldn’t trust her with such a secret. She was nice to me, because she pitied me — as confirmed by the System, which I had to trust for the moment — and I did not know how she would act without it. </p><p>“It’s time for some experimentation,” I said instead. I didn’t know the name of the pill she had given to me, but since the enhanced version was a martial aptitude pill, I expected it to be the same.  </p><p>I raised my hands, took a basic boxing guard, and started doing a shadow-boxing routine. I was not a boxer, but I had learned a few moves after my injury during my desperate rush to find another sport that could help me maintain my scholarship. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I said after completing a few basic routines, moving through a fluidity that surprised me. “If I had this pill back on Earth, I would have been a professional boxer,” I said. Each punch flowed fluidly, and the footwork felt natural, just like how sprinting techniques had felt as easy as breathing. “Can I return to my world, System?” I asked, in English. </p><p>There was no answer. </p><p>I decided to move before it was too late. But, first, some shoes. I tried to rip the cloak she had gifted to make something to cover my feet, but I failed. It was stronger than I expected. </p><p>Instead, I gathered some leaves, tied them with some soft branches to create something that could function as a shoe. Then, I broke a thick branch, one that could be used as a weapon against a wild beast, and started walking. </p><p>I did not know where the nearest civilization was, so I started moving toward the nearest hill I could see. Hopefully, the elevation would allow me to discover somewhere else. </p><p>It was barely a couple miles away, which I felt like an easy distance, but the more I walked, the more I realized not that easy without proper shoes. What was supposed to be a short distance turned into something that took almost an hour. </p><p>I stopped before climbing halfway and saw a village at a distance. However, it was at least ten miles away, and it was already late afternoon. I doubted I could arrive there before the darkness — assuming I didn’t get lost. </p><p>And, even if I arrived, could I explain myself with my very limited command of the language? </p><p>I looked around, but I wasn’t able to see the mysterious magic lady. Technically, she could be still watching me, but I took the risk. If she was still watching me, it would mean that she suspected something, and it was hard for me to hide anything. </p><p>It was risky, but not as risky as trying to traverse an unknown forest at night. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to reach to the System, to get the language jade. The moment I thought that, another green, glowing rock popped into my hand from nothingness. This one glowed even brighter. “Well, at has smooth user experience,” I muttered to myself even as I brought it to my temple, preparing myself for the pain. </p><p>Yet, the pain didn’t come. It felt like a gentle whisper, followed by a click, and suddenly, my mind was filled with the full comprehension of several languages, along with some contextual information. Like, how much someone should bow for a foundation establishment cultivator, or how long one could make eye contact with a connate realm martial artist. </p><p>Annoying, considering I did not know what a Foundation Establishment was, who was a cultivator. </p><p>Though, the number of ways that were there to explain why one had killed their enemies — a shocking number of them including mentions of mere disrespect — clued me I wasn’t in a peaceful world. </p><p>Luckily, despite the horrifying implications, using the jade was a simple process and useful. “At least the better they are, the less they hurt,” I said as I summoned the aptitude enhancement pill. However, this time, before I opened, I tried to put it back to where it came from, to see if I could use the Inventory as a storage. </p><p>It didn’t work. “Well,” I said as I opened the bottle. It smelt even more spectacular than the previous one. I took it, expecting a gentle caress after I swallowed, but the moment it touched my mouth, it melted and mixed into my body and — </p><p>My blood turned to lava, and my bones were replaced with ice needles. At least, that was how it felt as I hit the floor. I didn’t cry, and as much as I wanted to say that it was about my incredible willpower, the answer was less glorious. </p><p>It hurt too much even to breathe, so I just whimpered. </p><p>Worse, I couldn’t even fall unconscious. I just lay on the ground, helpless, watching the sun move… It probably lasted less than an hour, but felt like a lifetime. “Damn, that was worse than I expected,” I said as I stood up. For all my memories pain, my body felt good. </p><p>Amazing, even. </p><p>“Maybe it will teach me about making assumptions.” </p><p>Despite the torture I just had, as I moved, I felt better than ever, like the pain was nothing more than a bad dream. I took a deep breath, feeling refreshed. I sat on a nearby rock, wondering if I could light a fire to keep the wild beasts away. </p><p>“First, let’s test if it helped me as much as I expected,” I said as I once again took a basic boxing stance and punched. Breathed. Punched. Breathed. </p><p>A weird rhythm took me as I moved smoother than I had ever done. It felt like a dream, but instead of the panic of a missed exam, it filled me with true understanding. Every lesson I had about boxing made sense. I took a deep breath, and something clicked. </p><p>Warmth and pain filled my muscles in equal amount, but after the effect of the pill, it was easier to ignore. I continued to go through basic patterns again and again, and I felt another click, then another…</p><p>It was midnight when I stopped. I was tired and sweaty, hungrier than ever. Yet, I felt stronger than ever as well. I eyed a rock, one that must have weight at least two hundred pounds. A weight I could handle as a deadlift, but barely. Yet, when I grabbed and lifted it. It weighed nothing. </p><p>“I’m a superhero,” I said, then sniffed. “A smelly one,” I added. I smelled bad, far more than I expected, even after exercising for several hours. I grabbed the stick and started walking around the hill. My earlier fears about finding my way during the night faded, as the moon was bright enough to illuminate my path. </p><p>Even better, despite being barefoot, my feet didn’t hurt anymore, allowing me to move far faster. And, once I dashed, I felt my old sprinting techniques coming back in a way I never felt before. They were perfect. Better than perfect, even. </p><p>After some searching, I found a nice little spring, and washed myself. There were several plants next to the spring, but since I did not know whether they were poisonous, I didn’t dare to eat them, even if my hunger felt like it was digging through my stomach. </p><p>I washed the cloak, though its impossibly soft texture didn’t surprise me after punching for half a day gave me superpowers. </p><p>Instead, I let the spring water cover me while I enjoyed the rest. Soon, I lay on my back, treating the cold water as a bed. It felt weird, but somehow, I balanced perfectly for it to feel natural enough to fall asleep. </p><p>It was certainly more comfortable than bare ground. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was a dark day, a thunderstorm was wreaking havoc outside my windows — well, technically, not my home, but the home of the beautiful lady that was currently being intimate with — but the warmth off the hug I had been enjoying had been interrupted by a beeping sound. </p><p>“Oh, no! My husband is here! Quick, leave,” the beautiful woman I had been sharing the bed with said as she pushed me away. I reacted quickly, gathering my clothes before moving to a balcony that connected to a water pipe, one that was thick enough to allow me to climb down.</p><p>I knew the escape route, because it wasn’t the first time I had to escape the house of a rich, married woman. My life as a professional freeloader taught me long ago to always have an alternate extraction point, as there was nothing more dangerous than a rich man whose ego I bruised in such a direct manner. </p><p>Of course, someone else might say that I had been wasting my life by acting as a plaything for the rich and bored housewives, but I disagreed. I was an injured college athlete, kicked out of the college after unable to afford to pay for it without a scholarship. </p><p>An-ex professional sprinter had no career prospect. </p><p>Maintaining my physique and act as a young boy toy for the rich, bored, and young housewives was far more preferable than trying to live as a college dropout. Especially when those young and bored wives learned from the habits of their husbands in terms of gift giving; expensive clothes, pocket money by thousands, watches, even a car or two. </p><p>A beautiful, simple life. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not without its challenges. I put on my pants without skipping a step even as I run toward the balcony — another skill I had developed through repeated practice. I kept my jacket and shirt around my neck, threw down my shoes, and started climbing down. </p><p>The storm raged on; the rain making the grip difficult. It was a dangerous process, but I moved down without slipping. After my injury, my trips to the gym might be about maintaining my looks, but my grip was still strong enough to ignore the wetness. </p><p>“I would not die in such a ridiculous manner,” I chuckled. </p><p>Maybe that was a mistake, as suddenly, there was a blinding flash that covered me. </p><p>“Huh, I didn’t know lightning could be red and purple,” I murmured, unable to believe what happened. Was I dead? If I was, why could I speak? </p><p>A POTENTIAL. YET, YOU WANT TO LIVE AS A FREELOADER. LET’S SEE JUST HOW LONG YOU WILL LAST! </p><p>Then, darkness.</p><p>***</p><p>I was surprised as I stirred back. I didn’t expect to wake up after being struck by lightning. It was dangerous enough, but I was also climbing down a water pipe. Lightning and a painful fall were a deadly combination.  </p><p>I struggled to open my eyes, but everything in front of me was shifting and dancing as a blur. Was that a forest? I didn’t remember the garden being this lush. Yet, as the blur disappeared, I realized I had no idea where I was at. </p><p>It didn’t help my surprise when I tried to reach down, only to find myself wearing nothing. Maybe the husband caught me and punished me, I thought, but that didn’t make too much sense. Why risk being charged with manslaughter? </p><p>Even more surprising was that there was no sign of damage on my body, like it was completely ordinary.  </p><p>[Freeloader System Activated]</p><p>[The exalted ones thank the hero for accepting the task of fighting against the great evil!]</p><p>“Hey, I don’t remember accepting anything,” I said, but there was no answer. Was I going mad?</p><p>Or was that voice I heard after the lightning was not a delusion, and I somehow angered a divine being, who punished me … sending me to another world? </p><p>It wasn’t a realization that I should accept easily, but for some reason, I did. Someone deep down, I knew it was true. As much as I had known that my career as an athlete was over the moment I had blown my knee ligaments with a sharp turn, ruining my dreams with it. </p><p>Still, I wanted to cuss. What was wrong with her — I somehow knew that the being that sent me here was a woman — that she punished me by sending a new world, one that I knew nothing about. As for the System, it reminded me of the novels my old college roommate had been reading constantly; except those systems in the novels always had charismatic names like invincible lord, boundless dragon, and other cool shit. </p><p>“What the hell is a freeloader system?” I asked, hoping for an answer, or at least a tutorial. </p><p>There was none. </p><p>“Well, not a big surprise,” I said. The one that gave me the System was angry, so it was too much to hope for a convenience. I took a deep breath, letting the surrounding haze dissipate as I enjoyed the warmth. </p><p>At least she did not send me to an ice planet or something. </p><p>I forced myself to stand up and tried to decide what to do. In the middle of a wild forest, naked, without a weapon. Worse, I was a city kid, one that was too busy with my sports activities to join the scouts, and I knew absolutely little about what could be done. </p><p>Before I could say something, a figure in front of me blinked into existence. And, using the word blinked was certainly not an exaggeration. One moment, there was nothing. Then, there was one. A woman, wearing some kind of thick robe, and with a veil covering her face. For a moment, I thought I was in some kind of repressive society, but the glowing sword in her hand suggested otherwise. </p><p>She reached for her bag while she avoided looking at me. The bag was barely bigger than my hand, so I expected nothing. I was surprised when she pulled a large cloak, one that was too thick to fit there. </p><p>Magic. </p><p>However, as I grabbed the cloak, several lines of writing appeared in front of me. </p><p>[Gift received. Freeloader System activated]</p><p>[Cultivation difference bonus - 120; Pity Bonus - 10]</p><p>[130x Return - Initiate, Profound High-Grade Cloak]</p><p>I covered my body even as I ignored those messages. I could feel that there was some kind of storage space, and I could pull the extra cloak I received — whatever profound high-grade meant, I had no idea — but I didn’t want to alert the witch in front of me. </p><p>Once I wrapped the cloak around, I was ready to answer her questions. </p><p>She said something. </p><p>“Sorry, I don’t understand you,” I answered, hoping that she could understand me. </p><p>She answered me in another language I didn’t understand. I replied with the smattering of French and German I knew. She tried a few more languages. I failed to understand all of it. </p><p>She pulled some kind of green rock from her pouch with some kind of internal glow. I didn’t want to touch any weird glowing rocks, but I didn’t think I could fight against her if things turned violent. I did not know about her capabilities, but she was clearly strong. </p><p>She threw it at me, I grabbed it. </p><p>[Cultivation difference bonus - 120; Pity Bonus - 30]</p><p>[150x Return - Language Jade, Black Peak-Grade]</p><p>I did not know what black grade was, and I didn’t have an opportunity to consider it either. The moment I brought it against my temple like she asked, it felt like they had put my brain through a blender, unknown words infusing themselves into my brain. </p><p>I collapsed on the ground once more even as the yellow rock turned into dust, feeling the worst hangover of my life. </p><p>She spoke again, slowly. This time, I understood several words. She was asking me whether I saw a lightning. I was about to answer no, but she covered the distance, pulled a needle and put it to my wrist. Her expression didn’t look like she was trying to help me. </p><p>It was best to assume she could test whether I was lying. </p><p>“Yes … red … purple,” I answered, trying to find the words in her language. </p><p>“On you?” she asked, but before I could answer, some kind of energy spread into my body. “No … not on you,” she said. She was wrong, of course, but I had no intention of correcting her. Not lying was one thing, omission was something else.  </p><p>“Are you a martial artist?” she asked, this time slower, making it easier to understand.</p><p>I opened my mouth, trying to find the exact words, but failed to find the exact words to describe the difference between a fighter and a professional athlete. “Used to … injury,” I answered choppily. It was the best I could come up with. </p><p>“Very well,” she said, and reached into her bag, and threw me a small bottle. </p><p>[Cultivation difference bonus - 120; Pity Bonus - 130 (Capped)]</p><p>[250x Return - Martial Aptitude Enhancement Pill, Earth High-Grade]</p><p>With that, she disappeared, leaving me alone. </p><p>“Well, what the hell was that?” I spoke, dazed. </p><p>It was not how I expected my day to go. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As Tara dashed upstairs to change into her costume — a quick process thanks to her power — I turned my attention to the camera feed once more, examining the movement of the blurry figure. The most important thing was their movement pattern. </p><p>A spiral with occasional pauses, sometimes slipping in and out of the buildings, trying to get a better sense of what was going on through scouting, thinking that their quasi-invisibility kept them secure. A dangerous assumption, I thought even as I pulled my gun … even though I had doubts about it working. </p><p>The target moving too fast to be just running. They either had multiple powers, or some of their powers were reliant on a device. “A power armor,” I muttered loudly after catching the outline. I spoke out deliberately, to test if they had some kind of long-range listening capability as well. If they did, the mention of a power armor should have at least made them react in a way I could catch with my power. </p><p>A simple bluff, but effective. </p><p>The figure continued to move around the bar slowly even as Tara returned, once again dressed in her modified biker costume. “Our enemy is wearing a power armor, and likely has at least one weapon that might hurt you. You need to be ready to engage,” I said. “Do you remember the codes we agreed?” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said even as tensed with anticipation. She was afraid of the potential fight, but her submissiveness worked to her benefit. She looked at me, my confidence giving her the courage she needed. </p><p>Naturally, I was nowhere as confident as I was trying to look. An armored superhero was more than I expected. I pulled a simple ski mask on to make it look like I was trying to hide my identity even as I started to go through the possibilities of exactly who decided to probe us. </p><p>A solo hero or villain was the simplest explanation considering the low-value location we were living in, but I was reluctant to just assume that. It could just be a probing attack from the Elite Syndicate, or even a move from one of the smaller guilds if they realized the true owner of the warehouse, and wanted to start with the softer target first. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time a guild prioritized their targets absurdly. </p><p>I continued watching the blur, trying to get a sense of their movements despite the headache building. Soon, I realized it was a man who was piloting the suit, a deduction that I only made thanks to my power. It wasn’t entirely trivial, as it affected how he would react once he was confronted with a female super. </p><p>I was hoping that he would underestimate her. </p><p> At the same time, I was able to get a better understanding of the limits of the power suit. It was fast-moving on a straight line, and as far as I could read, it couldn’t turn that fast. Also, the arms weren’t exactly mobile, and it was bulkier than expected. </p><p>“… always try to stay behind the suit once engaged, and make sure not to drop your earset,” I said, finishing a detailed explanation of how she should engage with our enemy. “However, I might have read something wrong, so listen to my commands, and never delay if I call for you to dodge,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said, her fear dwindling as I confidently explained some weak points of our enemy.  </p><p>“Good, be ready, we’re going to move out in half a minute,” I said. His movements had changed. Rather than going in a loose spiral, he started moving in a straight line, barely faster than a walk, showing confidence while also allowing us a way to engage. “I want you to walk toward him directly. Say nothing but show confidence, and allow me to approach from the side.” </p><p>I didn’t like the idea of sending Tara as a distraction, but I couldn’t just walk behind her and hope he wouldn’t target me. She had semi-invulnerability. I did not. My best hope was to attack from the side, maybe taking down a sensor or two. </p><p>Tara left from the main entrance, while I used the back door, my pistol raised. I didn’t hope that I would stay undetected, which was the reason I raised the gun. Ironically, when attacking an unknown target, someone with a pistol was less threatening than someone unarmed. </p><p>After all, unarmed implied a dangerous mystery box of superpowers. </p><p>Once Tara walked a while, the blur around the figure faded and revealed a power armor at the other end of the street. It took all I had to suppress my desire to curse because I recognized the figure. </p><p>Chrome Defender. </p><p>One of the newer members of the New Giant Force. </p><p>I barely held back my desire to curse. I didn’t expect to see the biggest guild of the city to be the one to attack me. My first instinct was to believe that his presence was about my visit. I was already considering how to reach Emily to make sure she left home safely if they targeted her. Until I caught a very important detail thanks to my power, currently in overdrive. </p><p>The suit was made by the same person who was responsible for the puzzle. </p><p>It was hard to pin down exactly how I came to that realization. When overdrive, my power made some connections that were hard to comprehend easily. Maybe it was the type of material, or maybe there was something about the elegant, perfect lines of the power armor. </p><p>That realization made the guess about his intention more troubling. Was he really here because of my own visit, or whether they somewhat discovered that I had the puzzle. </p><p>Or, neither was the case, and they just wanted to deal with the bar before dealing with the warehouse. I wanted to deal with the third possibility first. “Move to the left, about fifty feet, act like you want to use the building to take cover,” I ordered Tara even as I moved further away from my bar. </p><p>She followed that even as the Chrome Defender spoke, his voice modulated. “Surrender, and you won’t be harmed,” he declared. Even with his voice modulated, his arrogance was clear, the kind only a rich person could develop easily. </p><p>He was a new hero indeed, and I suspected the assignment of power armor was more about his family's money than his potential. Maybe I was guessing wrong … but I didn’t think so.  </p><p>“Throw a dumpster at him,” I asked, and Tara followed. He dodged the attack, but it was a close call, and when he landed, he was unbalanced. A good first test about the capabilities of the suit. </p><p>“Fifty-two,” I followed, almost immediately, which was an order to take a big jump to the left, one that I gave when I noticed his weapon being charged. I didn’t know the explosion range of his weapon, but there was no point risking it. </p><p>It turned out to be a bit excessive. His weapon was some kind of laser blast, with little area damage. Still, it took down one of the empty buildings around us. </p><p>He wasn’t holding back. “Throw him a rubble, even faster, then move back,” I added, and Tara followed my request. He dodged again before aiming his suit arm, but before he could attack, I noticed something even more important … one that gave me another, even more problematic possibility about his presence. </p><p>He paused his attack, right at the moment when attacking risked damaging Elite Syndicate’s warehouse. </p><p>It was not good news. </p><p>I asked Tara to move around him and dodge deliberately a few more times, watching him act. He was more than happy to damage the surrounding houses, but whenever his aim could endanger the warehouse, he paused. </p><p>It was not good news in the long term. Even the most innocent explanation meant that the New Giant Force wasn’t ready to deal with the Syndicate, and wanted to target me instead. Also, there were worse possibilities. </p><p>Like it was the Elite Syndicate arranged the attack to test my backing … or worse, they were cooperating in some capacity, and they were here to help their allies. None of the possibilities were good ones. </p><p>“Move to thirty feet to the right, then charge forward, aim for the arm and leg joints,” I ordered Tara, a position that would leave her aligned with the warehouse, forcing him to use less dangerous weapons. </p><p>At the same time, I raised my gun, and aimed at the weak points of his suit — an achievement that was made much easier thanks to my power, not only allowing me to pick the weak points, but also making it much easier to aim — and fired, damaging what I assumed to be the detection equipment. </p><p>It wasn’t enough to take them down — that required a much stronger gun — but his inexperience worked to our benefit. He flinched in panic as the bullets hit his camera, allowing Tara to complete the rush. </p><p>She kicked twice, each taking down a leg joint, and then she grabbed the laser weapon that was attached to the arm. With a pull, it came off. </p><p>“I’ll be back!” he shouted even as he activated some kind of jet pack … and promptly retreated. </p><p>“Return to the bar, but walk slowly and confidently,” I said to Tara. She followed my request, but I stayed outside, watching both the warehouse and the horizon, wondering whether there would be a follow-up attack. </p><p>There was no other movement … but that didn’t mean I was happy as I returned. </p><p>My bar was getting more and more troubling. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Such a basic mistake,” I muttered even as I looked down. “Maybe you deserve to get fired.” </p><p>“Please, no, sir,” she gasped, trying to sound distressed rather than aroused … a challenge she failed spectacularly. “I need this job. Maybe we can pretend that it didn’t happen.” </p><p>“Why don’t you show me just how much you need this job, then?” I said, enjoying the way she trembled. </p><p>I caught her gaze, only for a moment before she avoided it, but there was no hiding the desire bubbling underneath. She licked her lips, trying to combat her excitement. “What do I have to do?” she asked. </p><p>I could have just ordered her, of course, but it would be a pity after she had gone through the trouble of dressing for me. “Well, you’re a clever girl. Clumsy, but clever,” I said, her cheeks darkening slightly. “Why don’t you show me exactly how hard you’re willing to work to earn forgiveness.” </p><p>She trembled in excitement. “I… I… well, I will…” she stammered, trying to find an answer, but failed to come up with one, finding the words far more difficult to utter than doing and reaching my belt. I stopped her. That finally earned true distress. “D-did I do something wrong?” she asked, panicking.</p><p>“Tell me what are you going to do first,” I ordered, my smirk in full force. </p><p>Her distress disappeared just as quick when she realized we weren’t going to stop, leaving itself to a deep shyness. She stayed silent for several seconds, finding it difficult to speak. But, she pushed herself hard, took a deep breath — which enhanced her cleavage — and opened her mouth. “I … I’m going to give you a … handjob to earn forgiveness, sir,” she uttered, blushing beautifully. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said, and she immediately reached for my belt, the hesitancy in her words nowhere to be seen as she grabbed my shaft with one hand and began to stroke up and down. Then, her other hand joined at the base. </p><p>She was aroused, but also a touch disappointed, suggesting that her initial plan was different, but she failed to admit it. </p><p>What an amusing little dilemma. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I enjoyed her hands, gently dancing up and down. She was incredibly sexy, enough for me to ignore the buzzing of my phone … if it was anyone but Emily. </p><p>I reached my phone even as Tara’s hands slowed down. “Did I tell you to stop?” I admonished. </p><p>She trembled in excitement as my harsh order hit her. “N-no, sir, you did not,” she whispered. </p><p>I turned my attention on the message. ’This is the report you asked for,’ the message said, one with two attachments. The first was the report itself … the second one was a photo. </p><p>I checked the photo first, and saw that it was one that showed her in her bedroom, wearing one of the underwear sets we purchased. White and innocent, together with a short, semi-transparent nightie. It was very conservative compared to some of the other photos she had shared with me.</p><p>Except for one important detail. She didn’t use the app we used regularly, but sent it normally, meaning it would stay with me forever. I smiled, as it represented her growing trust in me. A spectacular benefit. </p><p>‘Spectacular as always,’ I wrote even as I enjoyed the continued dance of Tara’s hands, her movement getting smoother without my attention. ‘Why don’t you show me the others?’ </p><p>While I waited for an answer, I tapped the report, but before I started reading, I looked at Tara. “Keep your eyes open,” I ordered, and she shivered. </p><p>She immediately followed my order, her submissiveness stronger than her shyness. An excellent show, and while she kept that going, I started reading the report Emily prepared. My eyes widened as I parsed through the incredible amount of information that she prepared for me. Hundreds of pages, filled with many public records, press releases, and many other random information. Since they were not public companies, there was no convenient financial information that could be accessed, but it didn’t matter much. </p><p>I had enough information to overwhelm even my power, forcing me to overcharge it. As I pushed my power to the limit, several details started to emerge. Fuzzy and uncertain, but I started to get a sense of general direction. </p><p>While I was busy with that, I received another message. ‘Amazing work, and even more amazing pictures. Continue with both,’ I asked her as I enjoyed her next picture. She was wearing the same underwear, but her negligee was gone, and one of the bra straps was askew invitingly. </p><p>Making Tara’s work of driving me crazy much easier. </p><p>I wanted to split my attention between Tara and Emily. Unfortunately, I had a third task, repeatedly checking the security feed. It was getting close to the time to open the bar, and I didn’t want to get caught by an early visitor. </p><p>Luckily, occasionally checking the cameras was enough, allowing me to focus fully on my pleasure, coming from two beautiful supers. Tara’s hands danced more and more enthusiastically, while Emily shared yet another photo, this time even her bra was gone, though the pose was a mirror shot from the back, focusing on her beautiful ass with a generous side view. </p><p>Tara leaned forward, but I put a finger against her lips, stopping her. “Not without telling me what are you going to do first,” I said. </p><p>“Is this… Is this really necessary?” she whispered, but when I gazed at her, her meager resistance was quick to diminish. “O-of course, sir,” she stammered. But, as I waited for her to speak, she delayed almost a minute before admitting. “I … I want to … give you a … b-blowjob, sir,” she whispered, every second of her hesitancy beautiful. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I allowed. Just like before, the speed she leaned forward was far faster than her words. Her warm lips covered the head of my shaft momentarily before she dipped down, easily taking half despite the gagging that followed. She pulled back, but only for a moment before she pushed down even more, easily accepting the physical challenge after the earlier embarrassment. </p><p>Beautiful enough for me to ignore the temptation to grab her head and push her even lower. I just enjoyed the pace she determined, each second more beautiful than the other, begging me for a premature explosion. </p><p>Emily’s next message didn’t make things easier. She had changed into another set, this time an alluring soft green low-cut corset, complete with a garter belt. She was naughtier this time and deliberately took a high shot to enhance the cleavage even further. Then, she surprised me with a mirror shot that focused on her upper body from the back. </p><p>Just low enough to show that, this time it was the panties she ‘forgot’ to put on, but the pose didn’t reveal anything more. </p><p>At the same time, Tara grabbed my legs for leverage even as she pushed down even more, her nose touching my skin, a great contrast to her earlier state, where she had been having trouble saying the word blowjob.</p><p>Such a beautiful contradiction. </p><p>I bit my lip, trying to hold myself back, which was a troubling challenge as the assault from the two sides continued. </p><p>Tara pulled back for a fleeting second, coughing for a moment as she tried to replenish her breath before she went down once again. Not necessarily with her power, but some habits were hard to beat. Her lips strained around my girth once more before rapidly arriving at the base, her throat tight around my presence. </p><p>I found myself checking the cameras once more, just to distract myself from the upcoming explosion … only to freeze when I noticed a blur at the edge of one of the cameras. Something that was easy to ignore as a glitch even with my observation power, and only when I overcharged my power, I managed to get a better sense of what it was. </p><p>Some kind of extremely effective camouflage, nearly completely invisible. Either a hero or a villain. </p><p>I thought about reacting, but luckily, the figure wasn’t rushing forward directly, but taking a wide circle around the bar. For a moment, I hoped that the target was the warehouse … but as I watched its movement, there was no doubt about the exact target. </p><p>I needed to respond quickly … so I grabbed Tara’s head with both hands. “Very well, you earned your forgiveness,” I said as I pinned her in place — well, in a way, considering her power — before I started invading her throat aggressively. </p><p>Her moans showed she enjoyed it as much as I did, her body rocking with climax even as exploded into her mouth. She caught most, though the little that spilled on her chest made her look even sexier. </p><p>I made a note to make the intruder pay. “Quickly, go change to your bodyguard outfit,” I ordered even as I started watching the cameras once more. “We have visitors.” </p><p>She dashed upstairs, quick to follow my order. To my surprise, there was no fear … but only because she found my order confident and comforting. </p><p>While she disappeared, I watched the blur on the camera, trying to decide on the ideal strategy. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The rest of the morning passed without a notable event, and I was prepared to leave for lunch when there was a hesitant knock on the door. I invited them in. </p><p>It was Umi, with a tray with my lunch order. </p><p>“Welcome,” I said as I watched her take a step forward, taking in the show. She was still dressed mostly the same, but there were a couple differences. The skirt was rolled even higher, and the blouse had five buttons open — though the tray covered the spectacle. She likely made all those changes in front of my door, putting its remoteness from foot traffic into good use.</p><p>Also, her daring looks suggested that she had a follow-up discussion with Charlie, and that didn’t leave her particularly happy. Well, I was ready to cheer her up. </p><p>“Lock the door and come in,” I said even as I pushed the clutter to the side. </p><p>“You want me to l-lock the door,” Umi muttered, her beautiful eyes widening, showing that she expected me to have limits when I was in the office. </p><p>Well, technically, I had some limits, but they were not remotely close to what she had in mind. </p><p>Her surprise didn’t prevent her from following my order. She locked the door before she walked forward slowly, realizing what would follow, but her growing arousal was obvious regardless. </p><p>She continued to walk. “What’s wrong?” I asked, though I knew exactly what was wrong. </p><p>“N-nothing, sir,” she said when she arrived in front of my desk. Though, just as she put down the tray, I caught a glimpse of a naughty smile. The reason, I understood once the tray was on my desk, and I received a full view of her cleavage. </p><p>She didn’t wear a bra, turning her cleavage into a true show, especially when she was leaning in front of me. “Excellent. This is exactly the initiative I expect from my secretary,” I said, enjoying her cleavage while she blushed, her hands twitching with a desire to cover her face — or the cleavage. She might be acting more daring after the fight, but that didn’t fix her innate shyness. </p><p>“Now, why don’t you tell me about my lunch,” I said as I glanced down, and found some unfamiliar dishes. “Is this a new place?” </p><p>“N-no, sir,” she answered, her blush getting even thicker. “I … I cooked them myself.” </p><p>“Oh, how fascinating,” I said, though enjoying the implied intimacy more than the food itself even though they looked delicious. “Thank you for your effort.”   </p><p>“It’s not a bother,” she said, embarrassed, but I was more interested in the way her breasts danced as she shrugged, the lack of bra turning it into an erotic show. </p><p>“Now, I don’t know how to eat them,” I said, which surprised her. Understandable, as it was an absurd lie considering it was some steamed vegetables and chicken stir-fry, and nothing really exotic. “Why don’t you come here and feed me.” </p><p>She paused a moment, realizing what would happen, but what followed her pause was a big, sultry smile. One that was bigger than I expected. “Of course,” she said, suddenly vindictive. “After all, I’m here to make sure my fiancee’s career goes without a hitch. And he told me, very strictly, that I should never make you unhappy.” </p><p>“Really?” I said, actually surprised by it.  </p><p>“Yes. Several times,” she said as she walked around my desk and stood next to me. </p><p>It took all I had to not palm my face when what Charlie was doing hit me. He clearly hadn’t wanted to talk about why the interview had gone like that, instead deflected the topic. But, his indirect words worked the exact opposite of how he wanted. </p><p>What a terrible salesman. </p><p>Once she arrived next to me, Umi sat on my knee before I even asked, reached for a fork, and brought a bite while I wrapped a hand around her waist, my hand landing on her naked thigh, staying in place for a moment before starting to climb up slowly.  </p><p>She fed me a second bite. “Delicious,” I whispered after chewing and swallowing it, then gently bit her earlobe, enjoying the way she shivered on my lap. A moan followed when my fingers followed her thigh, and reached high enough to show me her bra wasn’t the only piece of underwear she was missing. “Delicious,” I repeated, but I pulled back slightly, gently teasing her inner thigh rather than slipping inside.  </p><p>I didn’t trust her to drop the fork and ruin my suit if I did so. </p><p>More importantly, she deserved a lesson for daring to tease me with her lack of panties. A little teasing was an excellent punishment considering her clear desire for more. </p><p>I said nothing, and she continued to feed me silently, which lasted until I used my other hand to unbutton her blouse even more. “S-sir,” she whispered.</p><p>“What?” I countered even as her blouse parted open completely, revealing her large tits for my gaze. I was tempted to just grab them, but it wouldn’t fit my desire to tease her slowly. Instead, I let my finger dance on her stomach, doing my best to drive her mad slowly, occasionally drifting near her naked breasts, but not touching. </p><p>“P-please touch me, sir,” she whispered. I might have felt a little inadequate if I still heard an echo of vindictiveness in her tone. Luckily, her voice was pure desire, her body aching for pleasure after she received the taste of it. </p><p>“Oh that would be wrong,” I said mockingly. “I’m your boss, after all. You can’t expect me to do something like that,” I said, enjoying the absurdity of my words under the circumstances. </p><p>“Really,” she growled, reacting to my teasing surprisingly well. She settled more comfortably on my lap, but her move still managed to surprise me with its daring. “As you wish, sir. Then, that’s enough for lunch. It’s time for the dessert. </p><p>I opened my mouth, about to ask exactly what she had in mind for a dessert, but she was quicker. She grabbed my hair with both hands as she leaned forward, capturing my lips. Her tongue was so greedy, invading my mouth with an aggression that I didn’t expect. </p><p>She was learning. </p><p>She changed her position without stopping the kiss, and turned toward me. Her legs were on both sides of me. It rode her skirt up, meaning it was her naked core that was riding my bulge. “Oh, sir, you brought a dessert for me too,” she whispered as she rubbed against me. “You’re such an excellent boss.” </p><p>“Why don’t you go and enjoy it,” I said even as I finally brought my hands against her breasts, palming their beautiful wide expanse and twisting her nipples. </p><p>“N-not right now,” she whispered as she continued to hump me. “I want to savor it first,” she said as her back arched with pleasure. I decided to give her that. The beautiful sight of her breasts, with occasional pink spots to show where my fondling had turned too rough made them look even sexier. </p><p>I made a show of swallowing hard, giving her the feedback she desired, and showing that seductive was an excellent color for her. </p><p>After all, as a boss, it was my responsibility to encourage the development of proper skills in my beautiful secretary. </p><p>“I think my new job is going to be more exhausting than I had first assumed,” she whispered throatily, encouraged by my exaggerated vulnerability as she grabbed my neck to pull herself up, but this time, she lifted herself a bit, shoo rather than kissing me, her naked breasts dangled in front of me. </p><p>“Maybe, but I can promise that hard work is always rewarded,” I whispered before I leaned forward, capturing her nipple between my lips, squeezing gently enough to earn another moan.  </p><p>“Tempting,” she whispered. “What kind of reward we are talking about?” </p><p>“Hmm,” I whispered as I buried myself between her breasts, the tremors enough to make her moan. “Have you had any place that you always wanted to visit, but never had the opportunity.” </p><p>“Paris,” the answer came instantly, before she even considered the question. </p><p>I pulled back, caught her gaze, and smirked. “Oh, what a coincidence. I need to go there very soon for a business trip, and it’s only right that I bring my secretary with me, right?” </p><p>“Oh,” she whispered as she realized the implication. “I … I don’t —” she started, coming close to refusing. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for the earlier show with Charlie, she might have refused the offer. Instead, she paused for a moment before she delivered her answer. “When is this trip?” she asked. </p><p>“That depends on how hard you work,” I answered even as my eyes roved up and down her curves. </p><p>“Well, I better start then,” she said as she vacated my lap and fell on her knees. “Comfortable,” she said as she felt the thick carpet under her, then unzipped my pants. </p><p>Showing that she was ready to work hard starting from her first day. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was whistling in a satisfied manner as I returned to the office, feeling calm, glad that my little adventure with the owner’s daughter hadn’t turned into a crisis. She didn’t even call me, which was a happy occasion. </p><p>The retreat had gone without a hitch after her disappearance until a last-minute emergency forced me away, preventing me from taking the same plane. A pity. Taking the same flight with them would have been fun. Unfortunately, my comfort depended on my success, forcing me to limit my fun while I flew around to work.  </p><p>Well, old-school working that included gambling, cigars, and strip clubs, which meant it was hardly a great hardship. Even better, while I was away, my furniture finally arrived, turning my room into something that supported the image I wanted to build. I had already received the pictures from Brenda — some that included her as well. </p><p>I particularly loved the one she wore a hat, and only a hat. </p><p>I thought that my mood would stay the same, but, unfortunately, it didn’t stay like that. Just as I was climbing the stairs, I saw Mike, the annoying sales leader, and Tiffany’s husband, and Charlie, the tech salesman and Umi’s fiancee, in a corner, conspiring. “So, the interview is today?” Mike asked. “Very good. Once your fiancee starts working for that old codger, we will be able to do whatever we want. It’ll be glorious.” </p><p>I stayed, listening as they talked for two minutes, their discussion filled with insults, annoying me. It wasn’t that I cared about the insults themselves — I deliberately undersold myself to make the seduction of their partners more fun — but their recklessness to speak like that in the middle of the office. </p><p>I thought that they would have better sense, which turned out to be a mistake. It looked like I needed to teach them a lesson before their misaligned perspective filled the office. </p><p>I decided to start with Charlie, simply because Mike walked the other way once their discussion ended. I made a point of making eye contact with him, wearing a stiff expression that shouted that I heard their discussion, though my angry expression was exaggerated. </p><p>“S-sir,” he started, which was all he was able to say as I stormed past. He was too afraid to say anything else. </p><p>Ironically, it was also a test for him. If he was smart, he would call Umi and cancel the interview. Naturally, it wouldn’t have worked, but it was still the smart thing to do based on the information he had rather than leaving his innocent fiancee free for my retaliation. </p><p>After delivering the wordless challenge, I went back to my office. “Finally,” I said as I looked at the comfortable leather chair, mahogany desk, and elegant filing cabinets rather than second-hand garbage. Most importantly, a new bar that displayed my favorite bourbon and scotch brands. </p><p>The perfect working environment. </p><p>I took my seat before I took a glance under the desk, a nice nook, covered with a thick, yet easy-to-clean carpet. It was not one of my requests. It was likely Brenda’s idea, making it comfortable for all the times she would spend time on her knees. </p><p>Even I had to do paperwork, so I turned on my computer and started handling some of the critical paperwork based on the results of my surprise trip. </p><p>Until I was interrupted an hour later. “Come in,” I called. </p><p>“S-sir, may I come in,” Charlie said as he opened the door. Behind him, I could see Umi, dressed in the classical yet sexy secretary outfit we purchased together. Mid-thigh skirt, stockings, white blouse. Though, it was a pity she didn’t wear a garter belt, and her top was buttoned completely. </p><p>“Yes, come in,” I said. I was tempted to shout at him about asking pointless questions, but that would make Umi — who was clearly unaware of the little eavesdropping accident earlier, or would have looked more nervous — feel like I was targeting him unfairly. Combined with her guilt about cheating on him, it would have backfired badly.  </p><p>I had a better punishment in mind. </p><p>Charlie walked inside, his nervous energy dissipating somewhat when I didn’t show any sign of anger. “W-we’re here for the interview, sir,” he said, still hesitant. </p><p>“Good,” I said, ignoring my initial reflex of kicking him out. I couldn’t punish him if I kicked him out. Though, when he made a move to sit, I dissuaded him with a sharp shake of my head. </p><p>He caught it. Umi was more focused on taking in the view of her new working place to notice that. “Sir, my fiancee had worked in several student clubs and —” he started, only to fall silent once I raised my hand. </p><p>“Stop, let her talk,” I ordered. Which was already an absurd start, wondering whether he was trying to sabotage the interview, or was just that shy. Not that it mattered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Umi said, who, at this point, was familiar enough with me for her natural shyness not to be a problem. She quickly rattled through several useless club activities that she had taken part in during college.  </p><p>“Sounds sufficient,” I said, then, just as Charlie was looking away, I caught her gaze with a demanding smirk, making her blush. “Of course, I need my secretary to look sexy enough to keep my mood positive. Get rid of a few buttons,” I said. </p><p>A rather forward and clumsy request, which surprised both of them. Umi because she was very much aware that such a request was unnecessary and I was very familiar with the treasure hidden under her blouse, Charlie because he didn’t expect me to take revenge this openly. </p><p>In actuality, the real punishment was what was about to follow. Umi naturally turned to her fiancee,  waiting for him to argue against such a ham-fisted method. Yet, Charlie froze, every second further lowering her respect for him. </p><p>“Really,” she whispered, shocked. Ironically, she wouldn’t have reacted that obviously if she hadn’t already cheated on him. The human mind was a wonder when it came to finding excuses, and </p><p>Charlie nodded even if his face started to lose color, realizing the absurdity of the situation. </p><p>“Well, if my fiancee thinks it’s okay,” she said. She wasn’t particularly loud or cutting, just a little edge in her tone, but, considering her usual demure attitude, that counted as shouting in shock. </p><p>Charlie clearly realized that as well, regret clear in his face. Maybe, if he was stronger, he would have chosen to ask her to stop and apologize. Yet, resignation soon followed his regret. At this point, I could see his thoughts like he actually spoke them out loud. Since he had already committed to it, he wanted to finish properly. </p><p>“Better,” I said when she unbuttoned three from the top, enjoying the resulting cleavage, deep enough to show the edge of her bra. </p><p>“Not yet, sir,” Umi suddenly said, surprising me by grabbing her skirt. She pulled it up a couple inches, turning an ordinary short skirt into a daring one, just one misstep to turn it into a true scandal. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>“I like the way you think,” I said before turning to Charlie. “Actually you explained better. Why don’t you continue explaining just how well Umi will fit in here,” I said. </p><p>“I …” he started before his voice faded momentarily, unable to come up with anything to say, finally realizing that letting Umi be my secretary wasn’t as smart as his immediate superior had suggested, yet feeling helpless to change it. </p><p>Umi’s respect for him dwindled in real-time as she watched him wallow in silence for a while before he took a deep breath, and started droning about the various activities she had been responsible for as a college student. </p><p>“Umi, can you take this document and file it in the second drawer,” I said. </p><p>Charlie continued the explanation as Umi walked toward me, only stopping for a moment when I grabbed the file, but rather than pushing it forward, I pulled it back, making Umi lean forward to grab it, which gave me an excellent view of her cleavage. </p><p>Taking a hidden glimpse into a beautiful show like that was a subtle art, but this time, I deliberately exaggerated my gaze, enjoying the show. Umi smirked in satisfaction, while Charlie’s face lost even more color. </p><p>Yet, he continued to drone when Umi grabbed the file and walked toward the cabinet, her hips swinging exaggeratedly, her shortened skirt revealing her alluring legs in the process. </p><p>“It’s rude to look,” I warned Charlie, who found himself looking away even as Umi bent forward to reach cabinet two, which was low enough that she had to either kneel … or bend forward, and give a nice show in the process.</p><p>She chose the latter, lingering for a time, while I intimidated her fiancee from enjoying it. It was mean enough to count as bullying, but he should have thought about that before mocking me. </p><p>“Excellent work, Umi. You got the job,” I said. “Now, go find Brenda so she can give you a tour of the building,” I said. </p><p>“Thank you for the opportunity, sir,” she said, and after throwing a disdainful glare at her fiancee, she walked away. I didn’t comment when she fixed her skirt and buttoned her blouse again. Her show was not for the whole company. </p><p>She left, leaving her shocked fiancee alone. “Now, I hope you learned your lesson,” I warned. </p><p>“Yes, sir. I’ll not gossip again,” he said and left. The relief in his tone was clear, making it obvious that he believed the events to be a one-off to punish him. </p><p>A very poor observer. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was glad that Peyten — no, Pei, I corrected in my mind, which somehow felt more accurate, not truly her name, but more accurate than her fake name — walked away before I even arrived at my destination. </p><p>I was glad, because it meant I could tone down the drunk-act, making it easier to seduce the target. Of course, with my increased perception, I could see several cameras around the room, but they were not good enough to actually catch the details of my actions. </p><p>There were also better, hidden cameras, but they were targeting the dance floor, receiving a premium treatment compared to the rest of the club. </p><p>As I walked toward the VIP corner, one of the bodyguards noticed my approach and immediately moved to cut my path without being intrusive. He was clearly a professional. I just smirked as he put a hand on my chest in warning. </p><p>I took a step forward, ignoring his hand. He tried to push … only to stumble back. The VIP corner was brighter, which, combined with my display, allowed him to recognize me easily. He moved back to talk to one of his bodyguard friends, who moved to talk with the bouncers. </p><p>Another sign of their professionalism, trying to handle it before their boss noticed by borrowing the club’s security forces. Too bad the bouncer shook his head negatively, refusing to intervene. </p><p>My guess: Pei already ordered them not to touch me. After all, what was the point of making me fight with her bouncers — and, her bouncers, I didn’t believe a second that she was yet another bartender. She was either the owner, or high enough at the ranks for it not to matter. </p><p>Soon, I was at the table, just as one of the bodyguards leaned against the ear of the business mogul and whispered something. His widening, fearful eyes suggested that he had just learned the town’s only hero decided to interrupt their party. </p><p>“What are you doing—” he started, but I just flicked his nose, silencing him as I looked at the sexy, fit brunette that accompanied him. </p><p>“Hello, beautiful,” I said hitting her with my biggest smile. I didn’t use a heavy-handed magical suggestion along with my words, but they weren’t necessary. </p><p>She clearly recognized me as well under the bright light, and she was clearly flattered by my interest. My opening line was hardly clever or imaginative, but it worked excellently when paired with my identity as a local celebrity — this time as the Quarterback rather than a quarterback — and my ability to ignore the four bodyguards at once. </p><p>A sentiment that was clearly not shared by the man she shared a seat with, who was busy imitating ripe beet. “Hey, buddy. This is a private party,” he said. </p><p>“Hey, I’m not here to break your party. I’m just here to help the lady stretch her beautiful legs a bit on the dance floor. You don’t seem like a dancing man, and it would be a pity if she didn’t enjoy a couple songs,” I said, my gaze still on the sexy brunette, examining her. </p><p>She was beautiful and fit, but I paid more attention to the way she positioned her body, and not just the signs she had been displaying, trying to get a better sense of her identity. A model, I decided quickly, probably a reasonably famous one at least at the state level, still in her early twenties. </p><p>“Hey, you might be —” he started, but he was interrupted again. This time by the lady herself. </p><p>“Come on, Carl. There’s no harm in just one dance,” she said as she already stood up, though I could see the calculation behind her gaze. She was attracted to my looks, but not enough to abandon her partner in a second. She had her own calculations. </p><p>Luckily, unlike Pei, she was easy to read. As an emerging hero, I was excellent material for a scandal, which would only increase her brand value. A utilitarian move, but I didn’t care about that much. First, I was exactly in a position to throw stones in my glass house of intrigue … and I was confident that I could seduce her appropriately without annoyance. </p><p>She stood up and gave a shy grin — completely artificial — as she presented her hand. I ignored it, and instead hugged her waist, pulling her closer. She was hesitant at first, but that faded away the moment her hand landed on my back … and climbed up, caressing my muscles. “Wow, you’re strong,” she said, blushing, which, unlike her shy grin, was utterly genuine. </p><p>With that, we walked away, leaving the business owner behind. The music was loud, but not enough to block my enhanced hearing. “Call the papers. The heroes love their reputation, right? I want him in the gutters,” he said. </p><p>His threat was the greatest thing I had ever heard. The other heroes might be concerned with it, but for them, purifying Intent was the biggest challenge. </p><p>For me, his threat was an unexpected treasure, like someone decided to break my windows with gold bricks. Unexpected, yet extremely valuable. </p><p>I escorted the brunette model whose name I was yet to learn toward the dance floor. Her hand slipped under my shirt, caressing my muscles, showing that she enjoyed her men strong. No wonder she had no interest in the businessman who probably spent a small fortune while trying to seduce her. “Naughty,” I whispered into her ear. </p><p>She shivered as my whisper reached her ear. “I don’t know what you mean,” she said seductively as she leaned against my chest, leaving no gaps between our bodies. </p><p>“Oh, that’s the way you want to play,” I said even as I let my hand move lower, cupping her ass aggressively. </p><p>“Hey, that’s too much,” she whispered as her nails dug into my back, but not only did she make no move to push my hand away, but also she leaned against me even further, giving the non-verbal green light. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” I said as I squeezed her ass, giving her the same answer, which made her give out a surprisingly beautiful laugh as she half-turned toward me. </p><p>While her eyes were closed, I threw a glance toward her previous partner who was currently busy walking away … and taunted him. Not by using Intent, not when I was in the club. Trying to use Intent directly was risky, as I had no idea whether Pei could actually feel it. </p><p>Luckily, it was not needed. The scene was already perfect. The sight of the beautiful woman he had been working for a long time to date — likely weeks, I guessed — in my arms, giggling while my hands were already sneaking into inappropriate places was dangerous enough without adding a magical hit into the mix. </p><p>Her dress made it even better. She was wearing a tiny maroon dress, which was supposed to be sexy and stylish at the same time, but as a couple fingers slipped inside using its side slid, caressing her thigh directly, it didn’t look very stylish. </p><p>I could see anger and frustration boiling in his eyes. Even without the potential benefits of increasing my Intent gain without creating suspicion, seducing a woman whom a privileged prick thought was his — as she clearly disagreed with the idea — was a great feeling. </p><p>I didn’t keep my attention on him for long. I just sent a subtle yet mocking wave toward his way before I turned my gaze to my sexy partner, catching her gaze, and enjoying her aroused gaze while I slipped my hand even further. </p><p>“I thought you we were supposed to dance —” she started, which was all she was able to say before I dipped down, catching her lips in a searing kiss, showing her that I had no intention of taking it slow … a sentiment she clearly shared as her lips met mine, even more eager as our tongues danced. </p><p>Though, the kiss was not accidental. I deliberately started kissing her away from the dance floor, as an experiment to understand the range and the effectiveness better. </p><p>It was a fun experiment. </p><p>I let my hands settle on her ass, squeezing them hard, enjoying their perkiness that could only be created through a combination of genetic lottery, supported by very careful physical exercising. She responded with a desperate grind of her hips, surrendering to my surprise assault.  </p><p>She pulled back almost a minute later, breathing hard as she tried to control it. “H-hey, I thought we were supposed to dance,” she said as she looked around, afraid that our photo was taken. </p><p>She might want a scandal, but she clearly wanted it in a way that could be vetted by her marketing people. Yet, she didn’t say anything, clearly betting on the fact that I was reckless enough not to think of the possibility of a scandal. </p><p>I continued to play dumb. </p><p>“As you wish, beautiful,” I answered as I wrapped my hand around her waist once more as we walked toward the dance floor slowly, though I still kissed her neck every few steps, making sure to gather the necessary data for my exciting experiment. </p><p>It was very important if I were to properly trick Pei. </p>",

    "content": "<p> I identified my target, but I didn’t move forward. I could have … but it would be too obvious, which was a problem even under the best of the situation. The subtle magic field that covered the center told me to slow down. </p><p>I was tempted to just turn and leave, but I was afraid that it would show that I noticed the effect that was at the center of the dance floor, which wouldn’t be a good idea. After all, it was subtle, enough for me to assume that an ordinary hero wouldn’t be able to detect it. Leaving the club prematurely would have revealed my hand. </p><p>I went to the bar and asked for half a dozen shots. “Hard night?” the bartender asked. </p><p>I just shrugged. “Just trying to catch up with the crowd,” I said even as I rapidly went through them, gesturing toward the dance floor. </p><p>“Yeah, wait until midnight. You can’t believe the things that happen on the dance floor,” he said with an amused shrug, though I didn’t miss the tone of disbelief in his tone, which suggested that he didn’t know the reason for it, which confirmed not all employees were unaware of the nature of the place. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said, but didn’t ask another question. I couldn’t just stay and watch the dance floor without it getting too suspicious. Instead, I started looking around at the bar, as if I were looking for a target for a one-night stand. “Any interesting groups tonight?” I asked even as I passed him a large tip. “Maybe a bachelorette party or something that might be interested in an adventure.” </p><p>“A whole party?” he asked with a chuckle, the dismissal in his tone showing that he didn’t recognize the only superhero in town, my identity paper-thin at this point. Not too surprising, considering just how dark the place was, and the blinding background lights didn’t exactly help. “Someone’s feeling confident.” </p><p>“Shoot for the stars, and you might just land on the moon and find yourself in a low-gravity orgy,” I said. </p><p>“Alright, I like your confidence,” the bartender said. “How about those —” he started, before he got interrupted. </p><p>“Hey, the boss asks you for some questions about the inventory,” a woman spoke, interrupting him. </p><p>“Really, Peyten? Are you sure?” he asked, his worry clear, which was understandable. Every bartender skimped on alcohol, either to give some extra to their best customers to fish for tips, or to pocket some of the cash payments without registering the sale. </p><p>“Yes, I’m sure,” Peyten answered. However, this time, it was just an excuse. The reason was simple. Peyten was not an ordinary woman — unless the definition of ordinary changed during my absence, and currently included people with magic fields around them, disguising their looks.  </p><p>I didn’t dare to probe what was around her, but I could feel that it was similar to what was going on around the dance floor, once again echoing in my Lust Domain, like they had similar sources. Similar, but not entirely the same. </p><p>I ignored the temptation to poke it with my Intent, and just observed passively, particularly focusing on her disguise. I wasn’t an expert when it came to magic, nowhere near close, but the similarity with my Lust Domain allowed me to get a general idea of the function. </p><p>And the function was interesting. The disguise was actually concealing her beauty rather than enhancing it, which was an interesting use. Yet, understandable, as even with it, she was clearly the most beautiful woman at the bar, several drunk men already looking at me jealously. She was a busty blonde, her beauty shining despite wearing a practical shirt and jean combo, neither particularly tight. </p><p>I was willing to bet that her beauty had some supernatural roots. “So, Peyten, why don’t you take over and help me find a few lady friends while I enjoy another half a dozen shots,” I said, but even as I used her name, it felt wrong … diminished. Just like her looks, her name was disguised. </p><p>My instinctual realization about the name was interesting. It was the first time I felt a name having an actual power. The moment I spoke, I felt like touching a statue. One that was behind a curtain … somehow, letting me know that her real name was similar to Peyten, but not the same.  </p><p>“Oh, you think you can handle that much?” she said, and I abandoned those thoughts for the moment. If her name had power, exploring the truth might not be the best of ideas. </p><p>Instead, I focused on her taunt. Her voice was seductive and challenging, leaving ambiguous whether she talked about the girls or the drinks. I recognized the method. It was the exact way I taunted people to make them commit some terrible mistakes. </p><p>“I can handle it,” I said, my smile smug and wide, doing my best impression of Kevin, like I deserved everything just by existing. </p><p>I had no doubt that she recognized me as the new hero of the town, and that was a way to test me. </p><p>A test that I managed to fail if I managed to read her diminishing interest accurately. </p><p>Just as I wanted. She might be the hottest woman here even with the disguise, but that didn’t mean I would just throw myself to seduce her … no matter how tempting was the idea of seeing her true beauty. I rather stay concealed. </p><p>“Here, your drinks,” she said, but I noticed she poured them from another bottle, carrying a strong hint of empowerment. I could sense that the moment I drank them, it would challenge my supernatural endurance — once again able to read the function thanks to the similarity in domain. </p><p>It was a good way to get an arrogant superhero drunk. I decided to take the risk of concealing my role and took the first one, analyzing the impact. It was strong … strong enough that, the six of them would make me properly drunk and reckless if I was still relying on Heroic Traits … though with the combination of Recovery and Endurance, it would have barely lasted an hour. </p><p>With the Divine Body, it was far easier to ignore. </p><p>“E-excellent drink,” I said, easily faking being drunk. </p><p>“Very good, mister hero,” she said, her voice getting even more dismissive, my success making her dismiss me even more. </p><p>“Thanks, do you want to have fun with the hero—” I said with a smirk before freezing. “I m-mean, what do you mean by hero. I’m just a man who just woke up from a coma,” I said. “I have papers to prove it.” </p><p>Using that as an excuse was a good way to further convince her about the situation. </p><p>“Sorry, I must have been mistaken. Now, why don’t you seduce that lady, she’s more to your taste,” she said, her voice once again using a suggestion, though this time in an even heavier manner. She was truly an expert in persuasion, I realized. She didn’t use as much power as I did, but the impact was impressive. Without the Divine Mind, I would have followed her order immediately. </p><p>Luckily, she was targeting the exact same table I wanted to aim for, one with the business mogul. She clearly had a reason for it. </p><p>“Would you be i-interested in a three-way if I can get her,” I asked even as I stood up, making a show of poor balance. </p><p>“Unfortunately no. That man has some gang connections, and it’s a bit dangerous for me,” she said, which was the most blatant lie she ever told. I could feel that she treated him as a mosquito, annoying but small. “But you’re a big brave hero, I’m sure you can deal with him and save that poor woman,” she said, once again magically persuasive. </p><p>Just by listening to her, I could come up with better ways of using my Intimidation and Taunt abilities, which was a surprising reward. </p><p>Of course, that ‘poor’ woman was certainly not in distress as she magically tried to convince me, and was looking mostly bored. </p><p>“Pity, you won’t join us,” I said, doing my best to fake a drunk confidence as I stumbled toward the table. </p><p>“Don’t forget to bring her to the dance floor. It’s rude to bring a lady away without dancing,” she said. I didn’t want to the clearly magical floor, but unfortunately, I had to, because her persuasion magic was even thicker.</p><p>Not enough to affect me … but strong enough that, if I ignored it, it would ruin the whole point of my earlier acting. So, even as I walked toward my destination, I used the slow pace of a dizzy drunk to examine the dance floor more carefully, particularly the way the dancers interacted with it. </p><p>There was another lust field integrated, though surprisingly, it didn’t actually make people act differently. It just gathered and focused the resulting energy. Like the chess set that the German professor used against me … but several times better. It not only collected and cleaned the energy, but it focused. </p><p>Still Intent, but a focused, purified kind, but causing a lot of loss in the process. </p><p>Interesting process, but I was reasonably sure that I could fake it. </p><p>Excellent. </p>",

Hanging upside down from the boyfriend in question was a bad location to listen to an explosion. </p><p>“I guess you were right,” Fatima said … which was not the explosion Erin had been expecting. It surprised her, though not as much as her smile. </p><p>“I beg you pardon,” Erin found herself asking. </p><p>“I didn’t say anything to you, honey. I was talking to Darion,” Fatima said, her voice surprisingly light for catching her boyfriend in the shower with another woman. “Though, I would have loved it if you resisted even a bit…” </p><p>“What?” she said. Well, stammered, as Darion was yet to stop licking her, and it was hard to resist the pleasure. </p><p>“Well, we made a bet, and Darion said it would only take five minutes for you to put out. You managed to cost me quite a bit.” </p><p>“Wait, what…” she stammered, as she pulled herself up, ready to get down … but Darion’s tongue quickened, forcing a loud moan off her. It took a moment for her to jump down, which was a pity as it was fun to stay up. “Now, tell me what’s going on.” </p><p>“Well, we made a bet, and since I lost, I have to join you two for a threesome,” Fatima declared like it was a certainty. </p><p>Erin froze, shocked at the presumption. “And, you’re confident that I would accept,” Erin said. Fatima didn’t answer, but her naughty smile was answered enough. Worse, Erin failed to refute, and avoided her gaze. </p><p>“Just as I thought,” Fatima said. Erin opened her mouth to answer, only to end up locked in a passionate kiss. A nice one, Erin had to admit, enough for her to abandon herself to her embrace, even when she forced her to the other side. </p><p>She bit her lips as she realized just how badly things devolved from what was supposed to be an investor meeting. Worse, she had no intention of actually resisting as Fatima mauled her body aggressively if a bit ineptly, showing it was the first time she was with a woman. </p><p>Erin had a feeling Fatima’s new boyfriend was making her change her habits rapidly. </p><p>“Well, work hard, and you’ll have a repeat customer,” Fatima whispered, and Erin felt a touch annoyed, mostly because Fatima was barely able to string a teasing sentence together. </p><p>“Hey, don’t neglect me. This is supposed to be a threesome,” Darion said. </p><p>“Sorry about it,” Fatima said as she pushed Erin down. Erin allowed, even when Fatima sat on her face. She started licking while Fatima’s gagging reached to her ear. She abandoned herself to pleasure …</p><p>Which was why she didn’t understand how she ended up flipping, looking the other side while Darion invaded her, while she continued to lick Fatima. “Lick harder,” Fatima moaned. Erin would have answered … but she was busy moaning. </p><p>“You’re the best personal trainer I have ever seen,” Darion mocked her. Erin would have loved to respond in a clever way to show her she wasn’t to be mocked and played … but locked between two bodies, she couldn’t disagree.</p><p>Even once they changed positions, and were about to answer, Fatima put her fingers into her mouth. “No need to talk, sweetie. Just put on a show…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“And, I think that’s the last one,” I said as I passed the last bag to her in front of her door, enjoying the incredible blush that spread on Emily’s face … and she didn’t even try them on. </p><p>That had been my initial plan, but she was very reluctant to try them on and pose with them in real-time, enough to strain our budding relationship if I tried to push her on the subject according to my Observation. </p><p>There was no harm in delaying the show a little. </p><p>“T-thank you, it has been a fun day,” she whispered as she stood at the door, conflicted about whether to invite me in or not. Pushing her wouldn’t be useful, so I leaned forward for a quick, sweet kiss before pulling back. </p><p>“Actually, thank you, my beautiful superhero,” I replied. “You’re the one that’s saving my life with your powers.” It was a touch exaggerated, but considering her overall lack of self-confidence relating to her power — dismissed as a mere receptionist would do that — I had no problem being freer with my compliments. </p><p>Emily reacted to the positivity very well, in the form of another, far more heated kiss, her body smashing against mine, rubbing in a way that was inappropriate for a corridor, tempting me to use the opportunity to take a step inside and damn the consequences. </p><p>Unfortunately, my situation as a fake villain was too dangerous to risk that way, so I let Emily have control for a minute. When she pulled back, she was panting and her lips were parted with arousal, and for a moment, I hoped that she would drag me inside. </p><p>Too bad her shyness asserted itself a second later. “Um, I’ll see you later,” she whispered, took a step back, and slammed the door closed, retreating to the safety of her house, once again amusing me with the differences. </p><p>As I walked away, I couldn’t help but wonder whether her power played a role in her general attitude, making her feel safer due to her enhanced control. </p><p>Very likely, I concluded as I started traveling back to my bar. It was almost time to open the bar, and I couldn’t rely on Tara to handle the business. And, not opening the bar on time would send the wrong message — especially since I was supposed to be at the bar the whole time. </p><p>Before I could arrive, my phone buzzed. A message from Emily. ‘I have finished setting up the computer, and your researcher is ready to serve,’ the message read, but I was more interested in the attached photo. It showed where Emily had set up her new laptop … but she was in front of the computer, wearing a pair of faux glasses that had been slid forward slightly. </p><p>And nothing else. </p><p>Pity she chose her angle perfectly so that the laptop covered her naughty bits perfectly, giving me nothing but a nice cleavage and a glimpse of her beautiful legs. Without my power, I wouldn’t be able to guess that she was naked. </p><p>That didn’t prevent me from enjoying the photo very much, especially when she followed with another one just a minute later, this time giving a better glimpse of her cleavage, her blush suggesting that her fingers weren’t only busy with the keyboard. </p><p>‘Amazing setup, miss analyst. How about you start working,’ I wrote back, and followed with a bunch of names. </p><p>‘I’m on it, sir,’ she wrote back, followed by another photo of her, this time askew enough to give me a glimpse of her areolas. </p><p>We texted back and forth even as I returned to the outskirts of the city and used the secret tunnel to go back. I received several more photos, along with some very complete portfolios of the names and pictures I had sent. </p><p>She might lack the ability to hack, but that wasn’t a big detriment when she could go through the public sources and vet them with a shocking speed. Moreover, once I had given her multiple names, she was also able to find quite a bit connections between them. Old school photos that they thought they had erased, names of family members, old employment records…</p><p>Alone, they were impressive enough, but when I crossed them with my own real-time observations, about the way they reacted to the presence of each other, it created an even more complete picture. </p><p>Just like that, not only I was able to identify exactly which person worked for which gang — the shell companies they worked for and the lawyers that defended them against lawsuits doing wonders — but I also had a good idea about their weaknesses; financial troubles, mistresses, gambling…</p><p>Altogether, an excellent start. </p><p>I was tempted to send the names and pictures I gathered from Elite Syndicate, but after some thought, I decided against it. Who knew if they had the ability to trace back her queries. Instead, I asked her to study how to hide her connection while she did her research. </p><p>Her first answer was VPNs, but after she explained how they worked, I vetoed hard. It was just trusting her information to other servers. I didn’t trust them to refuse to give out the information if the Elite Syndicate came calling. </p><p>No, it was far safer to delay poking that particular bear while Emily studied. </p><p>However, that was a complicated study that would take quite a bit of time to get used to. Instead, I asked her to collect some information about some of the shell companies being used by the smaller gangs, curious whether I would be able to get anything from there. </p><p>With that, I was at the bar, which was in an even better state than how I left, showing that Tara worked hard. Currently, she was at the bar, dusting the bottles, acting unaware of my presence. Acting, evidenced by three points. One, I had already informed her about my imminent arrival. Two, I didn’t bother hiding my stomping, and if she was careless enough to miss that, I certainly wouldn’t have trusted her to protect the place. </p><p>Three, she was wearing the sexy French maid uniform we purchased during our shopping trip while leaning forward excessively while handling the bottles … minus the underwear that came with it. </p><p>A shocking amount of daring considering her usual submissive attitude. </p><p>One that I had no issues rewarding. </p><p>However, I didn’t say anything immediately. First, I took a seat, taking a note of her ensemble. It started with tall stilettos that looked impossible to balance — but she moved with ease thanks to her power — followed by white fishnet stockings that climbed halfway to her thighs, where a normal skirt was supposed to start. </p><p>Her skirt was much shorter than that. It would have covered her beautiful bottom, but only if she was standing perfectly straight. With the way she bent forward, it kept nothing hidden, giving me an excellent view of her curves.  </p><p>She was wearing the blouse that came with the set, which was a pity. She would have looked far better wearing just the apron. </p><p>The set was complete with a nice bow around her neck, highlighting her submissive nature even more, and so was the cute little headband that peeked through her beautiful brown hair, currently gathered in a nice braid. </p><p>Altogether, a truly sexy maid, ready to work for her master both day and night … in every room. </p><p>And, if she wanted to play like this, I was more than happy to accommodate her. “Bring me a scotch, neat,” I ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” her answer came quick, and poured me a glass before she turned toward me, giving me another fun surprise. Her blouse was mostly unbuttoned, giving me an excellent view of her cleavage until her apron started blocking. </p><p>I watched her saunter toward me, showing the full benefits of our earlier training. With each step,  her hips swayed beautifully, revealing the treasures underneath, her tits swaying alluringly. But, despite the show, the greatest thing about her beauty was her expression, demure yet alluring. Her body moved with the skill and confidence of a supermodel, but her expression told me that the display was more about her power. </p><p>She was just as shy and submissive as ever. </p><p>It only made her more beautiful. </p><p>I enjoyed the slow, alluring approach of my sexy model, each second filling me with a deeper appreciation of her beauty. She stood in front of me, a perfect mixture of sexy and demure, asking for more. I smirked as I grabbed the glass and took a sip. “What a clumsy maid. This is not scotch, but bourbon” I said, my tone harsh. “Apologize, or I’ll see you fired.” </p><p>“Oh, no, sir,” she gasped, trying to sound distressed, but there was no hiding her rising excitement. “I’ll do so immediately,  please don’t get me fired,” she said as she fell on her knees hard enough for me to wonder if she actually damaged the floor. </p><p>Considering her power, not an unlikely outcome. </p><p>However, I stopped wondering about it soon enough, and turned my focus on more important things, like the depth of her amazing cleavage. While I enjoyed that, she gathered her hands on her lap, looking up obediently. </p>",

    "content": "<p>She stayed silent for a long while, hugging me while trying to get me to relax. I answered her questions in simple ways, keeping her from realizing I had been pushing her toward a certain conclusion. </p><p>“Maybe …” she whispered a while later. “Would it help if I could send you research packages like the previous time, just like I had done for that customer? I’m not bad with a computer.”</p><p>Talk about underselling.  </p><p>“It might, but it’s not like you can stay in front of the computer constantly, ready to do such research. And, it takes time to collect such information. I don’t think I’ll have several minutes to wait,” I said, deliberately putting all my problems just for the time required for her to collect the information. I had some other issues in mind, of course, but I kept those until she could make her grand reveal. </p><p>My power was suggesting that the grand was near. </p><p>“And, what if … I can do it faster,” she whispered. </p><p>“That would help but—” I started, only to fake a gasp of shock when she put her finger on her phone. Suddenly, her screen flashed as multiple pages opened, operating in parallel while bypassing the screen. “Fascinating,” I said. “You are a hero.” </p><p>“Not a hero,” she said with a scoff, her disdain clear despite my fascinated voice. “It barely allowed me to get a receptionist job. Not exactly worthy of the name super, and certainly not enough to deserve the title of a hero.” </p><p>“I disagree,” I answered, cutting her argument before it could form. “Here you are, revealing a dangerous secret just to help me. It’s a worthy heroic move. The extent of your power doesn’t matter,” I declared. </p><p>She might have disagreed, but I chose that exact second to grab her beautiful chin and pull her closer, enjoying her lips. The kiss was enough to kill any objection she had, leaving her blushing intensely even as she responded to the kiss, hesitantly.  </p><p>Clearly, her confidence while taking selfies didn’t extend to the physical realm. I didn’t push for more, and instead, I pulled back, letting her lips continue dancing against mine in an effort to push for more, especially without going into too much detail.</p><p>It was a great opportunity. </p><p>I could have pushed for more, but under the circumstances, learning more about her powers was more important than her physical surrender. I pulled back. “Thank you, you can’t believe how much it means to see,” I said. </p><p>Which was the truth. She didn’t answer, just blushing as she hugged me, seconds passing slowly. “Would it be okay if I ask you questions about your power?” I asked. </p><p>She nodded hesitantly, but with my power, I could easily identify her hesitancy wasn’t about her unwillingness to share her secrets. She was ashamed of the limits of her power. </p><p>I strongly disagreed with that conclusion. Even the amount she had revealed was incredible without combining it with mine. For example, they would have actually caught me if they put her as the head of security rather than a receptionist, showing that the New Giant Force wasn’t very careful thinking about the powers of their members. </p><p>Admittedly, they didn’t need to be, not with the game rigged in their favor, allowing them to have the first pick out of the new heroes.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Even what you have done collecting that information had been amazing, especially if it was as quick as I assumed. How long it took?” </p><p>“A second, maybe two?” she said. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I said as I kissed her cheek, using positive reinforcement to make her feel more confident in her power. “And, can you access to locked computers, or do you need direct access?” I said. </p><p>“I can’t access anything that requires a password to access,” she said. “It feels like an impenetrable wall, and my power just bounces.” </p><p>It was a big restriction, but it didn’t surprise me. The New Giant Force might be negligent when assessing the new powers, but even they wouldn’t turn their nose to a super hacker. Of course, that didn’t make her power useless. “And, what happens if you have the password,” I said. </p><p>“Then I can use my power,” she said. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as a lot of options appeared in my mind, but rather than delving into it directly, I asked another question. “And, about accessing the locker room,” I said, enjoying her blush as I reminded her of the pictures she sent indirectly. “How did you access it without the password?” </p><p>“That’s simple,” she said. “You can think the password layer is between the door and the keypad. I can’t open the door while touching the keypad, but as long as I can touch the door directly, it doesn’t matter.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said. It was an interesting workaround that I didn’t expect to be working. Manipulating a device through a screen was different than manipulating it directly. Ultimately, the screen was designed to receive inputs, which could be copied. </p><p>What she explained was closer to manipulating data directly. </p><p>“And, can you use your power on anything?” I asked. </p><p>“No, digital devices only,” she admitted. Another interesting restriction that could be explored. </p><p>“Does the strength of the device matter?” I asked. </p><p>That earned a confused shrug. “I don’t really know,” she said, only for me to grab her arm and pull her up. “Let’s go and check, then,” I said as I stood up. She followed with a smile that was only partially about the kisses that she received every few steps. </p><p>My open excitement about exploring her power surprised her. She had clearly accepted that her power was useless — a mood I had experienced myself when I realized my power was just better observation before I realized the surprising advantages of it — and she was excited now that I was treating it as a treasure. </p><p>Soon, we were at a large electronic shop inside one of the poorer malls — an attempt to stay under the radar. I held her hand as we walked through a line of computers, from the weakest to strongest, while she tried to make a series of harmless and unnoticeable changes in the computers, trying to see if there was a difference in speed. </p><p>Soon, she reached a conclusion. “It looks like the performance of the device helps,” she said. “It’s not easy to distinguish if the difference is small, but here, it helps.” </p><p>“Good,” I said as I called in one of the salespeople, and arranged the purchase of the most expensive computer here. “That’s too pricy, we don’t need to buy it,” she said. “A cheaper one will do—” she started, but I sealed her lips with another kiss even as the salesman walked away, murmuring jealously. </p><p>“No, you’re the one helping me. This is the least I can do,” I said. “And, I have received that money from the other villains, thinking that I’m one. The best we can do is to spend it to defy them.” I made a show of sighing. “I wish that we could purchase something even better so—” I added, then I made a show of stopping. </p><p>“Actually, can we try something else,” I said. She nodded. “Try to change the settings for the computers and allow them to be networked. Maybe you can use them together,” I suggested. </p><p>She did as I asked, but by the fourth computer, I could see the signs of strain on her face, so I gestured for her to stop. “How was it?” I asked. </p><p>“Weird,” she answered, looking slightly dazed. “It was like trying to look to my left and my right at the same time. It is far more difficult to use multiple computers at the same time,” she said. </p><p>Interesting point, especially since some of the computers she had used only had single cores, and the one we had bought had four multi-core processors. It looked like her power had some interesting distinctions between what counted as single and multiple devices. </p><p>Or, I was just overthinking, and her power was just interacting through the operating system — it required more experimentation, but the fact that she could use multiple computers through a connection was still extremely useful. </p><p>After all, I had a nice basement to put a much better computer if needed. </p><p>“I’m sorry that I failed —” she whispered, which had been cut short once I leaned to seal her lips.</p><p>“Nonsense. On the contrary, your power issues are even better than I had expected. You might actually save me from my blunder,” I said, exaggerating my emotional relief … but not the intent behind it. Her power was actually far better than I had expected, and considering even the diminished form had been a treasure for me…</p><p>She said nothing as we paid for the computer, and I kissed her again as we walked out. “Now, do you want to go somewhere private …” I said, then noticed her expression shifting to a sudden shy nature. One that told me she wanted something different, something that she was too shy to admit. “Or, if you want, we can do some sexy shopping,” I said. </p><p>Her blush was all the answer I needed.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I followed Sophie inside, I couldn’t help but pay attention to her choice of clothing. A tall t-shirt that managed to cover her hips … and panties. Add in the way her hips were swaying more than necessary, and I had a feeling that she wasn’t regretting our little adventure. </p><p>Good, because I was looking forward to a proper one. </p><p>“It’s rude to look stare,” she said, without even looking. And, I knew for a fact there was no mirror she could use to check my expression, meaning it was a guess. </p><p>Considering the size and the nature of her panties, and the tendency of her shirt to ride up, not a bad guess, still just a guess. I could have claimed that I wasn’t looking, and I might have even convinced her if I worked hard. </p><p>“I might be a cultivator, but even for me, impossible exists,” I said, happy to see the sudden blush creeping to her neck. </p><p>“Jerk,” she muttered. “So, should we be worried about suddenly being cut in half,” she said, however, her tone implied she was more interested in changing the subject than actually looking for an answer. It was cute that she was confident enough to put on a show — not to mention everything that happened a few hours ago — but an honest compliment suddenly triggered her shyness. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I said. “Anything useful from the phones,” I said. </p><p>“Quite a bit, though mostly bad,” she said as we arrived at the basement entrance. </p><p>“Let’s start with the good,” I said as I followed her downstairs. Lana was there, in her usual seat, typing, however, unlike the previous time, she wasn’t exuding a sense of control and authority. It was probably because, instead of focusing on a difficult challenge, she was busy sending fleeting glances our way, blushing furiously as she did so.  </p><p>At first, I thought she was reacting to the spectacular way Sophie was dressed, but I soon realized her gaze was locked on me … particularly the middle part of my body. It clicked. </p><p>It seemed Sophie decided to have some girl talk about our bedroom adventure. I was tempted to tease Sophie about it, but I held back. We needed Lana awake, and I doubted she could handle any more stimulation. </p><p>“The only good thing is that EIM is not corrupt,” Sophie explained. “Well, whatever that’s going on, they are trying to keep it hidden from the headquarters,” she explained. “His work phone has nothing but fake reports, and they are too carefully crafted just to be placeholders. Officially they are searching for some kind of statue that drives the holder mad.” </p><p>“A good way to explain the occasional murderous demonic cultivator,” I said. “I’m guessing that there’s nothing in those reports about draining life force.” She shook her head. “It’s good that the organization is not filled with demonic cultivators,” I said, shivering at the idea. </p><p>“We don’t have concrete evidence of that, it might be still the case,” she said. </p><p>I shivered at the thought, not just about what it would mean, but also how the sect might react. They never favored a light touch when it came to leaked cultivation manuals, and things got even worse when it came to demonic cultivation. </p><p>I would have called in a few favors to get some assistance, but with my communication crystal confiscated, that was not an option. </p><p>“Let’s move to the bad news,” I said. </p><p>Sophie sighed even as she pulled a map of the town, several points marked, three with red. “We have a lot of bad news,” she said. “First, it looks like every single agent assigned to the case is a part of the conspiracy,” she said. </p><p>“Makes sense. Otherwise, they couldn’t have falsified the official reports,” I said, agreeing with her conclusion. </p><p>“We also realized that they have only a few people they are in contact with, but those people have their underlings. We don’t have a concrete number, but our guess is between twenty and fifty. It looks like those contracts are using the warehouse as their gathering place.” </p><p>“How about the forest base,” I said. </p><p>“That’s a bit more complicated,” she said. “From what we could piece together, there’s something valuable there, but they can’t excavate it without some kind of distraction.” </p><p>“And, they want their associates to create that distraction,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, but the thing I don’t understand is why?” Sophie continued. “Even if what they want to extract is in the middle of the city, and it’s too big to be hidden, there are far better excuses. A gas leak, construction, some kind of historical site.” </p><p>“Y-yeah, and since it’s in the forest, there’s a lot more options than disguising as a part of the clean-up crew,” she followed. </p><p>I sighed. “It makes sense —” I started, only to freeze as another possibility hit me. I jumped up to my feet and looked at the screen. “Show me the messages that talk about the clean-up crew,” I said. She did so, and I started reading them. </p><p>There were a lot of messages about the clean-up crew, but as I read them, the sense of fear and reverence at the mention was getting clear. </p><p>“Damn,” I said as I took a deep breath as the lengths they had been planning to go finally clicked. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” Sophie asked. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to contain the sudden flash of anger. “The clean-up crew is one of the unofficial names for a type of sect mission,” I said, unable to hide my shiver. </p><p>“That bad?” Sophie asked. </p><p>“Worse,” I replied. “It’s one of the last resorts against the areas that are assumed to be too far gone to be saved,” I said. “That kind of mission is usually led by three Golden Core elders, and only used when there’s absolute devastation is required.” </p><p>“And, when you say absolute devastation,” Sophie said. “Are we talking about tanks or—” </p><p>“After they had their time to set up their formations,” I said, pausing for a moment to find a nice equivalent. Then, one clicked. “Enough to rival a nuclear bomb, and not a small one,” I said, my tone grave. </p><p>“W-we have to stop them,” Sophie suddenly gasped, her aura flaring. Even Lana’s aura was not different. “No matter the cost.” </p><p>She looked at me challengingly, but I just sighed. “It’s not that simple,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean it’s not simple,” she started. “We’re talking about the destruction of a whole town. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people. Even if I have to kill them with my bare hands —” she started, her aura flaring and changing even more. </p><p>I wished I was in a mood to appreciate it. Instead, I silenced her with a gesture. “Believe me, I’m not worried about killing a bunch of demonic cultivators,” I said. “But killing them is not the problem.”  </p><p>“Their agent in the clean-up crew,” Lana completed. </p><p>“Exactly,” I said. “It’s clear that there is someone high-up in the sect that’s manipulating the issue. We can’t just go and kill their agents, hoping that everything will be alright. We need to draw out whoever that’s behind the issue first.” </p><p>“I still don’t understand,” Sophie interrupted. “What can be down there to go such lengths.” </p><p>Another sigh escaped my mouth. “That, I don’t have the slightest idea,” I said. “There’s too many options. Some kind of secret realm. A clue about an ancient cultivation manual. A treasury. Cultivators are a greedy bunch.” </p><p>“You’re talking like you’re not one of them,” Sophie cut in, angry. </p><p>“You’re acting like I ever had a choice. I was twelve when the sect took me. Without asking my opinion,” I countered, which cut her short, her expression turning into shame. She opened her mouth for an apology, but I raised my hand, silencing her. I wouldn’t have acted curt, but the situation was too complicated to focus on that. </p><p>“O-okay, calm down. It looks like we have two options,” Lana said. “Either we can somehow try to discover who’s behind the issue, or we contact this … sect directly and see if we can prevent the issue first.” </p><p>I responded. “Unfortunately. Contacting the sect is not an option. I don’t have my communication crystal. And, even if I did, I don’t have the pull necessary to reveal anything. I have no idea who’s daring enough to subvert an extermination mission, but anyone strong enough to do that is also strong enough to get rid of me before I could reveal too much,” I said. “Especially if I go without evidence.” </p><p>“What do you mean you can’t contact them? Don’t they have a phone number?” Sophie cut in. “Even if they are as reclusive as you claim, they are still living somewhere on this damned planet. We can take a plane or something?” </p><p>As she said that, I remembered that I had yet to explain to them the dissection was not exactly on Earth. I let her rant angrily for a moment, waiting for her to calm down before dropping another bomb.</p><p>But that changed once I felt several auras, approaching the house, too organized to be accidental.  </p><p>“We have guests,” I interrupted her tirade. </p>",

    "content": "<p>While Sophie slept after our afternoon fun, I was in the kitchen, sipping some instant coffee. “Disgusting,” I muttered even as I took another sip from the dark liquid. It tasted just as bitter as I remembered from childhood. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but take another sip. It was a beautiful contrast compared to the essence-infused teas that the sect was obsessed with, some taking hundreds of years to properly mature. The simple, horrible bitterness of the instant coffee was the exact opposite of the complex, harmonious taste of the tea, inferior in every single category. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but love it. Different was good, reminding me that, for the moment, I was away from the strictness of the sect. </p><p>I closed my eyes, focusing on the present … well, the present, and the very recent past, particularly when I had a certain sexy blonde on me, sharing a beautiful moment. I let the moment wash over me, not just the physical part of it, but also the shine of her aura, one that shone beautifully with the truth of her soul. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder just how good of a saber cultivator she would have made if she had the potential to cultivate — however, I still had trouble such similar weapons represented required wildly differing philosophies and methods — her unique sense of justice and bravery driving her forward. </p><p>I could even imagine her fighting method. Something that relied on overwhelming momentum, perfectly fitting with her recklessness and her haste to sacrifice herself — a fact that I had already witnessed twice, once metaphorically by sacrificing her career, once literally by refusing to ask for help until it got too late. </p><p>I closed my eyes, imagining her naked, holding just a saber as we sparred in a private room, my sword dancing against her saber, my attacks dancing around hers like the wind, each hit chipping down her aura…</p><p>Just like that, I was lost in the moment, my mind churning moves one after another, endless variations blooming in my mind as I focused on what kind of style I would have used facing her if she was a cultivator stronger than I was…</p><p>A light around my sword, shining with an equal sense of purpose, mixed with flexibility…</p><p>My feet free as the wind, ethereal and ephemeral… </p><p>My heart unfettered with pointless concerns, focusing only on the next move…</p><p>As my mind danced on those possibilities, I was barely aware of my coffee, getting colder and colder in my grip, the room getting darker and darker. </p><p>Until, I let out a gentle breath, one that was tinged with sword essence, purer than anything I managed to conjure in my life. The cup in my hand was cut in two … and along with the kitchen counter. A thin, perfect line. </p><p>An impossible cut.</p><p>“T-that…” I muttered, feeling like I had just woken up from a dream, and froze, realizing the impossibility of what had just happened. An impossibility. A miracle. </p><p>I had just had an epiphany.</p><p>One that allowed me to touch the impossibility that was Sword Intent, the first mark of a true swordsman, the deep, impossible gulf that separated the true genius from the ordinary, the harshest requirement of a core disciple. </p><p>Even in the Heavenly Sword Sect, Sword Intent had a legendary status, an endless number of outer and inner disciples spending incomprehensible fortunes on treasures, even throwing themselves in danger in the hopes of somehow touching that realm, but to return empty-handed … if they returned at all.  </p><p>Yet, I had just an epiphany that let me touch that realm while sitting on an uncomfortable stool, drinking one of the most disgusting beverages the human mind could come up with unless it was designed for actual torture. </p><p>Fascinating. Unbelievable. Absurd.  </p><p>I couldn’t help. I just laughed. </p><p>It was a full-belly, unrestricted laugh, the kind that I didn’t even remember letting out … well since I was nine. </p><p>“I-is everything okay?” </p><p>The question finally pulled me out of my daze. I looked, only to see Lana at the doorway, even more determined to avoid my gaze than usual. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. She probably followed my crazy laugh, only to find me standing in the middle of her ruined kitchen. It was already remarkable that wasn’t running away. </p><p>“Everything is amazing,” I said, realizing how deep was the giddiness in my voice. </p><p>She paused for a moment, surprised, even making eye contact despite her fleeting shock. “Are you … drunk?” she asked hesitantly. </p><p>I chuckled. “Not unless your instant coffee is laced with something,” I said, which didn’t help her to calm down. I took a deep breath, clamping on my emotions, so I sounded merely happy rather than crazy. “Have you ever had a moment when a difficult problem that you have been trying to solve for months just clicked?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, her voice still non-committal as she pulled her cardigan nervously. </p><p>“That just happened to me about a cultivation skill, but it had been troubling me for years,” I explained, trying to put on my most innocent and friendly smile, but her hesitant expression told me that I wasn’t too successful. </p><p>“Oh. And, um, the counter?” she asked. </p><p>From the hesitancy in her voice, I understood what she was asking. “Don’t worry. You don’t have to walk around carefully around me. It’s not some kind of murder trance,” I said, which was true. In that sense, an epiphany was closer to being drunk. </p><p>“Good,” she muttered, her tenseness fading.  </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll replace the counter myself,” I said. “And, I might even give you a share if you let me sell the remains,” I said. </p><p>“Sell it? It’s a broken cabinet.”   </p><p>“Let’s just say there are certain collectors,” I said. It was a great understatement. I had seen disciples killing each other for pieces of rock that were ten thousand years old but still carried some hint of Sword Intent. While the counter didn’t have a complete mark, it would still earn quite a bit. </p><p>I could probably sell it for its weight in gold, and the buyer would think it was a bargain. Not that it would work. I had yet to see any of those collectors succeeding, but sect-born could be weird about such a thing. </p><p>“If you say so,” she said. My claim that the broken remains of her kitchen would be worth selling didn’t encourage her about my mental stability, but she was too shy to linger on that. “I managed to break through the encryption of the phones,” she said.  </p><p>“Anything substantial,” I asked. </p><p>“That, I don’t know. There’s not a lot. They are not using their phones very much, mostly messages. I was going upstairs to ask Sophie, when…” </p><p>When she heard me laughing like crazy. “Why don’t you go and call her, while I clean the kitchen somewhat,” I said. </p><p>She sighed. “No need, just go take some fresh air while we go through the findings,” she said. </p><p>I nodded, which relaxed her significantly. I walked out, giving her the space to discuss the presence of a man who had just cut through her kitchen cabinet. </p><p>At least I didn’t mention I didn’t even use a blade for it. </p><p>I left readily because Lana wasn’t the only one who needed some time with a familiar face. Sophie needed someone to talk to as well, and considering she risked her life in a literal death trap to prove she didn’t need any heel, I doubted she would open up to me about anything. </p><p>Not that I expected her to open up to Lana immediately, but I wanted to give her some space in case she needed it. </p><p>And, if I was being honest, I needed some time as well. The garden was a good target. The trees needed some trimming, and the flowerbeds wouldn’t say no to some weeding. I decided to start with the trees, but instead of searching for a ladder, I just jumped. </p><p>I could have used my blade to trim the trees easily, but I couldn’t resist the temptation of using my discovery. I dragged my finger near a branch that needed to be removed, and it fell, only the barest of sword essence appearing. </p><p>“Incredible,” I said, unable to keep the fascination in my tone, followed by another giggle. I imagine the faces of my self-appointed rivals if they saw me carefully trimming a tree. I could imagine them trying to cut a mountain to show off instead. </p><p>What I had been using wasn’t Sword Intent, but an ordinary blade of essence, but after managing to touch the border of the Intent, it was both sharper and smoother. </p><p>It felt good using my new ability, but it wasn’t about the importance of the sword intent to the sect. That had been true for all the ancestral techniques I had been taught, and most of the time, I learned them rapidly enough —  hence the annoying number of self-appointed rivals — but none of them brought such satisfaction. </p><p>Once I finished with the trees, I piled the branches in the corner and started pulling the weeds. For that, I didn’t use any of my abilities, even if I could probably finish all the work in a few seconds. Sometimes, it was more fun to do things the slow way. </p><p>I was about to finish with the weeds when the door opened, revealing Sophie. “Stop playing with dirt and come in. We have work to do,” she said, which would have been annoying, but the darkness wasn’t as effective as she might think to hide her blush from my gaze.</p><p>“You’re the captain,” I chuckled and followed her.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as I wanted to tease Dorothy about her decision, I limited myself to kissing her while she slowly sank down my length, her wetness wrapping around me tightly. She was almost as tight as Umi, which was an incredible achievement. </p><p>She grabbed my hair once again, this time even more painfully, trying to convince herself that she was in control — likely subconsciously. I let that slide for the first few moments, ignoring the desire to dominate that rose in me. </p><p>Her grip on my hair wasn’t the only tight thing I was dealing with. She pushed herself down, her tightness getting more and more unbearable as she sank deeper. </p><p>Then, she hit the halfway mark, and I felt a switch flick. </p><p>Normally, I had better self-control, but after all that teasing, I reached my limit. I shifted my grip to her hips. </p><p>And thrust. </p><p>She pulled back from the kiss, letting out a beautiful, deafening moan that made me glad that the room was properly insulated. I stared into her eyes, enjoying her shock even as I began to move faster and faster, no longer passive. </p><p>For all her faults, she was not stupid, and realized any control she might have had until this point was gone — but too trusting to realize that it was an illusion in the first place. However, the shock she might have felt about that was quickly doused by pleasure, leaving her panting and moaning. </p><p>With no desire to ignore my domination instincts anymore, I grab her hair, responding in kind, pulling her down painfully as I skewered her. Her eyes widened in pleasure as she forgot to speak, enjoying the fact that she made no move to push me away … or even slow down, showing that I wasn’t the only one feeling the strain of the extended foreplay. </p><p>I groaned as the gorgeous rich heiress bounced on my lap. I was honest enough about my preferences to know that her status only made it more pleasurable, giving me a sense of domination that I didn’t enjoy for a long while. </p><p>With every push, my shaft disappeared deeper into her.</p><p>I decided to make things fun. I stood up, easily lifting her while still staying inside, each push invading her body repeatedly until nothing but desire was left behind.  </p><p>I wanted to do even more.  </p><p>“So, boss. Are you enjoying the treatment?” I asked even as I climbed to the stage before letting her down. Her legs failed to carry her, and she grabbed the nearest thing. </p><p>The pole. </p><p>I used the opportunity to change the position, and moved behind her, invading her from behind. “We’re putting on an incredible show, right?” I commented casually, enjoying her whimper, which was the perfect mixture of shame and desire. </p><p>She didn’t answer, but I had no problem with taking her silence as an affirmative answer. I grabbed her hips, lifting her until her feet didn’t touch the floor, leaving her to hang on. “W-what are you doing?” she asked, panicking.</p><p>“Making sure you can hold on to the pole just like you had been doing earlier,” I answered. “We can stop if you can’t handle it?” I added, confident that she wouldn’t take me on it. </p><p>She did not. She stayed silent — well, discounting the moans — as I pushed back and forth, enjoying the moment. Filled with my meat, she started moaning even louder in turn, her hands grabbing on the pole hard enough for her knuckles to turn white. </p><p>“Enjoying it, boss?” I asked, enjoying the way she tightened at the question, showing that she was doing her best to forget our power imbalance. Well, she should have thought about that before torturing me the whole night. </p><p>She didn’t answer, but her feverishly enthusiastic cries were enough to make my cock throb inside her, making me enjoy the challenging pose fully. </p><p>I kept her like that for a while, until her arms started to tremble, making it risky. “Let it go,” I ordered as I shifted my grip, and she let it go. </p><p>This time, I didn’t bother moving her far away. Just put her on the ground, her hips raised while her chest was against the floor. I gave up on my primal instincts, pressing her even harder, testing the limits against the rough treatment. </p><p>She didn’t complain, but I decided to stop pushing after that. No matter how much I enjoyed to dominate her, I knew that I couldn’t push to a point that she would blame me tomorrow. The power imbalance was a dangerous concept. </p><p>She yelped as I limited myself to the basic — yet effective — move of fucking her hard and fast, her body clenching around my invasion to show it was the perfect strategy, even if I was doing it on the floor with more savagely than it was necessary. </p><p>It was becoming exceedingly clear that, while she might have had sex before, it was the first proper fucking she was receiving. And, it was my ‘honor’ to give her everything she truly desired. </p><p>I was a nice employee, after all. </p><p>I didn’t pause even for a moment as I pumped her hard, she climaxed … and so did I, unable to resist the temptation to cum inside her despite the risks, not even bothering to mention it. Instead, I asked a question? </p><p>“Do you want me to fuck you even harder, boss,” I asked. </p><p>Her delirious moan was the only answer I needed. </p><p>*** </p><p>Four hours later, we were still fucking, with Dorothy dazed with pleasure. We were not in the strip club anymore, but at a limo, I asked the strip club to rent — which they had a selection already on call. Right now, we were on the tarmac of the private airport, looking at a jet. </p><p>No wonder she was able to change her flight time so casually. </p><p>We were naked on the back seat, with her clothing sprawled around the floor … except her underwear, which was hidden in my pocket as the bounty. </p><p>I wanted a memento — particularly as a reminder if things collapsed like I feared they might.</p><p>Still, it was easy to ignore the risks when I had a busy beauty in front of me, with her legs wrapped around me, begging for more. “Harder, faster…” she moaned repeatedly. </p><p>And, just like any good employee would, I gave it to her, enjoying her hapless cries, not bothering to hold myself back as I enjoyed her slick insides, her folds squeezing me desperately. </p><p>“It must be nice not to be afraid of missing the plane,” I commented even as I reached and twisted her nipple. </p><p>“It’s certainly a perk,” she answered, her tone dazed and exhausted. Understandable, considering we almost never stopped except for the logistical challenges. Yet, even as she answered, her hips continued to move, doing her best to milk me. </p><p>That was a shocking change considering her earlier shyness. It was fascinating just how much change could happen in four hours — a very memorable four hours, but still, barely half a working day. </p><p>I put my hands on her breasts, enjoying the way they filled my palms with some to spare, groping and squeezing, the pleasure enough to steal her all words, except one sentence. </p><p>“Cum in me!” she ordered. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” I said mockingly, not even pausing a second before I exploded inside her, giving her another dose of love. </p><p>The result was spectacular. She moaned in ecstasy once more as she tightened around me, her increasing wetness mixing with desire as I filled her completely, giving her another creampie. </p><p> Bringing the total to four, with two already dried on her tits. She never took the initiative to ask anything, just accepting anything in the heat of the moment, but quite a few things, she asked for seconds, showing it was her hesitation that was keeping her back. </p><p>As she climaxed, she let out another throaty moan and wiggled against the seat, but no matter how much she wanted, she was clearly at the edge. “I think you need to go to your plane, boss,” I said. “You have a shower there, right?” </p><p>“A bath, actually …” she commented, which was tempting for me. I almost asked whether she would be interested in continuing there, but I held that back. </p><p>I had taken far than enough risk. With both of us getting too exhausted to continue having sex, getting locked in a plane meant talking … and I had no intention of pushing that, especially since she was planning to return to her family. </p><p>No, I much prefer not to subject myself to that. I had already pushed my luck enough. </p><p>Instead, I watched silently while she dressed and left … but not before one last kiss, which was surprisingly shy. </p><p>I kept the car in place until her plane left, then pressed a button, signaling the driver to move. </p><p>I barely bothered to put on my pants before I leaned back and took a well-earned nap… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Dorothy froze the moment she ended up on my lap, which was not an absurd reaction considering she was wearing only her sexy red set that covered absolutely nothing. I didn’t push for more, letting her get used to the moment. </p><p>But also, I kept my arms around her waist, keeping her on. I wasn’t holding her tight to prevent her from escaping … just a little suggestion to keep her in place under the circumstances. It contrasted with my earlier decision, of course, but that was only so much teasing I was willing to handle. </p><p>Even from a heiress that was worth several billions. </p><p>Destiny threw a glance toward us, catching my gaze, but I just made a gesture, asking for her to leave and not send any other dancer. </p><p>I had my own stripper. </p><p>Dorothy stayed on my lap even as Destiny gathered her clothes and left, flushing as she tried to process the sudden shift. She wasn’t very good at handling shocks. “T-this wasn’t what I had in mind,” she whispered, still frozen. </p><p>“Oh. My apologies. I thought … of course you wouldn’t be interested in an old man like me,” I said. I wasn’t a particularly good actor when it came to acting pitiful, but poor lighting and the background music helped … and so did her mood. </p><p>“No, no, no!” she corrected in panic, which was a very beautiful panic considering her state of dress and her current location. </p><p>For a moment, I thought about stopping. She was beautiful, but was it worth all the risk. </p><p>But only for one passing moment, before it faded away and was replaced by the memory of her smug smile as she teased me. No, that would not do. “I’m happy to hear that, boss,” I said, deliberately using the title to make it look like she had control. </p><p>Well, technically she had the control, but as I leaned forward, slowly enough to give all the time she needed to move away if she wanted.</p><p>She didn’t make a move, captive of her own desires as I pressed my lips against her neck, squirming as the pleasure hit her. The way she reacted told me everything about her. She wasn’t a virgin, but she clearly wasn’t experienced either considering the amount of surprise her moans displayed. </p><p>“Why don’t you give me a proper lap dance, boss,” I whispered into her ear, my voice soft enough not to be threatening, like the whisper of a devil. She shivered as she turned her head the other way, not brave enough to meet my gaze. </p><p>But brave enough for her hips to start moving. </p><p>Warped priorities were the best. </p><p>Despite all the shame she was supposed to be feeling from the situation, she moved fast, showing that her hips were unaware of that particular fact. </p><p>I let her give me a lap dance, staying focused on the safer spots, only dipping down enough to nibble at her collarbone, or rising high enough for a few kisses to the cheek. I wanted to teach her a lesson, but I couldn’t be heavy-handled, not with everything at stake. </p><p>And, admittedly, listening to her while her helpless whimpers slowly turned into desperate growls was fun. It felt like fishing compared to my usual hunting, serene and patient … but ultimately, just as rewarding. </p><p>The song changed, and Dorothy said nothing. She didn’t ask me to stop, she didn’t question the absence of the dancers, nothing. She just moved back and forth, giving me a surprisingly good lap dance, getting better and better as her confidence started to recover. </p><p>It was halfway through the song when she finally spoke. “I … I always had a crush on you,” she whispered, barely loud enough for me to hear. </p><p>I could have let it slide, but I decided to turn that into a challenge instead. A bait, even, finally starting to reel her in. “What are you going to do about that, boss?” I said, my voice as suggestive as I could manage without sounding aggressive — once again, music helping to cover up my acting. </p><p>I expected that to work … but I didn’t expect to suddenly let out a low growl while she lashed out. I felt her grab my hair hard, desperately taking a firm hold and squeezing hard enough to hurt. I made no sound, not wanting to scare her. Luckily, I only needed to do so for a moment while her breath hitched, her beautiful eyes filling with lust. </p><p>Then, she leaned and captured my lips. </p><p>Her tongue jumped into my mouth, as aggressive as it was inexperienced, showing she wasn’t very used to taking the lead or showing passion. Luckily, the unintended foreplay destroyed whatever barrier that was keeping her from it. </p><p>Her passion was more important than her lack of experience. </p><p>More importantly, following my fishing analogy, the baiting was successful, and the hook was in place. All that was left to reel her in. </p><p>For the first time, my fingers dipped down lower than her waist, cupping her ass. Gentle at first to see her reaction, but quickly picking up speed once I ascertained there was no sudden panic attack coming — her tongue getting even faster was a good sign — I started to squeeze her ass harder and harder. </p><p>She tried to take deep breaths through her nose, her lips still locked to mine like she was afraid of pulling back. I had an inkling that her crush on me had at least a dash of daddy issues mixed in — expecting a billionaire’s family to be functional and loving was absurd — but I didn’t care the slightest. </p><p>Instead, I listened to the way she took her rapid, shallow breaths, low moans constantly hitting my lips … while one of my hands climbed up to escalate the situation. The sexy bra she wore was designed less for support, and more for easy removal. Combined with her distracted state, it took a few seconds to register her toplessness. </p><p>She squawked in shock. “Maybe—” she followed immediately as she pulled back from the kiss, but I didn’t want to bargain, not at this moment. </p><p>It was time to take control properly. </p><p>I leaned down to capture her nipple between my lips, my teeth and tongue doing their best to show the benefits of having an older, experienced lover to destroy her hesitation. With her body already overcharged thanks to her earlier exhibitionist show — compounded by the kiss — that didn’t last long, especially once my hands joined the mix and started exploring her body aggressively. </p><p>Her head bent back as she moaned, for once without obstruction, loud enough to suppress the music. </p><p>Lost in her pleasure, she didn’t realize the real aim when I led her to rise momentarily, more focused on the kisses I had been pressing against her belly, not asking the important questions, like why I was shuffling and shimmying … or why were was my other hand. </p><p>She might have not asked the questions, but she received the answer when she landed on my lap once more. </p><p>My naked lap. </p><p>She immediately tensed, the sudden escalation catching her by surprise. I could have penetrated her right there, but that would run counter to my most important objective. Instead, I caught her lips and pulled her against my chest, kissing her hard enough to steal her breath while she was subjected to the warmth of my lower body without anything annoying in place. </p><p>I let her pull back only minutes later, leaving her gasping for breath. “We … we can’t do this. We’re drunk,” she said, reaching for her strongest excuse … unaware that it had been depleted. </p><p>“Do me a favor and list the alphabet backward,” I said as I let her pull back slightly, but kept my hands on her hips to make sure she stayed immobile. She looked at me blankly, not registering the reason for the question even as she followed it. I followed with two more questions and a tongue twister. </p><p>She cleared all of them perfectly, but toward the end, it clicked. “I … I’m not drunk. How?” </p><p>“Did you think I would allow them to bring actual alcohol into the room when we had a pregnant guest?” I said, with absolutely no problem using Jenny as an excuse rather than explaining my well-intentioned — but ultimately useless, considering she was on my naked lap, wearing nothing but her sexy and sopping panties — attempts to keep her from acting like a whore. </p><p>She froze, her blush turning even thicker as she no doubt processed the night once again, this time without the excuse she had been using. Once the realization hit, she trembled desperately, her beautiful eyes wide open. </p><p>“Yes, boss. You did everything you have done to seduce me without the slightest influence?” I said even as I grabbed her hips, but before pulling her forward, I ripped off her panties, the sexy but thin fabric giving in easily, designed for such purposes. </p><p>Her eyes widened at the sudden aggression, but when she opened her lips, I was already close enough to slip my tongue, our bodies pressing together. Yet, no matter how tempting it was, I didn’t push my hips up to take that last step, once again giving her just enough leeway to leave no excuse. </p><p>Another minute of passionate kissing … and her lips lowered. </p><p>Just like that, she was reeled in completely. </p><p>It was the time for a feast. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Ironically, for all its defenses, finding and sneaking into the hidden base of the corrupted angel had been even easier than I had expected. He was trying to take control of his out-of-control Divine Spark, which allowed me to discover him rather easily through the temporary connection I had triggered. </p><p>His base was hidden much better, but by tracking his location, that was removed. </p><p>And, once that was gone, the other defenses had been even easier to bypass. “Fascinating,” I said even as I walked around. He had no guards, no doubt afraid of betrayal in his vulnerable state, but it left him even more vulnerable.</p><p>It was a treasure trove. There were several rooms filled with familiar-looking crystals, glowing with Divine Spark, along with Eternal Gems, weapons … and most importantly, an incredible amount of books. </p><p>There were many different types of Divine Sparks. Some, I recognized easily, like Necrotic, Forging, Light, and Nature — though Necrotic was definitely the most common one. Others, I never interacted interacted before, but recognizing was easy enough. Arcana, Swordsmanship, Elemental, and many other skills. I didn’t know how exactly Swordsmanship and other melee abilities interacted with Divine Spark, but I didn’t bother exploring that point, and just brought several samples from each of them. </p><p>And turned the rest into Purified Spark — except the elemental ones that felt significantly different. There were only Water ones available. </p><p>[+8,183,190 Purified Spark]</p><p>The Eternals were even richer than I had initially thought if that was the amount someone could steal successfully from their vault. </p><p>No wonder they had been treating Gods as some kind of weapon for their purpose. Even though they were split into pieces and therefore not as valuable, there were still enough Sparks to create multiple gods. It was not a joke. </p><p>Then, I moved to the center room, which was a giant version of the crystal structures that Mariel had used to suppress her own sparks. </p><p>I sneaked forward, and pressed my hand to his head, draining all Divine Spark from him. It killed him directly, not even letting him have a chance to speak, but I didn’t want to risk if he had some kind of trigger that could communicate with his allies. Divine Spark still had too many secrets, and I didn’t want to test myself against a being that had been experimenting on it for centuries.  </p><p>An ignoble end to a dangerous enemy … but that was how assassination worked. All the effort that went to months of acting, fake displays, and baits, all to force my enemy to reveal his hand without making him realize he was being targeted. </p><p>Technically, I could have tried to create a foolproof containment area, but the amount of time I needed to spend to make such a prison foolproof was too long. And, neither Helga nor Oeyne had the ability to contain if he actually escaped or called reinforcement. </p><p> With that, I sealed his unique brand of Darkness and Light mana. I doubted that I would be able to control it, and I certainly didn’t want to any of the girls to use such a dangerous tool, but it could be still weaponized as a devastating bomb. </p><p>“Now, let’s remove the evidence,” I said, and set up several wards filled with Darkness and Light mana, ready to go off the moment someone breached the place. I wanted him to look like he died in the explosion if the Eternals managed to discover his location. </p><p>Once that was done, I teleported back to Silver Spires.</p><p>Or, more accurately, Helga’s domain under Silver Spires. </p><p>She was at the center of the room, carefully analyzing the small, isolated blue fragment at the center of the room. “Any development?” I asked.</p><p>“Nothing much,” Helga answered. She wasn’t surprised by my presence, but only because we were in her domain, and hiding anything from her would take an incredible effort. “I can say that it’s definitely not Divine Spark in any shape or form. It’s not unfair to say that it’s the opposite, even.” </p><p>“In what way?” I asked. </p><p>“In many ways, Divine Spark is a unique, concentrated imprint of soul that somehow overlaps with a mysterious energy that fills the universe, and creates a sense of higher order,” Helga said. I nodded rather than arguing. It was just a theory for the moment, and she had no evidence to support the existence of that mysterious energy. It was not the time to lose ourselves in a pointless battle. </p><p>“What we have here is essentially the reverse of it. It mixed with the Primordial Aether, and turned into a lower-order, chaotic existence.” </p><p>“Elementals,” I said. </p><p>“Very likely linked, but not completely the same. If this new energy is Primordial Aether, Elementals are the equivalent of Aether,” she answered. </p><p>“How about Titania?” I asked. </p><p>“From everything I checked, it looks impossible to just cut the infection from Titania. It infused into her soul for too long, and added that chaotic aspect to it. I have no way to remove it, and you can’t just break it down either.” </p><p>I nodded. After all, I had already tried that with a sample, and it was … explosive. </p><p>“That means we need to study more,” I said as I revealed the books and the other samples I had brought to her, and her smile widened. </p><p>“It’s the best gift ever,” she said as she kissed me quickly before she moved to the books, her expression even more elated than the time I had actually raised her to Divinity. I wanted to bend her over the books to properly celebrate. </p><p>Pity that we were facing an emergency. </p><p>As we read, our frowns got bigger and bigger. “This is the fifth reference I caught to about other universes,” she said with a frown. </p><p>“I noticed several as well,” I said. “And, I’m starting to think that the potential they the text repeatedly mentions is the Primordial Aether more than anything. It looks like we identified how the first gods arrived here … from another universe.” </p><p>“It looks that way,” Helga said, and I didn’t blame her for shivering in fear. We were likely looking at the most honest historical notes, drawn by the personal anecdotes spread across magical notes, and several hand-written conclusions. “Also, there are mentions of a previous rebellion that allowed the gods to cut a dimension from the main one.” </p><p>“Likely ours,” I said. She nodded, agreeing with my conclusion. “Pity there’s very little about the Eternal Rebellion, “I said. “Other than the Eternal’s repeated inability to create a second System, and all the conjecture related to it.” </p><p>“I don’t like the number of notes about trying to find the other universes,” I added. Luckily, they were all mentioned along with failure, but who could know how it would go.  </p><p>“No going to another universe,” Helga immediately said. </p><p>“Oh, I wouldn’t even think about it,” I said, shuddering. Jumping between planes had been enough of an adventure for me. I wouldn’t have even bothered with the Eternals, but by achieving something they failed to achieve, I had already turned myself into a target. Only by Strength, I could protect myself against them. </p><p>Of course, that also raised some questions about where my first System came from, but I didn’t have the time to explore it. </p><p>Instead, I continued reading, slowly creating a more reliable account of the history of our universe. The first gods came from another universe. Though, at least, when they arrived, they seemed to barely step into the Chosen stage — or at least, their equivalent of it — and reached the Divinity stage here. </p><p>It was good, as the idea of older, stronger Universes was scary enough. The idea of it was strong enough that even actual gods abandoning it just for a chance to improve would have been too much.  </p><p>There were some references to actually establishing the material plane, but very little about how that feat had been achieved. </p><p>Then, at one point, the Eternals established the System, based on the information from a traitor … but once again, no real detail about her identity, just enough to confirm that she was a woman. </p><p>“At least it confirms my theory,” Helga said, though her tone was listless. “There are quite a bit notes about theories about another energy they can’t detect, and how it makes Divine Spark gather far faster. They claim that it’s some kind of energy based on the creation stages of the universe.” </p><p>“Creation, and destruction,” I corrected her as I confirmed through the other notes. “It doesn’t exactly fill me with great confidence about what would happen if they discover us.”  </p><p>“True, it doesn’t,” Helga said, but once we finished reading, there was no immediate answer. There had been a lot of books, but the information they had was limited, and not entirely trustworthy. </p><p>“You should continue reading,”  I said. “It looks like I’m going to visit the Eternal City.” </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 124</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 9.330,787}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“What are you doing!” the yet-to-be-named angel shouted. The moment he did, I could see some kind of black corruption spreading through his wings. </p><p>“Destroying an abomination,” I shouted back, doing my best to lean on the worst aspects of a Light Spark. Direct to the point of recklessness, confident to the point of zealousness. After all, my current identity had already achieved its greatest mission, and it was time for it to die. </p><p>“So be it,” he shouted, the dark corruption spreading even more. </p><p>This time, I was too familiar with the Divine Sparks to miss their conflicting nature. His conflict was between Darkness and Light, similar to Mariel’s challenge. Well, somewhat. His Light Spark felt similar, but the Darkness spark he used felt different. </p><p>The one that the princess used was calm, and soft, like a shadow. His Darkness spark was bright, angry, and changed. I could sense that it was somewhat forced to shift its nature. My guess was that he did so to counter his Spark. </p><p>His rain of attacks, a mixture of dark and light, came even stronger than I expected, making me glad that he was barely a demigod. I would have hated him to fight if he completed it. </p><p>While Mariel’s unique brand of Spark, which I termed Twilight Spark, had brought some unique advantages, its destructive capabilities came mostly from its Light aspect. </p><p>It wasn’t true for my enemy. His brand of Darkness Spark was almost a weird reflection of Light Spark, with a sense of destructive capability to match it. They weren’t blended, but balanced, even the slightest touch enough to send the balance careening. </p><p>A dangerous path. I didn’t want to imagine just how much of a nightmare to fight against him if he was an actual god. With the combination, he would have a good chance of winning against the other gods even as a mere avatar. His concept of destruction was just that good. </p><p>Luckily, in his demigod state, he was far more busy trying not to kill himself, making him a much more easy enemy. If I didn’t need him to find the base of the Eternals, I would have killed him easily. Instead, I defended his attacks in the worst way possible, and took his attack with my walking castle. </p><p>And channeled the resulting explosion to kill half of his men, and used the opportunity to mark several with some very obscure beacons that would start signaling a while later, somewhat similar to the working principles of the beacons we designed for Primordial Aether. </p><p>I didn’t expect that to lead me to the real base. The soldiers would probably be transferred to a sub-base, but my bet was that it would go unnoticed, especially since, for all intents and purposes, they were on a secret mission, and would be trying to cover it up. </p><p>Of course, that wasn’t my only trick. Oeyne clone was another. I had been hoping that, once I ‘died’ her value as bait would be gone, and they would imprison her again, ideally in the same base they held Titania. </p><p>“Is this all you can do, ugly abomination,” I shouted. In response, I received a primal shout that surprised me with its intensity. He didn’t seem to appreciate an insult to his physical features. His response was an even bigger wave of bolts, each hit destroying bigger chunks of my castle. </p><p>He was playing right into my hand. </p><p>While I already had two baits, one that led to a potential barracks, and one to a prison, I still needed a third one. One that would lead to his secret sanctum … which definitely existed. Keeping the two different Divine Sparks was a very dangerous process, the kind that any disruption would be deadly. Combined with its relatively hidden nature, I had no doubt that he had a nice base that no one else knew just for balance. </p><p>I just needed to give him a reason to use it. </p><p>As he attacked once again, the castle had already turned into a rubble. I triggered an explosion, using the opportunity to fake my death … but not before sending a blade of concentrated light, far too fast and intense for him to react. </p><p>And severing his wing. </p><p>His cry of pain was a balm to my soul. His reaction was intense … which was understandable. I had been with Mariel enough to know that their wings were bound to their existence even tighter than the rest of their bodies. Cutting off his arm would have been less painful. </p><p>As he collapsed, trying to contain the sudden disorder of Darkness and Light in his body, I wrapped myself with a Darkness cloak and moved forward … and forced a link with the Spark remnants in his wing. </p><p>One that would allow me to follow him to his base. </p><p>Then, I retreated before someone could notice my presence. My reckless last stand had come to an end, and another infiltration mission was about to begin. </p><p>Only after I moved a distance away from the battlefield, I teleported back to the capital. Or, more accurately, right under the capital, next to Oeyne. </p><p>“Is it done?” she asked as she hugged me, clearly worried. I didn’t blame her, considering my last encounter with that angel. I ended up lost in Primordial Aether. </p><p>“Almost. Currently, they are kidnapping your double. Others had already teleported away. I could sense their location…” I added, then paused. “In the sky.” </p><p>“On a mountain or something?” she asked. </p><p>“No, right at the sky,” I said with a frown. “And, their locations are too far apart. Either they have several flying locations that are moving in perfect harmony…” I murmured. </p><p>“Or their base is far bigger than we expected,” she added. </p><p>“Maybe. But if it’s true, it’s big. Several times the capital big.” I paused, feeling the location of Oeyne's clone … which was definitely not in the sky. “At least they’re secret prisons in a different location,” I said, then felt the location of the angel I had just maimed. “And so is the secret chamber of that angel.” </p><p>“What’s the sequence,” she said. </p><p>“Three steps,” I said, but I didn’t have much time. The beacons I left wouldn’t last long, as I deliberately made them underpowered. And, the city’s location feels weird, like it’s occasionally shifting in location. </p><p>“Probably a defensive method,” Oeyne suggested. That was probably the case. They might have nothing to fear from people of the material plane — well, except me, but they didn’t know that — but the same thing didn’t apply to their divine enemies. </p><p>Even assuming they had no enemies — which was an absurd assumption — most gods would be to weaken their bargaining position. I had no doubt that their base had been defended very aggressively. </p><p>“I need to go,” I said as I kissed Oeyne, and she nodded. </p><p>First, the prison. Hopefully, Titania would be there. </p><p>I didn’t teleport the location directly, but instead targeted a location that would take several minutes to travel even if I flew on a fake elemental. And, without it, the travel took even longer, but I didn’t want to trigger any alarm in the process. </p><p>Not when my favorite librarian’s life was at stake. </p><p>It turned out to be a good choice, as I had to bypass several detection wards in the process, each supported by an artifact. Though, as long as I approached them carefully, they were easy to bypass. Their need for secrecy prevented them from building an impenetrable prison. </p><p>Instead, they decided to bury the prison deep, relying on magic to conceal themselves from the beasts, and limiting the number of guards to avoid betrayal. A smart choice. </p><p>Too bad that it left them particularly vulnerable toward my skill set. I didn’t even bother engaging with the guards, using another cloak of darkness to bypass the wards. Soon, I was at the center of the prison, where Oeyne’s clone was, trapped in a complicated array. </p><p>And, next to her, there was Titania. </p><p>The moment I had seen her, I had decided to murder that corrupted angel painfully, because the scene in front of me was worse than I expected. Titania was locked in an array, her body glowing with Light Spark. </p><p>But not just that. Her Light Spark was Tainted. At first, I assumed it to be another divine spark, Spark of Water, but it was not. </p><p>The Divine Spark, regardless of nature, gave a similar feeling to a soul. Concentrated and directed, but still somehow human. </p><p>Whatever tainted her felt more like Primordial Aether, but a wild version. But, whatever it was, it was strong, enough to devour and destroy her spark despite being much smaller. </p><p>I frowned. I wanted to destroy the prison for daring to do such a thing. I didn’t know the thing that tainted her soul, but I could see that, without my unique set of skills, it would have been deadly. And, even with my unique skills, it wasn’t a trivial situation. </p><p>I suppressed the desire to destroy the prison as I searched the place, hoping to find something that would give me an idea about her situation. But, there was no information. </p><p>I took Titania away to another base I created for her, leaving a clone behind to warn me when someone started to experiment on them. Meanwhile, I needed to do some experiments. </p><p>But, before, I needed to deal with a corrupted angel.  </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 124</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Erin was panting as she had just run a half-marathon as she retreated back to the showers, unable to believe the risk she had just taken by peeking at a potential investor. If caught, her whole plan of finding an external investor would have been ruined. </p><p>Especially since there was no arguing about what she was doing there with her top pulled down while she fingered herself. </p><p>She needed to get laid, if this was her reaction to seeing something even remotely sexy — well, very sexy. “Let’s get rid of this first,” she murmured even as she got rid of her exercise clothes, leaving her body free to be played. She wanted to get laid, but that was for the future. For now, she needed to handle that problem herself. </p><p>“Now, let’s start,” she said, speaking to herself as she positioned herself in front of the mirror, enjoying the benefits of her facilities now that she had only one customer, who was busy with her task. </p><p> “Yes, let’s start,” a voice different than hers answered, making her freeze in shock even before she caught the reflection of her visitor. Darion. </p><p>“W-what are you doing here,” she gasped. “And, why are you not wearing any pants. Go use the other bathroom.” </p><p>“Nonsense. I’m here, because you invited me here,” he said. </p><p>“I did not!” she said. </p><p>“Really. So you were just peeking at us,” he said, making an affronted gasp. </p><p>It was clearly fake, but she didn’t care about that when confronted by an important piece of information. She had been caught. “I don’t know what—“ she started. </p><p>“Well, I can always ask Fatima to see if she saw you,” he said, his smirk wide. </p><p>“C-come on. I'm sure that’s not necessary&lt;” she begged. </p><p>“As long as you admit that you have been peeking at us. I don’t like to be treated as a liar,” he said, his smirk making it a mocking delivery.  </p><p>“Well, if you insist,” she whispered. “I have been peeking at you. Sorry for lying about it.” </p><p>“Good, was that so hard,” he said. “Now, you can go and enjoy your shower while I go and attend my lover,” he said. </p><p>Erin froze at the declaration. Once he had entered the room, she felt she was sure how things would have ended. He would threaten to tell Fatima about her peeking, she would beg him not to tell, he would offer it for a price … which she would reluctantly pay. </p><p>The fact that he looked ready to leave didn’t fit with that story, and while Erin wanted to send him away, what he was displaying was too attractive to act prideful.</p><p>God, it had been too long since she got laid. </p><p>“Well, I still deserve a punishment for intruding on the privacy of my customer,” she said, frowning. “You know what. How about I give you a show just like you had given to me, and we call it even,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, really,” he said with a chuckle. </p><p>Erin didn’t appreciate the chuckle. It felt like he was calling her a liar — which would be true, but she didn’t appreciate it nonetheless. Instead, she took a step forward, doing her best to display her body in the best way possible. </p><p>“Oh, someone dropped a soap,” she said, which was a lie as the floor was pristine. More importantly, even if there was, there was no reason for her to bend forward to grab it. Far more direct than she would have liked … but she was too aroused to act subtly. </p><p>She hoped that, in his passion, she would bait him successfully. After all, she loved her ass. It was her best feature, one part of her that was sculpted to perfection by her professional career. </p><p>Then, she smirked as she heard the footsteps getting closer, strong, confident, yet hurrying. </p><p>Success. </p><p>“I see that you want to get a better view—“ she started, only to gasp in shock when she heard another set of footsteps, ones that sounded fat more gentler. So much that, she didn’t even make a comment about impatience when he pushed her into the shower by grabbing her ass, and pressing her against the wall. </p><p>She bit her lips. Feeling his naked body — where it mattered — tempted her, but she pulled back to stand in front of him, hoping to cover him somewhat. </p><p>“Hey Erin, have you seen Darion,” Fatima asked as she entered. Thankfully, the wall blocked her view, and Erin pulled the curtain to hide her body. “Oh, it’s not like you to pull the curtains. Are you feeling shy?” </p><p>Erin opened her mouth, about to give a rebuttal. She didn’t like being teased by a woman as shy as Fatima … but the fact that her boyfriend was behind her, busy pressing his cock against her ass made it difficult. </p><p>“Well, I decided to listen to your complaints,” she answered instead. </p><p>“It sounds like admitting defeat,” Fatima teased her, which felt uncharacteristic, but Erin assumed it was the euphoria of being fucked hard. </p><p>“W-well, maybe,” Erin answered. It wasn’t her preferred answer, but when Darion suddenly started playing with her tits, she found it difficult to argue properly. Instead, she bit her lips, trying to hold back her moans as Darion squeezed her breasts, trying to control her voice. </p><p>A struggle she failed, and a gasp escaped her mouth. </p><p>“Something wrong?” she asked. </p><p>“No, not at all,” Erin answered panickedly. “I just hit my toe.” </p><p>“You need to be more careful. You don’t want to injure yourself.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Erin said, suddenly feeling annoyed at her superior tone, like Fatima wasn’t the scared little woman that was scandalized by everything. Just a little cock — well, not that little — and suddenly, she was missing chatty. </p><p>Erin was annoyed enough that when Darion grabbed her waist and lifted her, she said nothing, just obeyed. “You’re supposed to be a professional, show me your flexibility,” he whispered. A little loud, Erin thought, but since Fatima didn’t start shouting about her being a whore, Erin assumed it went unnoticed.</p><p>Which made her feel far more aroused. </p><p>Darion easily lifted her, licking her pussy while she took his cock from the reverse. It wasn’t like Fatima would interrupt, right—</p><p>“Wow, flexible indeed,” Fatima said just as she pulled the curtain open. </p><p>Erin froze, realizing that she might have misread the situation terribly.</p><p>But it was too late.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Fatima was finding it very difficult to control herself as Darion’s fingers danced over her core, driving her even crazier as he continued to kiss her neck. The contrast was maddening. </p><p>“W-we need to stop,” she managed to whisper, a desperate plea. “Y-you win, she’s watching.” </p><p>“What a naughty whore, right, masturbating while watching her client,” Darion commented, his hand still in place like he didn’t hear her. </p><p>Darion ignored her begging, which didn’t surprise Fatima in the slightest. He was a man in control, and in her mind, Fatima could admit that she loved it. Still, that didn’t reduce the shame of being watched. “Please,” she begged with a whisper, afraid that Erin would hear and realize she had been caught. </p><p>It would be even worse that way. </p><p>“Come on, beautiful. I thought you came here to party. This is not a proper partying attitude,” he said. She found herself trembling as she listened to his words, losing herself in pleasure. “Don’t tell me that you’re afraid of showing your beautiful body.” </p><p>She was, but as Darion pulled down his shorts, she found it difficult to utter those particular words. Instead, she opened her mouth wide, allowing him in her mouth despite the difficult pose. </p><p>At least, it gave her an excuse to finally peek toward the corner for longer than a second, enough to catch not only Erin’s half-naked state, but also expression. She was glad that her mouth was occupied, because she didn’t want to admit just how much seeing Erin’s expression of arousal satisfied her. </p><p>Maybe Darion was right. She came here to have fun. A little voyeur, especially one who needed to keep her mouth closed to maintain the reputation of her very expensive gym, was just what she needed. </p><p>“Your mouth is amazing,” Darion growled as she moaned, leaving her to tremble desperately. As he invaded her throat, it was difficult to maintain her position, but she managed. </p><p>For a while. </p><p>Then, she collapsed. </p><p> “Ops, you failed,” he said. Someone who didn’t know him might have thought that to be an innocent comment, but Fatima realized what was coming. Punishment … the kind that she enjoyed immensely. </p><p>“I-isn’t it a bit too much here,” she managed to whisper, but as Darion flipped her, she had her answer. She thought about arguing more, but a threatening growl stopped her. </p><p>“We can turn the other way if you want,” he whispered, and Fatima immediately fell silent. She didn’t want to show her face … she was afraid of the expressions she would be making. “Excellent,” he said as he pushed in.</p><p>Her expression turned like she had just received a huge hit of drugs, pleasure, and pain filling her in equal measures as his immense presence parted her. It was a beautiful punishment, earning passionate gasps from her as Darion fucked her hard enough to drill her to the ground. </p><p>Still, she realized a benefit to her hapless moans. Erin clearly thought that her voice was properly suppressed by hers, and stopped keeping herself back. Fatima heard enough to know that she was playing with herself. </p><p>“Enough,” Darion said a moment later, and for all supposed problems, she panicked. They couldn’t stop … not until she climaxed. “It’s not fair for her to not see your beautiful body,” he whispered as he grabbed her arms. </p><p>And she found herself pulled up, each push making her tits dance wildly. She knew she was supposed to keep her voice down, but as he pushed himself fully inside, there was no hope of that. He pushed repeatedly, and she lost control completely. </p><p>Though, she was not the only one. A glance she threw to the side showed that Erin was not any better, losing herself in the pleasure … going as far as to keep her eyes closed, completely unafraid of the risk of being caught. </p><p>Not that Fatima could blame her. </p><p>Darion changed the position once more, and this time, she found herself locked between the hard wall, and his even harder body. “Well, we must be putting on a good show. Our audience is going crazy,” he whispered. </p><p>“T-true,” Fatima whispered, all she could say. Their audience wasn’t the only one that was going crazy. </p><p>She abandoned herself to the pleasure, the orgasm hitting hard. Luckily, in her position, there was no risk of collapsing. She was safe. </p><p>Erin started trembling a while later, and Fatima watched her as she walked away without even bothering to fix her clothes. “Our audience left,” Darion whispered even as he lifted her, forcing her into a position that left absolutely nothing hidden. Fatima trembled again, this time in fear. If she decided to take another glimpse, there would be no hiding the fact that Erin was already caught. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she moaned. </p><p>“So, how about allowing her some backstage access…” he whispered. </p><p>Fatima wanted to say it was too much, but when she opened her mouth, another answer left it. “As you wish, sir…”</p>",

    "content": "<p>I immediately went down to the basement, not even talking with Tara to make sure I could catch whatever cargo they were moving. </p><p>While I had a camera there, it was not exactly a top-of-the-line device, making it hard for it to catch things. And, my superpower was related to observation, allowing men to measure things better. </p><p>I had been hoping to pick something more than a momentary glimpse. </p><p>My hurry was only enhanced by the view I had seen before I had arrived at the bar. Two groups of armed guards passed through the tunnel, carrying automatic weapons while they checked to make sure everything was in order. </p><p>Luckily, while they were careful, their attention was more focused on making sure there was no one in the tunnel than discovering a spy camera … their care suggested that the Syndicate wasn’t the one using the tunnels. </p><p>A good point to remember. </p><p>When I arrived at the tunnel, I carefully dug the thin earth layer, allowing me to both watch and listen to what was going on, ready to retreat in case of an emergency. But, my presence went unnoticed as I watched carefully, watching as another group passed.</p><p>Eight people, pushing some kind of hand cart filled with boxes, the kind that could be found in an airport, but two details were particularly important for me. First, two of the eight people that had been escorting the cart had been wearing costumes, marking them as supers — and their confidence as they walked confirmed that they were not fakes. </p><p>Second, the boxes they had been pushing had a mark that had been scratched out. It had been cleaned well enough that I wasn’t able to catch up with my Observation without overcharging it. I overcharged it, curious exactly what I would find. </p><p>A stylized drawing of a large man. </p><p>The logo of the New Giant force. </p><p>Frozen by the realization, I stayed still until the force moved away, not wanting to risk alerting them.  </p><p>I had no idea exactly what those boxes contained, but it was not good news. On the surface, the warehouse had looked like an ordinary drug-dealing operation, but what I had seen reversed it. For such an operation, even assigning a super to constant protection was excessive. </p><p>Two supers, just to escort a shipment…</p><p>I waited a while more before I sealed the crack I used to observe, making sure to adjust the camera to make it even more unnoticeable. Whatever that was going on, it was far above my capabilities. The best thing I could do was stay away from the tunnel. I couldn’t afford to anger them. I was tempted to remove the camera, but ultimately, I decided to leave it there. </p><p>Knowing what was going on was worth the risk. </p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but sigh once I climbed the stairs, checking my phone to see another notification from Emily, sharing another picture from the locker room. It was a beautiful picture … but one of the bigger reasons I had dared to show my presence around the biggest Guild in town was to give Elite Syndicate a fake reason for my presence. </p><p>Now that it looked like their operation was linked to the Guild, that plan was out. However, I didn’t even consider ignoring Emily, typing a quick message. The rational excuse for my decision was Emily’s power. Technically, if I actually retreated, she might have used her powers to take revenge. </p><p>But the real reason was different. I simply didn’t want to do it. Why should I stop recruiting a super sexy super with a power that fits with mine just to keep Syndicate happy? I might have found it an acceptable trade-off if it guaranteed a lack of conflict for eternity — though hated it — but it wasn’t the case. </p><p>Thinking about it, it was even the opposite. Her power helped me to gather actual information about the targets, far faster than I could achieve on my own. </p><p>Even without her access to the Guild — which she had as a receptionist, and enhanced by using her powers — she was a valuable contact. With it, she could actually help me discover exactly what the Syndicate was stealing from the Guild. </p><p>Or, at least I hoped that they were stealing it. At least, that way, all the cloak-and-dagger activities around the operation would make sense. The situation would have been even worse if they were actually buying something. </p><p>It would put the intense security around the boxes to a whole new level. </p><p>I sighed even as I typed a lengthy compliment for Emily, followed by a heated, erotic text. My initial plan was to slowly seduce Emily over a few weeks while cluing her about the fact that I wasn’t just a bartender. </p><p>I decided to shorten the timeline intensely. First, I started answering her text with far more passion, and even responded to a few excellent poses of my own, pushing her hot and bothered during work. And, she had shared enough photos to show just how hot she was. I was trying to bring her into the correct mode for recruitment, but that didn’t mean the show was not enjoyable. </p><p>Some photos were relatively mild, just fully clothed on her desk, showing her face, though some of them had a few buttons open momentarily. </p><p>In some other photos, she was actually naked once more, shared from the archive rooms and other places, though those didn’t show her body fully, the angles chosen carefully to hide her body. Only because I could read her sexy expression I knew that she was fully naked rather than just shirtless. </p><p>Scandalous, especially when considering the location. I suspected the only reason she dared was her control over the digital security system, giving her confidence that she wouldn’t get caught. </p><p>Fascinating. And, the more she escalated, the more I encouraged her, her arousal working like addiction. Of course, under any other circumstances, pushing her to indulge her feelings would have backfired,, even if she was the one that was taking the lead. All she needed was to have a few hours of calm, maybe a nice sleep, to realize just how extreme her behavior would have gotten and pull back. </p><p>Too bad I had a much bigger surprise for her. And, just as she left the work, I had already left the bar, once again disguised. Just as she started dropping hints about a date, I reversed direction. </p><p>‘Oh my god. I have a big problem, and I need your help,’ I wrote. ‘We need to meet.’</p><p>That naturally was enough to trigger her panic even if it wasn’t for the intense crush she was developing. ‘Where are you,’ she said, I answered, which was when she realized I was near her. ‘Lucky. I’m near, let’s meet here,’ she said, followed by the location of a nearby coffee shop. </p><p>I was nearer than her, so I picked a concealed spot. </p><p>“What happened?” she asked as she tried to sit across me, but I just hugged her, tight enough to show my desperation. She froze at first, but then tightened her arms around me. I wasn’t a bad actor, and reading her reaction in real-time only made it better. </p><p>The fact that my acting was mostly the truth made it much easier. Ultimately, what had been happening to me was dangerous enough to scare me, and I was just misleading her about the immediacy of the issue. </p><p>“I … I’m in trouble,” I said. “And, you’re the only person I can talk—” I started, before freezing. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t bother you with it. I have just panicked,” I started, making a move to stand up. Only for her to push me back down. </p><p>“No, I’m not going to let you go before you leave,” she said. </p><p>I sighed in defeat, and stayed passively for a while, enjoying her hug before I started speaking. “You remember the bar I had been working for,” I said, and she nodded. “Today, I needed to fake being a villain just to save the life of a coworker,” I said. </p><p>Her scared gasp was beautiful. “No. Maybe—” she started. </p><p>“Please, let me finish. Apparently, she had been hiding her power. I was able to bluff them and act like I had some kind of superpower that could pull information out of the air, but it was just a mere guess,” I said … a subtle trick, one that both refused the existence of my power and undersell it in the case she discovered it. </p><p>After all, the existence of the power could be tested through the blood, but not the effectiveness, and I wouldn’t be the first one to miss the existence of a significant power. </p><p>“Then, what?” she asked. </p><p>“I managed to convince them that I’m working for a bigger villain, which will keep them away for a while, but then, I don’t know what to do. I need to somehow keep them believing that I can pull information out of the air, or they will realize that I’m not a villain. Worse, they might think that I’m a spy for the guild just because of you…” I said, giving a believable yet distorted version of the truth, while also prematurely removing her from offering the Guild’s help. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The next day passed in a relative monotony. I had gone for another ride with my bike in the morning, making another show of my presence, occasionally interrupted by a lot of new photos from Emily. Some were from her desk, showing her beautiful face, while the others were from the bathroom, focusing on more interesting parts of her anatomy — unfortunately, her clothes stayed in place. </p><p>However, the interesting thing was that she was able to take photos. I wondered whether the Guild didn’t prevent people from taking photos in their employee-only areas … or Emily was bypassing it somewhat.  </p><p>An indirect question received a deflection, confirming that it was the latter. </p><p>How naughty. Not that I was complaining about that. </p><p>Her ability to take photos brought me back to that mysterious message from the puzzle I had received, tempting me to poke around. Not directly, but using the traffic as an excuse and passing near the junkyard that supposedly held the stash was easier. </p><p>I didn’t go inside, but I was just there to make sure to check there was any security like I feared. </p><p>It turned out that staying away from the correct choice, as by overcharging my power, I noticed three distinct high-tech cameras and four security guards that looked far too professional to be working at a junkyard. </p><p>It was definitely a trap. </p><p>Luckily, the holding cell that was supposed to exist was under the guild, and thanks to Emily’s new naughty habit, I had a chance to scout the area indirectly with my power, to at least understand if such a prison actually existed, and holding someone important. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t exactly being driven by a sudden sense of altruism. The supposed prisoner was helpful from two perspectives. If she existed, once I saved her, she would be still vulnerable enough to need allies … and I wasn’t in a position to turn my nose on an ally that was dangerous — or useful — enough to be illegally imprisoned by the New Giant Force. </p><p>The other benefit was even more direct. Even if I didn’t ultimately go through with it, the mission of saving a prisoner from the premier guild gave me an excuse that I desperately needed; high-impact enough to justify the involvement of my non-existent boss, and distant enough from the other villain operations to keep them away. </p><p>Naturally, it had significant disadvantages as well, the biggest being making an enemy out of the Guild, but I was still glad to have that as an option. </p><p>Just in case. </p><p>With that done, I returned to the bar and parked my bike in the front, but not before stopping by a store to order some construction material, like better floor tiles, some new wallpaper, and other construction items. </p><p>I hadn’t been planning to make any visible changes in my place, but having an excuse for the tunnel construction might have been useful. I asked for their delivery to the street, and I returned to the bar. </p><p>Then, once I left several strict instructions to Tara — and a quickie against the wall — I left the bar through the secret tunnel we had just built, once again disguised as a delivery person. </p><p>However, this time, my only stop wasn’t the bakery. I also stopped by a sexy lingerie shop, and purchased a beautiful white corset, complete with panties and a garter belt. It cost me three hundred dollars, which was nothing. I would have happily spent ten times for a gift and not blinked… but it would be too suspicious, particularly since, from her perspective, I was still a struggling young man with two jobs. </p><p>Admittedly, this was very much who I had been my whole life with the notable exception of the last few days, so it wasn’t exactly a difficult role. </p><p>Making my gift appropriate. </p><p>I also added a new lengthy note about how I couldn’t wait to see her in them, and then, after some thought, I also slipped the promised fifty dollars into the box as well. Ordinarily, mixing an intimate gift and payment for professional services would have been a terrible idea, creating a dangerous blurring.  </p><p>Considering my objective, it wasn’t as terrible. </p><p>“Delivery from a thankful citizen,” I said as I arrived at the headquarters, standing in front of Emily, who was suddenly blushing furiously as she looked at me, as if it just clicked with her that she was texting with a real person. </p><p>Looking at her, it was hard to believe it was the same girl who had been taking pictures wearing nothing. </p><p>The difference was shocking at first, but it soon clicked. It was her power. Her ability to interface with the tech allowed her to feel more secure than she did in real life. </p><p>An interesting detail. </p><p>“T-thank you,” she whispered, her blush thick. </p><p>“Don’t thank me yet,” I added as I slid the box toward her. “And, this is the gift from another appreciative citizen, to a particular member,” I said as I slid the box forward, which had her name on the box. </p><p>Curious, she opened it, only to slam it back, her face beet red. “W-what’s this, Jason,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, one of your pictures showed you didn’t have any leisure underwear to wear at home, so I decided to gift you one,” I explained, like there was nothing more ordinary. </p><p>She said nothing, just looked at me with a growing blush. It wasn’t much compared to all the pictures she shared, but standing in front of me, she seemed to forget just how compromising she had been on the pictures. </p><p>I ignored the temptation to tease her even more, and just left after a wink. </p><p>‘You are evil!’ she wrote five minutes after I left, making me chuckle. </p><p>‘Well, does it mean I’m not going to receive any pictures of you wearing that beautiful corset,’ I replied, feeling like I had a good enough handle on her personality to guess how she would react. If I said that directly, she might have fainted, but in a message, it just received a few angry emojis as a response. </p><p>A few back and forth, and she finally assented. ‘Maybe… If I’m still feeling well once I return home…’ she finally admitted. </p><p>‘How about if we don’t take the risk?’ I responded. </p><p>‘What do you mean?’</p><p>“Well, you have already shared a beautiful photo from the dressing room. Why not one more? It’ll be empty.’</p><p>‘We’re not supposed to be taking photos there,’ she admitted. </p><p>I smirked as I read her panicked reply, reluctantly admitting that she had already violated the rules. For someone with a stricter personality, it would be it, but I just sent a few more messages, which was enough to break her — rather reluctant and lackluster — resistance. Moreover, I could see that she was clearly not the best decision maker under pressure, not even the subtle one I created. </p><p>‘You are evil!’ she wrote again, but it hadn’t been particularly discouraging, considering it followed by a picture of her leg, showing that she had already put on the thigh-high stocking, the white looking particularly good with contrast to her beauty. </p><p>As much as I enjoyed the view, I also took note of where she was. It wasn’t the same dressing room she had used earlier. </p><p>It was far more luxurious and expensive looking … and I could see several superhero outfits hanging around. </p><p>She had sneaked into the locker room of the female heroes. </p><p>Even naughtier than I expected, I thought with a smirk. It wasn’t something serious, but I had a feeling that, she wouldn’t have dared to do so just the day before. </p><p>A fascinating speed of corruption, I admitted, but currently, I did nothing more than take a mental note. The next photo that followed. A mirror selfie, showing everything. The underwear was a perfect fit, which was another benefit of my observation power. </p><p>However, rather than patting myself on the back, I focused on enjoying the way she looked when clad in the corset. It wasn’t exactly something I would call revealing … her shirt selfie was certainly more revealing both in terms of the area it covered, and in terms of the pose. She was far more comfortable with her sexiness back home. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean she looked bad. On the contrary, she looked amazing in the corset and garter belt combo, both innocent white, and her hesitancy only highlighted her innocence more. </p><p>She was just like a cute white rabbit, hesitant to go for a walk … and I was the cunning and villainous fox waiting for the opportunity to catch her. </p><p>I was planning to spend the rest of my day, slowly encouraging her for more, when I received a warning from my other phone, showing that one of the cameras I left caught a movement. </p><p>A quick check showed that it was the old sewer we discovered while we had been digging ours. </p><p>I quickly made my way back to the bar. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but feel amused as Sophie pulled me to the bed violently. It was a rare experience for me, as I preferred to be in control … but considering her most recent ordeal, I was willing to make an exception. </p><p>“You will never speak of it, and there will be no repeat,” she ordered even as I landed on the bed, she was on top of me, not letting me answer before she started kissing. Which was good, as I had no intention of accepting it. </p><p>Not speaking of it was easy, but as I watched her bathrobe part completely to reveal what lay underneath, I disagreed with the idea of no repeats. But it was a discussion for the future. </p><p>I enjoyed her lips while she shuffled on my lap, humping me wildly. The kiss was sharp, intense, and needy, tinged with a desperate need to control. I yielded to her pace, enjoying her kiss, and feeling her aura flare even more. </p><p>She pulled back a minute later, but not for a moment, I thought that she wanted to stop, not after seeing her expression. Or her first act that followed, getting rid of her bathrobe, leaving her completely naked. I took a moment to enjoy her beautiful body. Lithe, yet muscular enough to show that she was a regular at the gym. Her breasts weren’t big enough to fill my palms, but they were beautiful enough to be amazing. </p><p>Her skin was flawless, the benefits of her most recent healing, and her blonde hair danced on her shoulders freely, still messy after her shower. </p><p>As I examined her beauty, I noticed a hint of shyness entering her face. She opened her mouth, to ask a question, but she squashed that instinct just as quickly. “You’re overdressed,” she growled instead, her sharp tone overcompensating for her earlier shyness. </p><p>She was a beautiful mixture of hard and soft. A real masterpiece. </p><p>I heard my t-shirt rip even as she pulled it desperately, her eyes locking on my naked torso. “Not bad, very chiseled,” she said, doing her best to sound sarcastic, but the desperate way she caressed the lines of my chest showed her true feelings. </p><p>“Benefits of endless training,” I said even as I watched her slide down, temporarily vacating my lap as she untied my belt, her fingers desperate as she pulled them down as well. A moment later, I matched her in the amount I wore, my presence long reached its peak. </p><p>“You’re a handyman to keep around,” she whispered as she approached once again, positioning herself between my legs, her tongue already darting out. My eyes widened. I couldn’t help it. It was not exactly something my occasional lady friends from the sect liked to do, finding it undignified. </p><p>Sophie’s face showed that it was certainly not a favor to me but for her pleasure. Her attention was focused on my shaft as she gave a long lick from the side, filling me with anticipation. Right at that moment, I felt like I was on a vacation once more, impatient for pleasure. </p><p>Luckily, Sophie was just as impatient, her lips parting open immediately to devour my length, her back arching desperately as she devoured half of my length, her beautiful green eyes still open, catching mine. </p><p>She was breathtaking. </p><p>For a moment, she paused, showing a hint of insecurity infusing her gaze as she searched my expression. Whatever it was, it was enough to make her aura shiver with indecision, showing it was important. Luckily, whatever she had been searching for, she found it, because that insecurity was gone a moment later, and she sank even deeper, devouring more of my length, still keeping eye contact. </p><p>I kept our gaze connected, enjoying her expressions as much as the way her throat wrapped around my girth … well, almost as much, to be honest. </p><p>Her back arched as she continued moving up and down, showing that she was capable of holding her breath for a long while, her eyes widening in struggle. Yet, she continued, clearly enjoying the physical struggle just as much while she imprisoned my shaft with her lips and her throat. </p><p>However, as she continued without a break, the first sign of struggle arrived soon. She closed her eyes, trying to gather her strength as she pushed herself further. The way she dealt with that sign of weakness was even more entertaining. She grabbed my legs for leverage, pushing herself down deeper and deeper until it disappeared into her mouth completely. </p><p>Despite the exertion, she managed to keep it up for almost two minutes, and even when she took a break, it was for a few trembling breaths before she repeated the following, just as determined. </p><p>Three more repeats, and she was getting more and more ragged, while my pleasure climbed up, begging me for a release. </p><p>One of the biggest benefits of the cultivation was that I had incredible control over my own body. Refusing the call of pleasure was uncomfortable, but it only increased the intensity of the pleasure. I would have preferred to extend my pleasure a while more, but even with her eyes closed, I could see Sophie determined not to move away until she received her victory. </p><p>Getting suspended from her job, narrowly dodging a summary execution, and discovering the true depth of the supernatural was far deeper than she had initially assumed; all capped with an actual brush with death.</p><p>She deserved a reward after her busy day. </p><p>I let my body react right as she pushed down once more, filling her throat with my seed, which she captured smoothly. Then, with a victorious expression on her face, she swallowed. </p><p>It took all I had not to flip her down, but I had already decided to leave the control to her. “Well, that was nice —” she started, signaling that she wanted to finish, which I had to accept, at least for today. Tomorrow, I would teach her how true seduction worked. </p><p>However, before she could even step down the bed, she realized my shaft was yet to go down. “You’re still hard,” she commented. </p><p>I shrugged with a smirk. “Perks of cultivation, sweetie. You have to work harder to defeat me.” </p><p>“Oh, that sounds like a challenge,” she said, her voice tense, but the way she licked her lips showed she was more than ready to greet it. She was slow and controlled as she climbed on my lap, doing her best to hide her enthusiasm. </p><p>She failed on that part.</p><p>I said nothing as she finished climbing, aligning herself on top of me. Her hands landed on my chest, ready to ride me, her eyes once again pinned to mine to show she was in control. Once again, I let her, no matter how tempted I was flip her and take her aggressively, for her moans to fill the room. </p><p>Instead, I waited until she took a surprisingly shaky breath like she was trying to gather courage before jumping off a cliff, and her warm frame started sinking, my girth wrapped by an even more intense hug.</p><p>She let out a small gasp as she moved down faster than I expected, and immediately bit her lips to keep the next one in. For me, keeping my chuckle down was an even bigger challenge, but I succeeded. I had a feeling she wouldn’t have appreciated it. </p><p>Luckily, there were a lot of details I had to distract me. Like the way, her beautiful breast jiggled as she rocked back and forth, the way her tightness wrapped around me, or the passionate dance of her fingers like she was preparing to make a bust of my chest. </p><p>Her eyes stayed closed as her hips rocked faster and faster, soon reacting to a wild speed, her beautiful blonde hair dancing with her sharp movements. An amazing sight already, but as the pleasure rose, so did her aura, getting even purer. </p><p>That was the reason for my selectiveness when it came to my partners. I loved the carnal aspects of it, certainly, but such an intimate way of experiencing pleasure had a way of lowering the defenses, even for other cultivators. Good or bad, ugly or pristine, everything was magnified. </p><p>Sophie’s aura was sharp and beautiful even as the pleasure invaded her body, all the small concerns that tainted her aura washing away, leaving its place to a blinding brightness. </p><p>She tightened around me, her arousal finally bringing her to a climax. I followed with my own, filling her. She collapsed against my chest. “So warm,” she murmured, the aftershocks of pleasure hitting her hard. “I never felt such an intense orgasm,” she muttered. </p><p>“Sleep,” I whispered even as I carefully laid her down and tucked her in. I even grabbed a wet wipe to clean her up without waking her up. After all, her collapse was partially my fault, as no matter how much I wanted to control, and despite the seal, I was still a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and it was difficult to prevent our souls from resonating for a fleeting moment.  </p><p>Not enough to comprehend the truth, but enough for the resonance to trigger a spectacular orgasm. Combined with the stress of the day, no wonder she collapsed. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean I wouldn’t tease her in the aftermath. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I still don’t think that this is the best idea. I don’t want to involve Lana anymore. Not to such a dangerous situation,” Sophie said. </p><p>“And, I’m telling you once again; it’s too late. Since I don’t know how they discovered your location, staying away might be a bigger risk,” I said. “Now, stop talking, and enjoy your trip,” I said. </p><p>“Shut up, what’s there to enjoy? Don’t be arrogant,” she retaliated, but her blush disagreed. It was understandable, considering I was carrying her in the bridal hold as I sneaked through the street, avoiding both cameras and any potential observers. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I chuckled. “I must have another blonde suspended cop that had declared she wanted to test my supernatural abilities,” I said. She didn’t answer, but just pinched me painfully. </p><p>Even as I sneaked into Lana’s garden, this time over the garden, and through an open window. I might have blamed her for not being careful, but considering it was the second-floor window, I decided against it. </p><p>Anyone who could reach here wouldn’t be stopped by a glass window. </p><p>“I think I’m going to take a shower,” she said. </p><p>“Call me if you need any help,” I said with a chuckle and received a slap to my chest in return, but her blush was too cute not to trigger it. She might have handled such open seduction if it wasn’t for her very open declaration of desire earlier. </p><p>I was also playing it heavy-handed intentionally. She might have been healed from her wounds, not even leaving a scar behind, but that didn’t change the fact that she had almost died, and I gave her a chance to make a calm decision  while still making my interest clear. </p><p>And, if she still had that idea when I returned from visiting those three places … well, it would be fun. </p><p>Before I left, I checked the basement. Lana was in front of her computer, lost in her work, not noticing our approach, or the fact that her shower was working. I didn’t bother her, leaving it to Sophie to explain the situation.  </p><p>I wanted to check the three locations to understand the exact situation. I wanted to see if I could sense the presence of the others. </p><p>My first destination: the warehouse. </p><p>It wasn’t too far away, and since it was on the outskirts of the town, I didn’t need to worry about the cameras much. Yet, as  I looked at the broken walls of the depreciated building, I couldn’t help but frown. Even from a distance, I could see about twenty people walking around the building, attending various tasks.</p><p>It was subtle, but every single one of them showed signs of demonic cultivation, likely beginners. It was already enough to conclude that whatever was going on was more organized than someone getting their hands on a rogue cultivation manual. </p><p>Then, there was an even bigger evidence. There was a formation around the warehouse. It wasn’t a good formation. While it was quite a bit stronger than the first formation I had dealt with back in the motel, but not as strong as the one that had been established by the EIM agents. </p><p>Which might be important. It suggested that the cooperation between the agents and the demonic cultivators wasn’t as direct as I would have feared. However, it was too early to conclude whether it was just a few agents suborned by the temptation, or something bigger. </p><p>I was tempted to go and deal with them directly and get the answer, but I stayed back. The events at the forest had already revealed my hand more than I preferred. I needed to understand the exact relationship first before acting.</p><p>With a sigh, I moved on to the second location. It was deep in the forest, without a road.  </p><p>At the destination, I wasn’t able to discover much, just a partially covered entrance leading underground. However, what I discovered, even from a distance, was enough to raise my sense of alarm to a new level. This time, there was a far more intricate formation over the place, one that had reminded me of EIM’s work back in the motel, but many times better. </p><p>It was intricate. At a glance, I could see the work of several experts with clashing styles, overlapping significantly, and I could see the signs that establishing the formations took weeks, maybe months. Moreover, the formation was strong. Not enough to resist me if I decided to break it, but with my seal on, it would still take a while. </p><p> “I should have studied more,” I sighed. For most missions, I had been assigned an expert in formations handling traps and defenses, so I was familiar with their capabilities. For any decent formations expert, bypassing them would take an hour at most. </p><p>I could break them in less than a minute, but not without alerting whoever put them on, making it a last resort. </p><p>Still, as I moved away to my last destination, I found myself wondering just how much power EIM had. </p><p>I had interacted with many mortal organizations during missions, and I knew it was rare to have more than a few cultivators for each country. Mostly because, without an essence-rich environment, they needed essence stones and other materials to cultivate, and those were not exactly easy to procure. Our sect had a treasury full of it, but along with it, many places to spend such a fortune. Fringe organizations on mortal planets hardly cut. </p><p>However seeing the number of demonic cultivators I discovered accidentally, I was ready to question whether it was the right call in the first place.  </p><p>EIM was problematic. Not just because of the number of cultivators they seemed to have, but also the skills they displayed. While not exactly impressive in sect standards, their formation capabilities were far higher than what should be possible.</p><p>I didn’t know what was more unsettling. Their higher than expected capabilities, or their dubious alliance with demonic cultivators. </p><p>Helpless, I returned. Well, helpless was an exaggeration. I could have cut through the formation easily before dealing with anything that might be in, even with my sealed cultivation. There was a reason that the Path of the Sword was one of the scariest paths. Unfortunately, that would mean alerting their backer — and I wasn’t stupid enough to think that they didn’t have any. </p><p>I needed more information. </p><p>My third destination was the house, which was the least alarming of the three destinations. With the number of agents going in and out openly, with several cars carrying the EIM logo, it looked like EIM had turned the house into a temporary base. </p><p>They still had a formation around. It might be about the number of people coming in and out, but the formation around the place was much weaker, making the location a good target to infiltrate after midnight.</p><p>I moved away, but I couldn’t help but sigh as I did so. This was supposed to be a holiday, one that might take months until the council focused their more important tasks first. </p><p>And, merely a few hours into it, I was scouting demonic cultivator bases. </p><p>Feeling melancholic, I found myself on a nice concealed rooftop and looked down at the town, wondering whether it was a coincidence that I had been here, or if there was something else in play. Not a conscious decision … but fate. </p><p>Fate was a nebulous, hard to understand concept, with the perception of the cultivators varying greatly. Exactly what it was, the objective of it, its practices. The only thing that hadn’t been doubted was its existence. </p><p>Coincidences happened around cultivators too many times for anyone to believe it. Some even thought that Fate could influence the decision of the cultivators in some minor ways. </p><p>Minor ways, like changing my exile location back to my hometown just as the presence of Demonic cultivators started to increase. </p><p>“I wonder…” I said, and then, let out a sigh. There was no point thinking about too much. Cultivators who had lived far longer than I did tried to solve the question of Fate, only to fail miserably. And, even if there was one that discovered it, they kept it to themselves. </p><p>I had more immediate concerns than wondering about those. </p><p>I decided to return to Lana’s house. As much as I wanted to act, I had been in enough missions to know acting with faulty intel could end very painfully. Lana was still in the basement, desperately typing to crack the security of the phones. </p><p>However, I had to admit, lost in her work, she was quite attractive. Pity her mission was too important to take a little break. </p><p>With a sigh, I went back upstairs. Sophie was still there, no doubt waiting for a report. I walked, making sure my steps were loud. After her ordeal, I didn’t want to scare her. She had been an FBI agent and police, and while I had been healing her, I noticed several wounds showing that it wasn’t her first close call with death. </p><p>Still, startling her wouldn’t be fun.  </p><p>I knocked on the door. “Blake?” she asked, her voice strangely tense.  </p><p>“Yes, I have just finished patrolling.” </p><p>“Anything urgent?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing that couldn’t wait a few hours if you don’t feel like —” I started, only for the door to open, enough to notice two things. First, Sophie was still wearing her bathrobe, which wasn’t tied particularly tight. </p><p>Second, her expression told me it wasn’t an accident. </p><p>She grabbed my shirt and pulled me inside violently. </p><p>Who was I to reject the call of the law…</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

The city seemed to have a new ‘mysterious’ hero, though considering the number of barely-concealed mentions of ex-football players, the news wasn’t even paying any attention to keeping my identity a secret. </p><p>Not that it was a problem. I had already received my real reward. </p><p>[DIVINE SYSTEM II</p><p>Traits: (Divine Body I, Divine Mind I, Divine Aura I)</p><p>Domains: (Lust I, Command I, Athletics I)</p><p>Acolytes: (Megan(?))</p><p>Totem Animals: (Black Tortoise [?])</p><p>Intent Pool: 613]</p><p>I had just collected enough Intent to not only repair the System, but also gather enough to maintain it for a week. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t use it much. I just used a point — away from the city — to see if those mysterious teleporters would react to an intense move like they did back when I was at the ruins. They did not. Either their methods didn’t detect Intent, or their detection was just focused on the ruins. Considering the giant beasts I had seen, it would be understandable. </p><p>Either way, it meant that I was safe from immediately being targeted. </p><p>I could feel that I could start upgrading various features with Intent, but I didn’t do so, for two important reasons. One, I could feel that they required more Intent than I currently had. Second, I didn’t want to waste my Intent. I could feel that, the only reason I had received such wide coverage was the novelty factor. </p><p>Soon, the situation would change. Having some safety margin before I could start making plans would work. </p><p>At least, I had some money. Not much, barely five hundred after buying an old phone and even an older laptop, but I managed to steal some while I had busted one of the burglaries. It probably belonged to the owner of the store, but I didn’t particularly care. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time I had to steal to survive.  </p><p>With a sigh, I turned my attention to the laptop, and quickly dismantled it, cleaning the dust, replacing its thermal paste, and making some other small changes until it was somewhat functional, which didn’t take long. </p><p>Handling the security, on the other hand, was much more difficult. </p><p>Most of the tools that were used to ensure true privacy were gone, leaving only corporate equivalents, but it would be a cold day in hell before I trusted them, especially for such an important task. </p><p>Meaning, that unless I was ready to build my own infrastructure — which required money, connections, and time, all three I had been lacking — there were no hacking adventures for me. The risk of getting caught was too high, which would mean losing my only true hidden weapon. </p><p>Instead, I built a more commercial security suite, the kind that made people think that they were secure and anonymous in this new world — which was a lie — before I set up a public donation campaign for my heroic identity. </p><p>I needed the money, and stealing was not a sustainable path. I doubted that it would work well, but every bit counted. </p><p>With that done, it was already midnight, so I went out for a second patrol. I was feeling energetic, and I didn’t want to waste my time. Though, this time, when I left my motel room, I wasn’t alone. Several blocks away, there were two people, watching me with binoculars. </p><p>And, they didn’t even look like they were a part of the same group. </p><p>Since they were too far away for me to notice based on my publicly revealed abilities, I didn’t openly react to their presence. And, while I didn’t like being observed, I couldn’t exactly prevent them while operating from such an obvious center. </p><p>Unfortunately, if I actually hid, I wouldn’t be able to give the impression of the young reckless hero. The more underestimated I got, the better. </p><p>I jumped through the roofs, acting like I was trying to stay hidden even as I let several people take my photos, making sure they were properly majestic. And, in the process, I even managed to bust a couple more criminals busy with petty crimes. </p><p>I wanted to act as ordinary as possible. </p><p>*** </p><p>A week. </p><p>I spent a full week filled with the most banal heroic activities possible, going as far as actually saving kittens from the trees, which had been fruitful. </p><p>[Intent Pool: 2,291]</p><p>And, Intent wasn’t my only benefit. The donations page I had set up had some movements. Nothing spectacular, but enough for me to afford to move to a decent hotel rather than a motel — a hotel that promptly upgraded my room to the deluxe version. </p><p>There were perks to having a paper-thin hero identity. </p><p>However, for all the benefits I had been collecting, I was not happy. Because, yesterday, I had over twenty-three hundred Intent. </p><p>My presence as a hero already lost its advantage. A troubling realization, especially since I was still getting prime-time news spots. I was still a novelty for the city … but it wasn’t enough to meet the daily consumption of the System. </p><p>It was not a happy realization. </p><p>I needed a solution. Some solutions, I immediately vetoed. For example, getting another Acolyte was a tempting idea, but I had no one around I truly trusted, and even if I had, I didn’t know just how intense making an Acolyte was. </p><p>There was no guarantee that it wouldn’t trigger something. </p><p>I was tempted to create some bigger spectacles, either by revealing more of my powers or actually creating some kind of disaster myself, but I ignored that temptation as well. Both behaviors risked bringing some unwanted attention and weren’t worth the risk. </p><p>No, I decided to do something more conventional. </p><p>Create an ordinary kind of scandal. Luckily, I had already noticed that drop trend for the last few days, and I was prepared for it. </p><p>It was why I was in front of the mirror, carefully fixing my clothes as I prepared to visit a club. I was wearing a simple shirt and slacks combo, the kind that cost barely a hundred dollars to assemble. Ordinarily, it would be too simple for a club visit, but there were perks to fame. </p><p>‘Hey, I have just seen Mister Hero leaving the hotel. I heard that he’s going to a club,’ I texted to a paparazzi. </p><p>‘Find out which one he’s going, and I’ll pay double,’ he said. Double meant two hundred dollars. We didn’t need to discuss much. It wasn’t the first time I was leaking information to him. I started the day after I moved to this new hotel, acting like an ambitious bellboy with a need for some extra cash, sending him information, and he dropped the cash at an agreed location.</p><p>I didn’t need the money, but I needed to make sure there would be cameras when I went there. Otherwise, how could I create a scandal?   </p><p>‘Echoland,’ I wrote before I turned off the burner and left it in my room and I left. A car picked me up, and dropped me in front of the club in question, which was the hottest location in town. </p><p>No one complained when I moved to the VIP line. “Welcome, sir,” the bodyguard said, quick to recognize the only superhero in the small town, which was a fun detail. I entered the place. </p><p>Inside, there was a small hallway that split into two, one leading a private VIP area, and one leading the wider public area. And, while I had no doubt that I could get into the VIP area, the isolated nature would mean the risk of a scandal breaking would be much smaller. </p><p>Instead, I followed the other path, and arrived at a wide area. The music was loud and bouncing, while the people danced freely at the center of the room, excited as they wrapped against each other. </p><p>I paused for a moment before I continued, feeling the echo from the dance floor. Its density wasn’t significant. I might not even notice that much Intent, but it was stronger.  </p><p>I didn’t dare to touch it, because I could feel it flowing, just like the Intent I generated that moved toward the System. However, there were two differences. First, the pull was stronger than the Intent I generated. </p><p>Second, it was being pulled toward the basement, gathering around … something, before it disappeared. </p><p>Not exactly something I expected to stumble, but I didn’t turn and leave. It was the first opportunity I had to interact with the powers of the new world, and I had no intention of turning back. </p><p>After all, I still needed a proper scandal to gather more Intent. I looked around, identifying the targets, until I saw a group at the corner. Five men, and a lone woman, but four of them were more focused on guarding, while the middle-aged man — dressed in a way that reflected money, but not taste — did his best to seduce the bored young woman that accompanied him. </p><p>One of the up-and-coming business moguls of the city. </p><p>The supporting actor for a scandal. </p>",
