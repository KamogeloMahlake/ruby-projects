    "content": "<p>Stepping inside the library once again was an interesting experience. For the last three years, I have spent almost all of my awake time in here, the Silver Library But for the first time, I had the ability to soak in its impressive sight, to understand the significance of the mass that was here. Endless lines of shelves, each filled with thick, leather-bound tomes, representing the biggest repository of information known to mankind. </p><p>And it wasn’t just magical knowledge that it contained. It supposedly kept at least a copy of each book in existence, representing humanity’s collective wisdom. Ironically, only my own spark of wisdom allowed me to fully comprehend the treasures that I had been carrying for the last three years. With my abysmal stats, previously stuck to one, I failed to realize the importance of it, though even if I did, not like I would have been able to benefit. With an intelligence score of 1, learning how to tie my shoes was a miracle. Recognizing the individual letters, I was able to learn only after years of private lessons.  </p><p>But, having a better understanding of everything wasn’t always positive. For example, I also realized the true importance of the Silver Library. The state of our world had made it a necessity. When losing towns and villages to the monster hordes wasn’t worthy of anything other than marketplace gossip, ensuring the safety of information was good thinking. </p><p>Luckily, protected by the walls of the biggest magical school in the world, I didn’t have a reason to worry about the dangers of the wild, at least not in the short term.  </p><p>I took a deep breath before walking forward towards the main desk, while trying to copy my unbalanced shambling, thanking the deities that I had the chance to select subterfuge as my first skill. It was the only edge I had to keep my new status under wraps until I could understand the limits and the impacts. The first years of my life were filled with experiments, and I had no intention to restart them. The experience had been harrowing enough for my idiot past, and I had no intention to risk it once again. </p><p>When I arrived at my destination, I was happy to note that the head librarian was away. The head librarian was a sharp woman in her forties, a battlefield veteran to the boot, and I wasn’t sure that my new acting skills would be enough to avoid her sharp attention. Even with my spotty recollection, I could remember her as a dangerous woman, and it was impossible to guess how she would react if she noticed my expanded capabilities.  </p><p>One of her senior assistants manning the main desk instead. A shortish, brown-haired guy that I failed to remember. Luckily it was just expected of me. I stood in front of him silently until I caught his attention. </p><p>“What are you waiting for, you log, go collect the discarded books,” he murmured in annoyance, not bothering to give me anything other than a glance, which suited me just fine. Until I could maximize my subterfuge skills, the fewer interactions I had with people, the better. Well, fewer interactions, discounting the one unique context that gave me my first experience points. I still wasn’t completely sure that was the only way I could gain experience, but that was one experiment I had no complications to run. </p><p>I grabbed the nearest empty cart and drove it towards the back of the library, to a section where the discarded copies of the less valuable books held, well-away from the majority of students and other employees. And while I hoped that I would come across a scene similar to one that gave me the first taste of power, I also knew that it wasn’t very likely, especially in the middle of the day, when the library was in its most crowded. </p><p>I was searching for a small alcove where I could read undisturbed, discovering more about my new status. Luckily, working for years in the library, netted me a few spots where I could hide to read a book or two. And I knew that no one would be looking for me thanks to my reputation. </p><p>Reading a book with my enhanced stats was an unbelievable experience. Previously, each letter was a puzzle that I struggle to decipher, and any sentence longer than eight words might as well be a mountain in terms of the challenge it represented. Now, words jumped from the page, sentences forming easily digestible sections that I could decipher with a glance. Truly a magical experience. </p><p>I had used my obscure location and newly enhanced reading skills, trying to discover more about my new condition and my power levels. Apparently, I managed to luck myself into a set of respectable stats. From what I have read, it seemed that the stat increase could be only driven by Achievements, and everyone had their own unique set of achievements, meaning stat increase was inherently driven by luck. </p><p>Moreover, my stats, with a minimum of six for each, was below average compared to the general population, but still workable in terms of usual standards, while my wisdom score was quite a bit above average. It seemed that a score of five was what an Abnormal had on average, and ten was what they could reach ultimately. And while there was no limit for the Melius, most didn’t surpass the twenties, meaning sixteen for Wisdom was quite respectable. </p><p>“Finally something going right in my fucking life,” I murmured when I realized that. After twenty years of torture, I was long due for some good news. That didn’t mean that I wouldn’t focus on enhancing my stats, but the real priority was my Level, which would unlock more skills. Yes, it was possible to learn things without skill, but only through extended practice that would take weeks and months, something skills that not only shortened significantly, but also allowed to break limits that would otherwise limit those. </p><p>With my newfound attraction towards reading, I barely realized the passage of time until the library became too dark to read. Only then I realized that it was pushing close to the sunset, and the section I was currently in wasn’t important enough to have a lot of lamps, and using one of those risked to give my position. With a sigh, I grabbed my cart, pulled several books from the shelves to give the impression that I had been working, and slowly drove back towards the main desk. It was for the best if I didn’t disappear completely from the view of my coworker. The less attention I got, the better. </p><p>I had been planning to drop the books on the usual desk, letting the others sort the stuff, but a sharp hiss derailed me from my plans. I barely kept myself from turning towards the source, recognizing her from the last night. Marianne of the Blue, the most accomplished student of healing arts in the Silver Tower. Her focus on the gentler side of the magic was the only reason I was still alive. If it wasn’t for her last-minute intervention, I would have ended up dead due to my pitiful amount of HP at that point in time. And most importantly, she was part of the reason I unlocked the first lock on the road to true power. </p><p>Still, just because she saved my life and unlocked true potential didn’t mean that she would get away without a consequence for her involvement in my near-death experience. After everything that happened to me, I wasn’t feeling particularly generous. But my current position wasn’t conductive for that particular payback, so I continued my trek. Common sense told me to take a turn towards the more crowded parts of the library. </p><p>Instead, I took a left turn, taking a path leading to another rarely-visited part of the library. If it had been Cornelia who was behind me, I wouldn’t dare to take such a risk, but considering Marianne was the one who saved my life, risks were more manageable. </p><p>Her footsteps following me after my turn made me certain that our encounter was not accidental. Still, dashing away was not an option. I needed to make sure about my status, and she was an excellent target for it. So, I continued walking, acting like I wasn’t hearing her footsteps. My old self definitely wouldn’t have noticed, after all. </p><p>Only when Marianne was directly behind me when I decided to stop. But she failed to notice my sudden movement in time, and collided with my back before she could react. It wasn’t exactly what I had in mind, but the line of writing in front of me went a long way to mollify that mistake. </p><p><em>[+10 Experience]</em></p><p>I was rather certain that the experience wasn’t about the accident itself, as they weren’t exactly rare in my history. No, I had a feeling that the sudden gain was about the pair of firm globes, pressing against my back rather distinctively. She really had an amazing chest.  </p><p>The best thing to do would be pulling back, and act stupid until Marianne could walk away. But I needed to validate my assumptions about experience gain. Luckily, there was no one around, leaving me free to act creatively. I have turned back rapidly, so that before she could react, I was face to face with my stalker. She opened her mouth in shock, trying to pull back, but I was quicker. I faked yelping in panic as I waved my arms, and my hands accidentally ended up on her chest! Such misfortune! </p><p><em>[+50 Experience]</em></p><p>I had been expecting her to pull back rather rapidly, but I hadn’t been expecting her feet to tangle into her robe, destroying her balance. She started falling back, and panic rose in my heart. Even in my idiot state -mostly due to sheer experience- I had known about the dangers of head-first falling. I tried to grab her as quick as I could, not wanting to injure one of the most important students of the school. </p><p>Since my hands were already there, grabbing her robe was purely reflex.  </p><p>Her robe was probably made from magically-enhanced silk or similar material, strong enough to resist the sudden pull. But the same couldn’t be said for the fancy lace ties on the front. I watched with a detached fascination as the front of her robe ripped, giving me a glimpse of what was underneath. A lacy corset that gently wrapped her curves, ending low enough to create a rather impressive cleavage. </p><p><em>[+50 Experience]</em></p><p>The smart thing to do was to gently help her stand up while marking the experiment as a success. After all, the experience I had gained was nothing to scoff at, considering the others had to risk their lives in the wilderness against the monsters to make the similar gains, where the smallest mistake might result in death. And, in a school filled with female students and servants, I would no doubt have other opportunities. </p><p>But riding in the exaltation of another experience burst, I was more willing to take risks. So, when her arms reached towards the front of her robe in a blind panic, trying to cover her body, I decided to push for more. “Sorry,” I murmured in panic as I let go of her robe, leaning to my recently-maximized subterfuge skill to make it seem like I was an idiot, panicking against what had just happened. </p><p>Thanks to the angle of her body, she started falling once more. And, her hands were too far away to reach back to soften her fall. “Help, you idiot,” she yelped in panic. Who I was to disregard the heartful cry of a beautiful maiden -guessing- asking for my help. So, my right hand darted towards her chest, and grabbed the edge of her corset. </p><p>She let out a gasp as the corset cut into her back due to sudden spot, but I really welcomed the next noise. A certain ripping sound, proving that her corset was weaker than her robe. This time, I reacted before she could react, leaning forward to wrap my hand around her waist. I was quick enough to prevent her from falling, but wasn’t quick enough to save her corset. As a result, the ripped remains of her corset was in my right hand while I lowered her on the ground with my left. </p><p><em>[+100 Experience]</em></p><p><em>[Achievement: Manufactured Mishap. Proactively create an accident that ends up in a visual feast. +200 Experience, +1 Manipulation]</em></p><p>I didn’t exactly know why a smile popped into my face. My guess was it was a close call between another stat increase, and the amazing sight in front of my eyes. The outrage grew in her face as she opened her mouth to cry, but a sudden comprehension stopped her. She must have realized that a cry would pull the others to our location, increasing the number of people who had captured the amazing sight of her voluptuous breasts. </p><p>I spent a second to commit the amazing view of her curvy body on my memory while trying to guess just how what portion I could cover. At most half, I was guessing. </p><p>Another inspiration struck at that moment. Did I have to keep that question on the theoretical level? With my left arm trapped under her, I was the perfect excuse, so I pushed a silly expression to my face, and started falling forward with an exaggerated movement. Her panic was positively delicious. </p><p>I let my knee to hit first, receiving a sudden spike of pain thanks to the stone floor. Then, when I tried to put my right hand on the ground, it accidentally ended up on her chest, my fingers sinking deep into her chest. It was a miracle I managed to keep myself from laughing against her shocked expression. </p><p><em>[+200 Experience] </em></p><p>I didn’t blame her when she pushed my right arm away with a strength that was boosted by her panic, but that move left me without support once again, and I started falling towards her once more, her panic growing stronger as our faces got closer. She tried to reach to my chest before the contact, but she was too slow, which made me guess that Agility wasn’t one of her best stats. But her stat distribution wasn’t as important as my lips pressing against hers. </p><p><em>[+400 Experience] </em></p><p>The experience boost was almost as welcome as the sensation I got from her beautiful lips, though I didn’t have much to savor the sensation, as I felt two hands on my chest, followed by a rather painful push on my chest, too strong to be just physical. </p><p><em>[HP 52/62]</em></p><p>It wasn’t too deadly thanks to my recent power boost, but just a day ago, it would have pushed me near death. So, once again I relied on my subterfuge skill, gasping pathetically like I was on the edge of the underworld. “Oh for god's sake,” she exclaimed, her panic tinged with exasperation as she stood up. A second later, she was leaning towards me, her hands glowing blue as a healing spell spread through my body. Meanwhile, I was enjoying the spectacular view of her breasts, hanging freely. </p><p><em>[HP 62/62]</em></p><p><em>[+100 Experience]</em></p><p><em>[Achievement: False Flag. Garner the sympathy of a woman you recently angered. +500 Experience, +2 Charisma]</em></p><p>“Pain, gone,” I murmured, trying to sound surprised. </p><p>“Idiot,” she murmured in exasperation as she stood up. She glanced to her corset for a moment before giving it up as a lost cause, and focused on closing her robe despite its ripped state. I continued lying on the ground in fake pain, enjoying the accidental flashes as she tried to fix her robe. A minute later, she sighed in desperation and murmured a small chant, and her robe repaired itself. Not enough to pass a detailed examination, cluing me that it wasn’t one of the areas she was strong in. She sent one last glare towards me, she stuffed the remains of her corset into her robe and dashed away, leaving me alone. </p><p>I just lay on the ground, amused by the fact that she didn’t have the time to mention why she was following me in the first place. I wondered whether I would be able to set up a similar accident the next time. </p><p><strong>     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****</strong></p><p>I spent the next hour after my encounter with Marianne to cart books around, trying to be visible while acting like my usual bumbling self. I was very aware of the fragility of my position, and the less attention I had on my actions, the better. After the earlier risk I had taken, it was only prudent. </p><p>But there was one important detail that was tickling my mind. </p><p><em>[Experience 2810/3000]</em></p><p>Just a dash more experience points, and I would have another level. And while patience was a virtue, after spending twenty years of my life in a static condition, stuck in a rut, waiting for another day sounded like torture. Which was why I kept my eyes open, looking for another opportunity to gain some experience points. </p><p>Of course, that wasn’t all I had done. Seeing Marianne’s spell raised another ambition in me, casting magic. So, as I walked around the library, I had been also doing my best to pull my mana to the surface. I wasn’t expecting to start coughing fireballs and spitting tornados without a corresponding skill, but simpler things should be a possibility. So whenever there was no one around, I reached for my mana, trying to do something. </p><p>Probably thanks to my extremely high wisdom stat, and an overall respectable level of my other mental aspects, after a couple of hours of dedicated practice, I was able to create a weak telekinesis effect. From what I had read, such an achievement would have taken weeks for the others, but also it was usually done by children who were yet to reach their puberty, so, whether it was a success was arguable. </p><p>The effect was stronger than I was expecting, enough to throw away a book violently, but on the negative side, I had learned that fact because of my limited control, actually slamming a book to a wall, hard enough to destroy it. Luckily, there was no one around to see it.</p><p>Still, however weak and unwieldy, I had access to magic, and it would doubtlessly come useful. That spell devoured a significant portion of my remaining mana, but I didn’t let it bother me. The benefits were too important to ignore. </p><p>That opportunity came soon after, in the form of a student with a distinctive pale blond hair, cut in shoulder-length student, sitting alone in a concealed desk, her attention firmly on the book in front of her. Helga, I recognized her. Disjointed memories of other students insulting and bullying her came soon after, because she was not only a foreigner, but also she belonged to a merchant family, and not a particularly rich one either. The only reason she was able to gain admission to Silver Tower was because of her prodigious talent, passing many of the noble students. </p><p>Of course, that fact hadn’t been noted with good humor by the other students, who weren’t very happy about being shown-off by a foreign commoner. And, to her unluckiness, her strength lied more on the research and other academic topics than combat, preventing her from responding effectively to her bullies. The other thing I remembered was she never treated me badly, though she had been dismissive enough. </p><p>If I was a nice man, I would have let her, a fellow bullying victim who had been suffering like I had been, to study in peace. Unfortunately for her, I was not a nice person. </p><p>I stood far away, making sure to put two large bookshelves between us, enough to catch a glimpse of her while making sure I wouldn’t be observed. It wasn’t ideal, considering my telekinesis ability was highly sensitive to distance, but keeping hidden was more important than accurate spellcasting in my situation. </p><p>My heartbeat picked up speed, only partially about the danger I was in. The rest was the anticipation about what I would find. Helga was a beautiful girl, but her body was a total mystery due to her habit of wearing loose clothing. Most students had thought that it was because she was quite fat, expressed by their regular insults. But there was a voice inside suggesting me that it might not be as accurate. And I couldn’t wait to see if it was true… </p><p>A deep breath later, I used my nascent arcane abilities to reach towards her, trying to focus on the top button that was holding her robe in place. With that, I hit my first snag, namely her aura, interfering with my spell. The books had warned me about that, but I had been hoping that her lack of alertness would blunt its effects enough to give me a movement area. Unfortunately, that didn’t work as much as I had hoped, or maybe my magical power was worse than I had been hoping for, or maybe, due to constant bullying, she had a stronger resistance active subconsciously. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, it was a barrier that I needed to overcome, so I focused on my spell, putting extra power behind it. And it worked… In a fashion…</p><p>My aim was to unlatch a few of her buttons, which I succeed. What I wasn’t planning for was the violent speed of my success, only parting her robe violently, making her buttons fly around, but also managed to achieve a similar effect on the blouse she was wearing underneath, though this time, only up to halfway. </p><p>Still, it was enough to reveal the corset she was wearing underneath, confirming my suspicions. The body she was hiding underneath was truly beautiful, enough to send my heart overdrive. Though my elation wasn’t only about that. </p><p><em>[+50 Experience] </em></p><p><em>[Achievement: Malfunctioning Magic. Use an uncontrolled magic spell for your personal benefit. +200 Experience, +1 Precision]</em></p><p><em>[Level Up!]</em></p><p>I wasn’t expecting her to react as quickly as she did, though. Her first reflex was to crouch behind the table while her eyes roamed the room rapidly. Trying to use the situation to my advantage before I retreated, I tried to push her once more, but this time, my spell fizzled long before it even neared her body. Either she was even stronger than I had been expecting, or I vastly overestimated my fledging strength. </p><p>Regardless of the situation, it was the time to pull back. The last thing before I pulled back from my vantage point was her buttons, attaching them back to her robe with a bare wave of her hand, showing just how much I still needed to improve. </p><p>I was driving my cart in my usual idiot disguise when I heard rapid footsteps closing to my direction, making me panic slightly. I knew that she hadn’t seen me, meaning she probably felt the direction the spell was coming from. Yet another complication to take care in my future actions. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel intimidated when she suddenly appeared in front of me, her expression bleak. “Have you seen anyone here,” she barked, and I raised a trembling finger towards distance while using my recently maximized basic acting skills to a maximum degree. Luckily, she didn’t have a reason to suspect me, and followed my direction with anger sharp on her face. </p><p>I let out a relaxed sigh before smiling. I had just gained another level! And from the skill selection, the decision was almost trivial to pick Basic Arcana Magic. For most, it was a tool that was underused due to its limited combat applications, but in my situation, it was too useful to miss… </p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>[Level: 3        Experience: 3010 / 6000</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Strength: 6    Charisma: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Precision: 7    Perception: 7</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Agility: 6     Manipulation: 7</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Endurance: 7      Wisdom: 16</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>HP: 96 / 96    Mana: 20 / 135             ]</strong></em></p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>SKILLS</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>[Basic Subterfuge (25/25)     ]</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Basic Arcana [1/25]</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>SPELLS AND ABILITIES</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>[</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Minor Telekinesis</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>]</strong></em></p>",

    "content": "<p>The next day, I was sitting on my office despite the fact that it was a weekend, the burner phone in my hand, my fingers dancing over to type a new message, like I had been doing for the last twenty minutes. ‘Yes, dear leader. I’m serious. That’s your punishment. You’re going to send him a mail, asking his urgent assistance, and go wherever he was.’ </p><p>‘It’s degrading,’ the answer came. ‘I can’t do the things you asked. I have my pride.’</p><p>‘You should have thought that before failing at your sacred mission of guarding the recordings of our Sisterhood,’ I answered, amused by the fact that my silly student was yet to realize who was responsible for the messages. I had expected that my over-the-topness would have clued her in, but it seemed not to be the case. ‘Until further notice, you can threat your pride like a shirt of last year’s fashion, shelved until further notice.’</p><p>‘Can I at least dress normally,’ she asked almost a minute later.</p><p>‘You have your orders. Either follow them, or an email will find its way to the Alumni, informing them about your lack of diligence.’ </p><p>‘You win,’ she sent back, leaving me smirking as I imagined the flash of defeat that passed over her face as she pressed the green button to finalize her message. Currently, I didn’t have a real-time feed to her room to validate that -as it was too dangerous to bring that computer anywhere outside my room- but I had watched her enough to get a solid hold of her reactions. </p><p>With that task done, I turned towards the book I was reading, Tractatus Politicus, from Spinoza. Just because I was bored from teaching a bunch of entitled kids who didn’t bother to read even their assignments, didn’t mean that I lost my fascination with the topic. Then, my reading was interrupted by an email to my official account. I wasn’t surprised to see that it was from Megan, asking for an urgent meeting. I answered it with an alternative meeting on Monday, but in a follow-up mail, she insisted that we needed to meet today. </p><p>Several more exchanges, where I tried to halfheartedly convince her for an alternative date, while making sure not to position my rejection too hard. It was a tight balance I needed to walk. She needed to think that I was reluctant to meet, while giving her enough hope that she could change my mind. After fifteen minutes, and a lengthy email chain later, I ‘graciously’ allowed her to visit me for fifteen minutes. </p><p>After her final message, informing me that she would be in there in ten minutes, I stood up, and checked the cameras in the room, making sure they were well-hidden, and recording cleanly, not only to have recording for personal pleasure, but also to prevent her going around, telling tales of big bad teacher dominating a poor student. Admittedly, it was exactly what I had in mind, but if there was one thing the Mafia thought me that the records didn’t have to match with the reality. </p><p>With everything in place, and the burner phone safely locked in a drawer, I sat back, trying to squeeze a few pages in before my guest arrived. It took another fifteen minutes for a knock to be heard on the door. “Come in,” I called, and the door opened, revealing Megan. Honestly, I had been expecting her to come wearing a coat, like Camilla did when she was trying to get a recording of me for blackmail. </p><p>But instead, Megan was wearing a white shirt that was unbuttoned halfway down, enough to reveal her absence of a bra. To accompany it, she wore a red and black plied shirt, far too short to be worn safely outside, even the slightest breeze enough to reveal her deepest secrets, especially if she had followed rest of the orders I had sent. The set was complete with her knee-high black stockings, and to top it all, her red hair was gathered behind her in an innocent ponytail to enhance the image. </p><p>Altogether, she was the Platonic ideal of a hot schoolgirl, one that was willing to get anything to get the grade she deserved, except maybe her homework. I was almost completely sure that she didn’t look as sexy until she reached to my door, where she folded her skirt a few extra times to shorten it, while loosening the constricting grasp of her buttons, but I didn’t say anything. </p><p>“Hello, professor,” she said with an exaggerated gasp, but pulling it much better than Camilla ever could, almost enough to convince me that she was here in her own volition, in the form of a dare that was common in the sorority houses. Only the tightening on the edges of her eyes suggested that it might be anything other than a horny sorority dare. </p><p>“Megan,” I said, leaning back with a smirk. While I would have preferred to play obvious professor, to see just how far she was willing to go for her task, considering my earlier actions, it wouldn’t have been believable. “Considering the way you have dressed, I’m willing to bet that you have reached a decision despite my warnings.” </p><p>It was clear that she wasn’t expecting to be confronted that directly. She froze at the entrance for a moment, the door still open. “Yes,” she managed to murmur after a moment’s despair. </p><p>“Excellent,” I answered. “When, why don’t you close the door and take a seat,” I added. </p><p>She took a deep breath, closed the door, and for good measure, locked it as well, another sign of her deep commitment to her supposed task. “Excellent,” I murmured as she walked towards her seat, while I didn’t bother hiding my gaze as I explored her body. While it wasn’t the first time I was getting a glimpse of her body, it had a different taste when she readied herself for my attention only. </p><p>She managed to gather her wits on the distance between the door and the chair, and sat down slowly. For anyone else, I might have thought that she might try to keep herself from flashing, but I was starting to get a handle of Megan’s reactions, enough to know that she was trying to maximize the impact. Then, after sitting down, she crossed her legs, trying to replicate the most iconic scene of the Basic Instinct. Trying, because she lacked the calm poise and the killer instinct that made the moment in the film enchanting, but other than that, I had no real complaint. With her rather noticeable lack of panties, she was really beautiful. </p><p>“So, Megan,” I murmured, leaning back even more. “You have been really insistent on your urgency to meet, and now, here we are. How can I help you?” </p><p>She raised her head and sighed, like she was trying to put her words in order, but I realized her objective when she pushed her chest forward, further inflated by her deep breath. I licked my lips, examining the way her shirt stretched, particularly in relation to showing the contours of her breasts, bereft from the protection of a bra, however flimsy. “I have a problem, professor,” she murmured, doing her best to sound cute. Unfortunately, she was far too sexy to pull that particular impression effectively. </p><p>“That, I deduced after your tenth mail,” I answered, not bothering to hide my smirk. “Why don’t you tell me exactly what is your problem, and I’ll see whether I will be able to help you.” </p><p>“It’s my grades, professor,” she continued, literally acting out the bare-bones plot of a significant portion of the porn plots. “I’m doing my best, but I’m barely able to scrape a D, but I need at least B+ to maintain a decent average.” </p><p>“And you’re here to ask me for some private tutoring,” I continued, not letting go of my smirk “Unfortunately, it isn’t possible with everything else I  have to deal with, but I’m sure I noticed several young men with good grades that would be more than willing to help you.” </p><p>Her fake-innocence flickered for a moment, replaced by annoyance, before she schooled her expression once more. “I wish that was possible, professor, but unfortunately, I have too many other commitments I have to handle due to my extracurriculars, contributing to the school a lot.” </p><p>“And…” I said when she stopped for a couple of seconds, inviting her to continue. </p><p>She took a deep breath as she brought her hands together, wringing them nervously. At first, I thought it was a natural reaction, another crack in her role, but only after she pulled her hands away, I noticed that she had positioned her hands rather high, directly above her highest button that was unopened. I noticed that, because as she pulled her hands away, her cleavage expanded in an attention-grabbing way. “I was hoping that maybe I could do some extracurricular assignments for you to get some extra points.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said as she pushed her chest forward with another nervous breath, straining the limits of her shirt to keep her treasures hidden. “I might be amenable to that,” I answered. “But why don’t you show me what you have in mind.” </p><p>“I can, professor, but are you sure you can handle it,” she answered. “I don’t want risk your heart giving out midway.” I nodded, but noticed her hand reaching for the small bag she had, pressing to something. She was considerably better than Camilla in keeping her move hidden, though not enough to avoid my gaze. I didn’t let it bother me, as I had access to her computer, therefore all of her cloud accounts. Erasing or corrupting any record she took would be trivial once I’m back to my room. </p><p>“That’s a risk I’m willing to take,” I answered. “However, you need to work really nice to get a B or above. I’m willing to give up to C+ for effort, but for anything more, you need to impress me,” I said, still keeping my levity. Then, I added one more word, but letting my sharp side to the surface. “Understood?” </p><p>As I expected, she was suddenly frozen at my last word, but a shake of her head later, she was ready to dismiss it, probably thinking that she had imagined it. A big mistake, as it was the most accurate glimpse she had to my personality, but not a surprising one considering her lack of survival instinct, something a rich, spoiled girl would never need. “Of course, professor,” she murmured in conviction. “You’re going to be very satisfied with the results.” </p><p>She untangled her legs, giving me another interesting glimpse before she slowly stood up, leaning forward to ensure her cleavage had the maximum impact. Then, with a little sexy twirl, she turned her back, her bottom losing its protection as her skirt flew. Then, she leaned, which rode her skirt even higher, giving me a full glimpse of her body. </p><p>Clearly, she was hoping that the sight of her naked booty would distract me enough to miss her fiddling with her small handbag, or the fact that her phone was peeking through the corner, with its camera facing towards me. Not a bad assumption, as her bottom was perfectly toned, betraying the hours spent in the gym to sculpt it to perfection. And since I already handled the risk of her making a recording, I had no problems acting obvious. </p><p>She was much more careful with her next turn, with her hands taking a hold of her skirt, preventing it from flying like the previous time, trying to maintain the mystery. “Professor,” she said, bringing her finger on her lips, smirking slightly as she leaned forward. “Would you mind changing seats,” she said, pointing at the small, two-person couch at the corner. “I think you will appreciate my efforts more without a barrier.” </p><p>“I like the confidence,” I said, and before standing up, stuffed a couple of condoms in my pocket just in case. If the things escalated to that point, not losing any more time might be strategic. “Let’s just hope that you will be able to back it up.” </p><p>Questioning her capabilities managed to spark her anger, which I had no problems with. From what I saw, she had a tendency to be singleminded when angry, which would make her miss any inconsistency in my behavior. More importantly, I had my filling of docile sex thanks to my professor and my new assistant, and some rough, combative sex was just what I needed to bring some variety. </p><p>Still, I was surprised when I was walking next to her, she grabbed my arm, and pushed me in a sitting position. I chose not to resist, curious how far she would go in her riled up state. After all, the last few days had been quite difficult for her, and she had been deprived of her favorite toy. </p><p>Without resistance, I hit the couch harshly, and she didn’t lose any time before putting her hands on my shoulder, pinning me in place. She leaned in, and while her cleavage created a captivating view, I was more interested in the angry flames in her eyes. They would be doused appropriately at the end of the day, but for now, I let her hold the reins. </p><p>“Are you ready, professor,” she said, stretching the last word mockingly. I nodded, and she didn’t lose any time before straddling my lap, pulling my head to her cleavage. A bit hurried, I thought, mentally marking her down. I could see how it would impress a young football player or give heart-attack to a nerdy boy, but I wasn’t in the same group.</p><p>“Go ahead, Miss Collins, impress me,” I said as I leaned slightly forward, bringing our faces closer that one last push would be enough to connect our lips, but I avoided that. It was too intimate to support my objectives for the day. </p><p>“As you wish, professor,” she answered as she squirmed on my lap until she was directly above my shaft, in full erection thanks to the anticipation. It was amusing to watch the way her eyes grew as she moved forward, acquainting herself with its size. She let out a surprised gasp, and I smiled smugly, showing her that I caught the reason for her momentary lapse. “Don’t get cocky,” she answered sharply, trying to re-establish her authority. “I was just surprised that you didn’t have a micro-penis, you seem like the type.” </p><p>I didn’t bother to respond to her poor attempt to rile me up to balance the situation. Instead, I leaned back, making myself as comfortable as it was possible on the uncomfortable cushions of my guest couch. “Are you going to start, or are you waiting for an invitation?” I asked. </p><p>My dismissive tone sparked her to action. She tightened her hold on my shoulders, started rocking her hips rapidly. Admittedly, it was quite enjoyable especially thanks to her lack of panties, if a bit amateurish, but I didn’t let my expression to reflect my enjoyment of the situation. </p><p>And it worked just as intended. She kept her eyes on my face, her outrage getting more defined with each passing second. Soon, she stood up with a huff, making me worry that I pushed her too hard and she was scuttling the plan. I wouldn’t have lost a lot, but I didn’t want all my effort to go to waste. But that concern faded when I watched her hands reaching the buttons of her shirt, and instead of moving upward, which was necessary to close them, they moved down, the wrap of her shirt loosening. </p><p>When she turned to face him once more, her shirt was completely unbuttoned, and parted enough to give a vision of her flat stomach. Even better, her breasts were mostly on display, her nipples barely hidden by her shirt, a barrier that looked like it was about to fall off with the slightest wind. </p><p>And that wind came in the form of a forward step, showing that she was willing to push to erase the expression of cold amusement off my face. I decided her commitment deserved a reward, and let my expression flare with amusement for a moment before continuing forward. </p><p>Apparently, she thought that my momentary ‘slip’ was really valuable, because she doubled-down on the impression. Her shirt flew away after a few sharp motions, giving me an unobstructed view of her breasts. I waited for her to use the same treatment for her skirt, but instead, she chose to sit on my lap once more, this time her back pressing against my chest, giving her more freedom of movement as she twerked on my lap. </p><p>Then, she did something that reasonably surprised me after twisting her neck to see I had the same slightly amused expression. She grabbed my wrists, and brought my hands on her breasts, giving me explicit permission to touch her. It wouldn’t be gentlemanly to reject such a kind offer, so I sank my fingers into her breasts, testing their firmness once again, this time unburdened by the concern that someone might enter and discover a rather illicit scene between a student and a professor. </p><p>I would have liked to leave my mark on the pale skin of her neck, attractively wrapped by the red strands of her ponytail, but that would have ruined the impression I was trying to give. Instead, I let her continue her improvised lapdance while I enjoyed the texture of her breasts. Under my attention, her moans slowly turned from artificial to natural. It was good to see I was starting to get her. </p><p>She kept the position for a few more minutes, though didn’t bother to change position, going for repetition rather than creativity. I guess it was my job as her teacher to educate her about the better way of doing it. Then, she stopped. </p><p>“How was it,” she said as she slipped forward a bit, taking a seat on my knee, her hand slipping through my hair. A nice touch, I had to admit. </p><p>“Barely a C,” I answered without missing a beat. </p><p>“What!” she answered, jumping up her feet, which caused her tits to jiggle attractively. “What do you mean, a C, you bastard.” </p><p>“Well,” I said, raising my hand as I started listing the reasons. “First of all, you were quite repetitive,” I said, folding one of my fingers. “Then, you didn’t even bother to turn on the music before starting to lap dance. Not to mention you limited yourself to dry humping like we’re high school freshman, experimenting for the first time. To sum up, you have a nice body, but there is a significant lack of effort, not to mention I expect more creativity from a woman.” </p><p>For a moment, she just stood frozen, her anger flaring higher and higher. “I’ll show you effort,” she said as she reached down, and for a moment, I couldn’t help but stiffen, but relaxed what she was trying to do. With a sharp pull, she unzipped my pants, and a brief struggle with my belt later, my erection jumped open. </p><p>She fell to her knees in front of me, her eyes fixed on my shaft. “I’m going to show you that I deserve an A,” she murmured as she leaned forward, while I was curious just how far she would go for a slight on her pride… </p><p>I was enthusiastic to discover her limits… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was planning to make a sacrifice to the lady luck, clearly, she was working overtime to make my life fun. Otherwise, why would I found myself sharing a dressing room with a sexy redhead, who was dressed in a sexy corset and fishnets combo, helping her to lace up her boots while getting the prime view under her skirt thanks to her lack of panties. The fact that I had taken the virginity of her sister just hours ago in the same room was the cream on top of the hot chocolate. </p><p>Clearly, answering to that short ad about rental basement was the best idea I had ever had. Not only it allowed me to recover my career, but also gave me access to three very beautiful, and equally inexperienced, women.  </p><p>But I didn’t have much time pondering about the excellence of my situation, not when I could see Nancy’s glistening arousal peeking under her short skirt whenever I raised my eyes, tempting me to dismiss rest of the job and focus on impaling her mercilessly instead, teaching her the dangers of misreading her target. </p><p>In the end, patience won. Not only it would be more convenient to finish the costume set tonight, allowing me to finalize it and share it with the client, but also it would make her think that she was the one that was managing the situation, making her more confident. Teaching her about the correct balance of power would be fun.  </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean a bit of teasing wasn’t allowed, especially when finishing to tie the laces of the first boot conveniently left my hands on the middle of her thigh. It would be a waste if I returned without a little exploration of my own. </p><p>I let my fingers trail upward on her leg, almost negligently, delivering a short but dangerous massage that caused her to tremble softly while it brought my reach dangerously close to her nether lips. A gasp escaped her mouth, but her eyes widened in panic, trying to balance her arousal and the sudden escalation. </p><p>I pulled back before she could say anything, ignoring the opportunity to push forward. No need to scare her prematurely. I moved onto the other boot, my fingers carelessly trailing her skin as I climbed upward, too repetitively to be mistaken for an accident. Not that I needed to masquerade it as an accident. At this point, neither of us had any illusions about how the things were going to end, and the rest was just bargaining about the exact timing and dominance. </p><p>Her next move betrayed her impatience, showing that she wasn’t too far away from surrendering. Her hand on her skirt, which ‘accidentally’ dragged it up, depriving her of the limited cover it provided, giving me the full glimpse of her glistening womanhood, ready for action. I could have pushed my fingers into her without a protest, but that would ruin the game we were playing. Instead, I slowed down, even more, my fingers lingering more and more on her skin, tracing the patterns of her fishnet. Her legs widened further, while a gasp underlined her arousal even further while giving me an even better view. </p><p>In reply, I slowed down even more. </p><p>Frustrated moans started to become a fixture of the moment while I fastidiously avoided eye contact, continuing my task to imprison her leg within the tight grip of the boot, a sharp contrast with the fleeting caresses of my fingers on her leg. From the way her muscles constricted, I could see that the dichotomy was driving her crazy, enhancing her frustrated moans even more. </p><p>It was too soon that the costume was finished, and I pulled back and stood up, much to shock and displeasure of her. I passed her the panties of the costume, which, fortunately, had a knot that allowed them to be tied from the side like a bikini, freeing me from that particular obligation. I wasn’t too far from the edge myself, and I welcomed the reprieve. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said, letting my lips curl into a teasing smirk as I glanced at her furious expression before I turned my back and walked back to my tripod. She was already in front of the backdrop when I turned back, trying to stand in a calm and collected manner, but unable to prevent her sexual frustration from leaking through despite the mask that was on her face. In any other set, it would have been a big problem, but considering the sexiness was the connecting idea for this particular set, it was a godsend. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked, and after a nod, another session started. I had enough good photos after a five-minute stretch, but I deliberately let it continue, as I could see the extended effect of the set on her, and wondered just for how long it would take to drive her crazy. I would have loved to have another costume to drive her even more crazy, but unfortunately, the current one was the last, and I didn’t have anything else lying around that I could claim to be a part of the set. </p><p>“Are we going to continue,” she murmured in annoyance. </p><p>“Just a few more,” I said. “Why don’t you loosen your corset a bit so that we could explore an interesting angle, just to make sure.” </p><p>It was proof of her frustration that she didn’t bother to play slow, or act like she wasn’t able to reach the back of her corset. She reached to her back, showing her flexibility with rapidly unzipping her corset, while her other hand was pressed at the front to prevent it from slipping away. “Is this good,” she gasped invitingly as she turned her back, her skin shining under the spotlights. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I said as I took a few more photos. “That seems to be enough,” I called. While watching her frustration was fun, it was for the best not to push her too much, lest she would prefer the companionship with a toy to finish the day. </p><p>“About time,” she murmured as she turned towards the small dressing room, and let the corset to slip away from her body, displaying her beautiful back in its full glory. Even more impressively, she reached for the string of her panties, and without missing a step, pulled it off, letting them slid on the ground. I just watched, fascinated… </p><p>But my daze wasn’t long-lived. “Are you coming, I still need your help,” she said, once again the smirk back on her face on seeing my shock. “These boots aren’t going to untie themselves.” </p><p>“Coming right up,” I said, and snapped one last photo of the amazing view she was creating before following her. She took a seat once more, and I leaned forward, about to grab her laces, intending to untie them in the slow and sensual way I had tied them. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to realize that I had underestimated the extent of her arousal, a misunderstanding she disabused me of rather violently. I felt a sharp pain in my scalp, and when I realized it was her fingers grabbing my hair, she was already pulling me towards her nether lips, her skirt pulled upwards, her legs parted invitingly.  </p><p>I had considered pulling myself back, not giving an inch to her domineering ways, teaching her who was the master of this game, but then I decided to play along for now. After her patience and diligence, she deserved a reprieve, not to mention flipping the situation after she got used to her position would have been even more fun. </p><p>With that decision made, my tongue darted out, tasting the evidence of her extended arousal. She pressed my head deeper, wordlessly asking me to quicken, and I complied, allowing my lips to join the fray. It didn’t take long for a gasp to escape her mouth, and I continued my task. </p><p>A while later, I decided to spice things up. I put my hands on her inner thighs, forcing her to widen her legs even further, giving myself better access to her lips. My tongue danced on her lips, tracing the edges, but fastidiously avoiding the hotspots. Her answer was another frustrated moan, even as her fingers tightened helplessly, pulling me towards the center of her core. I didn’t resist her pull, but weakened the pressure of my tongue to keep her on the edge, her frustration continuing to plague her. </p><p>A flash of pain passed through me as her fingers tightened around my hair, but I just chuckled softly as her frustrated groan echoed in the room. She was doing an elementary mistake, giving me plenty of clues that my attempts to get her was very effective, which destroyed any chance of her establishing power over me. Well, educating her about the finer points of domination was a part of my tasks, I presumed. </p><p>I kept passively-resisting her attempts to quicken my efforts, pushing her towards the edge of orgasm in a torturous slowness. Though, the desire to monopolize the control wasn’t the only reason. I wanted to change the balance between us before my last push. Before, despite the enjoyment she displayed as I watched her half-naked body with appreciation, she was keen to put a barrier when it came to touching, an attitude that would have cut our fun times short. But by reversing the roles, I have forced her to be the active one to earn those touches, each second of reluctance causing her to force the issue harder. It was like a tug war, and I just needed to let the rope go for her to topple helplessly… </p><p>Unable to get the result she desired, her clumsy attempts to dominate faded into nothingness soon after, replaced by a string of moans, marked with a desperate edge as she unconsciously accepted the futility of her efforts. It was the time for a change of pace, I decided. My tongue landed on her knob, but brushing it much stronger. More importantly, the following brush came much quicker, earning a hiss of surprise. </p><p>Backed up with a frustrated desire, it didn’t take much to push her to the next stage of her arousal. A few quick beats of my tongue, interrupted by occasional hard kisses, a tightening grip on her thighs, and she was shuddering helplessly, her aroma invading my tongue… </p><p>I was already up when her body slackened under the effects of her unexpected orgasm. She lost her balance, but my arms were in place to arrest her fall. I couldn’t let her fall, not when I had such interesting plans on her. </p><p>“Stephen,” she murmured when we were halfway to my bed, the possible activities in our destination vivid enough to penetrate into her consciousness even when it was blanked out with pleasure. “Where are we going?” </p><p>“To finish what we started,” I said, but quickly followed with the next sentence when I felt her stiffen in my arms at the suggestion. “But maybe we should stop, as it seems that it’s all you can handle,” I added, watching her words die instantly. Pride was an extremely useful tool, especially when the target was already wounded, just like Nancy was after her most recent failure, and the confusion that dominated her mind as she battled the aftershocks of her climax didn’t help any. </p><p>I carried her to my bed, and lay her face first so that her bubble-butt was pointing at me, and she was yet to gather enough energy to shift her position. But instead of delving to her inviting depths, I reached for the drawer and pulled a couple of choice items. I had other plans. </p><p>“What are you waiting for,” she whispered, her excitement not reduced by her half-hearted attempt of concealment. </p><p>“Preparing to take your virginity,” I said even as I squeezed a generous dollop of lube to my hand. Then, I threw the tube on the bed, in a distance easy to reach, and my clean hand shifted to my belt, freeing my shaft from its tight prison. Then, I covered it with a thick layer of lube. </p><p>“You’re a bit late for that,” she answered, managing to gather enough energy for an amused chuckle. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, crouching next to her and using my free hand to push the skirt off her bottom, exposing the enticing view of her butt. I brought my lube covered finger to her crack, dragging it until it touched her puckered hole, invitingly tight. She stiffened and I smirked. “But something in your reaction tells me that I still have the opportunity.” </p><p>“You cannot-” started to say, but the rest of her sentence disappeared into a cry, a mixture of pain and surprise, when I forced my finger into her puckered hole, first two digits into her virgin hole. </p><p>“The evidence disagrees,” I said. “However, we can always stop if you think you can’t handle.” I met with only a determined silence, so I continued to push bit by bit until my finger had disappeared inside her, a motion that she managed to stay silent in its duration. But the motion of pulling it back, faster than it went in, managed to break through her resistance, and her pained cry echoed in the room. I used my free hand to pat her bottom comfortingly, giving her a second to relax before repeating the motion once more… </p><p>Soon, her tight hole adapted to the girth of one finger, so a second one joined the fray, then the third and fourth, all the while my other hand teasing her clit repeatedly to quicken her second climax. Though I doubted it was necessary. Despite her pained cries, she was yet to ask me to stop, her rising excitement getting more obvious with each repeat. </p><p>“It’s the time for the main course,” I said after pulling my hand away, and after a small break where I put on a condom to maintain cleanliness, with a dollop of lubricant to ensure smooth access, my crown pressed against her gaping hole, one that was about to be invaded by my rather considerable girth. </p><p>“Wait-” she hissed in panic when she felt the change, but once again, the rest of her statement disappeared when I pushed my well-lubricated shaft inside her. Another cry left her mouth instead, the enjoyment dwarfing the pain. Assuming her earlier objection was dead, I continued pushing inside her slowly until I was half-buried inside her. </p><p>I pulled back, just a bit faster, then impaled again in the same torturous slowness, not wanting to tear anything before she got used to my presence. After all, the night was long, and it would be unfortunate to stop the lesson because of an unfortunate mishap. “You were saying something,” I asked, but only received a petulant silence in return. If it was Nicole, I would have reminded her about my preference for Dprompt answer in the form of a stiff spank, but I had a feeling that Nancy wouldn’t react as meek as Nicole, even when I was half-buried in her hole, unexplored until moments ago. </p><p>Her stubborn silence turned out to be short-lived. After a couple of minutes of slowness, I picked up speed, each push delivering me deeper into her, and her cries rose proportionally. Soon, every time I impaled her was birthing another beautiful cascade of sound. I could feel myself closing on another arousal, but didn’t want to be the first one there, so my fingers disappeared into her slit once more, pecking rapidly to push her through the finish line before me. </p><p>I was successful in my efforts, but not by a huge margin, the tightening of her puckered hole as the orgasm hit her was enough to cover the distance between us. I filled her with my seed, glad about the lack of risk. </p><p>I was feeling the bite of exhaustion as I pulled back, but that didn’t prevent me from getting rid of the condom while my manhood returned back to life with record speed, too impatient to taste Nancy’s remaining hole. This time, I didn’t bother to give a warning as I slipped inside her hole, and another alarmed gasp escaped her mouth. But she didn’t make a move to escape, far too happy with the situation she was under to try doing anything else. </p><p>But her exhaustion didn’t prevent her from letting out a disappointed gasp when I pulled out. Luckily for her, stopping wasn’t exactly my plan. I grabbed her hair and pulled, reversing our earlier situation, forcing her to a doggie position. She was quick to understand my intention, and raised herself on all fours, and I slid back inside her. The next several minutes, or maybe half an hour, was filled with merciless pounding and boundless moans, culminating in a glorious moment where I was barely able to pull out, spraying her back with my seed. </p><p>I had the energy to continue, but a glance at Nancy’s face revealed that the pleasure from the double-penetration, combined with the extended foreplay, was enough to exhaust her completely. “That was a nice session,” I said as I gently caressed her shoulder. “Now, why don’t you go upstairs and get a bit of sleep, and maybe a shower as well, sweetie,” I said. “You deserve some rest after such a successful session.” </p><p>It was another evidence of her exhaustion when she just nodded rather than throwing an annoyed glare against my patronizing attitude. After a brief struggle, she stood up, and started walking towards the stairs with a distinct limp on her steps. Amusingly, she either forgotten the exact details of her house, or was too exhausted to care, because she didn’t bother to change, climbing the stairs, half-naked and stained with my cum. And despite all the risk it contained, I didn’t bother to ask her to change. Its thrill was too delicious to deny. </p><p>But it was a truly glorious sight that deserved to be immortal, so I quickly dashed to my camera and took several photos, each sexier than the last. She didn’t say anything, but her sudden shift in posture, enhancing the view, suggested that she heard the click of the camera, and was enjoying the recording. It went rather well, I thought as she disappeared at the doorway… </p><p><strong>      *****       *****       *****       *****       ***** </strong></p><p>The next morning, I went to the breakfast despite my bone-weary exhaustion, a feeling I would have hated if it wasn’t for its amazing source. The breakfast was an interesting affair, almost comical if it wasn’t for how tense it was. My dear housemates were silent throughout the morning, doing their best to hide their limps from each other, though their efforts were destined to fail after yesterday’s activities. Luckily, none of them dared to ask why the others were limping, afraid to receive the same question in return. </p><p>Fear was interesting, I decided. Allied with preconceptions about the normality, it prevented them from coming to a simple conclusion, that maybe the reason of others’ limp was the same with theirs, but they didn’t, or so I assumed. Even if I was wrong, I wouldn’t be the first suspect, because, for all they know, I’m just a distant tenant for the others… </p><p>Still, that didn’t chance the fact that I was in a tightrope, a mistake, and it was back to the search for me. Not exactly an intimidating threat, if it wasn’t for the fact that it would also mean a lack of access to the three beautiful women I shared the house with. An unbearable proposition, considering all the things I wanted to do with them, and to them. </p><p>My tenancy was shaping up to be a fun one… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had enough time to finish my sandwich, change my clothes, and pour a glass of scotch for myself before Camilla’s arrival. When I heard the knock, I was sitting on my couch, wearing a pair of shorts and a loose t-shirt, already half-drained my glass. “The door is open, just come in,” I called as I shuffled in my seat, trying to get even more comfortable. I heard the door closing, followed by the distinctive click of the lock. Smart, I thought. Camilla had no mysteries about what awaited her here, and if her willingness to isolate herself was any indicator, she had no problem with it as well. Apparently, proving to her that I had the tools to tame her tormentor went a long way to earn her acceptance. </p><p>Despite that, it wasn’t hard to detect the hesitancy in her steps as she walked into the room, unsurprisingly, still wearing the same clothes she had been wearing in Megan’s room, equally successful in hiding her amazing figure in real life. It was good that I was prepared to address that horrible problem after greetings were out of the way. “How are you, my sweet assistant,” I asked while shook my glass softly, filling my nose with the sharp but delicious smell of high-quality scotch while the amber liquid danced in the glass in a circular motion. </p><p>“I’m well enough, professor,” she said obediently, only the slightest hitch in her tone as she stood straight, her wringing hands betraying her stress. That, and the way she avoided my gaze studiously. </p><p>“You should be,” I said with a smirk, unable to hide the signs of pride of a job well done. “Did you enjoy your gift?”</p><p>On her face, confusion battled as she tried to decide between admitting her enjoyment or trying to play it off, the former she only thought possible because she was unaware of my real-time video feed, giving me a prime view of her sudden bout of dominance. I hoped that she didn’t get too addicted to the experience, as rest of the night was going to be running under the theme of submissiveness instead. </p><p>After a lengthy panic, she simply nodded, assuming accurately that hiding her enjoyment served no purpose. “Excellent,” I said. “Is there anything that wasn’t for your enjoyment, or something we can add for the next session. Handcuffs? Or maybe you would like to drag our favorite redheaded beauty around campus in chains like a badly-behaved puppy.” The sudden excitement on her face at the last mention surprised me, and laughter escaped my lips. </p><p>“Do you think something like that is possible,” she asked, overwhelmed by her sudden burst of excitement enough to forget her caution. </p><p>“Maybe, but certainly not in anytime close,” I answered, slightly misleading her. Forcing Megan into a desperation enough to consider that wasn’t an impossibility, but it was unnecessarily risky. It would either break her fully, or cause her to lash out, and neither was ideal for long term success. “But let’s focus on the present for now. In particular, the payment for today’s little gift.” </p><p>I examined her face carefully, trying to get a sense of her mood after my demand. Her intensifying blush was not a surprise, but it wasn’t enough to hide the hint of excitement underneath. It made me quite happy, as it could have been revulsion or fear just as easily. It seemed that my luck truly recovered after that disastrous heist attempt. </p><p>I didn’t need to say anything before her hands grabbed the hem of her blouse, preparing to pull it off before I stopped her with a gesture. She stopped instantly, her expression confused, trying to understand if she had made a mistake or misunderstood my intentions. “You have new clothes waiting for you in the bathroom,” I told her. “Why don’t you be a doll and change into them before we move into the main event. Sooner you can get rid of those abominations that hide your beauty, the better.” </p><p>She froze for a moment before nodding, then turned her back to me, her steps flickering, indecisive. I could see her hands shaking as she tried to process my new order, afraid of what she was going to find waiting for her in the bathroom. An unnecessary fear, as there was no scary toy waiting for her there, only some alternative clothing that I picked up for her beautiful figure. </p><p>Contrary to my expectations, I hadn’t had to wait for long before she stepped out of the bathroom, clad in the gifts I had picked for her while I was shopping for Amelia’s gift. I said nothing, just watched hungrily as she slowly walked towards me. I took note of the subtle sway that was absent from her steps just moments ago, suggesting, despite her raging blush, she was enjoying the image change she had just gone through. </p><p>I waited until she stood in front of me to show my excitement. “Marvelous,” I exclaimed even as I made a show of dragging my gaze from bottom to top in agonizing slowness. Her feet were naked, discounting black fishnet socks I had picked for her, climbing up to the middle of her thighs, which had failed to do their task of covering her legs rather spectacularly. My gaze climbed upwards to meet with her plied skirt, red and black adding a splash of color to otherwise monochrome ensemble, which was straining to do its job to cover her bottom even when she was standing perfectly still, barely enough to hide the fact that whether she was also wearing the thong I had picked for her.</p><p>After the skirt, I had met with a large expanse of skin as I ‘carelessly’ forgot to pick a top for her to wear, leaving her thin, lacy, strapless bra as the only piece to protect the modesty of her voluptuous chest, a task that it was horribly failing due to the rather large size and the incredible perkiness of her breasts. All told, they were just one wrong move away from escaping their alluring prison. </p><p>I didn’t bother saying anything, just bent my raised finger inward, and she took a step towards me. She was about to add a second step when I raised my hand, stopped her, then my finger moved in an approximation of a circle. Despite her hesitance, she followed my command and twirled. She was slow in her turn, trying to prevent an accident, but it was a vain attempt. Her twirl,  even in its agonizing slowness, was enough to make her skirt rise, which was enough to reveal the answer of my earlier question about her thong, positively of course. And to make things even better, her thong was failing in its task of covering her body worse than her bra was doing. “Simply exquisite,” I murmured. Then, in a sudden display of mercy, I added. “You seem tired, why don’t you take a seat.” </p><p>She directed herself towards the empty space next to me until I patted my lap, informing her about my alternative views about what constituted an acceptable seat, and she changed her direction. Her blush intensified even further, but she didn’t delay while she took her new seat. She made an effort to stay away from the rather obvious tent in my shorts, courtesy of the amazing show she had been displaying. Which would not be borne, I decided as I sent a disappointed glare to her. She tried to avoid my gaze, but after a warning flick to her knee, she slid closer, directly above my length, earning a moan of satisfaction from me as her warmth infused me despite the layers of cloth that separated us. She was even more excited that her face suggested. </p><p>I decided to leverage our closeness further, and wrapped my arm around her naked midsection in a casual gesture. “So, tell me. What’s your first impression of your new clothing. Are they to your liking?” </p><p>She shuffled uncomfortably upon being put to spot like that, a move that only made my smile widen even further. She didn’t answer, so I put my finger to her spine, leveraging the convenience of her naked back. I dragged my up, causing her to shiver sexily. “Yes,” she murmured. “They are beautiful.” </p><p>“And would you like to walk outside like this,” I asked, even as my finger continued its journey towards the clasp of her bra. </p><p>“No!” she answered panickedly, trying to jump away from my lap, which my arm prevented. </p><p>“Calm down,” I said even as I patted her back gently. “Don’t worry, I have no intention of sharing you, even the beautiful vision of your body to this extent. You’re my assistant, after all.” I chuckled before continuing. “Still, tell me how do you feel while dressed in your new clothes.” </p><p>It took a while for her to answer, and it required some coaxing in the form of my finger, moving on the path that her spine created, causing her to shiver helplessly. She started squirming on my lap, which worked excellently to enhance the pleasure I was feeling. “It feels … good,” she murmured soon after. I wasn’t sure whether she was talking about the clothes, or the result of her squirming. Or maybe both.  </p><p>“Give me some details,” I said while I put my hand on her thigh, to the exact spot her fishnet socks came to an end. It was a casual gesture that would go unnoticed as habitual intimacy in a situation less sexually charged, but her subtle shiver left no doubt about whether she understood its full significance. </p><p>“It’s different,” she murmured, which turned into a moan halfway in as I dragged my hand upward her leg. “I felt naked, no worse than naked, signaling things that I shouldn’t be thinking about. I felt like a stripper.” A deep breath interrupted her explanation. “But then, that feeling started to excite me, like I enjoyed being a stripper. Is it wrong to feel that way…” </p><p>The question, taken in its face value, seemed deep, but the soft moan that followed all but admitted that she was just trying to rationalize her enjoyment. And I was quite happy to help with that aim. “Of course not,” I whispered as my hand disappeared under her skirt. “You’re just trying to find your true self, and there is nothing wrong with some experimentation with your looks.” My fingers found her bountiful booty, and she shivered. “Actually, since you liked them so much, maybe we should go shopping together tomorrow to pick a few more items, maybe something that would better fit your needs.” </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer, but it turned into a sharp gasp, shortly followed by a lingering moan when I used the opportunity to lean forward and plant a lingering kiss on her neck, followed by a soft nibble. Her hand found my neck, preparing to push me back in reflex. It seemed that her brief foray as a discount-dominatrix ingrained her with some unwelcome reflex. Normally I would have punished such a move harshly, but with Camilla’s fragile confidence, it would have harmed more than helping, forcing me to search for alternative options. </p><p>Luckily, with her current state of dress, I wasn’t exactly starved for options. With a swift move, I leaned down to catch the edge of her strapless bra with my teeth. Meanwhile, my fingers found the hook of her bra, rendering it useless in one smooth movement. So, when she pushed me back, she inadvertently became instrumental in getting rid of her bra, leaving her bountiful breasts bereft of any cover. “Excited much,” I said amusedly after I let her bra to drop to the ground. </p><p>“No-” she tried to say, trying to convince me that it had been a mistake. While it would have been fun to listen to her panicked explanation about how it was just a mistake, I had more interesting tasks for her beautiful lips, such as moaning with pleasure. To bring that to reality, I leaned forward and captured her nipple between my teeth, the slightest pressure enough to trigger a helpless gasp.</p><p>Of course, that was just a start. One of my hands moved to her other breasts, gently cupping her sensitive skin before she could raise a word in process, and sinking into her supple flesh proved enough to convert her gasp into a continuous chain of moans. Emboldened, I squeezed her breast, adding just the right amount of pain to her tone, something she enjoyed just as much if her squirming, too rhythmic to be an escape attempt. </p><p>My other hand was roaming freely over her body with her complete acceptance, and I was more than willing to test her limits. Considering I had been sucking her breasts rather enthusiastically, there was only one spot remaining that might convince her to put a resistance. My free hand, which was gently caressing her belly at the moment, started to slip lower. </p><p>A transition over the area that was covered by her skirt, my fingers were on her legs, enjoying the plumpness of her thighs. An instant later, my fingers reversed direction, taking the same route of arrival, but with one major difference, tunneling into the confines of her skirt rather than going above it. Soon, they were in the sweet spot between her legs, the coverage of her silky underwear might as well not exist in terms of limiting the sensation. </p><p>The rapid increase in her moans was not a surprise, luckily, she had enough presence of mind to modulate them just enough not to alarm the neighbors with the help of her hands, pressing against her lips to suppress the excess. And with my mouth occupied with the task of leaving a trail of hickeys over her breast, there was a distinct lack of speaking, which made the moment even better. </p><p> It didn’t take long for until her last fortress of resistance started to crumble, and soon, her surrender was complete, marked by the changing movement of her hips, adding a circular motion, exact opposite to the movements of my fingers, causing friction that enhanced her pleasure even further. With her resistance abandoned, her desire was replaced with an attempt to drive towards a climax as quickly as possible. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had no intention of giving her such a quick escape. She needed to earn her release. I pulled back without warning, leaving her to blink in confusion. “Stand up,” I ordered. She looked at me, still trying to process the sudden transformation. “Do I need to repeat my order?” I asked in a tone that could be categorized as menacing, and she jumped up to her feet, her chest tumbled impressively thanks to her sudden movement. </p><p>I could see a burst of panic dominating her demeanor as she tried to understand her mistake that led to a sudden shift. “Relax,” I said to her while I patted her leg comfortingly, though, in her aroused state, it was just another touch of enjoyment. “You have done nothing wrong. I just decided to call a stop to our little warm-up exercise. It’s finally the time for the main course.” </p><p>“Ma-main course,” she repeated, her nervousness painfully apparent once more, enough to momentarily drown her arousal. Luckily, her arousal was not far from the surface. </p><p>“Yes, the main course,” I said. “You didn’t think that we will be dry-humping all-night-long like high school students, did you? Now, be a good girl and remove my shorts.” </p><p>She was far too deep in our deal to ignore a direct order like it, not that I thought she actually wanted to do so with her arousal hidden under the surface. Still, her movements were slow and her hesitancy was clear as she leaned forward, each passing second bringing her amazing breasts closer to my face. Only thanks to my willpower I was able to pull myself back from sinking my teeth into them, to finally leave a hickey deep enough not to recover in a day. </p><p>Unaware of my thoughts, she was doing her best to avoid my gaze as her fingers hooked at the waist of my shorts, her grip very fragile. I raised my hips to allow her to pull uninterrupted. She met with another surprise when she pulled them down, instead of meeting with the view of my boxers like she had been expecting, her gaze was suddenly filled with a devouring view of my naked shaft. “So big,” she murmured dazedly as she paused, her eyes moving up and down as if she was trying to convince herself it wasn’t an illusion. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie,” I said, spurring her to panicked action once more. “We have a lot of things to do, and at this pace, we’ll be still on it at dusk.” Suitably warned, her movements quickened and she completed her task in a couple of seconds, leaving my lower half-naked. With that, there was only one barrier left between us and fun times. “Good, now, get rid of your thong. I want unrestricted access.” </p><p>She was even slower as her hands slid under her skirt, her legs crossed slightly in a poor attempt to hide her wetness. I let it slide, more interested in the way her underwear moved downward, barely slowed down by her fishnet, until it met with the ground. “Done,” she murmured. She stood up, her arms on the side, trusting her skirt to cover her slit, which it barely managed to do, and only when she was standing completely still. </p><p>“Now, take your seat,” I ordered, watching her face carefully for any sign of rebelliousness. On that, she managed to surprise me pleasantly and started moving with almost no delay. She sat on my lap, but carefully avoided sitting on my erection, which I allowed. I wanted to play with her a bit more before the final move. </p><p>I pushed her skirt out of the way with a negligent swipe and sank my fingers into her plump bottom, enjoying the shapely softness of her flesh in a roughness that contrasted with my earlier soft touches, but she was suitably aroused to not to make a big deal of it. I continued my aggressive massage for a while before pulling her close, and she suddenly found herself above my length, her wet lips leaving a delicious trail on it, from bottom to top. “Excellent,” I murmured, enjoying the sensation she had left in her tracks. </p><p>I watched her as she froze due to her new seating arrangement. It wasn’t the first time she was taking this particular seat, but apparently, that wasn’t enough to prevent a small panic attack she experienced. Luckily, that panic attack proved to be short-lived, and she started to move up and down over my shaft in her own volition, hesitant at first, but quickly picking up speed until she was dancing over my shaft up and down with an increasing fervor that burnt up her hesitation. </p><p>This time, it was me that had to struggle to keep my moans of appreciation in, as the last thing I needed was her to get a big head about her impact. Luckily, I had a better tool than my hands to use as a gag. I leaned down to latch her amazing breasts, simultaneously suppressing my need to moan rather loudly while creating the same need for her. </p><p>I was dying to ask her about how she was feeling, curious about how she would react when she was forced to commentate on the shameful actions she was conducting. I was willing to bet that she was going to blush adorably as she stammered, but failing to come up with a coherent explanation. But this time, I decided to forgo that in favor of examining her increasing rush of pleasure. I was too enthusiastic about the next step to actually delay in the current position. </p><p>Just like the previous times, all it took was a gesture to make her stop despite her obvious display of pleasure. “It’s time for the actual payment,” I said with a smirk. She looked at me questioningly, but didn’t actually ask for it. “You know what it is,” I commented, and she nodded in a surprising display of calmness despite her barely restrained excitement. At that moment, I was happy that Megan wasn’t into play with toys, which was the only reason Camilla’s virginity was intact, incidentally giving me an excellent opportunity to cement my position for her. </p><p>She took a deep breath, and nodded resolutely. In response, I pulled my hands away from her body. Grabbing her hips and impaling her would be very simple at this point, but I wanted her to surrender her virginity without direct involvement from my end. I want her to be completely aware of what was going on in there.  </p><p>She raised herself, and I prepared myself in anticipation, but instead of lowering herself, she reached for the clasp of her skirt, and pulled it loose. That surprised me. I was expecting her to rely on its cover as a psychological crutch, dispelling it like that took more confidence than I had thought she possessed. Still, it wasn’t worthy of a comment, so I focused on watching her instead. </p><p>I had been thinking that as she pushed through that monumental step, her submissiveness would be the main factor, but much to my surprise, there was hungry excitement that was dancing behind her eyes, stronger than any other emotions, suggesting that maybe I had been underestimating her. For how much, I was hungry to learn.  </p><p>She said nothing as she lowered herself on my shaft, her lower lips wrapping around my crown. I couldn’t help but moan in excitement as her warmth infused my skin. Her lips parted open, mirroring my pleasure, tempting me to catch them in a searing kiss that would blow her mind. But I kept back, not wanting to blur the significance of the moment. </p><p>I kept my gaze on her eyes as she slowly lowered herself. My crown disappeared between her wet lips. Her expression started to strain as her virgin hole tried to accommodate my girth, but that did nothing to dampen her anticipation, spiking as she moved deeper and deeper. In a primal part of herself, she understood that in a moment, everything was going to change… </p><p>She came to a sudden stop the moment I felt the presence of a barrier, cutting my way towards ecstasy. She looked at me questioningly, trying to process her situation one last time. Whatever she must be searching for, she found, because her resolution steeled as she pushed herself down, a soft gasp escaped her mouth as she surrendered her virginity. </p><p>Even more surprisingly, she didn’t stop her descent, and continued to devour my shaft until it was halfway in. There, she stopped, her physical limits preventing her from continuing. But she wasn’t nothing if she wasn’t stubborn. She pulled herself up quickly, and pushed herself down just as quick, causing a warm sensation of pleasure to spread over my shaft while she overcame her restrictions to push even deeper.  </p><p>Such a conviction deserved its reward, I decided as I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a heated kiss, catching her in surprise with my sudden intimacy. My tongue jumped to the fray a moment later, boosting her already burning flames of desire into a roaring inferno. Her lips were quick to reply, trying to follow my rhythm in an unfamiliar tango. </p><p>Her hips hadn’t lost much time before starting to move once again, up and down, hesitant at first, slowly picking up speed with each repeat as she started to get used to my presence, though her tightness was still phenomenal. She was clumsy, but her enthusiasm was more than enough to cover for it. </p><p>Soon, she was grinding on my lap with a reckless abandon, so I decided to give her another reward. My hands started to roam over her body, exploring her body, finding more and more sensitive spots. Then, one of my hands slid over her breasts, circling around her nipples to boost her arousal further. </p><p>With everything that had happened to her earlier, it wasn’t a big surprise when she suddenly stopped, her grinding replaced by quakes of an orgasm, big enough to push her towards the unconsciousness. </p><p>That wouldn’t do, I decided as I grabbed her hips to pin them in place, in a point suitably above my hips to allow the delivery of a consistent assault, in the same rhythm of a jackhammer, breaking her orgasmic haze. I kept the pace for a minute until I was on the edge as well. “Ready yourself,” I said with a self-satisfied tone, warning her of my impending release. </p><p>“Not inside!” she exclaimed, but she lacked the energy to actually pull away from my grip. I pulled her hips lower, depositing my full length inside her before I started spraying her insides. </p><p>There was a unique satisfaction in filling up a naive girl that was a virgin just moments ago, even her expression of horror enhancing my enjoyment. For a moment, I let the silence to stretch, while in her, I could feel my shaft coming back to life. “Don’t worry, I have a couple of after-night pills that would prevent any accident,” I said, consoling her about the risk.</p><p>“Really?” she asked, her fears lessened. </p><p>I nodded. “And since we solved that, there is nothing preventing us from truly celebrating your important milestone,” I said even as I gripped her waist, and threw her on the couch, her legs open invitingly…</p>",

    "content": "<p>My mood was impeccably good as I turned on my computer. Why wouldn’t it should be good, I thought. After all, I had just returned from a fruitful trip with a sexy brunette, who had a rather impressive reaction to adrenaline, and to make things even better, I was about to teach a stark lesson in discipline to my most unruly student with the help of my newly conscripted assistant. </p><p>All was well. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in satisfaction as I opened up the program that allowed me to hijack Megan’s computer, and her vision filled my screen. Just a glance was enough for my pants to tighten despite Amelia’s best efforts to drain me earlier. Megan looked really impressive, wearing nothing but a fluffy white bathrobe, the crimson of her hair contrasting nicely with its brightness. The fact that she was pacing the room restlessly just made the things better. To her knowledge, she was away from any prying eyes in her room, so she didn’t bother to keep her robe fastened during her movement, which had loosened enough to create an impressive valley between her breasts, creating a cleavage that would make people crash with excitement. </p><p>I kept my focus on the screen, doing my best to etch the memory into my mind. While I took a recording for the purposes of archiving, there was a certain unique touch that was a certain magic in the original viewing of such an excellent movie. </p><p> But as much as I enjoyed watching her restless but sexy walk, things needed to start rolling. I sent a message to Camilla, ordering her to move into the nest five minutes while I moved to the kitchen, preparing myself a delicious tuna sandwich to recover some of the energy I had lost. </p><p>When I moved back to my desk, my phone was in my hand once more, but this time, I had a different recipient in mind. ‘Good evening, dear leader,’ I wrote, punctuated by a smiling face, once again using the mystery identity of a sorority sister. </p><p>Megan flinched as her phone rumbled, and she was reticent as she reached for her phone. From the way she blanched the moment she checked the screen, my message, or rather, a message from her mysterious sorority sister, was the last thing she wanted. But, she needed to learn that wishes were not reality. Luckily, she had a selfless teacher like me that was willing to work overtime to teach her that lesson.</p><p>‘What do you want,’ she wrote back in return. ‘I have done what you asked, isn’t it enough.’ From her expression, it was easy to see that she wasn’t hopeful that her poor attempt of subterfuge would work, but she tried it anyway. I had to admit, she could be really decisive when the situation demanded. </p><p>‘Really, you call today a success?’ I have written back. ‘My friends had a different view of the day. From what they say, the professor barely reacted to whatever you were trying to sell.’</p><p>‘There’s a reason for that. I haven’t done much during the class, but I stayed behind after the class to take the revenge,’ she answered, desperately trying to reframe the situation in a convincing way. Unlucky for her, she didn’t know she was trying to manipulate someone with first-hand knowledge of the situation.  </p><p>‘Share them, then,’ I wrote back, too amused to act like I bought her excuse even for a moment.</p><p>‘Share what?’ was her dumbfounded reply. </p><p>‘The photos you took as evidence, of course,’ I countered. Megan’s expression of shock was truly delicious, her finger hovering above the screen in indecision. She collapsed on her bed, her expression marred with worry, but I had to admit, I was more interested with the widening gap in front of her robe, giving me a glimpse of her nipple before she absentmindedly fixed it. ‘You took at least one photo, right?’ I sent another message, almost a minute later, giving her worry just enough time to peak. </p><p>Emotions cycled on her face before stopping in determination, and she wrote an answer. ‘I wasn’t able to take any, my battery was dead because of all the messaging we did during the class. But believe me, he was a true mess when I left.’ she wrote back, throwing one last Hail Mary pass before admitting defeat. </p><p>‘Really?’ I wrote back. ‘So, explain to me why he was very composed when he left the classroom while you left it a couple minutes later, with a red face and trembling legs.’ Well, technically, I didn’t know how she looked while she was leaving the classroom, but at this point, it was a safe bet to take. Even if she had managed to gather herself during her exit, I had trouble imagining her reversing the argument based on that fact. </p><p>Her expression of total defeat contributed to my erection almost as much as her sexy breasts and her lean body. ‘You knew from the beginning!’ she wrote accusingly. </p><p>‘Of course I did, my dear leader. Unlike you, I take my responsibilities, even self-assigned ones, very seriously. I was there in the corridor, observing your defeated retreat. I was just curious how long you were going to flab helplessly before sinking.’ At that point, I lost my ability to keep my snickering inside. Luckily, I was alone, so I had no obligation to keep my voice down. </p><p>‘Now what,’ she wrote, her curt reply trying to convey a rebelliousness that was absent from her face or from her body. Defiant to the last, I commented in appreciation.  </p><p>‘It’s time for punishment, of course,’ I informed her. ‘Luckily for you, I just saw your favorite toy passing the hallway, which means we can experiment today without something a bit more substantial than self-spanking.’</p><p>And just like that, alarm joined back to her face. ‘What do you mean,’ she wrote. </p><p>‘Simple, tonight, you’re going to explain to your toy that you have a different game in mind, and she’ll become the vessel which I will punish you through. I’m going to write tasks of punishment to you, and your little sexy Latina friend will be the one that delivered them after you explain them to her.’</p><p>Pure outrage flared on her face, and for a moment, I had thought that she was going to push back the offer, but it didn’t take long for it to fade, unable to maintain its heat against the cold truth of blackmail. ‘Okay,’ she wrote back, sighing in defeat. </p><p>I could see her surrender, but I wanted to make sure that it worked exactly as I wanted. The last thing I needed was to act in a way that would cause an inconvenient setback in both Megan and Camilla. ‘I’m giving you one last chance, and not asking you to record what’s happening real-time. But that doesn’t mean that you’re isolated from my knowledge. If you don’t follow my directions to the letter, I’ll know. Then we’ll stop playing games and move onto real punishment. And, believe me, you wouldn’t want that. It won’t be as fun as you might expect.’ </p><p>She didn’t write back, but thanks to my real-time video feed from her laptop, her messages weren’t necessary for me to receive an answer. Her defeated expression spelled the answer in sufficient clarity. ‘Keep your phone in easy reach, and have fun,’ I wrote. </p><p>Then, I sent a quick message to Camilla. ‘Feel free to cut loose tonight. It’s my gift,’ I wrote to her. She sent a question mark in return, but I ignored it. She was smart enough to get the message after all the assurances, and if she failed despite all… Well, it wasn’t exactly difficult to switch the situation around and use Megan to deliver a much-deserved punishment.  </p><p>Then, my time to think was over. A knock rang on the door, marking the second stage of my little game. Nancy sighed as she stood up, fixed her robe and walked towards the door, momentarily hiding her from the view due to the camera’s position. A moment later, she was back in the view, accompanied by none other than my new teaching assistant. Camilla was dressed in a knee-length skirt and a loose blouse, both in unappealing pastel colors that covered the treasures that were hidden underneath. I was glad that I had a shortcut for those riches. </p><p>I enjoyed my sandwich while Nancy took a seat on her bed, and invited Camilla to sit next to her. Camilla was reticent despite my earlier assurances, afraid of the fallout in case of failure. I took a mental note to punish her for her lack of faith in our next face to face meeting. Other than that, I watched as Megan started talking with Camilla with a kind manner that contrasted greatly with their earlier relationship. </p><p>It was a smart move, approaching Camilla with kindness, trying to make sure that Camilla wouldn’t go overboard when she moved onto the punishment phase. Unfortunately for her, she was too distracted to notice Camilla’s suspicious glare, nor she was aware that any kindness wouldn’t be attributed to her. I loved playing rigged games where the opponent lost before making the first move. </p><p>While watching Megan trying to prepare Camilla for the next step was amusing, it was nothing compared to the next step. I sent another message to Megan, initiating the much-awaited next act. ‘Let’s start with some spanking. Ten sounds like a good number.’ I watched as Megan’s face lost its color as she read the message, showing that she had been hoping for more time to breach the subject. And just like the gentleman I was, I sent her a follow-up message that would make her situation direr. ‘Directly to your naked bottom, of course, and make sure that they are stiff enough, or next time, it’s going to be a paddle delivered by me. And that’s something you don’t want.’ </p><p>“Let’s try something different tonight,” Megan managed to say to Camilla after a deep breath, unable to raise her gaze from the floor. A mistake on her part, as the way Camilla’s expression shifted would have clued her about the inaccuracy of her assumptions. </p><p>“Like what,” Camilla answered, confusion on her tone not fake. </p><p>“I was thinking … maybe we could switch roles tonight,” Megan murmured. </p><p>“Really? You want to-” Camilla started, but Megan interjected, not allowing her to finish.</p><p>“I thought it would be an interesting change,” Megan said, still studiously avoiding Camilla’s gaze, which allowed my new assistant enough time to process the situation. “It’s okay, right?” Megan asked, her facade of confidence paper-thick. </p><p>“How are we going to do it,” Camilla said after a while. “Any preferences, or would you like me to pick.” </p><p>“Maybe we can start with spanking,” Megan murmured even as she stood up, and divested herself from her bathrobe with one pull. I couldn’t help but let out a whistle as I met with the amazing view of her body once again. She might be a spoiled brat, but that didn’t change the fact that her body was top-notch in deliciousness scale, her hips and chest sufficiently curvy despite her overall thinness, contrasting nicely with Camilla’s voluptuous thickness. The sexiest double-act in the whole school, no doubt. When the time came, taking them together would be a glorious experience that I would treasure until my last breath. </p><p> She didn’t show much concern to her nakedness, which wasn’t really surprising considering her extended relationship with Camilla, even though it was outside her zone of comfort. The interesting part was Camilla’s excited gaze, tracing Megan’s curves with great interest, suggesting that their relationship might have a messed-up basis, but mutual physical attraction still played a big role. </p><p>“Do you want me to lock the door,” Camilla asked suddenly, her gaze sliding towards the door. </p><p>“Good idea,” Megan said, trying to sound casual, but her widening eyes betrayed the panic she felt for her mistake. Megan lay on the bed, preparing for the next step, while Camilla walked towards the door. When Camilla returned, she met with Megan’s booty conveniently placed as Megan’s chest pressed against the covers while her feet were still on the floor. </p><p>Camilla’s face was a mixture of anticipation and fear, with a generous dash of surprise still present as she tried to process the reversal of her fortunes. She was hesitant as she sat down next to Megan, her gaze filled with fascination as she examined Megan’s bottom. It might not be the first time she was seeing Megan naked, but I was willing to bet that it was the first time where Megan was really vulnerable. “Are you ready to begin?” Camilla asked, her attempt to sound determined failing adorably as her voice cracked midway. </p><p>“Let’s start,” Megan said, her voice carrying a hint of a crack as well despite her attempts to come across impervious. It must be burning her to be forced into a situation like that due to the will of her unnamed ‘benefactor’, especially since she was well aware her situation would be much worse if the said ‘benefactor’ actually decided to hurt her. </p><p>A smile appeared on Camilla’s face, trembling yet hungry, and her hand met with Megan’s bottom. Admittedly, it was a soft one, barely above a caress, creating almost no sound, but Megan flinched nevertheless. It was unfortunate that the angle didn’t give me a view of her face. Camilla’s hand hovered, while she tried to gather her courage for the next one, but Megan spoke before she could do so. “Harder,” she said with great reluctance, showing that she was taking my warnings seriously. </p><p>A second later, Camilla’s hand connected with Megan’s bottom once more, this time hard enough to leave a soft pink blemish on her otherwise white skin. “How is this?” Camilla questioned. </p><p>“Better, but try to hit even harder. I want to hear its sound” Megan corrected. Apparently, my display of ‘clairvoyance’ during the first session suitably impressed her that she wasn’t willing to take any chances. It looked like she was betting on the fact that I had been listening to her room from one of the connected ones. Not a bad idea, I had to admit, even though it was ultimately very wrong. </p><p>Camilla’s answer came in the form of another spank, finally accompanied with a delicious cracking sound, which was immediately followed by a pained gasp from Megan. But to her credit, Megan just took a deep breath to prepare herself for the next instead of complaining. Camilla waited for a second, waiting for a response that wouldn’t come, before her hand shearing the air in a sudden movement. </p><p>I had thought that the rest of the flow would go in a predictable manner, which, surprisingly, turned out to be inaccurate, when Camilla’s free hand reached for the buttons of her blouse, getting rid of the top two before her hand landed on Megan’s bottom once again. Rest of the buttons suffered the same fate immediately, revealing Camilla’s bra underneath, a conservative piece that underlined the need for a shopping expedition. </p><p>But that need took back-seat against the need when, after another spank which was considerably harder than the others, Camilla’s hands slipped under her bra, pushing its borders just enough to give a delicious glimpse of her brown skin as her fingers sank into her flesh, awakening a vision of pleasure on her face, getting thicker with each repeat. </p><p>Even more interestingly, the surprises for the evening weren’t limited to just that. Despite the poor view provided by the webcam, I could see a very telling glistening between Megan’s legs, hinting that she didn’t find the situation as distasteful as she had first thought. A soft yelp still escaped with each spank, but the pleasure on its edges got more and more visible with each repeat. Even more telling, she made no attempt to stop Camilla despite the count moving well-past the initial ten I had ordered.</p><p>I wasn’t the only one that noticed Megan’s changing mood. Camilla started to get more and more adventurous as the number on the counter grew. Her fingers stayed on Megan’s bottom after each repeat, a move appreciated by Megan if her hums were any indicator. A few more spanks, and Camilla stopped being restricted to safer spots, letting her hand caress Megan’s nether lips after each spank. A fleeting touch at first, but the duration increased noticeably after each repeat. </p><p>At the excitement, Megan had forgotten to count for the spanks, but the counter was well into the twenties, quite a bit more than my initial request, so I decided to let it go. The space between spanks had lengthened further to a point that Camilla’s finger was spending the majority of their time on her folds rather than on her bottom, her punishment falling to the side. </p><p>And that wasn’t the only interesting development. Camilla’s idle hand had decided for a change of venue, and slid under her skirt instead, causing it to ride up, providing me with the view of her leg, just at the right thickness. But that wasn’t the full extent of her display. She grabbed the edge of her panties, pushing them down to her ankles with a rapid movement, her skirt already around her waist, showing that she was even further than Megan on the subject of arousal. </p><p>Megan moaned with enthusiasm when Camilla slid the first digit of her index finger in her slit, earning an enthusiastic moan from her, which was all Camilla needed to abandon spanking her in favor of pushing her finger deeper into her, the second one joining to the task soon after. “Yes!” Megan moaned, loud enough to cause my speaker to make a cracking noise. </p><p>That proved to be only encouragement Camilla needed to throw away her restrain, two other fingers joining the first as they slid deeper into Megan’s core, an action her free hand replicated just moments later with her own core, her mouth falling open under the rush of pleasure, her moans mixing with Megan’s. </p><p>It was a true pleasure to watch two women’s rapid journey towards the peaks of pleasure, especially with the knowledge that both were under my total control, and the fact that they didn’t know the full extent of it just made it even more delicious. </p><p>“Do you like it,” Camilla said as her fingers traveled deeper and deeper into her insides, making Megan moan loudly. I would have said it was surprising, but her next words were more deserving of that statement. “I asked you a question,” she followed up as her hands pulled out of Megan’s slit, and landed on her bottom with a sharp crack, harder than any other spank she had delivered today. </p><p>“I do,” Megan answered, mixed with a moan, compounding my shock even further. Even if I hadn’t been expecting her to have an iron will, her quick compliance had been surprising. I hoped that it was just a sign of her response in a safer spot, and she was going to display a better resistance to face to face. </p><p>“Excellent,” Camilla said even as her fingers disappeared between Megan’s legs once more, driving her towards a climax, which arrived in less than a minute of silent focus, signaled by her out of control cries. </p><p>I reached my phone while Megan collapsed in pleasure-filled cries, and sent Camilla a message, ordering her to visit me. She looked reluctant, her fingers quickening to make her reach for orgasm, so I sent a follow-up message, just one word. ‘Now!’ it read. I took pride in the way her face blanched a bit. Even with a meek target like Camilla, establishing that level of control in just a few meetings was an expert-level success. </p><p>“I need to go,” Camilla murmured as she leaned down to fix her panties. Megan just murmured in response, still under the effects of the orgasm, preventing a coherent response. </p><p>I watched as Camilla fixed her clothing slowly, each move measured as she slowly covered her body with her boring clothes, which would have annoyed me a lot if her destination wasn’t my home, where a set of more interesting clothing, not to mention a follow-up with the lack of it, was waiting for her. </p><p>I waited for Camilla to leave to send a message to Megan. ‘Since your toy is leaving the room, should I assume you have completed the task successfully, or do I need to come up with an alternative method.’ </p><p>Megan barely managed to raise her head when alerted by the buzzing of her phone. It was unfortunate that I wasn’t able to see her face, but the stiffening her body clued me enough about her mood. ‘It’s done,’ she wrote even as a sigh left her mouth. </p><p>‘And you don’t mind sharing the evidence, of course,’ I said, earning a louder follow-up sigh, but she had no delay as she raised her head, and took a picture of her ass, tender and glowing with patches of red. </p><p>‘Good work,’ I said even as I saved up the picture, hardness of my boner reaching an unbearable point. Luckily, my new assistant was on the way to cure my horrible ailment. ‘Your work for tonight is complete. You will receive your next task tomorrow.’</p><p>‘Next task!’ she wrote back even as she let out a frustrated cry, her annoyance enough to break through the haze of her orgasm.</p><p>‘Yes, your next task. Tonight was just the payment for tonight’s failure. Tomorrow, you’re going to repeat today’s task, and for your safety, you’re going to successfully complete it.’ After hearing her frustrated cry, I couldn’t help to send one last quip. ‘I recommend forgoing underwear, maybe that way, you’ll be able to catch his eye.’ </p><p>Who knew playing both the target and the instigator could be so much fun! </p>",

    "content": "<p>The next few days after my small trip with Brenda passed normally, at least, as normal as it could be under the charged circumstances where I had been banging both my boss and her secretary. I had met with Natalie often for work-related meetings, but in those, I was careful in not pushing her about the intimacy we had shared during our business trip. I didn’t want her to regain her balance, but the possibility of her breaking under stress was even worse, so I gave her some space regardless. It was hard work to maintain the delicate balance we had managed to set, a wrong push risked to destroy everything I had managed to establish.</p><p>Of course, not banging Natalie hadn’t meant that my days had been boring. Brenda had visited my office with surprising regularity to bring some ‘special files’, allowing us to hold some detailed ‘audits’ on certain assets, discussing ways to ‘penetrate’ foreign markets. Surprisingly, half of the time, it was Brenda that initiated them. Those activities left both of us panting and wheezing. Luckily, Natalie let Brenda act freely, hoping that she would be able to worm herself into my confidence, spying for Natalie, unaware that Brenda had converted into the fruitful job of being a double-agent for a long while.</p><p>I was lazing around in my room in a late afternoon, trying to get my breath after another visit from Brenda where we discussed ‘operational challenges’ in great detail, when a knock on the door distracted me from my rest. “Come in,” I said, fearing that it was Brenda, changing her mind about having another session. After the last session, I needed at least an hour before I was ready for the next one. But then, the door opened, revealing a slimy-looking guy on the other side of the door. Mike, I managed to identify, one of the sales supervisors that worked on the second floor, and more importantly, a member of my new team after the latest reshuffle. </p><p>“Can I come in, Mr. Smith,” said Mike. His face was contorted with stress despite his best effort to keep his expression pleasant. The reason was simple. He was one of the guys with high ambition, and he had been doing his best to get promoted to a managerial position, namely, the position I was currently holding… </p><p>For him, missing the promotion opportunity was just one part of his problem. The other, and the more important, part of the problem was entirely self-inflicted. As a rat, he decided that the best way to increase his profile was to pick a victim in the office, and gain visibility in the company through humiliating that target, simultaneously showing everyone the depth of his information, and his abilities to force his subordinates harder and longer with fear. </p><p>A pitiful strategy, but the inaccuracy of his conceptual understanding of management wasn’t the biggest reason. Unfortunately, he had proved that he didn’t have the intelligence to match his ambition by choosing me as his target, ignoring the complications that had put me in my position. He happily insulted me whenever I passed near his desk, a proud expression on his slimy face like he had achieved something impressive. Then, I got promoted, and his smug jabs had been quickly replaced with over-the-top bootlicking, like that would be enough to make me forget all the insults he had thrown to my side. </p><p>“Yes,” I said even I turned my gaze back to my monitor, not bothering to speak another word. I still watched him from the corner of my eye, enough to catch his face contorting with anger against my dismissal, but he lacked the spine to make it an issue. </p><p>“We’re going to have a small after-work gathering as the sales team in my house, barbecue, and maybe a couple cans of beer to chase it down…” At that point, he stopped expectantly, hoping that I would pick up his invitation, but I continued working, my eyes on the screen. “I thought maybe you would like to drop by?” he added, his tone hitching desperately. </p><p>I opened my mouth to reject his offer in a rather humiliating manner, but then I remembered that a few weeks ago, a sexy redhead, significantly younger than him, had picked him up when his car was broken, a mechanical malfunction that the whole office learned due to his constant bitching. That sexy redhead was his wife, I had learned when I overheard the discussion of two security guards as they shared their crass opinions about the best way to treat such a voluptuous young woman. “Sure, just email me your address, and I’ll be there,” I said. </p><p>“I’m glad, sir. We’ll start around eight,” he said happily, though I doubted he would be as happy if he knew the only reason I was coming was to use the opportunity to hit on his wife. And her beauty wasn’t the only reason I wanted to be there as well. No, I wanted to hit on her in front of Mike. I didn’t know what would be more unbearable for him, pissing off his wife, or his boss, and I couldn’t wait to find out. I could just imagine the torture he would feel under a threat against his work prospects. “And since I’m here, do you have five minutes to discuss the client assignments for the next month. I have a few interesting ideas that would increase team efficiency by several percentage points…” </p><p>I had no doubt that whatever reassignment he would offer would increase his wallet more than anything else, and any improvement to the company coffers would be completely incidental even if they weren’t completely imaginary in the first place. “I’m too busy today, but maybe we can discuss them tonight, depending on my mood after the party,” I said. I had no intention of implementing anything he had came up in his initiative of course, but dangling the possibility was going to make the evening even more fun. “You can leave now,” I added, and he closed the door behind him, leaving me alone to plan how to handle the evening… </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>It was well past ten when I pulled at Mike’s driveway, feeling no guilt at arriving later than I had initially promised. It was merely the first shot of an incredibly annoying assault to the asshole that tried to make my life hell while he thought he had power. I could have simply arranged for him to get fired, but it was a poor display of creativity. Why would I do that when of slowly torturing the asshole instead through the things he found most important. </p><p>I reached the passenger seat to pick up the small gift box, a top-shelf tequila with a hefty price tag. Not a wallet-breaker for me, but enough to make Mike think that I cared about his opinion. It was just another hook I was dangling in front of a gluttonous fish, to make the evening even more horrible as I flirted with his wife while faking slight drunkenness. If he thought he had an actual rapport between us, he would be even more reluctant to defend his wife against my lecherous grasp. </p><p>I rang the doorbell, followed by rapid footsteps from the other side of the door. The door laid open a while later, revealing Mike on the other side of the door, dressed in a smart-casual getup. A bit over the top for a home party, but he was just smug enough to think it made him look better. “Mr. Smith,” he said in his usual snide tone which he seemed to think as charming, and gestured me to walk inside. </p><p>I just nodded in acknowledgment, not finding him important enough to give a verbal confirmation. The way his lips twitched told that he caught the slight, but was too powerless to reject, choosing to swallow it without an argument instead. I walked through the corridor, following the low-key rumble, a mixture of smooth jazz and buzz from the speech of a few different people. </p><p>But before I could reach the living room, someone stepped on my way. A figure that I managed to place as Mike’s sexy wife despite catching a fleeting glance of her only once as she drove away. There was no mistaking of her eye-catching crimson mane, which was gathered on her head in a complicated knot, just a few streams spilling on her naked shoulders. I hadn’t had the chance to catch a view of her body previously, but she turned out to be a very understanding hostess in that regard, wearing a green dress that was just tight enough to give me a glimpse of her excellent curves, while managing the conceal enough to sustain the mystery. </p><p>“Mike-” she was saying as she turned the corner, only to freeze when she came face to face me with a stranger. Or more accurately, face to chest, as she barely passed my shoulders even wearing a pair of stylish shoes with decent-sized heels. I lowered my head, enjoying the sudden panic on her face. </p><p>“Tiffany,” said Mike as he dashed next to me. “This is my boss, Mr. Smith.” Then he turned to me. “And this is my lovely wife,” he said proudly, but pride that felt weird to my senses. Factoring in the significant age difference between them -she looked in her early twenties while he was clearly pushing towards his forties-, I felt that it wouldn’t be unfair to bet that there was a certain trophy situation involved, driven by Mike’s earnings. </p><p>And, I was asshole enough to test that assumption. “A pleasure,” I murmured as I grabbed her hand, but instead of shaking, I brought them to my lips, pressing them on the back of her hand. She looked surprised at first, but panic wasn’t too far away as the touch of my lips lingered, bordering inappropriate. I could see her trying to her husband with her gaze, which then turned into a disappointed glare. It seemed that Mike chose not to interject, not wanting risk angering his boss. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>I lowered her hand, holding her hand another second before letting go. Mike coughed pointedly. Since he was still behind me, I wasn’t able to see him. I thought I was the target of the cough, warning me about my extended touch, but the sudden anger on Tiffany’s face, her eyes looking over my shoulder, dissuaded me from that idea. “A pleasure to meet you as well,” she managed to say between her squeezed teeth, her grip tightening in rage.</p><p>“If you don’t mind, I brought a small gift,” I said, passing it to Mike, whose eyes widened as he noticed the fancy case and the brand name. Hook, line, and sinker. </p><p>He passed it to his wife. “Honey, could you please put this in the kitchen,” he said with a smug expression. </p><p>“Of course not, my love,” said Tiffany, though the way she spat her words left no mystery about her actual mood.  </p><p>“Excellent, now, let me introduce you to others,” Mike said as he put his arm on my elbow, trying to lead me inside. I hated being touched without my permission. I was tempted to push my elbow back ‘accidentally’ to see whether I could crack a rib, but that stayed as a fantasy. Physical violence was a younger man’s game, and I had better tools to get revenge. And from the cloud on anger that was hanging over Mike’s redheaded wife, I couldn’t help but feel that my alternative methods had a fertile ground to take root. </p><p>Next few minutes passed in mind-numbing normalcy. Mike led me around the room, introducing me to his friends and neighbors while bustling around to make sure that I had drinks and food. Altogether, it was a rather poor display of bootlicking. And from the disappointed gaze of Tiffany, I could see that I wasn’t the only one in that opinion. A few minutes later, she walked to the corridor, disappearing deeper into the house. </p><p>But Mike, who also noticed the disappearance of his wife, spoke before I could come up with a reason to get away and follow her. “I just need to check something in the kitchen,” he added before walking away, leaving me alone with one of his neighbors, who might be a part of the furniture as far as his potential for interesting talk went.</p><p>“Would you mind, I need to visit the restroom,” I said, cutting his bland tirade about the latest insignificant political scandal, following the same path Mike had disappeared to. </p><p>I hadn’t need to walk for more until I heard two familiar voices having a row, both trying to whisper, but failing to keep it low in their obvious display of anger, which I could hear because they failed to close the door. I scooted closer to hear them clearly. “… I don’t care,” I caught Tiffany saying. “I can’t just flirt with a random guy, just because you’re so incompetent that they preferred to promote a junior to your place.” </p><p>“Like that’s a huge sacrifice for you,” answered Mike with obvious bile, his jealously suggesting that it wasn’t the first time they were having that discussion. </p><p>“So, I need to stop talking to all my male friends just because you’re feeling jealous, but then turn and act like a bimbo to your boss because you suck at your job. Is that it?” </p><p>“Either that, or kiss your designer bags goodbye, because that’s how we’re going to pay our mortgage if I can’t increase my sales area. We’re in debt, if you remember. We need those commissions.” </p><p>“When you’re failing to earn enough, it’s suddenly we when it comes to budget. How interesting. We wouldn’t be in this situation if you hadn’t leased that stupid sports car.” </p><p>“That car cost less than your hairdresser…” Mike countered. It was time to get back, I decided. I had enough information for their fights, and I had a feeling that, after that fight, either Tiffany would disappear completely from the party, or come back with a vengeance to annoy her husband by the exact same way he requested. </p><p>“Are they fighting again,” whispered gleefully one of the neighbors the moment I returned back, in a display emotion only a suburban wife could manage in the face of a juicy piece of gossip. I just shrugged, choosing to say nothing. “They always do,” she continued, taking my silence as an invitation to continue. “I heard that they are trying to have a baby, but it’s not going well,” she added with a whisper and a wink. </p><p>Interesting, I thought as I carefully nodded in appropriate places to coax a more detailed explanation from her. Extra information seldom hurt its bearer as long as it was used wisely. Soon Mike returned the foyer, joining back to the crowd, but Tiffany failed to return. Pity, I thought in disappointment. I would have expected her to return. </p><p>For the next fifteen minutes, I was busy nursing my drink as the rest of the crowd slowly started to leave the party. One advantage of coming late, as hanging around with the dull examples of humanity Mike chose to befriend was tough even for a brief amount of time. I couldn’t imagine suffering them for a couple of hours. </p><p>The neighbors started to leave one by one, and soon, I was alone in the living room, with Mike at the entrance to send of his last guest. Unfortunately, Tiffany was nowhere to be seen. I filled myself another glass, planning to have one last drink before leaving permanently. I was considering just delay enough to have a brief talk with Mike about the zone assignments, planning to ruin his night by further reducing his responsibilities, and with that, his earning potential. </p><p>But then I heard a voice that made me shelve those plans in an instant. “Where’s everyone,” said Tiffany. </p><p>I turned towards to explain her, but when I saw her, my tongue was locked in surprise. The culprit: her new dress. Gone was the earlier flowing green dress that reached her knees, replaced by a tight silver one that barely covered her bottom, not that it helped much with its extreme tightness, giving me a perfect view of her booty. It was marginally looser on the chest area, but that mattered little with the cut that went sideways underneath her boobs, giving an interesting, yet welcome, angle for her cleavage. “You seem different,” I said, trying to sound nonchalant, but a slight hitch in my voice betrayed me. </p><p>“I had a small mishap in the kitchen, so I needed to change.” She smirked viciously, aware of the full impact of her dress on me. “What do you think?” she added, followed by a small twirl, showing that her dress was backless, barely hanging on her body due to a knot behind her neck. It didn’t take a genius to see she wasn’t wearing a bra, and from the way the dress was clinging on her body, I guessed that it was the same for downstairs as well. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said honestly, enjoying the way her red hair spilling on her silver dress and pale naked shoulders. “You should have started the night with this one. The party would have been much livelier.” </p><p>“You think so,” she said, ducking her head in an approximation of shyness. </p><p>I prepared to answer, but before I could, her husband arrived, cutting my words with a shocked gasp. “Tiffany,” he growled angrily, but cut himself short when I turned to him. “What are you wearing?” he continued, trying to suppress his anger from his voice, but that did little to moderate his sharp gaze. </p><p>“I had a little problem in the kitchen, so I had to change. Is there something wrong with the way I dress, husband?” she added, a victorious smirk on her face. It was a bold plan, twisting her husband’s request to be flirty to a point that would make him blow a casket. And from his rapidly reddening face, he was more than aware of it. </p><p>But the way he handled it managed to surprise me. “It’s okay,” he said with a shrug. His posture was shouting that it wasn’t okay, but he pushed it nevertheless. It was clear that he was expecting to change her mind now that he wasn’t rewarding her behavior, but that was his failure to understand the female mind. </p><p>The way Tiffany smiled in smug satisfaction before starting to walk towards the kitchen just confirmed my conclusion. “Nathan, any preference for your drink?” </p><p>“Bourbon if you have any,” I countered. “Double, neat.” </p><p>“A real man’s drink,” she said with a giggle. It was a bit much, especially the giggle, but since she was banking on annoying her husband rather than gaining any favor with me, it was understandable. “What do you prefer, hubby,” she added, but her voice had a mocking edge. Subject to that, I wasn’t surprised when Mike repeated my order with a gruff voice. “Coming right up,” she said before starting to walk out of the room, her hips dancing attractively despite the challenge she was feeling from the situation. </p><p>I kept my eyes firmly on the sway of her lips until she disappeared at the doorway, then turned back to Mike. “You’re a lucky guy,” I said with a leer on my face, mostly to annoy him. </p><p>“Aren’t I,” he answered, impressively managing not to break his teeth as he squeezed them, clearly unhappy with the way his plan was coming together. Little did he knew that the night was just starting for him. “Have you watched the game last night,” he asked in a desperate attempt to change the topic. </p><p>“I’m not a fan of sports,” I answered dismissively. “It’s a waste of time, stealing time from fruitful endeavors.” It was bullshit, of course, but I remember him using a very similar statement to insult me when it took more than ten minutes to fix his piece-of-shit computer. </p><p>“I agree,” he confirmed rapidly. “I don’t usually watch them as well, but the guys insisted.” </p><p>“I see,” I said, followed by an ominous pause. “Do you make a habit of folding when people insist, Mike,” I added. It was a ridiculous, meaningless hyperbole, but it was worth to see the abject horror on his face. </p><p>“Of course not, sir,” he answered. “I do my best to stick to my decisions and principles.” </p><p>“So, you lack the ability to roll with the punches,” I countered, catching him with surprise. He shut up, his face contorting with shock as he tried to come up with an answer that would leave him dry in the quagmire I set up for him. But I started laughing before he managed to put an answer. “Just joking around, Mikey,” I said, gently punching his shoulder playfully. I could see that he hated it. Still, he joined the laughter, chuckling uncomfortably. </p><p>Before he could answer, his wife walked in the room, with a tray in her hands, carrying three drinks, a colorful glass of cocktail sitting in between two stout glasses, filled with amber liquid, quite a bit more than a double. “Bottoms up for the new beginnings,” I said as I raised the glass for cheers. </p><p>“Bottoms up?” said Mike in alarm. </p><p>“Of course,” I said with a shrug. “That’s the only fitting way for two men to start a business relationship together.” For a moment, I watched as he examined the glass with a fearful gaze. “You can handle it, right?” I added. </p><p>“Of course I can,” he countered, using the same tone a fourteen-year-old desperately trying to convince his friends that he was also cool. I just smirked before raising the glass to my lips. The liquid that burned through my throat wasn’t entirely pleasant, but it was worth to see Mike desperately trying to keep a cough in as he drained the glass. </p><p>Impressively, he managed to keep it until his glass was finally empty, but he started rocking with a deep cough the moment he pulled the glass away. “Wrong pipe,” he managed to whisper between the breaths while I shared an amused glance with his wife. </p><p>“Can you bring us two more, sweetie,” I said as I pushed the glasses towards Tiffany, a statement that earned a glare from Mike, but considering his objectives for the night, it wasn’t a surprise that it was the end of it. </p><p>She took a long sip from her own drink before making a gesture to reach the glasses. But she stopped before her hands touched the glasses. “Maybe I should just bring the bottle,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent idea,” I said, and watched as she walked away. This time, the sway of her hips was even more pronounced, dancing deliciously in their silver wrapping.  </p><p>I watched with rapt attention until she disappeared at the doorway, acutely aware of Mike’s rising discomfort. “Let’s talk business,” I said, facing Mike only after his wife disappeared from the view. </p><p>The night was starting to suppress my wildest expectations. I wondered for how far I would be able to push my new subordinate, and his sexy and angry wife…</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>A lot of men would have questioned my manliness if they knew that I was paying attention to anything other than the amazing view I had stumbled upon in the library, two very sexy women, their state of undress matching their great beauty, their limbs tangled in a beautiful tango. But in my defense, two glowing, floating sentences, invisible everyone except me, was an excellent reason for my distraction. </p><p><em>[Successful Voyeur Activity: +100 Experience]</em></p><p><em>[Achievement: Patience. Wait two decades before gaining first experience point. +500 Experience, +10 Wisdom]</em></p><p>Of course, it was difficult to understand its total magnitude without knowing my particular background. Not when more than ninety percent of the population had the ability to gain discrete experience points which then turned into sudden boosts of power, greatly increasing their capabilities, while the remaining few had to do it the hard way, studying tirelessly to enhance their abilities. Melius, these people had been called, increasing their skills and abilities through the points they have collected through killing monsters. </p><p>Nobody knew why something like that was possible. Some claimed it was a gift from gods, others theorized it was somehow linked to endless hordes of monsters that turned otherwise beautiful planes into blackened seas of death, interrupted only by occasional town or city. Some fringe religions even claimed that it was somehow linked to Demon Kings, and every single Melius was cursed by the demons -not a popular theory considering the only reason that people were still alive against the monsters was the Melia, especially the elite warriors that had been lucky enough to have a high enough level cap. Everyone had a different level cap, with no way of learning it before hitting to a point, causing a Melius unable to register an experience point gain. </p><p>That level cap neatly tied into my status as a disabled Melius. Or my supposed status, invalidated by the floating letters in front of me.</p><p>As the firstborn of a noble family, I was tested when I was five, revealing that, unsurprisingly, I was a Melius. It wasn’t entirely impossible for a noble family to have an Invalid child, but it was not expected by default. But things had taken an unexpected turn when I killed a small monster that had been captured by our family hunters, only to receive no experience. It caused a huge commotion. Repeated tries, or experiments with different monsters, changed nothing. No matter the creature, no matter the circumstances, I never gained a single experience point. </p><p>Experts, after making my father spend endless riches, deduced that I was the most unlucky Melius ever, born with a level cap of 1, meaning I would never learn a Skill, or earn a Stat Point. I was supposed to live my life as nothing. No skill points, no stats above one, no skills, and certainly no hope… </p><p>My father used his influence to record me as an Invalid, meaning I was supposed to belong to that particular unlucky minority that was supposed to improve themselves through endless practice. Still better than being a cursed Melius that never leveled up. Less damaging to family reputation, at least.  </p><p>But those two glowing sentences changed everything. </p><p> <strong>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </strong> </p><p>Considering that my whole life had been turned sideways just a moment ago, even with my suddenly increased mental prowess, the shocked gasp that escaped my mouth was excusable. Unfortunately, it alerted the two beautiful ladies that had been sharing an intimate kiss to my presence. Their heads raised, and I managed to recognize them, far faster than any other time I was able to recognize anyone. Cornelia, of the House Antony, and Marianne, of the House Louis, two of the most popular women that currently graced the halls of the Silver Tower, the premier learning institute of the Empire. Two strong, deadly women with strong lineages, which made their panic completely understandable. </p><p>“Who is there,” called Cornelia, her voice sharp in anger, the uncrowned queen of the school, a famed fire mage with a temper to match. I couldn’t help but record every single detail as she hurriedly wrapped her arms around her breasts, though they were not sufficient to hide them from the view, a decent portion spilling out of her arms. Marianne was different, her face colored with panic, and her arms were enough -if barely- to cover her more modest assets. And just like that, another sentence appeared in my field of view. </p><p><em>[Achievement: Double Trouble. See two pairs of chest at the same time. +100 Experience, + 1 Perception]</em></p><p>At that point, the most logical thing would be to escape silently, trusting to the endless shelves of books to hide my figure. But I didn’t do that, because I had been already noticed before I could take action, courtesy of my abominably low intelligence stat, which governed the flexibility of thought. By the time I realized I was supposed to be moving, I was already pinned down by Cornelia’s gaze, her green eyes flickering darkly, suggesting that she was already preparing a spell. </p><p>Again, I was slow to react while they fixed their clothes before cornering me. But for the first time in my life, I was annoyed by it. Because only now, I really understood the difference between the others and me, which I lacked the wisdom to appreciate. The stained glass that prevented my perception was suddenly broken, giving me the first taste of clarity. </p><p>It was too bad that it was the clarity of death.  </p><p>“I’m going to kill you, you twerp,” Cornelia whispered in a tone that made me shiver, the flame that flickering in her hands making her even more intimidating. “When I’m done with you, no one would even find your bones-” she added before her words had been interrupted by a desperate shout. </p><p>It was my shout, I absentmindedly realized it was me that was shouting, even as the pain threatened to bury the momentary clarity I had. From the corner of my eye, I could see my health-bar diving dangerously close to zero. It was already blinking red. </p><p>Luckily, her companion grabbed Cornelia’s hand before my health dipped below zero. “Stop, it’s the Mule!” she called, reminding me my nickname, which, for the first time in my life, caused anger to spark in my heart, because for the first time, I understood what it meant. “Don’t kill him. It’s not like he’ll remember anything.” </p><p>“Damnation!” Cornelia called as she took a step back in shock. Without her hand, I collapsed on the ground, and I could see my health bar draining even further. “Do something!” she called. </p><p>I saw Marianne’s hand glowing blue before a coolness spread through my body, breaking my concentration. It didn’t prevent from the darkness covering my view though. The last thing I had seen was three glowing sentences, promising that everything was going to be different.</p><p><em>[Achievement: Survive the Fury. Narrowly escape death as a direct consequence of being caught while peeking. +500 Experience, +1 Endurance]</em></p><p><em>[!Level up]</em></p><p><em>[Achievement: Patient Leveler. Wait for two decades before leveling up. +5 to all stats]</em></p><p><strong>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </strong></p><p>Waking up was a weird experience. Despite the persistent pain on my cheek, I felt like I was reborn, that I was walking unencumbered for the first time after wading through the mud for the first time. I would have thought that I was in a dream, but even in my dreams, my thoughts flowed with a clarity that I had never experienced before. </p><p>I was in uncharted territory. The closest I had been to this when my mother had pitied me, and cast status enhancement spells on me, which raised all of my stats by five for a glorious minute before disappearing forever, leaving me a fleeting memory of heaven that never left me. </p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but tremble with fear as I brought my status window, afraid that the clarity will dispel like a puff of cloud the moment I bring my status window, that damnable screen that was filled with ones, reminding me that I was cursed. But this time, the view was different. </p><p><em><strong>[Level: 22    Experience: 1200 / 3000</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Strength: 6    Charisma: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Precision: 6    Perception: 7</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Agility: 6     Manipulation: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Endurance: 7      Wisdom: 16</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>HP: 59 / 62    Mana: 82 / 82             ]</strong></em></p><p>I couldn’t help but feel excited as I examined the scores in front of me. In less than a minute, the curse that ruined my life was dispelled, I was free. Free to life. Free to grow. </p><p>At that moment, I was thankful to my Wisdom stat, because I had no doubt that, without a significant score on it, I would be shooting my lungs about my curse being broken, that I could be something more than that damnable Invalid Mule, capable of something else than collecting discarded books while lacking the intelligence to even sort them correctly. </p><p>But my newly enhanced Wisdom stopped me, my mind sorting a lifetime of barely-remembered knowledge in a revolutionary manner. I barely remembered the details years after, but parts of a discussion between two experts, considering the probability that I could gain experience with anything other than monster kills had been considered, but ultimately dismissed. Not much, but enough to convince me that keeping my shut might be the better idea. </p><p>Only then, I remembered to glance around, checking where I was. I was afraid that I had been in the medical ward, which would mean I would be examined before leaving. It would have been impossible to hide all the changes that my body had gone through. With my stats upgraded, a night’s sleep was enough to put some muscles to my twig arms, and add some color to my pasty skin. </p><p>Luckily, I was in my room, which was a small room in the depths of the castle, in an abandoned wing, barely bigger than a wardrobe, a dirty, ruined cot only furniture in there. Only after my revolutionary mental shift, I could truly process how insulting it was to live in there, but I still welcomed it. After, it kept me out of view. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder just how much of my life had been spent as being kept out of view. My childhood had passed locked in a room, various experts my only companions, then my father arranged me a ‘job’ as a librarian assistant. Not a bad job for a supposedly Abnormal child. Of course, now, I was realizing that it wasn’t my father’s mercy that drove him to arrange it. Any job in Silver Tower was prestigious enough to prevent too many questions. and more importantly, with four hundred miles between the Silver Tower Complex and my family estate, too far away for any news reach back to my family’s social circle. </p><p>But to me, it had been a cruel exile, forever stuck in Level 1 between the best and the brightest students of the Empire and the Free Cities, my life filled with meaningless menial work, broken only by one of the students decided to prank me due to boredom. Though, the latter didn’t happen much, because there was no great pride found in tricking the ‘Mule’, a nickname referring my endless menial tasks and my slowness of mind. </p><p>“No more,” I murmured, unable to prevent excitement from slipping to my tone. I was finally awake, and ready to take what the world owed me for twenty years of humiliation! </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****    </p><p>Of course, before making the world pay for my humiliation, I needed to validate the reason for my experience gain. With my improved deduction capabilities, it wasn’t hard to theorize that the sexuality of the situation had been a major part of it, but I needed to test the exact conditions to </p><p>But before that, I needed to select my skills. Excitement burst in my heart as I realized, for the first time in my life, selecting a skill was an option. I called for skills tab, and met with an empty list, three lines of writing below it breaking the pattern. </p><p><em>[Select one of the following skills: Basic Subterfuge, Basic Resistance, Basic Concealment] </em></p><p>Again, quite different than what was supposed to be normal, combat filled option list, but I welcomed the change. While it was tempting to have the ability to beat up the assholes that humiliated me for years, I needed to keep my changes as hidden as possible, meaning my selection was between concealment and subterfuge. </p><p><em>[Basic Subterfuge (0/25)] </em></p><p>It wasn’t an easy choice, but I went with basic subterfuge, because I needed to hide the changes I was going through, and the ability to trick others would prove invaluable. Acting was critical for my survival.</p><p>I have never heard a skill that didn’t focus on combat and similar activities, but since none of the experts were able to identify my problem during my youth, it wasn’t too wild to believe my condition was unique. And needed to keep that hidden since I had no intention of spending another ten years of my life under the examination of so-called experts. </p><p>I donned by librarian assistant robe, which conveniently covered my whole body loosely. It even had a hood to cover my face. Then, I took a deep breath, trying to suppress a sudden excitement that thumped into my heart. For the first time in my life, I felt alive, doing something other than obediently following other people’s direct orders, like I was nothing more than a wound-up toy.  </p><p>The moment I stepped in the corridor was different. I smelled the mold and the dust that covered the corridor, my increased stats allowing me to process just how disgusting those smells were, but even then, it made me only happier, like a recently-recovered blind person enjoying the sight of a dumpster. </p><p>A desire to let out a laugh filled my chest, different than all the times that I had been trying to copy the others when they laughed, usually me as the butt of the joke. I suppressed that particular desire, not wanting to alert anyone to the sudden change of my status, though I had a feeling that if it wasn’t for my ridiculous increase in the wisdom stat, I would have missed that particular detail under the rush of excitement. </p><p>I started to come across other people closer I got to the library. I had passed just a few people when another line of fiery letters appeared on my sight. </p><p><em>[Subterfuge +1]</em></p><p>Excellent, I thought, surprised, but definitely not dissatisfied, with the increase speed of the skill. I remembered hearing that real-life situations were much better to enable skill progress, a swing against a deadly monster was more valuable than a thousand swings in the courtyard. And apparently, the likely consequences of getting noticed was enough to qualify my situation as dangerous. </p><p>Missing such an amazing opportunity would be definitely wasteful, so I decided to get ‘lost’ during my walk towards the library. For anyone else, getting lost while walking towards the location of employment of last two years would be incredulous, but for my past self with all one stats and no skills, it was something that happened in a startling frequency. </p><p>I spent almost an hour wandering in the corridors, which helped my subterfuge skill to reach the rank of ten, but unfortunately, that number stayed the same for the last five minutes, suggesting that I needed more dangerous situations to test it. Or maybe, I added a moment later, it required more interactive situations. </p><p>The sensation of a hand, wrapping tightly around my biceps, pulled me from my thoughts. I turned towards my assailant, only to meet with the face of a servant that I occasionally saw in the halls. “Lost again,” he murmured, but didn’t wait for an answer before starting to drag me towards the library. “Fucking nobles,” he murmured. “Every single one is a parasite, even the Invalid ones, wasting food while they should be given to monsters.” </p><p>I quirked my eyebrow as I listened to the rumblings of the servant, curious to see that my supposed shared status as an Invalid not quelling his anger. Maybe because my past self’s capabilities were abysmal even in Invalid standards. He was careful to hide his mumbling whenever another student or servant closed in, but apparently, I didn’t count. I might have ignored it, but maintaining my silence added another five points to my subterfuge skill. Tempted, I pressed the skills button as the servant deposited me at the entrance, checking my full status. </p><p>Things were finally looking up for me… </p><p>—————</p><p><em><strong>[Level: 2        Experience: 1200 / 3000</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Strength: 6    Charisma: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Precision: 6    Perception: 7</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Agility: 6     Manipulation: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Endurance: 7      Wisdom: 16</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>HP: 59 / 62    Mana: 82 / 82             ]</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>SKILLS</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>[Basic Subterfuge (15/25)     ]</strong></em></p><p><br></p>",

    "title": "Mafia in College 9",
    "content": "<p>There was a certain thrill riding on the backseat of a powerful bike when the driver was a sexy brunette, especially when the said brunette was on board when I started to peel her clothes with a dangerously sharp knife. I was tempted to use the same knife to loosen my pants, which were becoming uncomfortably tight under the circumstances. But in the end, keeping my attention on Amelia was the more attractive choice. </p><p>I dragged the blunt side of the knife over her skin, starting from her now-naked stomach, my other hand perfectly positioned to sense her trembling, which intensified as I continued dragging the knife upwards. While I couldn’t hear her out of control breathing due to the presence of her helmet and the loud roar of the engine, the way her diaphragm was dancing was enough evidence for it. She slowed down the bike as the knife got closer to her breasts, but very pointedly, she didn’t stop. She was on board with what was about to go on as well. </p><p>A smirk was coloring my lips as I used my free hand to pull her bra forward, and the knife took a position between the generous valley of her breasts, surrounded by her perky nipples. I wished that it would have been silent as I continued dragging the knife upward, as it would have allowed me to listen the whisper-like sound as the sharp side of the knife cut a path through the middle of her bra. Soon, that journey was complete, and cups of her bra started to flap in the wind uselessly, leaving her breasts bare for the nasty beating of the wind. </p><p>As a gentleman, I couldn’t allow such a travesty, of course, so I placed my empty hand over her breasts, tightly to ensure to errand wisp of air could pass between the barrier to her rock-hard nipples, pressing against my palm. The knife, I continued to drag over her skin, tracing the edges of her globes. </p><p>Amelia wasn’t entirely focused on the drive as those were happening, not that she could be blamed on that. The slowdown of the bike continued as massaged her spectacular globes. Even better, she pushed her hips back more aggressively, and added a circular motion on the deal, grinding against me. </p><p>“Pull over,” I ordered her. I had been planning for a more extended session of foreplay, but the way she was rubbing against me managed to change my mind. I didn’t want to waste the moment by prematurely exploding in my pants. </p><p>She must have been thinking similar, as she didn’t even bother looking for a relatively covered area before pulling over to the right, in the middle of the road. The bike stopped, but the engine was still rumbling when she made a motion to dismount the bike. I disagreed on that path of action, a disagreement I displayed by pushing her forward until she was almost horizontal on the seat, her bubble ass conveniently pointed upwards. </p><p>“Don’t move,” I ordered even as I got rid of my helmet. A moment later, I pressed the tip of my knife over her jeans, and carefully dragged it down, creating a very convenient access point for me. Something she was enjoying very much if her out of control breathing, loud enough to seep out of her helmet, was any indicator. Then, I remembered the stop I made to a clothing shop, the results sitting on my bag. </p><p>Since she had spare clothing, there was nothing that prevented me from continuing to drag the knife down across the length of her leg. Surprisingly, she made no attempt to protest even I dragged the knife over the other leg of her jeans. With that task complete, pulling apart her jeans was trivial, leaving the task of protecting her bottom to a pair of wet panties. They weren’t anymore resistant to my knife, of course, sharing the same fate after a twist of my wrist. </p><p>I slid my knife back to its sheath before taking something much more context appropriate from my pants. Normally, I would have played around with her a bit with my fingers, trying to bring her to the optimal mood, but just a glance to her entrance, its wet sheen shining under the sun, convinced me that there was no reason for that. But I still have another thing to do before starting the main course. “Remove your helmet,” I ordered. </p><p>Seeing she was hesitating to follow my order, I was quick to show my displeasure, in the form of a loud spank on her bottom, filling our immediate surroundings with a loud crack. Before I could have time to leave a similar slap on her other cheek, she pulled her helmet off hurriedly. </p><p>Her hair had turned into a sweaty mess during the drive, but that was nothing compared to the expression on her face, sweaty, hazy, and most importantly, filled with a delicious strain that showed that she was even closer to climax than I was. And I, as a true gentleman, knew that I shouldn’t keep her waiting any more. </p><p>“Hold tight,” I ordered even as I placed my hands on both sides of her hips, and aligned against her entrance. I pressed, and she raised her hips more, inviting a deep plunge. In a last-minute decision, I decided not to reward her on that vein, and asked her a question instead. “Do you want a slow ride, or a hard ride, my dear professor,” I asked instead. </p><p>She turned and threw a glance at my side, surprising me with the blush that was spreading on her face. Somehow, despite the situation, that question managed to trigger her shyness. She turned away just as quick, her damp hair unable to hide her ears, glowing brightly. Against all reason, she managed to look cute at the moment, but not to prevent me from pushing further. “Should I assume that your silence means you don’t want a ride?” </p><p>The answer escaped her mouth in a panicked hurry. “No!” she exclaimed, afraid to be left on the edge of orgasm she wouldn’t meet. The probability of losing the treat that was dangling in front of her was enough to break her shyness. “I want it, I want it hard.” </p><p>The way her expression shifted back to shy as her brain processed what her mouth spat out in the hurry was amusing, but not as amusing as the transformation that followed when I grabbed her hair harshly and plunged deep inside her with a sharp stab, invading her slippery insides. </p><p>A primal cry of pleasure escaped her mouth, preventing her from saying anything else. I pulled back until her nether lips were around my crown, only to impale her once more, even harder, earning a correspondingly louder cry. “An amazing song,” I said, happy to listen to her boundless mix of moans and cries as I pumped inside. She was definitely loud — and surprisingly melodic under the circumstances. And since we were in the middle of the wilderness, there was no reason for her to keep her voice low. </p><p>She wasn’t bothering to keep her voice low as I continued my rapid assault, as for once, there was no risk that her desperate cries would bring an immediate audience. But she was close to the edge, and since I didn’t bother holding back, it didn’t take long for her cries to turn into ragged breathing as a climax hit her with full force, leaving her laying limply over the bike while I continued to plunge repeatedly inside her. </p><p>“Give me a second,” she managed to say a while later between her gasps. “I need to - I need to catch my breath.” </p><p>“Why?” I said even as I continued pumping inside her. “You’re doing excellent as it is. I see no need to break this amazing rhythm.” She opened her mouth to say something else, but a spank on her bottom, lacking any kind of coverage after I destroyed her jeans via the huge cut I created for convenient access, managed to prevent her from continuing those words, replacing them with another desperate cry. </p><p>Initially, I had been planning to pump until I was on the edge of my own orgasm, then pulling out without a warning, but I changed my mind when I was struck with a desire to watch her spectacular breasts tumbling every time I impaled her. I pulled out, and at that moment, Amelia turned to face me, and despite her earlier protests, clearly unhappy about stopping halfway. </p><p>“I just needed a change of scenery,” I explained calmly, like I was commenting on the weather around the office water-cooler, even as I dismounted from the bike. My hands found her waist and lifted her up, which was very easy thanks to her small and lithe stature. It was slightly harder to turn her in the air to make her face me, which meant that it just took a second more. “Ready for the next step?” I asked with a smirk. </p><p>Her mouth opened to answer, but as usual, it wasn’t a point that I was very interested with her answer, so I just pushed my shaft inside her warmth, and once again started to enjoy her slippery insides while her words predictably melted into another cry. And it was not like I needed her words to know whether she was enjoying the treatment, when her legs, conveniently wrapped around my waist, </p><p>With the position we were sharing, it was almost trivial to lean forward and capture her lips, which I did in a short yet heated burst before leaning into her ear. “You’re such a sexy beast,” I whispered. I pulled back, focusing on her expression. </p><p>I could read the absolute chaos that was going on her mind as her usual self-assured mannerism burned into a crisp under arousal and adrenaline. All the effort she put into her academic life, earning a post as a professor before most people in her age trying to graduate from college, and here she was, nothing more than a toy on the lap of her assistant. A fake one, even, but she wasn’t aware of that particular fact yet. </p><p>And more interestingly, she was silent. Well, not exactly silent, as she was gasping, moaning, and crying very loudly every time my shaft slid into her depths, but she was producing no words. Not comprehensive ones, at least. I was so lucky, I thought as I examined her spectacular tits. She was a true treasure, one that avoided male attention thanks to her ambitious academic track. And even luckier, her previous boyfriend was a total tool, leaving her potential untouched for my attention. </p><p>She proved to be a quick learner. She wrapped her legs around my waist, and used the leverage to raise herself, only to slam back as sharp as she could, devouring my full length, giving me untold pleasure in the process. The expression of bliss on her face would have been enough to make me climax if I was a shade less experienced. So instead, I watched with great pleasure as she rode himself to another climax, </p><p>I was quick to force her into a new position when she climaxed once more, throwing her on top of the bike’s seat, her tits pointing the pristine sky, sunlight dancing on her sweaty skin. And I plunged despite her helpless protests, begging for a small breather. Another few minutes later, she was climaxing once more, but that one left her a mess on the edge of unconsciousness, her body one of the most erotic things I had the pleasure of seeing. </p><p>While it was tempting to spend hours watching Amelia’s spent body lying over the bike, the ripped remainders of her clothes just making it sexier by failing to hide her body, marked by our rather aggressive sexual encounter. I was tempted to continue, of course, but she looked dangerously close to fainting. Any more, and it wouldn’t be safe for her to drive back. </p><p>“Are you ready to go back,” I said as I passed the helmet to her. </p><p>She nodded, but it took a while for her pleasure-drunk brain to realize a very important problem with that. “My clothes,” she moaned in shock, realizing that they were far from the condition that would allow her to drive through the streets without getting arrested for indecent exposure. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I came prepared,” I answered, reaching for my bag to pull a skirt from it. It wasn’t a large skirt, barely larger than my hand. And from the glare I was receiving, I could easily deduce that she had realized that it was going to be difficult revealing anything while driving, especially since I failed to give her panties to make her task any easier. </p><p>“Is that all,” she said with a glare. </p><p>“Of course not,” I answered, and I pulled fishnet stockings, tall enough to reach the middle of her thighs. </p><p>“How they are going to help,” she said even as she looked at them with shock.</p><p>“They are going to help me,” I said, followed with a wink. She made no motion of putting them on, so I glared her. “Aren’t you going to wear them, after I went all the trouble picking them up for you.” </p><p>She tried to look at me authoritatively, but it was difficult to do after a satisfactory rumble in the wild over a bike while lacking anything to hide her body. She sighed a moment later, and reached for her boots. “Would you mind turning your back,” she said. </p><p>“Actually, I would,” I answered with a smirk, and watched with rapt attention as she got rid of her own socks, replacing them with the stockings I had brought her for. She pulled the skirt on, but that was revealing on her body even when she stood perfectly straight. I couldn’t wait to see her on the bike, her skirt was ridden upward with the movement. </p><p>There was a certain satisfaction in her movements as she pulled the zipper of her leather jacket up, hiding her breasts from sight. That was not to be allowed, I decided as I walked towards her. “I don’t think it fits the ensemble,” I explained even as I grabbed her zipper, slowly dragging down until the jacket failed its task to obscure the sight of her breasts. They were still partially hidden, her nipples still behind the dark curtain of the jacket, but created a delicious cleavage in the process. I wanted to feel her skin against my back as I drove back, and there was no harm in a bit of teasing. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked, passing her the helmet. She just huffed, but took the passenger seat without protest. Which was good, because she looked too exhausted to steer. She was barely fit enough to hitch a ride behind me. </p><p>But her drowsy state hadn’t lasted long after I started to drive. I quickly jumped a couple gears despite the bumpy road. Advantage of using a rental bike, I didn’t care about the longevity of the suspension. </p><p>With the cry of the wind around her ears and the rumble of the engine underneath her, it didn’t take long for Amelia to return back to life on the way, which I could tell by the way her arms tightened around my chest. But, much to my surprise, she didn’t stay limited to that, and started wandering over my chest, copying the treatment I had given her while she had been driving — minus the knife. </p><p>First, her hand slid under my shirt, pushing up enough to allow the sharp wind to beat against my skin, hard enough to hurt at the speed I was driving, the softness of her fingers creating an amazing contrast against the bite of the wind. </p><p>But it was just a beginning, I realized when one of her hands slid lower until her fingers were tracing the lines that my erection created on my pants, teasing me with the same game I had subjected her to. But her amateurish touches was easy to resist. She had a lot to learn in this game. </p><p>Five minutes later, I had found myself revising my assessment. Her hands were still dancing over my body, her learning curve phenomenal. And just as we passed through city borders, she unzipped my pants and slipped inside, grabbing my erection with her burning fingers, and started pumping. With all that going on, it wasn’t surprising that cars that passed us greeted us with enthusiastic honks. Luckily, we both wore helmets, which kept our identity secret, and the road wasn’t crowded to begin with. </p><p>It was good that we were close to her house, I thought even as I bit my lips, trying to suppress my body’s insistence to explode. Because after all that happened, even with all my effort, I didn’t trust myself for resisting her wiles for more than a few minutes. As I drove through the city streets faster than the speed limits, I knew that she was smirking at me victoriously, amused by her own power, but it didn’t bother me much. After all, we were about to arrive at her house, where I would be free to teach her the folly of her actions. </p><p>She pulled her hand from the confines of my pants as she dismounted, and then pulled off her helmet as she turned to face me. Like I guessed, a self-satisfied smile that begged to be erased colored her face, though it was hard to pay attention to that with the amazing cleavage she had on display. “Thank you for the drive, James,” she said, a teasing edge in her tone. “It was the perfect way to distract me from my other concerns, but now I have to return to my papers.” </p><p>I would have played along with her attempts to tease me, maybe acting like I took her words on face value to see how she would react, but there was a problem with that. I wanted my release, if the smug smile on Amelia’s face was any indicator, she was very much aware of that particular fact. </p><p>I decided to handle that particular problem more directly. I walked towards her door, grabbing her arm on the way without even bothering to stop. I dragged her along towards the door, ignoring her protesting yelp. “Be careful,” she said, trying to sound angry, but her excitement was barely below mine, so the words that left her mouth was a needy gasp rather than a sharp rebuke. </p><p>“Either unlock the door, or we start here,” I said, peering at her eyes. And she knew from experience that it wasn’t a bluff. She reached to her key with a great hurry, her fingers trembling as she unlocked the door. I pushed her inside the moment the door was parted enough, and slammed the door behind myself. </p><p>When she found her balance, she turned towards me, looking ready to complain, but she never had the chance. I was just a step away from her, my lips meeting with hers to douse her complaint. Against my body, she was nothing more than a windup toy, doing her best not to not to fall as I forced her to walk to her living room without even breaking the kiss. </p><p>I unzipped her jacket in one hurried pull, revealing her tits to my gaze. But this time, I removed it a moment later, ignoring the discomfort I made her feel with my sharp movements. I threw the jacket to the side. </p><p>The ruined pieces of her bra were the next step, but this time, I kept them with me, as I had something more interesting in mind. A way that would teach her the cost of teasing me. Though, with the performance she was displaying on the various other encounters, I doubted this would be something that she would be annoyed with. </p><p>We were in front of her couch when I pulled back from the kiss without a warning, made her turn, and pushed her on the couch, with her back turned to me. Then, with a familiarity that was left from the unlawful days -though the targets for that particular skill usually was much uglier, about to meet an equally ugly fate-, I tied her arms behind her back. </p><p>“So, my dear academic adviser,” I said with an amused tone even as I grabbed the edge of her skirt, pulling them up to reveal her puffy lips, drowning in their own wetness. “Are you ready to receive a lesson of your own.” </p><p>A desperate grunt left her mouth rather than words, so I spanked her bottom hard. “You’re more articulate than this Amelia,” I said with a mocking manner. “Speak clearer.” </p><p>“You’ll pay for this,” she said instead, her voice thick with arousal. I was impressed with her courage, though it might also be a glutton for punishment. The way she acted hadn’t exactly ruled out that probability. </p><p>“I will?” I drawled, my mind churning a number of ways I could use to punish her thoroughly, but before I could focus on one, my phone started vibrating, indicating an incoming text message. I thought about ignoring it, but a follow-up message arrived just a few seconds later, so I decided to check. </p><p>‘Megan is calling me to her room, saying it’s urgent,’ read the first message, sent by Camilla. ‘What should I do?’ she added in the second. </p><p>‘Tell that you’re not on campus, and you’ll be there in an hour,’ I wrote back. A small sign appeared on the screen, denoting she was writing something, but nothing appeared on my screen. She was probably trying to ask me to reconsider, but afraid of angering me as well in the process. ‘Trust me,’ I wrote back before putting my phone back to my pocket. </p><p>“You’re lucky that something important came up,” I said even as I released my shaft from the confines of my pants. A disappointed gasp escaped her mouth, one that was cut short when I spanked the naked flesh of her bottom once. “That means I have just a few minutes to teach you a real lesson,” I added, and watched as she perked up in excitement. </p><p>For a moment, I just enjoyed the sight in front of me. My sexy professor, wearing nothing but a miniskirt and fishnets, ruined remains of her bra wrapped around her wrists to pin her arms behind her back. It was a pity that I didn’t have time to properly savor the moment. Still, at least, I had enough time to finish the first module of her lesson.</p><p>“Open wide,” I warned as I pressed my shaft against her lips, which she resisted just a moment before allowing my girth into the confines of her mouth. Normally, I would have enjoyed playing with her a bit, but I didn’t have a lot of time, so I pushed until the crown was ticking her throat, the shock dominating her expression, until it was replaced by panic when I showed no sign of stopping, forcing my presence deep into her throat. </p><p>She would have complained, on that, there was no doubt, but saying something was hard when she had several inches my presence in her mouth, a part of it invading her throat. She was too busy gagging to speak. Her muscles contracted around my girth, which, added to my earlier enjoyment, pushed me close to a climax than I would have expected. Still, it wasn’t a loss, as her tightness was unbelievable. I kept the position, forcing her to go without a breath, and only to pull for a moment when she started showing the signs of fainting. </p><p>Since I didn’t have much time, I decided to make her work harder. I put my hand behind her head, and pushed once more after giving her the opportunity to catch her breath, but this time, impaling repeatedly instead of just staying in the warm confines of her throat. Her wheezing filled the room as I pumped inside mercilessly, my tight grip on her head only thing allowing her to maintain her balance with her arms bound her back. </p><p>A minute later, I pulled back once more, giving her another opportunity to breathe as he examined her face. There was no sign of her earlier haughtiness, replaced by a dazed shock, a dribble sliding on the side of her lips. I was tempted to ask questions, but I neither had time nor patience to delay my climax anymore. </p><p>So, I said nothing else, and just started to slide my presence into her mouth once more, invading her throat mercilessly, her gags and wheezes filling the room as I invaded every untouched part of her throat, giving no thought about her discomfort or pain. And since she was trying to lean forward rather than back, I was willing to bet that she shared the same idea. </p><p>Soon, I was at the edge of my resistance, and decided to mark the occasion by a celebratory filling of her mouth without a warning, leaving her coughing desperately even after I pulled back. “That was nice,” I murmured in satisfaction as I pulled back and fixed my pants. Amelia was coughing, barely able to prevent herself from toppling. I reached to untie her makeshift handcuffs, and started to walk towards the door. </p><p>“I’ll see you tomorrow at your office,” I said before leaving, enjoying the confusion that spread to her face, which was the last thing I saw as I closed the door. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked through the corridor, a spring in my step, I was considering what to do next, though it was an easy question. Megan was left behind in the classroom, gasping, trying to process the shock of my fingers sinking into her beautiful breasts. And I had nothing arranged with Camilla until tomorrow. Arranging something would take only a message, but she needed some space to gather her balance, otherwise, she would just collapse into pieces. She obviously lacked the mental fortitude to handle those issues. </p><p>And just like that, I was left with only one viable target. My dear professor, Amelia. </p><p> I didn’t bother checking her office. She didn’t have any lessons or office hours today, and after our latest encounter, I had a feeling that she would feel disinclined to linger around. An encounter which saw her bent over her desk, her own place of power, her clothing restricted to a pair of panties around her ankles. </p><p>From a rational perspective, the best thing would be to leave her alone. But, after the last encounter with Megan, where she flashed me for the whole lesson, I was feeling rather raunchy, and Amelia was the perfect cure for my ailment. There was a certain irony in teacher finishing what the student had started. </p><p>The decision was taken, but the issue of approach was still on the table. The easiest option would be just to drive straight to her home, knock the door, and walk inside using exam papers as an excuse. I doubted that she would reject me, or at least strongly enough to keep me away. </p><p>But that would be boring, so I came up with an alternative mention. Not to mention, I did owe her for making her kick out her boy-toy, depriving her of a hobby she enjoyed as a result. I had a certain responsibility for creating entertainment for her.  </p><p>So, I had stopped in a mechanic shop where I could rent a bike for a few days. It wasn’t exactly cheap, especially considering I was looking something more exciting than a cookie-cutter, but it was worth it. I was planning to drive directly to her house, but the last minute decision tickled my brain, and I stopped by a shopping center to pick a few pieces of very interesting clothing. Arranging everything took a while, so I was parked in front of her house in about two hours later. </p><p>At her driveway, I briefly considered just honking to call her to the door, but then decided against it. I didn’t want her to look from the window, which would prematurely reveal the surprise. I wanted to meet her at the door, experiencing her surprised glare firsthand. Not to mention, it would allow me to push forward without giving her any time to process her shock and daze. </p><p>I rang the doorbell, and a few seconds later, the door opened. “How can I-” she started, then our eyes met, hers growing wide as she registered the identity of her visitor. “James,” she gasped in shock, her fingers tightening on the door like she wanted nothing more than to slam the door shut, but she had enough presence of mind to realize it might not be the best choice. </p><p>As she watched me with surprise, I had the opportunity to examine her state of dress. Alone in her home, she was wearing just a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, both loose enough to hide her excellent curves, which was a pity. There was an upside to her dress though, the collar of the shirt only half-covered a bite mark that I distinctly remember leaving yesterday on her collarbone, adding a dash of sexiness to her otherwise plain clothing. “Hello, my dear professor,” I murmured throatily. She said nothing for a second, so I continued. “Aren’t you going to invite me inside?” </p><p>From her expression, I could see that it was one thing she didn’t want, but I kept my gaze on her beautiful green eyes, her determination wilted rather quickly. But even then, she took a step back silently rather than inviting me inside verbally. Maybe she was hoping that I was a vampire that can’t walk through the threshold without invitation. But if it was the case, I disappointed her by walking in, and she closed the door behind, then we walked to her living room in silence. </p><p>In her living room, I was surprised once again. It was a lively house, mostly blues and oranges, softened by occasional white and gray, modern-style furniture, except one antique looking hardwood bookshelf that completely covered one of the walls of the living room, well-cared despite its apparent age, piled with an impressive number of hardcover books, most looking even older than the shelf itself. But apart from that bookshelf, the decoration fit neither Amelia the professor, nor the Amy the danger slut that had appeared in occasional glimpses. Even more curious, I thought, wondering what was her deal. </p><p>She took a seat on a chair that stood apart from the others a small trick to make sure I didn’t sit close to her. I smirked as I ignored her silent expectation for me to sit away. I had no intention of giving her that victory, however small. And since the chair she chose was close to the bookshelf, I had the perfect excuse to do so. I stepped in front of the bookshelf, making sure to stay close to Amelia, my body angled in a way that I could see Amelie while browsing the books, and waited for her to talk. </p><p>Her frustration was delicious as the seconds ticked in silence. “How can I help you, James?” she asked almost a minute later, realizing that I had no intention of initiating it. “Maybe something is wrong with the lesson plan?” </p><p>“Nothing school related. I just wanted to talk to you about yesterday,” I said as I waved my hand dismissively, enjoying the blush that was slowly spreading on her face. </p><p>She coughed, trying to hide her discomfort, but it only highlighted it more. “Maybe we should just forget about it,” she said as her eyes slid on the floor, her redness intensifying. </p><p>“Not about ‘that’ part,” I said casually as I pulled a random book from the shelf, acting like I was reading it while watching her from the corner of my eye. “I know how much you like bikes, and I couldn’t feel a bit guilty about how your relationship with Henry ended. So, I decided to give you a small tour as an apology.” It was a lie of course, not only I didn’t have anything to do with her breakup, but also I wouldn’t have cared the slightest if I did. </p><p>With her confusion, she chose the safest discussion. “I didn’t know that you have a bike.” </p><p>“I recently acquired one,” I said as I slid the book back into its place. I turned to her, trying to catch her gaze, but she kept it firmly on the floor. I started walking closer to her, enjoying the way she flinched with every step I took. “Why don’t you go upstairs and change, so that I can introduce you to my ride,” I said. </p><p>“I still don’t know-” she tried to say, but I interrupted her by pressing my finger on her lips.</p><p>“No argument,” I said, hovering above her, her hot breath caressing my finger. I smirked, trying to bring things to the next level, but that didn’t work as good as I could have hoped,  “Go and change, professor. We shouldn’t waste too much time.” She just nodded before leaving the room, dashing to upstairs. </p><p>Amusement was the foremost emotion I felt as I watched her dash upstairs. It was interesting how quickly she changed from the stern adviser that was trying too hard to skittering cutie that trembled at the thought of pushing back. It was likely about what happened in her office, I reasoned. After all, it was the center of her power, the culmination of the years of extraordinary effort which ended up with her earning an incredible position. </p><p>I had to wait a bit before Amelia arrived. I was considering the merits of going upstairs -to help her change- when she appeared at the end of the stairs, wearing jeans and a leather jacket, with a loose white t-shirt underneath. Far from the amazing ensemble she was wearing that fateful night at the bar, no tiny skirts, no tight tank tops. </p><p>The temptation to order her back upstairs for better clothing was high, but the look on her eyes dissuaded me from that path. Apparently, the alone time was enough for her to gather herself, at least enough to put a varnish of confidence on the shine of her eyes. I didn’t expect it to be a deep one, but also there wasn’t a pressing need to test it. “Shall we go,” I asked, and walked outside without waiting for an answer. </p><p>I walked to my rental bike, her footsteps distinct as she stomped closer, her boots making an impression on the ground. I had started the bike then passed the spare helmet to her. “Hop on,” I said. </p><p>She turned the helmet in her hands a couple of times, making a show of examining it, hoping to find a flaw that would give her an excuse to get away. But the helmet was in a good condition, depriving her of the last excuse she could have used to run away. With a sigh, she put the helmet on, and sat on my back, distant enough that our bodies weren’t touching, her hands mimicking ghosts around my waist. </p><p>“Hold tight,” I ordered her before starting to drive. I didn’t drive particularly fast. Partially because we were in the suburbs and it wasn’t exactly advisable. But more importantly, I wanted her to underestimate me, so that I can twist her expectations later on. I picked the shortest road I could to get out of the town. Thankfully, in a university town, it wasn’t exactly difficult to achieve. We drove in silence for about ten minutes, then I pulled at a convenience store. </p><p>I took a deep breath, enjoying the warm weather and the smell of the trees. Once again, she was silent as I walked into the shop to buy some water. I passed one onto her when I returned, and she removed her helmet to get a sip. “How was it?” I asked, despite knowing the answer I was going to receive. A supremely bored expression was on her face thanks to the listless way I was driving. </p><p>“It’s okay,” she said, the same tone that a girl informing her quick-fire boyfriend that it was nothing to worry about, that it happened to everyone.  </p><p>“We can go faster if you want,” I offered dismissively, deliberately bragging in an overcompensating way that most men would hide their insecurities. “I was driving slow not to scare you.” </p><p>“Don’t worry yourself on that,” Amelia answered. I smirked, happy that she was feeling lively enough to be sassy. “I don’t see that being a problem with your hands on the handlebar.” </p><p>“Whatever you wish, professor,” I answered as I winked, and pulled back my helmet. To her credit, she had realized that she had been set up, aware of her mistake, but her pride, already bruised with all that happened, didn’t allow her to correct her statement. She needed a victory, and she was willing to walk into a trap to get that, confident that she could walk out in her power. Too bad it was one that she wouldn’t be able to resist. “Hold tight,” I said as the engine roared with enthusiasm. </p><p>This time, she scuttled closer, her chest resting on my back, her arms tighter than the first time. Not tight enough, though, something she fixed when the bike jumped on the road with great speed, and cut loose on the open road. </p><p>She yelled in shock as her arms tightened around my stomach even further, smashing her chest against my back. I cursed the leather jackets we were wearing, breaking what otherwise would have been a great sensation. Still, her panic was good enough, so I shifted the gear up even further, the landscape turning into a blur. </p><p>It was a great sensation, cutting through the winds with great speed, with a beautiful girl behind me. Even better, Amelia’s cries were slowly changing from panic to excitement. Her arms lost their death grip. They were still tight around my body, but not in a way conveyed the fear of an imminent disaster. I wondered whether her nipples were hard with excitement, but the way she dressed prevented me from learning it even with her chest pressing against my back. I shrugged, as it was a fun mystery I could unravel during our next break.</p><p>After another fifteen minutes of driving, I slowed down, which earned a disappointed exclamation from her, though words were too difficult to pick with the sound of the wind blocking. But then I took a sharp turn to a small, forgotten backroad, both sides covered with tall grass, lacking anything else. But there was a more important feature of the road I had just picked. It was unpaved, constructed from flattened dirt, which turned into a bumpy hell though lack of maintenance. </p><p>Bumps that made the bike tremble violently with each step of the way, subjecting Amelia to constant, violent tremors. </p><p>And it was working the way I was intended. If the way her grip tightened around my body wasn’t clue enough, there were a rapid succession of moans that left her mouth that solidified the message. She was under my control, all without a touch. I sped up several times, only to slow down when her moans were intensifying, giving her an unasked time to cool down, with each repeat, frustration intensifying in her tone. </p><p>Soon, even slowing down wasn’t enough to keep her arousal from building up, but I didn’t want her climax yet. So, I pulled to the side with another sharp turn, and stopped the engine. Amelia said nothing, just breathing deeply as I removed my helmet. I would have stepped off the bike, but her arms were still around my waist, so I turned to her, and raised the visor of her helmet. </p><p>The expression in her eyes, begging for release, was delicious, especially with the way she was struggling to hide it, only to fail miserably. “Your arms, professor,” I said, and she realized just how close we were standing together. She jerked back like she was escaping from icy cold water on a chilly winter day. I didn’t say anything else, just stepped off the bike.  </p><p> She removed her helmet in a crawling pace, trying to give herself a moment to gather her thoughts. But I couldn’t help but lick my lips in hunger as she threw her head back, her hair flowing with the motion, revealing her beautiful face, her lips parted with arousal, and her eyes sparkling. </p><p>“Why did we stop,” Amelia said, trying to sound cold, but it was impossible to do so with her quickened breath.</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious,” I said with a suggestive tone as a leaned forward, and her breath hitched. I waited a moment for her to process the insinuation, then pulled back the moment she parted her lips in passive acceptance. “It’s to get a bit of rest, of course,” I said casually, turned my back, and started walking towards a large rock that looked smooth enough to sit. Her face still carried an amusing mixture of shock and relief, which made it difficult not to snort, but I somehow managed it. “Are you going to just stand there,” I said. “You should stretch your legs a bit, we have a long drive in front of us.” </p><p>“Sure,” she murmured as she dismounted the bike, and started walking around, deliberately away from me. A few minutes passed in silence as she tried to gather herself. “Maybe we should return?” she murmured. “I have a few papers I need to grade.” </p><p>“If you wish so,” I answered. “I would have assumed that you would prefer to drive a bit, but-” I said only to be cut by her excitedly.</p><p> “You would allow me to drive?” she exclaimed. </p><p>“Why not? Assuming that you know the basics, of course,” I said magnanimously. </p><p>“I don’t have a license, but I definitely know how to drive,” she answered. “But Henry never allowed me to use his bike…” </p><p>“Just another evidence of his fragile ego,” I said dismissively. “He probably didn’t want any competition for his likely poor driving skills, assuming his driving skills were as poor as his appetite to fight as I saw the bar that night.” Reminding the cowardice her boyfriend displayed definitely helped her as to I threw the keys to her, which she grabbed excitedly. “Nice catch.” </p><p>She mumbled a few incomprehensible words as she dashed towards the bike, far from her usual articulate manner as a childish excitement dominated her steps. She jumped on the bike carelessly, leaving me to wish that she had been wearing a skirt, her careless reveal under the clear sunlight would have been a scene to remember. </p><p>But not like it was a big loss, I added with a shrug, starting to walk towards the bike in lazy steps. “Hurry up,” she said as she turned towards me, the engine already rumbling like a warhorse excited to taste the wind. </p><p>I might have deliberately ignored her order, however casual, if I was in an earlier stage of seduction, but after the encounters in front of her door and in her office, a passive-aggressive display of authority was just unnecessary. Instead, I silently climbed at the backseat, my arms softly wrapped around her waist. </p><p>She didn’t wait for me to declare my readiness before launching the bike forward, speedier than it was safe. Unintentional, I assumed, based on her yelp, half excited, half panicked. She reduced the acceleration, and suddenly we found ourselves slowing down. She couldn’t help but glance backward with a downcast look on her face, or that was what I assumed with the helmet hiding her face. It seemed that she was expecting me to take back her toy, but mellowed out when she only found an encouraging nod. </p><p>Elated by the unexpected encouragement, her body perked up as once again she faced the horizon, and started to pick up speed in the bumpy earthen road we were in, driving us deeper towards the wilderness rather than going back to the highway, her hands tight on the grips. Her driving was a bit wobbly at first, but that quickly disappeared as she got used to the weight and the power of the bike, and the road started to disappear under her wheels. </p><p>I let her drive unmolested -literally- for several minutes, making sure that she had enough experience handling the device to prevent her from swerving dangerously in the smallest surprise. Surprises that I was about to deliver her. </p><p>A nasty bump on the road gave me the excuse I needed to tighten my grip around her waist, a move its significance she missed in the chaos of the moment, distracted by the effects of the bump on her body. She realized the consequences of her mistake a moment later, when she tried to shuffle reflexively, only to find out she was prevented from doing so by my rock-hard erection, lodged between her cheeks. </p><p>I was expecting her to lean forward awkwardly as much as she could without endangering the drive. Which was why I was surprised when she slid back instead. Impressive, I thought. I hadn’t been expecting her to lean in on the situation like that. But apparently, once again, I had miscalculated the impact of adrenaline on her mood, and more importantly, her arousal. </p><p>It was not a bad surprise, I thought as I modified my grip a bit, enough that my hands slid under her shirt, allowing me to gently caress her stomach. I could feel her shivering underneath my touch, her excitement spiking with the change of the situation. I took it as an invite when she slowed down the bike, letting my hands slide up until my thumbs were tracing against the underside of her bra.</p><p>But I stopped there rather than advancing towards her breasts, extending the tease she was suffering under. The simplest thing to do would be ordering her to stop, and start getting handsy safely on the side of the road. But not only that wasn’t very appealing for me, but also I was willing to bet Amelia wouldn’t enjoy it very much as well compared to alternatives, especially with the speed she got in the mood once she started driving. </p><p>So, I let things escalate. I wished it was possible to press my lips against her neck to tease her sensitive spots there, but unfortunately, our helmets prevented that. Not that it was a big concern, as I had discovered several other sensitive spots over her body that was easy to reach with my fingers even while she continued to drive. And I started teasing those, her excitement rising with every time my fingerprints caressed her bumps. </p><p>The easiest thing would be to pop open her jeans, carrying the action to the next step. But I felt that it wouldn’t give the situation the full excitement it deserved. I pulled one of my hands underneath her shirt instead, ignoring her body language, shouting disappointment. I could understand why she thought that I was pulling back, even though it couldn’t be further from the truth. I reached to my ankle, where I kept a small sheath hidden in my sock for emergencies, a habit I carried from the earlier days of being a street thug. I hadn’t had to rely on that after I had promoted to a leadership position, but before that, it saved my life a few times, and I simply hadn’t stopped carrying that, and kept it sharp by oiling and sharpening it once a month. </p><p>I waited until she slowed down to drive through a particularly bumpy section of the dirt road, and put my knife at the hem of her shirt, using the hand that was inside it to push it away from her skin. Then, I dragged it upwards sharply, years of experience handling a knife preventing me from harming her skin despite the relatively difficult position, her panicked yelp music to my ears. But more importantly, she kept driving, only slowing down a bit, suggesting that she was on board with what was about to happen more than her panicked cry indicated. </p><p>The fun was about to start…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>I have received no reply from Nancy after I have sent her the invitation, but I didn’t let it bother me. She wouldn’t be able to ignore my invitation with all the things I could hold above her head, namely the specter of the debt she owed, a set of photos while wearing clothes nonexistent for all practical purposes, and, last but not least, last night’s encounter where I caught her wet-handed in the middle of the living room, watching porn and masturbating while wearing the exact same clothing I had watched while she was masturbating… </p><p>No, there was no chance that she would ignore my invitation. </p><p>But that didn’t mean she would be quick to respond. The situation was too overwhelming for her to respond. After a quick detour to the shower, I was upstairs, sitting in front of the TV, wearing a pair of loose shorts and an equally large t-shirt, though my choice of movie wasn’t nearly as tame. I had picked an erotic movie, the same one that I watched with Madison and Katie, which started in a tame manner before turning up the steam to eleven. A small bottle of red wine was on the center of the table, to help to calm her nerves, but not enough to make her drunk even if she drank all of it alone.</p><p>However, I had to wait for more than a quarter hours for Nancy to appear, forcing me to rewind the movie to the beginning two times. I didn’t want her to come across one of the sex scenes in her first step. I needed a few minutes free of distraction to make her get used to the idea. </p><p>I turned towards the stairs when I heard the footsteps, only to see Nancy upstairs, wearing an ensemble that was quite a bit more conservative than her usual. A full-size pajama, with the exact same pattern Katie had. I was willing to bet that Nicole bought them for both girls as gifts. I waved at her absently and called her closer, glad that I just rewound the movie a minute ago. It gave me almost ten minutes to work on her until the first important checkpoint. </p><p>Her usual exorbitant manner was absent as she walked closer, her eyes firmly on the ground, bringing her similarity to Katie to the forefront. She stood at the side of the couch, choosing not to sit. “Sorry,” she murmured. “I missed the session today.” </p><p>“No worries,” I answered, doing my best not to leer or insert a saucy comment, a surprisingly difficult challenge in the wake of her sudden bout of shyness, tempting me to poke fun. “Why don’t you take a seat and we can talk.” </p><p>It was apparent that her preference ran towards a different direction, but the situation didn’t allow her to reject a casual demand for me, despite the elephant in the room, shouting too loud for even the most persistent to ignore. She took a seat, the deliberate place I had left for her, the exact spot she was sitting yesterday night. She looked towards the screen rather than me, a distraction I was alright with considering the trap that awaited her there. </p><p>Seconds ticked where we both watched the screen, other than the fleeting glances she threw at my side before retreating just as quick. I didn’t say anything, because each passing second made her even tenser. “So,” she whispered a minute later, her tone strung harder than a violin. </p><p>I could have played obstinate, but decided to give her a dash of mercy. “I wanted to talk to you about the photoshoot today, in particular, why didn’t you come despite agreeing beforehand.” I turned at her fully, my body language demanding her attention. She turned towards me, but her eyes wandered over my chest instead, unable to meet my eyes. “I know that you’re not a professional model, but coming on time is one of the things you can do regardless of the situation. Skipping it altogether without a message is, frankly, unacceptable.” </p><p>She ducked her head in remorse. “Sorry,” she whispered, low enough that I had to lean towards her to hear. “It just that… After the last night…” </p><p>“I understand that it was a difficult moment for you,” I said, acting like it was completely her fault that I had found myself in an abominable situation, abusing the fact that she wasn’t in a position to call on the differences in representation. “However, it’s a mistake everyone can do. You don’t need to beat yourself about it.” </p><p>“I know, but…” she started before trailing into silence. </p><p>I nodded before continuing in an intentionally flat tone. “Don’t worry, it’s normal. A lot of people enjoys exhibitionism.” </p><p>“What!” she exclaimed in a cracking tone, but continued in a voice less loud after I sent her an amused glance. “I’m not an exhibitionist!” </p><p>“Yes,” I deadpanned. “That’s true, which is why you were watching porn in the middle of the living room, dressed in a way that was sexier than being naked.” I took a breath before adding sarcastically. “Yes, that’s conclusive evidence that you’re not an exhibitionist.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to explain, but she fell silent as I raised my hand. </p><p>“You don’t need to feel bad. It’s completely normal. Technically, when you think about it, it’s an advantage for a model rather than a drawback.” I took a breath, letting the conversation stumble to boost the tension. “However, there is one rather important issue.”</p><p>“There is?” she said, leaning forward panickedly. </p><p>“The way you are feeling uncomfortable around me,” I explained. “It would make impossible to take your photos. Normally, I would have just waited for a few days until time cured you from the worst of it, but we need to finish the rest of the costumes tomorrow. If we can’t take the photos, I need to find a new model and take all the photos from scratch, which unfortunately would mean the cancellation of our deal.” </p><p>The rush of fear told me that I was in the position. “But we cannot,” she exclaimed loudly. </p><p>I shushed her before pointing at upstairs. She turned silent, fearfully glancing upstairs. “I agree. Which is why we need to make sure you’re relaxed with me once more.” </p><p>“How?” </p><p>In a fortuitous coincidence, I noticed the woman on the screen was reaching towards her button, signifying the start of the first explicitly erotic scene of the movie. “Exposure therapy,” I said, pointing at the screen. “We’re going to watch the movie together, and hopefully, you will be used to my presence. Simple, right?” </p><p>She opened her mouth, but instead of an answer, a strangled gasp escaped her mouth as the man in the screen decided that he was unhappy with the actress’ pace, and ripped the shirt off her body, launching a rough and explicit sex scene that would last for several hot minutes. But Nancy neither escaped nor closed her eyes, marking the success of the first phase by turning her attention towards the screen. </p><p>I smirked as I quickly poured two glasses of wine, pushing one towards her. She grabbed it like it was her lifeline, gulping half of it in one move. The rest didn’t survive a minute, and she passed the glass back. I refilled it, and she grabbed it once more, but this time sipping slower. </p><p>For the first scene, I neither said nor did anything, allowing her to come in terms with the situation, particularly with her choice. But during the second scene, which was even longer and steamier than the first scene. I slid closer to her, and grabbed her left hand. She looked at me in alarm, but I ignored it for a second in favor of pressing my thumb in her palm. “You’re still looking a bit tense, so a massage might be helpful,” I explained. She looked doubtful, but stayed silent, aware that her position wasn’t conducive to arguing. </p><p>“You’re tense,” I said as I finished her hand and moved up to her wrist. “When was the last time you got a massage?” </p><p>“It has been a while,” she answered, her voice tenser than her body, but at least, she was able to speak louder than a whisper. “As you remember, I’m a bit short on cash.” </p><p>“An artist’s path is difficult,” I said approvingly, avoiding to mention just how irresponsible she was being by relying on her stepmother to pay for her needs rather than getting a day job. After all, neither sound financial advice nor lessons in responsibility was especially useful as an aphrodisiac. Also, I wasn’t in a position to complain when it was her financial irresponsibility that likely forced Nicole to rent the basement in the first place, so I said nothing else than asking for her other hand after finishing her left, which forced me to slide closer to her. </p><p>“You’re good,” she said, the way she bit her lip suggesting that my approach was starting to work. I acted even slower when finishing her right, enjoying the way her heartbeat climbed higher and higher along with the movie’s intensity.  </p><p>After finishing her right, I pulled back, trying not to smile at her disappointed sigh. “Now, put your leg on the cushion,” I said, patting empty space in front of me. She did so instantly, and I put my fingers around her ankle and led her to a different position, her heel resting on my thigh, suggestively close to my crotch, a fact she was acutely aware, told by her fleeting peek.  </p><p>As I focused on the soles of her feet, our silence stretched even bolder, contrasted by the explicit moans and flesh hitting flesh on the screen. I was proud of my massage skills. While I never used them in a professional capacity, they allowed me to seduce quite a few sexy women that would be out of my league otherwise. And Nancy turned out to be susceptible as well, and the unusual developments of the last few days weren’t exactly making it easier for her to resist.  </p><p>“Are you comfortable?” I asked before climbing upwards on her leg. A nod and a moan were as clear as any answer I might receive, so I continued focusing on her calf. But then, instead of moving upwards on her thigh, I asked her to switch to her other foot, which forced her to sit towards me while leaning her back against the armrest as I mauled her other foot and calf. </p><p>I looked at her, examining her face without bothering to hide my attention, since her eyes were currently closed with pleasure. The second part of the plan was complete as well. “Turn over,” I ordered her. She looked at me, trying to understand what I was asking. “Lay on your chest across the couch,” I explained her more in detail. “Since we started, there is no harm in finishing the massage before moving downstairs, right?”  </p><p>“Sure,” she said, and would have managed to come across as casual if it wasn’t for her voice, cracking at the last second. Her blush was another clue for her mood as she shifted in her place. I stood up, allowing her to sprawl across the length of the seat. Then, I climbed on the seat as well, my knees on both sides of her waist as I pressed my hands on her shoulders, slowly moving down. When I arrived at her back, purrs had become commonplace as my hands untied her muscle knots bit by bit. But more importantly, the movie was still running on the screen, adding a certain heated edge of her otherwise relaxed purrs. </p><p>I slid my hands under her top when I arrived at the small of her back. She looked at me for a second before escaping my gaze, leaving me free to work on her flesh without the unwelcome layer of fabric. I backtracked my earlier path, slowly forcing her top upwards until it was bunched above her breasts, which unfortunately were under cover of an ugly bra. It was a pity, because I was hoping that she was still wearing the set I had given her. </p><p>Her back finished, I slid down until I hovered above her calves, giving me the opportunity to work on her legs. I pressed my palms against her thigh, but it was annoying to feel the texture of the fabric on my skin after enjoying her silkiness. The solution was simple. “Do you mind?” I asked even as I hooked my fingers at the waist of her bottom, and pulled it down before she could even process the question in her distracted state, revealing a pair of equally unattractive panties. </p><p>A panicked yelp escaped her mouth, but my hands were already on her thighs, working wonders on her tense flesh. I ignored the way she was watching me, focusing on the movement of my hands, and soon, she decided against speaking, and turned back to her job. But it wasn’t the last time she found herself pondering on the same question, turning towards me in conflict whenever my fingers drove closer to the area under the coverage of her panties. However, I fastidiously avoided there, even when she started showing the signs of thick arousal, squeezed under the effects of the movie, my hands, and the theoretical danger of being caught. </p><p>I had other plans.</p><p>Her moans were getting loud enough to break through her efforts to hide their presence when I stood up without a warning. “W-what?” she stammered, caught flatfooted with the sudden change. </p><p>“The massage is finished,” I explained as I reached the remote and turned off the TV. “We still have a lot of costumes to go through.” </p><p>“But…” she said, then trailed towards the silence as she saw my smug expression, one I had pushed to the foreground intentionally. </p><p>“Okay,” she said, changing her approach as she stood up, her intention to take revenge obvious on her face. Just as I planned. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said, and she stood up. She fixed her top, but surprisingly, instead of pulling on the bottom, she let it fell on the ground, and stepped out of it. She was deliberately slow as she leaned forward took them in her hand, giving me a glimpse of her rear, a move that would be much more effective if she bothered to pick some decent-looking underwear. Still, it wasn’t enough reason to prevent me from enjoying as she walked in front of me, an excessive sway on her hips. </p><p>“The costume?” she asked after stepping on the basement floor, even as she pulled her top to reveal her firm belly. I pointed behind the screen. She nodded even as she started to walk there, letting her top to drop on the ground midway. She had already untied her bra when she arrived at her destination. She disappeared behind the screen, but not before letting her bra to drop on the floor. It was a nice way of revenge, I noted with a large smile. </p><p>My smile widened further as I heard a shocked gasp behind the screen, and a bit of surprised. The next costume wasn’t as revealing as the librarian one she had worn the last time. I turned on the set lights and finished other preparations while waiting for her to step out. “Are you ready?” I asked after two minutes passed, more than enough for her to finish changing, especially since she was already naked when she stepped behind. </p><p>“Almost,” she answered with a muffled voice, making me wonder whether the maid costume had some special significance for her. A few seconds later, she stepped out in the open. I froze, preventing my jaw from falling, a challenge that took all of my strength. Thankfully, she was too busy walking carefully to notice my attention. </p><p>I shook my head to distract myself from the exquisite view. Looking her in her French-Maid uniform, or more importantly, the distinct lack of underwear, which wasn’t really hard to notice thanks to the fluffy skirt that was barely qualified to be a belt, and a top that might as well don’t exist, considering it was quite transparent, and was about as wide as a hand. Now, I understood the reason for her reticence. Apparently, she managed to miss the underwear that was waiting for her there. Still, it was interesting that she chose to step out like that by assuming that was the totality of the costume, with no resistance other than a slight delay. </p><p>“Are you ready?” I asked as I pointed the camera at her, and let the flash explode. Her gaze didn’t contain anything that could be described as readiness, but nevertheless, she turned her side to the camera and let arms fall, giving me a simple pose. “Perfect,” I said. “Now, turn towards the camera.” </p><p>She did so, letting me enjoy an unobstructed sight of her firm breasts, discounting the frail texture of her strapless top that left top naked for any practical definition of the term. I took a few, then asked her to lean forward, which increased her cleavage even harder. It didn’t reveal anything that wasn’t already visible, but it was an erotic sight nevertheless. “Give me a twirl,” I requested. She looked at me with a look that begged for mercy, but a mocking smirk was the reply she got. “We can do something weaker if you can’t handle,” I added, doing my best to copy the mannerism of a parent, bored from the antics of his child. </p><p>“No need,” she answered quickly before completing a standing turn, but her body wasn’t as courageous as her words, with her hands pressing her skirt tight to keep it immobile. The duster in her hand was making her current pose even stiffer. </p><p>“You need to keep your arms away from your skirt,” I added. “They are ruining the dynamism.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to say, but I cut her off. </p><p>“It’s okay if you can’t handle it,” I added in a fake generosity, knowing it would push her more than anything angry or demanding, especially in her current state, neither her unsatisfied arousal nor her tipsiness helping her decision making the process. She glared at me balefully, but also pulled her arms to the side and did another twirl. Free from the encumbrance of her hands, her skirt flew up, giving me a fleeting view of her bottom that I managed to immortalize with the assistance of the technology. </p><p>“Perfect,” I said with a glee that didn’t help to quell her anger, but if I was reading the signs right, was quite useful to fan the flames of her arousal. An interesting dichotomy, enjoying her exhibitionism while resenting me for forcing her to that position by strong-arming her pride. “Now, why don’t you dust the chair in front of you,” I added. </p><p>This time, she didn’t lose any time making eye contact, just turned and starting dusting the chair, the angle of her body pulling her skirt up enough to give me an unrestricted view of her body, especially her nether lips, which was wet with arousal. I could see her stiffen with every flash, but impressively, she managed to keep the position until I asked her to get a tamer pose. </p><p>“That’s enough,” I called her off, as while it was fun, I actually had to finish the costumes, for which she needed to wear some underwear, regardless of the attractiveness of the alternative. </p><p>“It’s finished already?” she said. “It was much quicker than before.” </p><p>“Finished?” I asked. “No, you need to finish your preparations so we can start taking the actual photos?”</p><p>“What do you mean by actual photos?” she asked, surprised. </p><p>“I mean that you need to go and put rest of the costume so that we can take the photos that I will send to the client,” I explained.</p><p>“Rest of the costume?” she whispered, struck with a sudden realization. </p><p>“The underwear,” I spelled out. “Unless you’re proposing that we send the clients the photos we just took.” </p><p>“But, there is no underwear there.”</p><p>“I’m sure you just missed them.” </p><p>“But…” she said before trailing into silence, a blush creeping up her neck as she realized that gave a range of explicit poses in her own violation. She dashed behind the screen, which incidentally gave me another stretched out view of her bottom, which I immortalized in just my memories. </p><p>A minute later, Nancy stepped out in the open once more, a set of black lacy underwear covering her body strategically. Of course, her clothing was modest only compared to its previous state, as a set of underwear and a skimpy French-Maid outfit could only cover a minuscule area. I took the required photos in silence other than the required directions to correct her posing. In parallel, I had an amusing spectacle, the shift of her emotions during the shoot, from a shocked shame to a smoldering mixture of anger and arousal. In the light of her earlier suggestiveness, I was quite hopeful about the results. </p><p>The first sign of things to come was her call a minute after she disappeared behind the screen once more. “Could you help me,” she called. “I’m having a bit of trouble putting this one on.” </p><p>I did my best not to run behind the screen, keen to see the next costume on her. The costume consisted of a pair of lace-up boots tall enough to come to the middle of her thighs, a pleated miniskirt, a corset with deep cleavage, and fishnet stockings to complete the set. All black to contrast sinfully against her flaming-red hair. I couldn’t wait to see them on her, especially in their half-worn state. </p><p>The sight in there didn’t disappoint. The first thing I noticed as I stepped inside was the sight of her naked back. I stopped, trailing her spine with sight until it disappeared under her miniskirt, devouring her delicate back, which looked much sexier in costume compared to earlier, where she was in her unflattering pajamas. The fishnets enhanced the view further, making her delicious enough to eat. A cough disrupted my concentration. I looked up, only to see her looking at me with a sense of victory, an exact same expression I carried earlier. “Could you be a dear and pull my zipper up, Stephen,” she said, acting more confident than she did all night.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure, my dear,” I answered as I took a step forward, letting my breath to fall on her neck as took a hold of her zipper. I pulled it up, letting my fingers drag along her spine. She didn’t give a sign of complaint, but I could feel her heartbeat picking up with my touch. “Is that all?” I asked, trying not to sound too reluctant to stop, but her smirk suggested that my success was debatable. </p><p>“Actually, could you help me to put the boots on as well,” she added. “The corset is stiffer than I expected.” </p><p>“Not at all,” I answered, gesturing her to sit down on the only foldable chair in the dressing section. I turned back to pick up the boots, and when I turned back, she was already sitting, her hands pressing on her skirt to prevent the sight of her underwear. A bit excessive considering our earlier encounters, but it made her look sexier, so I fell on my knees in front of her without a word of protest. </p><p>She raised her fishnet covered foot, and I wrapped my fingers around her ankle, leading it gently towards the boot. “Is it comfortable?” I asked. </p><p>“Very,” she answered with a giggle as her foot slid tight, feeling confident now that she was back to a position of power, at least in her own perception. We repeated it for the other, then I kept my head down as I started to tie them from the bottom, trying to look like I was just being attentive, but the real objective was to hide my predatory smirk from her. I didn’t want to make her aware where things had come to. </p><p>However, I soon learned that it wasn’t only me that a surprise prepared. Her legs were firmly closed at first, trying to prevent me from catching a glimpse of her panties, or so I assumed. A few seconds later, when I was tying the laces near her knee, I learned that it would be impossible for me to catch a glimpse. The reason was simple, she didn’t have any, a fact that she had a great pleasure informing me if the sensual way she parted her legs was any indicator, giving me an extended view. </p><p>I couldn’t help but look up, only to see her watching me an enticing mixture of reticence and smugness, born from the clash of her desires and her morals, the latter turning into tatters under my extended assault. Still, even her partial smugness was enough for me to abandon my sense of restraint. </p><p>If she wanted to play, we would play.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>That night, Nancy had missed her appointment. </p><p>Normally, I would be annoyed with something like that. Regardless of everything else, I expect a certain level of professionalism from my models, and punctuality was one of them. I would have gone upstairs to drag her down despite her protest, uncaring how awkward she was feeling after our last encounter. </p><p>But this time, the opportunity to get a bit of rest was quite welcome. After all, I had spent most of the afternoon trying to fuck Nicole into an unconscious rag, a very challenging target. I was ultimately successful, but not without three hours of concentrated effort that left me bone-weary. </p><p>On the positive side, it created a spectacular example of homemade porn, one that would have made a mint if I released it on the web. Unfortunately, while I was a total bastard, I was a possessive one. These moments I had recorded with Nicole belonged only to me, to be hidden in an encrypted section of my hard-disk. I had no intention of sharing that with anyone else. </p><p>So, I spent rest of the day after carrying Nicole to her room by lazing around in the room, even taking a power nap just to be able to keep my eyes open as I tried to finish my work. </p><p>It was past eleven, and I was fiddling with the photos I had taken in my last session, preparing to sleep, when my impromptu break was interrupted. My door opened without a warning. I looked, only to see Katie climbing down the stair, an unfamiliar expression on her face. Anger dominated her face, turning her usual innocence into something sharper, more mature. It might even be intimidating if she had been wearing something other than her fluffy pajamas. </p><p>It was amusing to watch her walk down the stairs. Her steps started strong, exuding self-confidence every time they touched the stairs. But then, our eyes met, a questioning expression on my face, and her determination started to flail, her steps getting softer as she drew closer, unable to sustain her anger under adversary. </p><p>I watched her draw closer, doing nothing other than changing the photo I was working on. It might have been hard to explain why I had a picture of her stepmother on my screen, but not as hard as explaining the revealing state of her dress. “We need to talk,” she said, unknowingly repeating the same phrase Nicole did earlier today. It was even less intimidating than Nicole’s, who managed to keep her expression straight until the end of the sentence, rather than slipping away before even opening her mouth. </p><p>“Sure,” I said, not bothering the hide my smirk. “Go ahead. What’s it about?” </p><p>“It’s about the last night…” Katie said, but her nerves failed before she could complete her statement. </p><p>She was adorable, her words dwindling to nothingness, vanquished by her shyness. I decided to help her a bit. “Is this about the cocktail I brought?” I asked, and she nodded. “That was spectacular acting from your part. Congratulations.” </p><p>“What?” came her eloquent reply. </p><p>“It was very clever of you,” I explained. “Understanding my plan without even requiring a hint. You’re really impressive.” </p><p>“Your plan?” she asked, her anger long drowned in her confusion.</p><p>“Yes, my plan of convincing Madison that she was getting drunk through the power of suggestion despite the bottle having almost no alcohol in it. And you understood the plan instantly, acting like you were drunk, easily convincing Madison as well.” </p><p>It was a ridiculous excuse, of course, but young women had a tendency to jump that kind of excuses if it meant avoiding looking foolish. Katie let out a nervous laugh, proving she was no exception to the rule. “Yes, all planned,” she said, in a manner that wouldn’t trick a child, but I acted like I bought it.  </p><p>“It’s a pity her cousin screwed up our plan with her surprise visit. If it continued, we would have really humiliated Madison. Anyway, have you done anything after I left.” </p><p>“Nothing, we just dressed and went to sleep,” she said, and this time I believed her. The mortification of getting caught would have sobered her up even if she had been actually drunk, and the psychological variety never had a chance.    </p><p>“Anyway, is that all? I’m a bit tired,” I continued, making a show of yawning. She nodded, outwardly relaxed, but I was familiar with her expressions to catch a hint of disappointment. “But once again, since you bothered to sneak all the way down here, it would be rude to send you away without another training session.” </p><p>“Wait-” she tried to say, but it was too late. My fingers were already around her wrist, and a soft tug later, she was on my lap, not showing even a hint of resistance. The motion cut her words half, and before she could restart, my lips were on hers, stealing the rest. I put one of my hands to the small of her back, a gentle caress enough to destroy her inclination to struggle, excitement beating reticence. </p><p>The kiss lasted for a minute which saw her resistance dead and buried. “We can skip it for tonight if you want,” I offered after pulling back for a breather, feeling confident about her answer. If her diluted irises and quickened lips weren’t clue enough, she had moved deeper on my lap during the kiss, deliberately ending up on my shaft. </p><p>“Maybe not,” Katie whispered, still unable to keep her eyes up as she declared her desires. “There is no harm in a few minutes of practice, right?” </p><p>“Good choice,” I said before leaning for another kiss. This time, she met my lips midway instead of waiting passively. I probed her lips with my tongue, and her lips parted open, but only to allow her tongue out, which started battling mine midway. She was still hesitant, and it would have been an easy task to dominate her, but I allowed her to continue, not wanting to discourage her from showing initiative. </p><p>But with she was distracted with the French kiss, I had the opportunity to push her in a different direction. I slid my hands underneath her shirt, but she barely paid attention, distracted by my lips. One hand, I used to rub her belly softly, the other slowly climbing upwards towards the hooks of her bra, which unlocked easily a twist of my fingers. Surprisingly, that too went unnoticed, or unremarked. </p><p>The thick spell of desire started coursing through my veins, destroying the last vestiges of my exhaustion much better than any drug could. I grabbed her shirt, pulling it up enough to reveal the loose hold of her bra, but I had no intention of leaving it on. I continued to pull it upward, forcing her to separate from the kiss, her arms rising up reflexively. Her expression didn’t shift when I pulled her shirt off, but it flickered when her bra received the same treatment before she could lower her arms. But another kiss was enough to send that seed of doubt back to slumber. </p><p>For a while, I just kissed her passively, waiting for her nakedness to become the new normal, then I let my hands loose once more, exploring her naked top. I gently caressed her breasts, small but firm, tempting me to lean down and suck them until they were littered with my mark. But I continued kissing her, so my hands were deputized for that mission. And they were quite successful, if the sudden moan that left her mouth as I squeezed her nipples, barely muffled by my own lips. </p><p>It was the time for the next stage, I decided as I wrapped my arms around her waist before standing up. Her legs wrapped around me reflexively, allowing me to walk to my bed easily. I deposed her on the bed, and she loosened her legs around me. I pulled back, but not without another aggressive move. My fingers hooked around her panties, and before she could notice, she was naked, discounting a pair of animal-printed socks. </p><p>And just like that, her doubts were pushed to the surface once more. But it was too late, as I was crouched between her legs, her nether lips just an inch away from my lips. Her lips opened up in preparation of a hesitant comment, likely about to ask me to stop, but I was quicker. My lips closed over her inner thigh, near her nether lips, close enough to that the smell of arousal filled my nose, and I pressed my teeth against her sensitive skin. Not hard enough to actually hurt, but enough to make her cry in shock. Then, I moved to her nether lips, teasing her knob with a few measured brush of my tongue, converting her cry to an unrestricted moan. </p><p>I was glad that the voice insulation of the basement was good, because her cry was strong enough to bring the rest of the house to us if it wasn’t for that. And I really didn’t fancy explaining it to Nicole. I had a feeling that even the domination that I established over her wouldn’t be enough. “Try to keep it low,” I said as I raised my eyes towards her rapidly reddening face before turning my attention to her slit once more. </p><p>“Stephen-,” she started, only to devolve into another wordless cry, thankfully not as loud as the previous one. It was good for my ego, but not as good for keeping the risk of getting caught minimal. My tongue flickered rapidly, each earning its own cry, but the volume, she slowly got under control. It was still loud, but not enough to be heard from outside. </p><p>I took it as an opportunity to turn on the intensity. My lips joined the fray, and I started alternating between kisses and brushes, my fingers digging to her thighs. For someone as inexperienced as her, it was a hopeless battle, and she fell back, shuddering, just a minute later as the sharp taste of her arousal filled my mouth. At least, she had the foresight of pressing her fingers on her mouth, muffling her cries. </p><p>I stood up and removed my pants and underwear as she lay on my bed, trying to catch her breath. I aligned my shaft to her entrance, only to be stopped by a weak whisper. “Stop,” she asked. “I’m a pledge member,” she said, showing a small platinum ring on her left hand. I had to bite down the first response that came to my lips, nor I plunged deep inside her like I wished to. Annoying as it was, I would never go against a woman’s explicit wishes. </p><p>I didn’t let it sour my mood. Her words lacked conviction, meaning that a bit more push, and she could be convinced. A bit of pointed push, and she would be jumping up and down across my length. </p><p>But, it was too easy, I decided. Yes, I could have pushed her for her final surrender, but it would be much more fun to tease her until she surrendered in her own violation. “As you wish,” I said, sitting on the bed next to her before tapping on my lap. “Still, that leaves a couple of interesting tricks I can teach you.” I stopped for a second, turning my best half-smile to her. “Only if you’re willing to learn, of course.” </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to decide, but the result was never in doubt. She gave a small nod that was almost indiscernible from the aftershocks of a climax. I offered my hand, and her fingers wrapped around mine. A strong pull, and she was in my lap once more, but her back was pointing at my chest. “Let’s change things a bit,” I whispered, dragging my fingers softly on her arm. Distracted by the sensation of my fingers, she failed to realize the implications when both of my hands found her waist and lifted her up, only to drop her on my length. </p><p>A panicked gasp escaped her mouth, but it was unnecessary, because I positioned her so that she was sitting over the length instead of the tip, a fact she realized just a second later, her panic dispersing. “Move up and down,” I whispered into her ear, my hands wandering over her body, leaving fleeting impressions in their wake. She hesitated, so I slid my hands to her buttocks and pushed her forward until her nether lips were dangerously near my shaft. I slid my hand up once more, leaving her free to set up her own pace. She slid back and stalled there for a second, enough to make me worry maybe it was too much for her. </p><p>My worries turned out to be unfounded. She moved forward more, a bit less than what I pushed her for the first time. She didn’t stall, moving back and forth in the limited area her first voluntary movement drew, at least at first. After a minute, her moans were added to the flow, and more importantly, her range of movement started to increase. Soon, she even passed the point where I marked at the beginning, coming dangerously close to the crown.</p><p>I was so tempted to raise it just a bit, so that she would impale herself on the way back, but I held myself back. Instead, I leaned to her ear, and whispered. “There is no harm in just sliding in the tip,” I reminded her. Her body pressed against mine, I felt the shudder that passed through her body as it passed through mine. Her lips gave no answer, not that they needed to when she moved even further across my length, tracing the curvature until her entrance was aligned with the crown, coating it with her juices. She froze, hesitant, but her courage faltered, and she pulled back. </p><p>I said nothing, just continued to caress her body encouragingly as she repeated the same motion several times, only to falter at the last moment. But with each repeat, the delay got extended, until that time she finally managed to push through her own reticence, and a tight warmth wrapped the top. I said nothing, busy combating my own desire to pull her deep into my shaft. She pulled back, trailing the path her rhythmic movement had created. </p><p>I had been hoping for her to gather enough courage, or arousal, to push through the useless mental block that fundamentalist assholes called a pledge, but in the end, I caused her to break it inadvertently. I squeezed her nipple hard while nibbling her neck at the exact moment her nether lips were grasping the crown. The rush of pleasure hit her hard, causing her legs to tremble powerlessly. Her balance lost, she found herself impaled deep, her barrier only resisting for a split second before suffering its destruction. </p><p>A moan escaped her mouth as she found herself skewered with an unfamiliar presence. I could see that she intended that moan to sound like a sound of protest, but her body, after a strong orgasm and a second one that was closing, had different ideas, turning it into a moan of pleasure instead. She tried to extract herself, but before she could complete the motion, I wrapped my hands on her torso and pulled her back. “Let me go,” she moaned, but her tone of voice disagreed with her message. </p><p>“I can,” I whispered seductively, like the snake trying to convince Eve that she already pulled the apple from the tree, and what harm a bite could bring. “But the accident has already happened, and what’s done is done. Why don’t we use it as another teaching opportunity instead.” </p><p>“I don’t know-” she murmured, but her words were cut early with another cry when my fingers found her clit, teasing softly as my shaft stretched her walls. </p><p>“What’s the harm,” I whispered. “After all, it’s just training.” </p><p>Once again, the silence stretched while I waited impatiently. “Yes, it’s just training,” she murmured after almost a minute later, more to convince herself. I loosened my grip around her waist, and she started to move upwards, only to stop at the last second and reversing the direction, allowing my girth to push against her walls once more. I stood passively as she repeated the motion a few times, waiting for her to get used to my presence. </p><p>Then, without a warning, my arms tightened around her waist once more and I stood up. She let out a yelp when she found herself in the air, but my grip was strong. “Hold tight,” I ordered, and her legs wrapped around my waist. I started walking towards the bed, each step pushing my shaft even deeper into her untouched territory. </p><p>When we arrived at the destination, I threw her on the bed before she could even realize the shift. She lay on her back, her legs parted open, anticipation rapidly dominating her face as I took a position over her. Her expression was affirmation enough, so I leaned forward and slide inside her, a delicious expression of pleasure dominating her face. Missionary was such an underrated position. Yes, it could be monotonous in repetition, but in the end, everything was. But there was a certain magic in examining the face of a young woman experiencing the fruits of the womanhood for the first time. </p><p>Her expression of pleasure was in agreement. Her lips opened for a cry that threatened to break through the sound resistance of the room, and I grabbed them with another domineering kiss, made much easier thanks to the comfortable position. Her cry vibrated in my mouth, tempting me to impale her even harder, which in turn made her moan even louder, in a divine example of positive feedback. Unused to the pleasures of the flesh, it didn’t take long before she shuddered under the throes of another orgasm. </p><p>I pulled back from the kiss, but deliberately stayed inside her, sliding in a leisure manner as she helplessly tightened around me, her trembles intensifying whenever I was fully buried inside her. Her eyes were closed as she was dominated under a rush of unfamiliar sensations, helped by the gentle caresses of my hands exploring her body. </p><p>A blush spread on her face a minute later, when the haze dissipated enough for her to open her eyes. It wasn’t a redness of pleasure, but common shyness, born from the realization of what just had happened. Pulling back and letting her gather herself would be the kind thing to do, which was why I pushed into her until I was fully sheathed and left another peck on her lips. “How is my prodigal student?” </p><p>“Good,” she managed to whisper, unable to meet my eyes. </p><p>“Perfect then, do you want to move onto the next module?” I asked. </p><p>She froze at the implication that it wasn’t the end of what carnal pleasure offered. On her face, I could see an alliance of curiosity and desire, fighting against exhaustion and remaining tatters of her sense of propriety, but unfortunately, the latter was victorious. “I have school tomorrow,” she managed to murmur. </p><p>But despite her assertion, she made no move of pulling back, looking at me with a mixture of anticipation and reprehension. It was clear that she would continue if I pushed. But I pulled back after one last peck. I wanted her to wait for a few days in anticipation for the next step, not to mention I wanted to see whether she would be able to gather enough courage to visit in her own violation. I stood up and passed her the clothes laying on the floor, using the opportunity to check the cameras to see whether Nancy was around. Thankfully, she wasn’t there for another evening session, as it would be difficult to explain why Katie was leaving my room in the middle of the night with a very distinct limp. </p><p>She looked at me like she was asking me to turn back, but received only a smirk and a shrug in response. It was enough to remind her just how ridiculous her request was. She quickly pulled her clothes on, and turned to the stairs. “Are you going to leave without a hug,” I said to her, raising my arms invitingly. </p><p>Her steps were hesitant, but it didn’t change the fact that each step drove her closer to my clutches. She wrapped her arms around me, but it wasn’t a gentle hug that I had in mind. I hooked my arm around her waist before dipping her back, my lips seeking hers once more in an attempt to replicate the famous photograph of the sailor. </p><p>The kiss lasted for another half a minute, and when I pulled back, the excitement was the dominant expression on her face once more. She looked at me with anticipation, expecting an encore. “You’re already late for bed,” I said with a smirk. “You don’t want to be exhausted for tomorrow’s lessons, right?” </p><p>“Of course not,” she said, but her tone didn’t agree, suggesting that missing a day’s worth of lesson through exhaustion wasn’t as bad compared to the alternatives. But even after what we just did, she lacked the willpower to assert her desires openly, so with a sigh, she turned and climbed the stairs, her limp ticking my archaic male pride. </p><p>When she disappeared at the door, I switched to my camera and watched her until she was in her own room. However, there was one little problem, during the session I hadn’t had my release, causing my shaft to stand uncomfortably. For a moment, I considered paying a quick visit to Nicole, using her to finish what her stepdaughter had started, but then, an even better idea came to my mind. </p><p>I sent a quick message to Nancy, inviting her to the living room for a talk… </p>",

    "title": "Dominating the Boss 10",
    "content": "<p>I left the office just a step behind Natalie, stopping for a second to lock the door, intent on following her to her office, curious about Brenda’s reaction. I realized my miscalculation when she walked towards the bathroom rather than her office. It made sense. While Brenda was aware of the treatment Natalie was receiving, Natalie didn’t know that Brenda knew, so she had to visit the bathroom in a wasteful attempt to hide the signs of her treatment. </p><p>Onward for the second best option, I decided, still following the original route. Soon, I found myself in front of the desk of my favorite blond, Brenda. She looked surprised by my sudden presence. “Hello, sweetie,” I said as I leaned on her desk. “How are you doing?” </p><p>She glanced around to see whether someone was around. She spoke only after confirming there were no one around. “Have you finished with Natalie,” she asked conspiratorially, not bothering to hide her excitement. </p><p>“I did,” I answered. “For today, at least,” I added afterthought after a moment’s pause. “You don’t seem too broken about it?” </p><p>Brenda shrugged. “Why should I? It’s her fault that I’m in this mess, and I can’t be bothered if she was getting what she deserved,” she said dismissively even as she looked at her nails. </p><p>I didn’t bother to explain that it was her faults that started the whole mess for them. For Brenda, it didn’t matter, especially since Natalie was rapidly coming under my control as well. There was only a boss at the start for Brenda, and after some upheaval, she ended up having only one boss once again. The identity of the boss didn’t matter much for her, especially not when she was clearly enjoying the treatment she was receiving. The fact that I didn’t sell her to Natalie likely also factored in her thoughts. “The king is dead, long live the king,” I quipped. </p><p>Brenda looked at me confusedly. “What the hell are you talking about, what king?” </p><p>I sighed. “Education in this country is really going down,” I murmured in sadness. Though, it was my mistake to expect a cultural complexity from her. She was basically a perfect mixture of blow-up doll and reality-show level gossip. No substance. “Don’t worry about it,” I added. </p><p>Brenda nodded, uncaring of the insult that targeted more than a decade of her life. But she would have gone crazy if I called her on her haircut or something equally asinine. But her shallowness just made her a better toy, so I waved my concerns off. “How do you enjoy sitting,” I asked instead, reminding her of the special toy she had received in my room. </p><p>That managed to break through her mentality. “It’s okay,” she murmured. </p><p>“You don’t feel any discomfort, do you?” I added, and she shook her head. “Excellent,” I added as I reached my pocket. “So, you won’t have any problem with me doing that?” I added, and flipped the switch of it. </p><p>A moan pushed itself through her lips before she could gather herself as the device that was currently lodged in her sensitive spot buzzed without a warning in a short but intensive burst. “What was-” she started, but her words were cut short when I pressed the button again to cut her argument short. It worked, but this time, she managed to press her hands on her mouth to prevent her exclamation in a timely manner. </p><p>“Do you like the secret feature of your gift,” I said with a smirk. Her mouth opened, ready for an angry remark, but Natalie chose that moment to walk in. “Hi, boss,” I said cheerfully. </p><p>“Nathan,” she murmured, doing her best to sound flat, but that was challenging even for her after the treatment she received for the last hour. Not only I had invaded her most sensitive spots repeatedly, I was still at the entrance of her office, making her receive continuous annoying treatment. “I thought you were going to take off early? Is there anything urgent.” </p><p>“Nope,” I answered. “I was just chatting with Brenda. She has such a fascinating … mind,” I said, looking at her cleavage in an obvious manner just to leave no doubt what I was talking about. </p><p>“I see,” Natalie answered, doing her best to hide her annoyance at my presumption of hitting her secretary. She was cornered badly enough to surrender her body to me, to just gain enough time to fix the issues. Sacrificing her secretary wasn’t something she would shy from. Too bad that she had no idea of my reach making her sacrifices moot. “If it’s just it, I have a couple of things to handle before leaving,” she added. </p><p>“Actually,” I said, stopping her walk. She turned with trepidation, afraid what I was going to ask. “Since we’re both going to leave early, there is no point for Brenda to wait until six, right? And since she is going to act as my secretary as well, it would help if we know each other better.” As I explained, I switched Brenda’s dildo once more, but in a lower setting. Brenda looked at me warningly, but I just smirked. </p><p>Natalie was too distracted to notice the interplay. She was smart enough to recognize the opportunity I was dangling in front of her. A date with Brenda would bring her to my confidence, which then could be used for Natalie’s purposes. Too bad that Brenda was already a double-agent. For a moment, Natalie was lost in thought, her expression shifting too quick to catch as her instincts fought with her logic. “I guess there would be no harm. It would be a team-building event.”</p><p>I smirked. “And since it’s a team building event, we can charge it to the company, right?” I asked, much to her annoyance. Admittedly, the whole point was to annoy her, not like I needed the fifty dollar dinner budget. </p><p>Natalie took a deep breath as she paused to suppress her emotions, desperately trying to hide her anger. As a woman that prided herself on the control she had over her workplace, this kind of small quips must have been driving her crazy. Still, I was presenting her with an opportunity that was too good to miss, so in the end, she nodded in acceptance, trying to hide her own reaction. “Of course. It’s for the best of the company,” she said, somehow managing not to sound stark-mad, but I knew her enough to see her anger was barely suppressed. </p><p>“Excellent. Come on then, Brenda. Let’s go.” Brenda looked at Natalie, waiting for her confirmation, and I used the opportunity to twist the dial-up another degree, making Brenda jerk in surprise. Natalie looked suspicious for a moment, but then she shrugged it off, nodding in approval.</p><p>“Just a second,” Brenda said, trying to sound reluctant, but she failed the act. Luckily, Natalie had too many other concerns, failing to focus on that particular one. After one last glance, Natalie disappeared into her office, leaving me alone with Brenda. “Stop that!” she said, her hand reaching to her posterior. </p><p>I pushed a sharp expression on my face, reinforced with cold anger. “Did you just order me to do something?” I said with a tone barely above a whisper, but its flatness made it more effective than a shout. </p><p>“N-no,” Brenda stammered, suddenly whiter. </p><p>“Good,” I said in a much more casual tone. “I was sure that you’re smart enough to avoid such a mistake. It’s nice to have confirmation.” I always found that people under my power responded much better to a soft but unyielding tone much better than a boundless shout. The latter sometimes worked, but its effectiveness tended to erode quickly. Cold anger had a way of sticking with a person. “Let’s go, then,” I said, gesturing her to stand and walk. </p><p>She stood next to me without any argument, something she would never do a week ago, afraid to be seen with the outcast of the office. But my position had been mainly driven by the fear of Natalie the staff had, and my change of office at the top floor told everyone that I suddenly had a position above them in the corporate ladder, and since they were nothing more than peons, they accepted it helplessly. They still expected a retaliation, fearful lemmings they were, but I had no intention of bringing the hammer right now. </p><p>But these developments meant that Brenda could walk next to me obediently without any loss of prestige in office rankings. I shook my head dismissively. Sometimes, office life was worse than schoolyard. I glanced around as we walked, amused by the way people avoided my gaze, likely expecting me to abuse my newfound authority bluntly to punish them for their earlier transgressions. Well, they were correct in their conclusions. I wasn’t a forgiving person, and I was going to make every single one of them pay, just that I didn’t feel a particular hurry for that. </p><p>One eye fell to a short man with graying hair. Mike, one of the worst offenders before my sudden promotion. And now, he was a member of the team under my direct control. Teaching him the error of his ways would be amusing. I just needed to decide whether I should directly fire him, or slowly torture him first. </p><p>But that was a decision for another day. Today belonged to Brenda. And speaking of her, she could deal with another dash of challenge, I decided, turning the intensity of her device even higher. She managed to cover her yelp with a sudden cough, and turned at me with a begging expression, but I shrugged, indicating that she needed to deal with. She maintained eye-contact until I let another tendril of anger to slip onto the surface, and her gaze slid away. </p><p>After a few more steps, it was the time to push things even more. “Try to act normal,” I said as I raised the intensity of the device by two, just below the maximum setting. Brenda looked alarmed, but somehow, she managed to avoid making a noise. We passed near several cubicles, a persistent buzzing not unlike a vibrating cellphone accompanying us with each step. </p><p>I was watching Brenda walk with admiration. She was holding herself up magnificently despite the unfamiliar presence of a vibrating dildo in the depths of her bowel. Yes, her face was covered with a blush, and her steps were suspiciously small, not to mention she was biting her lips playfully, but at least she managed to avoid moaning obviously. And with the rest of the people on the floor avoiding my gaze, there was a high chance that she managed to hide it. </p><p>And if someone managed to see it… Well, it wasn’t exactly my problem, was it?</p><p>We stood in front of the elevator, and Brenda turned her back to the rest of the office, trying to hide her red face, and her lips open to allow her panting helplessly. I was tempted to ask her a question, but was stopped by the pleading expression in her green eyes. She deserved a measure of mercy, I decided, letting her stay silent until the elevator arrived. </p><p>Lucky for her, the elevator was empty when arrived, so she hadn’t had to hide her shudder as she threw herself inside. I walked in a much more measured pace. She slammed the basement floor button, where my new parking spot was, and the door slammed closed. Hidden from the view of office staff, Brenda had no reason to hide her voice. Her lips parted, and a long, lingering moan escaped its prison, erotic enough to tempt me. I would have stopped the elevator and had my way with her, but that was too dangerous even for my risk appetite. </p><p>Instead, I leaned back and watched her beautiful struggle was she moaned again and again, her body trembling in a way that put her assets to an excellent view. I might have risked doing something more, but it was still work hours, and someone could easily drop-by. </p><p>But no one did, making me regret missing the opportunity. The door opened, revealing the underground parking lot. “Let’s go,” I said, but Brenda whined wordlessly. I looked at her, only to see she was clutching the handlebar desperately. It seemed that it was the only thing that was keeping her upright, the unfamiliar presence of a vibrating dildo, combined with the fear of getting noticed, pushing her close to another climax. </p><p>The reasonable thing would be stopping the vibrator, but it was also the less-fun option. Instead, I presented my arm for her. She looked at me beggingly. “No,” I said simply, not even waiting for her to ask the question. Out of option, she reached for my arm with her trembling hands, grabbing it in lieu of the handlebar. It wasn’t a symbolic grab, a significant portion of her weight was on my arm as we walked forward. Once again, the temptation to bend her over and take her in the middle of the parking lot was bright as we walked through relative darkness, but there were enough cameras around to make it unfeasible. </p><p>Her hold on my arm got heavier and heavier as we closed the distance to my car. When we stood over the passenger side door, she was barely able to stand even with my help. I turned her vibrator off. Not that I pitied her, but because I had some plans for her, and I didn’t want to collapse her early. </p><p>“Thanks,” Brenda murmured as she stumbled on the passenger seat of my convertible, a black two-seated sports car that shouted mid-life crisis, which, to be fair, was probably accurate. I took the driver’s seat, and looked at Brenda, whose eyes were wandering on the interior of the car. “Nice ride,” she said, sounding impressed. </p><p>“It’s a decent one,” I approved as I drove out of the parking lot. “Do you like cars?” </p><p>“Who doesn’t like a nice one like this,” Brenda answered in awe. It was a justified shock, as my car was quite expensive, even considering my income level. </p><p>“Would you like to have a real ride,” I offered. Today, she had been amazingly accommodating, and she deserved a reward. My initial idea was shopping, as I was yet to meet a twenty-something girl that didn’t appreciate a nice visit with a generous budget. But if she was feeling that excited about the car, maybe a ride would be a better substitute, especially since she was too exhausted to bustle around a shop. </p><p>“Would I?” she said with an obvious excitement. “I would love to!” </p><p>“Excellent,” I answered even as I reversed my direction, towards the nearest highway. Luckily, it didn’t have much traffic, and more importantly any police checkpoint. I pressed the gas pedal, and the car slowly picked up the speed. Brenda let out an excited yelp, watching the obstacles fly from her side of the window. </p><p>I said nothing, but drove as fast as I reasonably could in a city. “You better put your seatbelt on,” I suggested. She looked at me, but her intention to argue melted against my stern look. I liked adrenaline as well, but I had no intention to kill her with a stiff brake. “Ready?” I asked. She nodded. </p><p>I stepped on the gas pedal. </p><p>The loud roar of the engine reached my ear simultaneously with her excited cry. I smirked as I jumped up gears rapidly, and soon we were cruising the near-empty highway on lightning speed, swerving around the occasional car on the road with great agility. I could feel my heart beating with excitement. </p><p>I paid a glance to Brenda soon after, only to find her with a clear expression of ecstasy on her face. She was enjoying the drive almost as much as she enjoyed sex, if her expression was correct. Well, I could help her with that, I decided. I pulled my hand from the steering wheel for a moment to reach my pocket, and a click later, her vibrator was buzzing inside her once more. </p><p>Her cries rose once more, but this time, mixed with carnal satisfaction. For a moment, I was passing a relatively crowded part of the road, which prevented me from looking at her side. I glanced at her after passing the obstacle. I was pleasantly surprised to see she was busy while I dealt with the road-challenge. She had untied several buttons of her shirt, revealing her bra for my viewing pleasure. One of her hands stayed there, sinking into her breasts repeatedly, while the other chose the travel downward, and disappeared under her skirt. Thanks to her expression, it wasn’t a great difficulty to guess what her fingers were doing underneath. </p><p>Then, she decided to escalate. Her hand moved away from her breasts to my crotch instead. She looked at me with a suggestive smile as she slowly dragged my zipper down. A brief struggle with my boxers later, she was holding my erection in her hand, slowly moving up and down. Perfect display of initiative, I thought, taking a note to reward her appropriately later on. Such displays needed to be rewarded. And even better, she soon leaned towards me, catching my shaft between her lips, going up and down in a great display of skill. </p><p>I focused on the road as I drove even faster, enjoying the ultimate dream. A sexy girl on my side, her lips around my girth, devouring my shaft like my car devoured the distance, the sound of the engine roaring impressively. Life was truly grand. </p><p>But even such a nice experience could be improved, I decided as the pleasure started to build up. I took a sudden turn to a side road, and pressed the brakes after I drove far enough from the highway to not to be seen. Brenda raised her head, trying to understand what was going on, and I used the time to flip open my seatbelt before jumping up, and shifted in front of her. </p><p>Before she could say anything, my hand was on the small button that allowed to adjust the seat depth, and I pushed it all the way back, something that gave me enough space for my next action. “It’s time for action,” I said as I grabbed her legs, raising them to my shoulders. Her skirt slid up, giving me unrestricted access to her core. I plunged deep inside her. </p><p>At that moment, my moan of appreciation mixed with Brenda’s cry, overcharged with pleasure. “That’s slick,” I said, unable to keep myself from commenting at the incredible feeling of wetness inside her. After the extremely extended foreplay, she was like a slippery slide, accepting my full length without the slightest hint of resistance. “It seems that I did a favor to you today, helping you discover a new secret about yourself,” I added casually even as I hammered her mercilessly, leveraging our extreme angle for all its worth.  </p><p>She avoided my gaze, managing to surprise me. Somehow, pulling the attention to her anal enjoyment managed her to feel shy, a considerable achievement in the position we were currently sharing. Then, I shrugged, focusing on my more important task, though I took note of her reaction. </p><p>Still, she avoided a direct question; and that required punishment. Luckily for her, I had a way that would make both of us enjoy. I grabbed the end of her still vibrating dildo, and pulled. Then, without a blink, I pushed my shaft inside the gaping hole that was left in its place. Brenda let out a loud cry that made me happy that I didn’t try that at work. </p><p>“Please-” she managed to squeeze between her cries, but she got the message when instead of listening to her, I tugged her shirt open, buttons flying around. Her bra was pushed to the side negligently a moment later, leaving her tits free. I grabbed them without losing any time, squeezing them mercilessly, but I doubted that it made any contribution to the intensity of her cries, considering that I was slamming her tight hole mercilessly simultaneously. I looked at her face, enjoying her eyes, widened with pain and pleasure. </p><p>I would have liked to spend hours in that position, breaking the last hole of my secretary for a longer time, but there were limits. Her resistance had limits, which could be ignored, and I also had a limit, which was harder to ignore. The way her muscles contracted around my shaft was the last stone, triggering a climax that coated her bowels. Meanwhile, she was trembling with an orgasm of her own, one that left her on the edge of unconsciousness. </p><p>I pulled out, and after a brief break to clean up and fix my clothes, we were on the way once again. Brenda still lay on her seat, half-unconscious, her tits still laying open, her skirt uneven. I had done nothing other than putting her seatbelt on, leaving her body deliciously open. I started driving back to the city. She recovered halfway on, and buttoned her shirt back on, though she made sure to leave a cleavage deep enough to get her fired if she ever dared to wear that in the office. In a public part of it, that was. </p><p>With both of us exhausted, no words were spoken as we drove towards her house, other than a few broken sentences to describe the way. Then, we arrived in front of her apartment. “Thanks for the drive, boss,” she murmured when we arrived. I just nodded, and she left the car, stumbling towards the entrance with a very distinct limp on her steps, which, combined with her mussed up hair and messy clothes, left no doubt about the treatment she had just received. </p><p>“As they say, the importance of having a good working relationship with the secretary cannot be overstated,” I said with a chuckle as I drove away. I still needed to decide how I was going to handle rest of the office… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Kim was feeling exhausted when the alarm blared loudly, forcing her out of her short and restless sleep, filled with dark dreams she couldn’t exactly remember. Last night, trying to sleep proved to be quite an ordeal, that fateful moment popping in her vision whenever her eyes were closed, injecting a fresh dose of anger to her veins. It was only with the first lights of the morning she managed to fall asleep, though it could be more accurately defined as unconsciousness. </p><p>And even that fleeting rest hadn’t been comfortable. It was plagued by the nightmares she couldn’t remember now that she was awake, but she had a strong feeling that chains were involved. She wished calling sick was an option, especially since she had a ready-made excuse in the form of her sprained leg. Unfortunately, she needed to be at school, not only she needed to drop the paper for Mrs. Robinson, but also she needed to spend some time with Mike if she was ever going to earn his trust. </p><p>The first thing she did was to write a quick message to Olivia, asking her to pick her up. Kim needed to talk to someone about what happened, and her best friend was the only one that she could trust about it, as she was the only one that knew about the relationship between her and Mike, and the only one she could trust to keep her mouth shut about her sister. Kim didn’t want to imagine what her parents would do to both of them if they learned what was happening under their roof. And since her car was still at school, a lift would have been useful. She had no intention of spending her journey trying to ignore the hungry gaze of a pathetic driver. </p><p>She still had an hour to prepare. With that in mind, she took a quick shower to help her awaken, and then wrapped her ankle once again. She quickly dried her body, and started drying her hair, which took a considerably longer time. While her hands were busy with the drier, her mind was on which clothes to wear. She needed something multi-functional, one that would look casually attractive from a distance, while allowing a sexy transformation after a few quick touch-ups. </p><p>In the end, she decided on a long burgundy skirt with a zipper along the side, giving her an adjustable slit to display her legs to the maximum effectiveness. On her top, she chose to wear a sleeveless black top that covered her shoulders, relying on the buttons on its front to adjust as needed. And to maximize the impact, she picked the sexiest underwear she owned, a dark red set that was more lace than fabric, covering a minimal amount of skin while elevating her looks to the max. She had used them previously to the maximum effect, driving her previous boyfriend crazy whenever she whispered to his ear what she was wearing… Of course, his obvious display of enthusiasm also caused her to get bored and dump him, but for Mike, she had more important things to focus on. </p><p>She pulled the side-zipper up, and popped a few buttons open, examining herself in the mirror. With her underwear peeking from the edges, enhancing her already great natural beauty with a sexy edge, she looked magnificent, she decided, smiling for the first time today. She had great pride in her looks, and the full potential of sexiness she was packing boosted her self confidence significantly, even though she had no plans to unleash the full range today. </p><p>She opened her shoe closet, looking at a pair of dark red heeled boots with sadness. They were perfect to complete the ensemble she was wearing, but her ankle was still tender enough that she couldn’t wear them. She wore a pair of dark-colored sandals instead. They weren’t her first preference, but she needed to favor comfort over looks to return to the training as soon as possible. She picked a dark toned make-up to complete the impression, contrasting with her blond hair nicely. </p><p>Since she was still waiting for Olivia to arrive, Kim walked downstairs, wanting to grab a quick bite before she left, some fruit, or maybe a bit of cereal. But when she was in downstairs, she came to a sudden stop. The reason, her sister, walking around the kitchen, trying to prepare breakfast. An extraordinary thing, as her sister usually preferred to sleep until midday, but not as extraordinary as the reason for her slight limp. She squeezed her hand, struggling to control her emotions. She wanted to shout at her sister, asking what the fuck she was thinking, but in the end, she didn’t. She was afraid of admitting what she had seen last night, knowing that it would change their relationship between them. </p><p>“Hey, sis,” said Audrey when she noticed Kim standing in the middle of the room, waiting for her to speak. “Right in time for an amazing breakfast. How do you prefer your eggs?” Kim had to bit her lips from saying something. She did so, because even she didn’t know that she would have said if she opened her mouth. Undecided, her mouth stayed shut, the silence stretching in a way that slowly turned uncomfortable. “Is something wrong?” she asked. </p><p>Something was indeed wrong, but the last thing Kim wanted was to explain it. But with a stroke of good luck, her phone started ringing. “Thank god,” she murmured as she raised her phone and opened. </p><p>“I’ll be there in a second, kitty, come outside,” said Olivia. </p><p>“Coming right up,” she answered and closed the phone. “Sorry sis,” she answered enthusiastically, happy to have an excuse to escape. “Olivia is here to pick me up. I’ll need to take a rain check.” </p><p>“Nice, you’re finally taking my advice. Carpooling has much lower carbon footprint. Good for you,” Audrey said with a huge smile.   </p><p>The risk of an environmental disaster had no bearing on her decision, but there was no benefit in informing her sister about that, so she just nodded before walking towards the door. Thankfully, distracted by her own morning routine, her sister failed to notice her limp, which would cause undue concern for her. Normally, she enjoyed being pampered by her sister, a process which usually included nice imported chocolates, and maybe even a cocktail or two, but not this time… The less she talked with her sister today, the better. </p><p>She walked out, and a second later, Olivia appeared over the corner in her car, a red convertible with considerable engine power. A waste in her opinion, as Olivia barely avoided a panic attack any time she drove faster than forty, but that didn’t prevent her from bugging her parents until they gifted her a car more impressive than what Julia was using. Kim approved. High school hierarchy was tricky, and they needed every advantage they could gather to stay above Hannah-Julia duo. </p><p>“Hey, girl, how is your leg,” asked Olivia as she pulled next to her. </p><p>“Better than yesterday,” Kim answered as she opened the door and stepped inside. </p><p>The car started moving the moment the door was closed. “Really, why are you looking glum, then,” Olivia asked. Kim stayed silent for a few seconds, trying to come up with the best way to explain what she had seen the last night. “Come on, girl. I’m waiting,” Olivia added, her fingers dancing with impatience over the steering wheel. </p><p>Kim decided to be direct. “Last night, I saw my sister having sex with Mike,” she said. The car swerved wildly, forcing Kim to hold on her seat to keep her in place. Luckily, the road was empty, so they didn’t hit anything, though it was a close call for an innocent tree. “What was that!” Kim shouted, her heartbeat loud enough to deafen her. </p><p>“Don’t yell at me,” said Olivia as she pulled to the side. “It’s your fault, I was surprised by your joke.” She made a show of shuddering. “Damn, even in imagination it is horrible. A pathetic specimen like Mike, together with someone as magnificent as your sister.” </p><p>Kim had to suppress a shudder of her own. Olivia’s words brought the memories from the last night to the surface, where pathetic was hardly the adjective Mike deserved. But that was hardly the point to make there. “No,” she said instead, as serious as she could manage. “That’s true. I caught my sister with Mike, having sex.” </p><p>Olivia let out a strangled gasp as she pulled to the side, her face contorted with shock. “Shut the fuck up, no way!” she exclaimed. “How can something like that be possible.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” Kim answered. “I saw them together when I arrived home earlier than expected. They were in upstairs, my sister’s room, doing it.” Of course, they were also doing it in the shower, and at downstairs later on, but that was hardly the point Kim wanted to make. The situation was complicated enough in its current state. </p><p>“Are you sure that she was willing, maybe-” Olivia started to say, but Kim cut her off. </p><p>“No, believe me, she was willing,” she answered, Audrey’s worshipful expression popping to her mind. “She was willing indeed.” </p><p>“I don’t understand,” Olivia said. “I mean. It’s Audrey. She is literally a goddess, tall, rich, and sexy. Even if she wanted a young boy toy to amuse herself for the night, why would she chose that pathetic nerd.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” Kim answered. She should have admitted that it didn’t look like Audrey was in control, but she kept her mouth shut. The situation was shameful enough when Olivia was thinking her sister was the dominant one, and she had no inclination to alert her to the reality of it. Of course, Olivia was still waiting for an answer, so Kim went with the easiest answer. “Maybe because of his size?” she suggested. </p><p>“I wouldn’t have guessed that your sister has a fetish for tall men?” Olivia answered. “Wasn’t her last boyfriend like five feet tall.” </p><p>“That’s not what I’m talking about,” Kim answered. </p><p>“What-” Olivia started to say with a confused expression, only to freeze. “No way!” she exclaimed in a scandalized manner. “Mike can’t be that big down there.” Kim looked at her questioningly. “He just can’t,” Olivia continued with absolute certainty. “He doesn’t have the confidence of a man with a big tool. Even if he doesn’t have a micro, it cannot be above four inches.” </p><p>Kim shook her head. “No,” she answered. “He is considerably bigger.” </p><p>“How big he was,” asked Olivia with a giggle, the severity of the situation destroyed by her sudden shift in attitude. </p><p>“I’ll not tell you how bit it was,” Kim said angrily. “We have more important things to talk about.” </p><p>“Tell me to stop, then,” Olivia countered as she opened her hands approximately five inches, then the distance between them started to grow. “How about it?” she asked. </p><p>“Not yet,” Kim spat out, deciding that the easiest way to return to the topic was to give her what she wanted. Olivia had a tendency to be stubborn when she got stuck on something. </p><p>“No way,” Olivia said, her eyes widening as her hands continued to move apart. “This much!?” Kim was about to shook her head once more, as from what she had seen from the last night, he was even bigger, but the awed expression on Olivia’s face stopped her. Too late, she realized that Olivia had a fascination with the size that bordered on unhealthy, and informing her about his full size would likely backfire. The last thing she needed was for Olivia to start chasing after Mike as well. She grabbed Olivia’s wrists and pushed her hands closer, one extremely closer to their earlier position. “Ah,” Olivia murmured, a bit disappointed. “Not bad, but nothing to be impressed either.” </p><p>“Since the most important part of the problem is finally solved,” Kim said with a pointed tone. “Maybe we can move onto less important issues, like how to make that asshole pay for what he had done.” </p><p>“That depends on what we want. The easiest way would be to whisper a couple words to Jason. He has a crush on you. If he heard a rumor that says Mike was around you, he would frighten him away.” </p><p>“Maybe something less violent,” Kim said. It wasn’t that she was feeling bad for Mike, or Jason, but the sight of his muscled back was still sharp in her mind, and she felt reluctant to try the path of violence. A voice on the back of her head was telling her that it might cause things to slide out of control quickly. “We should keep it simple. Maybe I should encourage him to take things physical. From what I had seen last night, he would be quick to take that road. Then, I can complain to the headmaster, and we can have him kicked out. Not exactly a genius plan, but effective.” </p><p>“Not a bad idea,” Olivia answered. “But maybe I should be the one that does it. He might try to retaliate if you’re the one that does it. As a wronged party who just realized that the boy that touched me was the secret boyfriend of my best friend, I would have more leeway to create a commotion.” </p><p>Kim smiled widely. “You would do that for me?” </p><p>“Of course, girl,” Olivia said. “We are besties, aren’t we?” </p><p>“We are,” Kim approved, excited to get rid of the latest threat to her lifestyle. “When should we do it?” </p><p>“After the last class,” Olivia answered. “I’ll ask for his help and bring him to the lab floor. Then, I’ll send you a message, and you’ll catch us, creating a commotion that would surely draw a few teachers close. Since it’s after class, there won’t be any student around there.” </p><p>“It’s a plan,” Kim said in approval. Their laboratories, despite being filled with first-rate equipment, rarely had any student other than mandatory classes, and never after the end of the class. Also, they were close to the teacher’s lounge, meaning the commotion that Kim started would be heard by a teacher almost immediately. From there, Kim was sure that they could spin the situation in a way that would end with him getting kicked out.</p><p>Kim was smiling once more as Olivia continued to drive. Soon, Mike was going to pay for daring to touch her family…</p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>“… I promise, Mrs. Robinson. I’ll make sure to finish the next one as soon as you assigned.” Kim murmured, doing her best to suppress her desire to shout. She had been listening to Mrs. Robinson’s tirade for the last fifteen minutes about the merits of hard work and punctuality. Kim found herself forced to listen as she went through with her redundant lesson. At this hour, she was supposed to be in Gym class, but she was excused because of her ankle. So instead, she was listening to a boring lecture about punctuality. Still, she kept her mouth shut. The last thing she needed was to annoy her teacher, which would give her a cause to examine her work in greater detail. Her life was complicated enough without dealing with plagiarism charges. </p><p>“See that you don’t,” said her teacher in her usual sanctimonious tone. </p><p>“Thanks again, madam,” Kim said before leaving the teacher’s lounge. “Too bad Mike won’t be around to help me for the next homework,” she murmured, half annoyed that keeping him until he finished her final paper wasn’t an option. She shrugged, writing a paper herself wouldn’t exactly kill her, and if her last paper does as well as she hoped, she would already have a passing grade, making it less of a priority issue. </p><p>She was about to go to her next lesson, but a glance to the outside changed her mind. She saw Mike, but she also saw Olivia next to him, walking towards the storage rooms where gym equipment was being kept. And to make things worse, Olivia was wearing something other than her usual gym clothes, which was revealing enough. But now, they were replaced by a tank-top that left her stomach bare, and micro-shorts, both a size too small for her, showing contours of her body like they were painted. </p><p>“Damnit, Ollie,” she murmured as she dashed towards the stairs, trying to ignore the pain that spread with each hurried step. It wouldn’t be the first time her best friend decided to adapt a plan on the fly without bothering to clear with Kim, despite her tunnel vision that caused her last-minute adjustments to blow up on their faces with a dangerous frequency. And the current one wasn’t an exception. Creating a scene in the storage rooms when gym class was in action would be a true disaster, especially with the way Olivia was dressed. Just the insinuation that she or Olivia was in a relationship with a scholarship student would be enough to sink their reputation. The fact that they were fighting for him… It didn’t even bear thinking about…</p><p>Kim looked from the window once more after she cleared the stairs, and saw that their path had changed. Now, instead of continuing towards the gym, they were going towards the storage shed which kept out of used equipment. Better than a gym, but pointless. Likely there wouldn’t be anyone around to hear the commotion, and even if there was, it would likely to be a student rather than a teacher. </p><p>She reached her phone to send a message to Olivia, only to remember that she left it in her bag, which was still in the classroom. “Damn,” she murmured. If she tried to go to the classroom, which was on another wing, she wouldn’t be able to catch up with Olivia before they reached the storage room. And if they were inside, there was no chance for Kim to sneak inside without being noticed. </p><p>In the end, she decided that her presence was more important than whether she had her phone with her, and continued her walk. Luckily, they were walking slowly, which gave her enough time to dash ahead of them even with her twisted ankle. A minute later, she was in the storage shed, which was piled with old equipment, still completely workable, but both the gym and the sports teams were sources of pride for the school, meaning they always had the latest and fanciest equipment. </p><p>But the spending habits of the school was only a passing concern for her as her eyes browsed the room, trying to find a good place to hide without sacrificing her ability to observe the room. The answer came in the form of a pile of damaged exercise mats, which created almost an impenetrable barrier, with the exception of a small opening where she could watch the room. “Excellent,” she murmured as she took her vantage point. Not a moment too soon, as the moment she took the position, the door opened, and a familiar giggle filled the room… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Not knowing what to do, Kim took a taxi to the nearest coffee shop, and sit on a corner seat. She would have preferred a bar, or better, a nightclub instead, but two things prevented her. First, her fake ID, which showed her as twenty-two rather than her real age of eighteen was in her room, and under the circumstances, going back to pick it up was not an option. </p><p>The second reason was simpler, she was still wearing her cheerleader costume, and going to a bar in that was a big no-no. She had no intention of spending the next few hours dissuading drunk assholes, drawn to her costume like a moth to a flame. It was a testament to her anger that they didn’t try to bother her now. A couple of the braver ones tried to walk towards her, only to change her mind as she turned her gaze towards them. Thankfully, it was evening, and the most persistent ones were already at the bars, allowing her to focus on her own woes. </p><p>She sat on the corner table, a large mug of hot chocolate, topped with whipped cream, between her hands, its warmth comforting her as much as its sweet taste. Hot chocolate was her comfort food, one she tried to avoid as much as possible to protect her figure. But tonight was worthy of being an exception, she thought as a giggle escaped her mouth. It wasn’t an amused giggle. It gave the impression of a hysteric one instead, laced with desperation. She was edging a breakdown. </p><p>No matter how much she thought, she failed to wrap her head around the surprise scene that greeted her when she arrived at home. Catching her sister on the action was traumatic enough, her cries loud enough to echo in downstairs. Luckily, the distance between the house and the neighboring ones was far enough, a silver lining to a huge problem she was facing. </p><p>A problem named Mike, she admitted, unable to avoid it despite her tries. Seeing him naked, hovering over Audrey, was against every thought, every conclusion she had about him. He was supposed to be simple. A minority student with excellent grades, with a demeanor guaranteed to avoid any problem, brought in to their exclusive private school in an attempt to claim diversity. Everything about him at school seemed unworthy of notice, his thick-framed glasses, his ugly clothes, his slouched shoulders, and his determination to avoid conflict no matter how much the other students had insulted him. Kim had always thought that it was cowardice that kept him from acting, making him unable to stand against his betters…</p><p>Then, Kim had seen him with her sister, the strongest woman she had ever known. And alone with her, he was completely different. She wasn’t able to see his face, but hadn’t needed to understand that somehow, her perception of him was completely askew. Just seeing his back was enough, his slouch replaced by a confident gait, reminding her a lion standing over his fallen prey, preparing himself for a feast. </p><p>As she continued to think about it, another emotion started to join her confusion, annoyance. She had to admit, that if he had managed to hide his personality that well, it was exceedingly likely that he had realized what Kim was trying to do, but played along while mocking her in his mind. At that point, Kim carefully avoided how her sister was linked to the subject, focusing on her own outrage. Anger was easier to process than confusion…  </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>It was easier to focus on her anger when her home wasn’t in her sight, she realized as the taxi she was in drove closer to her home. Her earlier outrage was dwindling swiftly as she traveled closer to her home, replaced with a timid anticipation. When the car stopped on the driveway, her anger had frozen sufficiently to make her consider going back to the coffee shop. Unfortunately, it was past eleven, and the coffee shop was about to close. She could have gone to Olivia’s house instead, but that required an explanation on why she was still dressed in her cheerleader costume, an explanation she didn’t feel ready to give. </p><p>With that, she passed a twenty to the driver, waved off the change as the tip, and stepped on the carefully cut stones of their driveway, creating a rustic feel. Kim was biting her lip as she limped towards the main door, her ankle hurting even more as the spray the coach had used started to lose its effectiveness. A feeling of anticipation filled her chest as she twisted her key, fearing that she would be greeted by the moans of her sister once again. </p><p>A relaxed breath escaped her mouth as she stepped into a silent living room. Even better, the blouse that was lying on the ground was nowhere to be seen, meaning not only they had finished, but had enough time to erase the clues. But as she looked at the pristine state of the living room, she couldn’t help but wonder how many times it happened. The only thing Kim knew was it wasn’t the first time, and probably not the second time as well. They were too confident in their roles for it to be a fresh thing. </p><p>It was silent, but still, Kim couldn’t help but feel panicked as she walked through the corridors, unable to shake the feeling that she was about to come face to face with her naked sister, or even scarier, her naked fake-boyfriend. That thought slowed her steps more than her twisted ankle did, her heart getting heavier with each step. </p><p>Thankfully, the door to her room was closed, giving her one last opportunity to gather herself before knocking the door. “Come in,” said Mike. It was his usual voice, lacking in both emotion and strength, the one that convinced her that he was nothing more than a spineless nerd. But now that she knew what lay underneath, she could actually catch one emotion in his tone. Amusement. </p><p>He was mocking her, she suddenly realized, her, and rest of the school. She could see why, he didn’t have to do anything extreme, just used a false front, and their assumption did the rest. And he dared to use that fact to somehow seduce her sister. Just like that, her anger was in flames again, roaring in an intensity that threatened to swallow her.</p><p>She took a deep breath before opening the door, trying to control herself. She wanted nothing more than storm inside and start throwing the heaviest books she had to his head, but that would only reveal her hand. No, she needed an actual plan if she was going to take her revenge. No one treated her like an idiot.</p><p>The door swung open, revealing Mike, who was sitting on her desk, his pencil dancing on the paper as he filled yet another sheet with his handwriting. With his body once again hidden by his ill-fitting shirt and jeans, his shoulder slouched, his head down, he was in his nerdy guise once again. Almost enough to make her believe that the earlier scenes were nothing more than a figment of her imagination. </p><p>Almost, but not quite. The scene was etched in her mind, and a fake attitude like that could never succeed to remove it. “Hi, Mike,” said Kim, trying to act casual, but despite her best efforts, her voice trembled for a moment. “Sorry I was late, but I had a bit of trouble at the training.” </p><p>He quirked his eyebrow questioningly, but then she took a step forward, limping badly. The injury was bad, and the extra journey she took wasn’t the best solution for it. “Are you okay,” he asked as he stood up, his eyes on her ankle, which was wrapped tightly. </p><p>“Just a sprain,” she explained as she continued to walk, but in an effort to show her strength, she took a step that was nominally stronger, which was followed by a painful stab of pain. A gasp escaped her mouth despite her best efforts. </p><p>“Let me help you,” he said as he closed on the distance between them in two large steps, his arm present for her comfort. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, trying not to be intimidated by his height. It was the first time she ever felt intimidated by his presence, because all the other times, she was convinced that he was just a spineless boy with nothing special other than an overdeveloped aptitude for math. But after their earlier encounter, she had to revisit those assumptions. </p><p>They said nothing until they reached to her bed, and she sat on her bed. She glanced at his face a couple of times as they walked towards her bed, trying to understand what he was thinking. But she only found a thin layer of concern, covering a sea of indifference. And it annoyed her immensely, not because she was emotionally invested in their fake relationship, but due to fact that she had been tricked for so long by his weak acting. If it wasn’t for the earlier scene, she would have written of his expression as his personality. No wonder Olivia hadn’t been feeling comfortable around him. </p><p>For the first time in the evening, her heart tasted an emotion stronger than her shock. The flare of outrage edged the other emotions to the side, annoyed by the fact that a trailer trash like him dared to trick her, and even more importantly, he dared to defile her precious family. She was going to take revenge. </p><p>It was her strongest suit, ruining people. The easiest way to do that would be to ruining him in the school completely, without screwing herself in the process. And to do that, she needed him to trust her nominally. </p><p>Distracted by her plans, she was late to notice that Mike was sitting on her bed. “Let me see your ankle,” he said, and before she could react, he grabbed her knee, pulling her on his lap. Her first instinct was to pull back, of course, but she managed to suppress that response. She wanted him to trust her, and the first step on that road was to act like their relationship was genuine. With that, even if he stayed unaffected -which she doubted, her seduction skills were phenomenal- he would start to take her actions at face value. So, she didn’t resist as he pulled her leg on his lap, his fingers gently dancing around her ankle wrap. “It’s a bit loose, we need to tighten it up,” he said, once again, his fake concern like a badly wrapped foil. </p><p>“Thanks,” Kim answered in a soft voice, one that never failed to work on the other boys, but Mike didn’t even bother to look at her face, busy with unwrapping her bandages. His fingers moved quickly in a practiced familiarity, loosening her bandage, and soon, her skin was revealed, slightly bruised. “It doesn’t look too bad, but it would be better if we could put some cold compress on it. Is there a medicine cabinet in the house. </p><p>“There should be one in the upstairs bathroom,” she answered even as she jiggled slightly. It was a strategic move, one that allowed her skirt to bunch upwards a bit, and considering she was still in her cheerleading costume, which was quite short, the result was spectacular. But his eyes didn’t stray from her ankle as he carefully raised her leg and stepped away, which was another annoying detail. </p><p>Thankfully, she managed to hold back a scowl until he left the room, leaving the door open behind him. “Stupid idiot,” she murmured in annoyance. It wasn’t the most impressive insult, but it worked well enough to drain her frustration. But her relative calmness lasted only for a second. He heard him opening the bathroom door, and the sound of running water reached to her ears for a second before he could close it. It was a small detail, one she wouldn’t have noticed in any other situation, but this time, her instincts were shouting that the bathroom he just walked inside wasn’t empty. </p><p>“Fuck,” she murmured. For a few seconds, she waited for the sound of the bathroom door opening, but it stayed closed. She bit her lips, trying not to think the worst. Maybe she had misheard, and the bathroom was actually empty. But as the seconds passed, she started to doubt that it was the case. When it reached the five minutes mark, she was sure, but she lacked the ability to do anything. Yes, she could have just gone and busted them, but that would remove any chance of him trusting her, therefore destroying her chances of getting him kicked out of the school. Instead, she decided to enhance her chances of impressing him. She removed the small short she wore under her cheerleading skirt, which was there to prevent any visual accidents. And also, she pulled her shirt down a bit, enough to enhance her cleavage. More she could impress him, easier she could keep him away from her sister.</p><p>But that realization didn’t make any easier to act calm when he returned with two hand-prints over his shoulders, too small to be self-inflicted. It didn’t take a genius to realize who they belonged. Kim tried to smile, but she was unable to prevent her bitterness from showing. “Sorry for being late,” he said in his regular tone. “I had a bit of trouble finding it.” </p><p>“It’s okay, it’s not hurting much,” she answered. </p><p>“Still, I shouldn’t have kept you waiting,” he answered. His fake concern made her even angrier, as not only she knew it was a lie, but she had a pretty good idea about the reason for her delay. He pulled a chair towards her, and opened his mouth, about to continue his concerned speech. She said nothing just raised her leg for him once more, hoping to make him stop talking. Only when his smile twisted into something darker, she realized the mistake she made. In her hurry to silence her, she raised her leg without paying attention to her skirt, giving him a clearer glimpse of her panties than she had intended. </p><p>Still, she kept it in place despite the blush that threatened to invade her face. It was humiliating, but it was the first time he had showed her anything other than his empty expression, so she decided to count it as a win. And if her heart-rate had picked up a bit, it was definitely about the humiliation she was feeling. It definitely wasn’t a sudden feeling of excitement she felt. </p><p>Whatever it was, it was gone the moment his expression returned to his usual goody form. Her hands reached to her skirt, trying to fix it without making it obvious. He was occupied with checking her ankle, which allowed her to succeed in her task. Then, he sprayed some of the cold compress, and a gasp escaped her mouth. “Careful,” she yelped. </p><p>“Brace yourself for just a second,” he answered as he wrapped the bandage around her ankle in a practiced manner. It hurt a bit, but she managed to keep herself from giving any visual confirmation. She didn’t want to appear weak. “All done,” he added. </p><p>“Thanks,” she answered, lowering her eyes to the ground to give an impression of shyness. Showing signs of a crush was an appropriate strategy, especially after he ‘heroically’ bandaged her wounds. And she didn’t have to work hard to add blush, as her anger already saw to it. “You’re the best boyfriend ever,” she murmured, letting her eyes to find his face in a fleeting moment, solidifying her image of crush. And during that glance, she managed to catch a satisfied expression on his face, no doubt buying her impression of crush. Good, she thought. More he believed her sincerity, easier time she would have to engineer a situation that would have him kicked out of school. </p><p>“It’s the least I can do,” he said as he slid with his chair towards the table. “And I need to return to the paper. There are a few more things I want to add before leaving, and I don’t have much time before the last bus.” </p><p>“They should be enough,” she answered as she pointed towards the papers in front of him. He was already filling his third paper, which meant she was already going to cut down quite a bit of length as she rewrote it. Mrs. Robinson was one of the more attentive teachers, and she would never believe Kim could finish a paper of that size in just a night. And half of it should be enough for a passing grade in any case. </p><p>“If you say so,” he said with a shrug. Then, her sister walked through the corridor, appearing her doorway for a moment before continuing her walk. While passing, she didn’t look at them. But it wasn’t a casual inattentiveness. No, she firmly kept looking forward, her neck or eyes not deviating even for a bit, not that Kim would have noticed it if it wasn’t for her accidental stumble. The only positive thing that she was wearing actual clothes rather than just a towel. “Maybe I should bring you some food,” he said. “How about some orange juice, or some hot chocolate.” </p><p>“There is no need…” she tried to say, but before she could complete her sentence, he was already on his feet, walking out. She bit her lip, trying to hold back a frustrated cry. Here she was, dressed as revealingly as she could, but it didn’t even keep him a moment. She needed to up her game, she decided. But she shelved that part, as she had something more important to think about. Namely, whether she should follow him to downstairs, to prevent another encounter between him and her sister. </p><p>She decided to block it, not wanting that poor bastard to defile her sister any more than he already had. She stood up despite the lingering pain that begged her to wait, and started to walk, though her speed was closer to crawling. But just before she reached the stairs, she received the first sign that she was too late. A muffled moan, quiet enough to be mistaken for an illusion. But she just needed one more step to realize it wasn’t. </p><p>The view that she saw was no less scandalous than the one in Audrey’s bedroom. It was even worse, because this time, both of them was aware of her presence under the same roof, but that hadn’t stopped them. She had to bit her lips to prevent a cry of frustration escaping her mouth. Mike was sitting on the couch like he owned the place. Both his pants and his boxers were around his ankles, driving the message even further. Still, it wasn’t as bad as Audrey’s position. She was still wearing her top, but that didn’t mean anything because it was rolled up enough to reveal her naked tits. Even worse, she was on her knees in front of Mike, with her head between his legs, trying to devour his length, while concealing his actual presence at the same time. </p><p>An errant thought struck Kim. How big he was? She hated herself for focusing on such a topic in the situation she was in, but she couldn’t help but think about it. It was her sister’s fault. She was obviously struggling as she tried to suck him, gagging whenever she tried to push herself deeper on it. But her thoughts took a backseat when she realized Mike had noticed the same issue her sister was having, but decided to approach in a different way. His hands landed on her head, and without a warning, pushed her down.</p><p>Kim watched with her mouth open as her fake boyfriend forced his shaft into her sister’s throat, ignoring her gasping and wheezing. She repeatedly tapped his leg, likely begging him to lessen the pressure, but he didn’t let her breathe. Kim got angrier and angrier at the treatment her sister was receiving, and she was about to walk downstairs to break things down, consequences be damned, when he finally let her go. “Mike, that was amazing,” her sister moaned in an obvious display of enjoyment, adding a brand new shock to Kim’s growing collection. </p><p>She took a step back before they could notice her, and returned to her room as soon as she could. Her sister’s obvious enjoyment was just a part of her shock. The responsibility for the other half belonged to Mike, or more accurately, the monster he had been packing between his legs, larger and thicker than even her wildest guess. She bit her lips, trying to ignore the sudden warmth between her legs. It was a shocked reaction, and nothing more. </p><p>It took almost fifteen minutes for them to return. Her sister walked in front of the door first. “Hey sis,” she murmured as she passed by, careful not to look at her as she passed. She was obviously trying to hide her face after the treatment she received at downstairs. Mike walked in a couple minutes later, carrying a tray, which had some hot chocolate, with a large piece of marshmallow swimming in the middle. Her favorite, but she wasn’t willing to give him any points for that after what he had done to her sister’s poor throat. </p><p>“It smells delicious,” she murmured, doing her best to act obvious. The last thing she needed was him to notice her acting weird. </p><p>He placed the tray on the desk, then made a show of checking his watch. “Look at that, I will miss the bus if I don’t hurry,” he said. “Is there anything else I can do to help you, honey,” he added. </p><p>“No, sweetie, just be careful,” Kim answered, the diminutive name tasting disgusting to her tongue. It was the first time they called each other by nicknames, and Kim hadn’t enjoyed it a bit. But it was better for her plan, so she did her best to act obvious. She waved him goodbye, he waved in response, and then walked away, leaving Kim alone with her confusion…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>Since I didn’t hold teaching in high regard, usually I didn’t feel any excitement as I walked towards the classroom. Most days, it was yet another boring session where we dissected the writings that long lost their relevance. But today was an exception, which was more about the changes in my students rather than the topic of discussion. Two of them, in particular, Megan and Camilla, a red-haired heiress with a personality to match, and her Latino fling with a body die for, whom I managed to suborn after a particularly ill-thought attempt to ruin my career. </p><p>With all that was going on, for once, I was going to the classroom earlier than the required time, wanting to be in the classroom before they arrived. After what happened at last night’s visit, my new toy -assistant, I corrected in my mind with a smirk- was likely in a fragile state, and spending time alone with Megan risked reversing her progress. Coming to the classroom ten minutes earlier was a small price to prevent such an occurrence. </p><p>It proved a wise choice. Camilla had come to the class five minutes before the start, wearing jeans and a conservative shirt, true to her usual standards of dressing. An attempt to compensate for the last night, no doubt. When our eyes met, a sudden blush assaulted her face, but she managed to hide it before another student could take note of it. She took her path towards the front row, trusting for my presence to blunt Megan’s assault, but I had other ideas. I gestured her to sit one of the seats on the back of the classroom. She was obedient enough to follow it, especially after I followed up with a stiff glare to reinforce the message.</p><p>Then Megan walked inside, two minutes before the class officially started. I could see more than one student looking surprised at her unexpected arrival. “Well, isn’t that a rare sight. Our resident princess decides to come the class early for once,” I said, referring to Megan’s habit of arriving late, and in a way that would be quite annoying if I had the slightest concern about the subject I was teaching, or the official authority I had as an instructor. Normally, Megan would have entered the classroom five to ten minutes late, her thin-heeled shoes clicking loudly in every unhurried step she took, her smirk telling that she was aware just how big of a distraction she was being, and enjoying every single moment of it. </p><p>But not today. Her clothing was the only thing that hadn’t changed, sexy as always. A loose short skirt, combined with a tight tank-top, both dark red to reflect her negative yet angry mood, searching for her target to explode. She had a red leather jacket on top, and dark makeup to complete her dangerous image. Of course, it was really hard to pull a dangerous aura with designer clothes, and it hadn’t needed pointing out that Megan failed in it. </p><p>But the rest was unusual. Her haughty expression was replaced by stark annoyance, though students seemed obvious to it as Megan quickly glanced around. Front rows at first, looking for Camilla in her usual seat, though several seconds later she managed to notice Camilla was sitting on the back of the class, whose efforts to make herself unseen had just failed. </p><p>Anger was in her steps as she climbed the classroom stairs. I wasn’t surprised by her mood shift. She had been blackmailed humiliatingly less than a day ago, and Camilla’s sudden silence couldn’t have helped. I started talking about today’s topic halfheartedly, keeping one eye between Megan and Camilla. Her earlier capitulation in my hands hadn’t helped my regard towards Camilla’s willpower, and I didn’t Megan to waste a whole night’s effort, which she seemed to do effectively. I wasn’t able to hear what she was whispering, but her aggressive gestures were enough for me to take a wild stab at them. And Camilla’s expression told me that she was not far away from breaking. </p><p>I had no intention of allowing Megan to achieve her objective. “Miss Collins,” I suddenly called, referring Megan with her surname. “Why don’t you explain your precious insights to the whole classroom,” I added. </p><p>The classroom fell silent, surprised, all of them turning toward Megan, trying to see what she had done to trigger me. I didn’t blame them. It was the first time I called someone about their behavior in the class explicitly. I could see a blush creeping up Megan’s neck, disliking the attention she hadn’t receive in her own terms. Still, her voice was quite even as she spoke. “Sorry, professor, but we were discussing a personal matter. I’ll make sure to keep my voice lower.” </p><p>She assumed it was it, already turning back towards Camilla. “I’m afraid it won’t do,” I said, and just like that, her attention was back on me. “It’s one thing that you are not paying attention to my lesson, Miss Collins. Unfortunately, I’m used to it. But by distracting other students, you cross the line. Come sit on the front row, please. If you’re going to insist on acting like a child, I’m going to treat you like one.” </p><p>It was amusing to watch the seeds of another rage explosion appear on her face. “Are you serious?” she murmured in shock. I just nodded, letting my smirk widen in a very peculiar way, like how it was just before I had stolen a kiss off her pouty lips. “This is bullshit,” she added as she took her stuff. She started walking, each step a thunder. I didn’t say anything until she passed the first row of seats and turned towards the entrance. “You can leave of course,” I added. “But let me remind you that you’re already risking to fail, and your spotty attendance is not exactly helping. If you step out, I cannot guarantee that you won’t receive an F.” </p><p>I was lucky that she didn’t have any superhero heat gaze, because if she had, I would have been vaporized in a moment under the heat of her fury. I wanted to let my smirk widen even further, to make her know that it was just another intentional dig I prepared in the way of ruining her, but I kept my expression neutral, not wanting to anger her to a point she found a failing grade acceptable. “Okay,” she murmured, her voice laced with venom, and she took a seat on the first row. </p><p>I struggled not to make a victory sign when I saw her sitting on the uttermost left seat, which was partially covered by a support beam that bulged from the wall. And since none of my other students preferred to sit on the first row, Megan was mostly hidden from the view of the other students. A perfect development. </p><p>I didn’t bother to say anything when more than one student reached for their phones, filling the school gossip mill with their perceptions about what had just happened. Megan glared them, hoping to stem the tide, but her glare was not effective, the fingers continued to dance over the keyboards of their phones. </p><p>I continued to teach, waiting for the excitement to lessen. Five minutes later, I walked back to my desk, and opened my burner phone under my desk, hidden from the view. From there, I sent a message to Megan. ‘I heard even that loser teacher had put you in your place. First, failing to protect our sacred recordings, and now, humiliated by a no-name assistant. What a shame. One might think that you’re losing your touch, our dear leader.’ </p><p>When she pulled the phone, annoyance was the dominant emotion on her face. The message managed to shift that into anger. Her fingers drummed on her phone, and her reply appeared on my screen a second later, which I read from the corner of my eye. ‘What are you talking about?’ she asked, trying to deflect the situation. </p><p>‘Everyone is already talking about it, which is yet another failure. You are clearly lax in establishing your authority if the rest of the students could gossip about you this easily.’ </p><p>‘What do you want?’ Megan wrote back, trying to go into the root of the issue rather than lengthening the discussion pointlessly. </p><p>‘I want you to take revenge against that insolent man. What he had done is unacceptable,’ I typed. </p><p>‘It’s nice to see you care,’ came the sarcastic reply. </p><p>‘Don’t be absurd, I wouldn’t have cared even if that man bent you over in the middle of the classroom and spanked you, if the other students hadn’t seen you. But your role in the sorority makes it an insult to me as well, which I find unacceptable. You need to make him pay.’ </p><p>‘What I’m going to do in the middle of the class, flash him?’ she wrote back.   </p><p>‘Yes,’ I wrote back, and an expression of total shock passed over her face, her mouth agape. “Miss Megan,” I said loudly. “Do I need to take your phone as well?” </p><p>“Sorry, professor,” she answered in a panic, clearly not willing to lose her phone right now. ‘What the fuck are you talking about!’ she wrote after I returned to presenting my lesson. </p><p>‘Simple, I want him looking at you with obvious arousal, and with a tent on his pants. With that, it would look like he was picking you up to get a better view under your skirt, making his poor impulse control responsible.’ </p><p>‘Amazing solution! It only requires me humiliating myself,’ she wrote, the anger that invaded her face intensifying to a point that didn’t allow anything else, so much that I was surprised she didn’t smash her phone against the wall. </p><p>‘That is an acceptable trade-off for me, as long as rest of the students doesn’t realize it,’ I wrote, then sent a second one before she could reply. ‘That’s all I’m going to say. Do it, or I call the alumni council about your poor leadership. And don’t forget, I have a couple of friends that are telling me what’s going on in the classroom. You better perform to my satisfaction, or more accurately, to his satisfaction.’ </p><p>It was a credit to her health that Megan didn’t suffer a heart attack or a stroke in her anger. She typed a couple more messages, but her mysterious blackmailer ignored them, leaving her on the verge of an explosion. Seconds passed as she managed to suppress her anger, in which she was partially successful. The anger was still apparent on her face, but at least she didn’t look at the verge of a stroke. </p><p>But she did nothing else after managing to control her anger. Minutes passed, and I was about to write off my plan as a failure when Megan raised her hand. “Go ahead,” I said. </p><p>“Professor,” she said with a sweet voice that had no bearing to her real feelings. “I’m not sure I understood the last part. Could you repeat why parallelism is important in there.” It was a pointless question that had little to do with the topic I was explaining, not that I found it annoying. The important thing was not her question, but the fact that her legs were parted open enough to inform me about her choice of the panties for the day, a g-string that matched colors with her jacket. </p><p>If it had caught me with a surprise, it might have affected me negatively, but not when I was prepared. I still let my eyes to dip down a moment, informing Megan that I indeed noticed what she was trying to do. I let my eyes grow slightly, enough to be noticed by someone that knew what she was looking, before pulling them away and launching a short explanation about her question, namely, why it was irrelevant, and why she needed to be more attentive while listening to me. </p><p>My action was enough for Megan to notice, but it stayed hidden from other students, who weren’t paying much attention to my lecture. During the explanation, she closed her legs a couple of times, only to open them wider every time, with her skirt sliding upwards with every repeat. Once again, I was careful not to gaze it by any more than a glancing view. There was no point of letting her succeed after all the effort that went into setting her up. </p><p>I could see desperation growing on her face with each passing second. She grabbed the edge of her tank-top, surreptitiously pulling it down, creating a nice cleavage on her shirt. I let my gaze dip down into her amazing valley for a second, trying to show her that her efforts weren’t in vain completely, but still far from the success. She pulled her shirt even lower, but this time, enough to risk revealing her areolas, but the only thing she was able to get from me was another moment’s gaze. Still, I admired her. She was using her location, covered by the support beam, to the maximum impact. Too bad the game she was trying to win was rigged from the start.   </p><p>With her latest plan failing to bring the desired impact, she stilled, thinking about the next step. My gaze flickered over her occasionally, enjoying her cleavage, which she hadn’t bothered to fix. But her next move was a nice surprise for me. Her hand disappeared under her skirt. When it appeared once again, it was dragging a particular baby-blue colored string along. That one managed to put a slackened expression on my face for a moment, surprised by her courage to remove her panties in the middle of the class. Maybe I had been underestimating the importance of that sorority thing for the girls. </p><p>She raised her legs to pull her panties, a move that treated me with a perfect view of her slit, helped by the looseness of her skirt. I let my gaze fell to that. Her panties disappeared into her bag. She deserved a victory for her daring, I decided, trying to plan the best way of letting her off the hook. Of course, she managed to make me change my mind soon after. Her lips turned into a smirk that simultaneously managed to announce her upcoming victory and informed me that I was an inferior being, unable to resist her perfection. </p><p>Just like that, I decided against giving her any reprieve. I pulled my gaze away from her and walked to my desk. I checked my normal phone, and put it back in a calculated image of carelessness while leaving its video-recording function running, its camera pointed towards Megan. </p><p>Her victorious expression replaced with another frown as I continued the lesson, acting impervious to her shenanigans. Soon, angry sparks joined her expression, and she didn’t even bother to hide them. Instead, she pulled her skirt up, removing its already restricted ability to hide her nether lips. She brought her hand there, but instead of using her fingers to hide, two of them delved into her tunnel, starting to masturbate in the middle of the lesson. </p><p>It was an impressive display of dedication. She could be valedictorian of the school if she had bothered to show half of that commitment to course material. I continued teaching the lesson, only paying occasional glance to the sexy redhead that was playing with herself. I turned my gaze to Camilla, who was watching me with a confused gaze. She clearly had a good idea of what was going on, but she knew neither the reason, nor its true extent. </p><p>The situation continued without a change, except her fingers, which started to move with a desperate hurry, afraid that she was about to fail her task. I didn’t bother to look at her, fanning her desperation even more. “And that’s it for today,” I suddenly called, a few minutes before the scheduled time, leaving Megan scrambling to cover her body. She pulled her shirt to its previous place, her legs sealed shut, her head lowered to hide the blooming panic. </p><p>The students get out one by one, but I gestured Camilla to stop before she could leave. “Can you visit me in my office tomorrow at noon,” I said her. “I have something I want to discuss with you that you might be interested in.” She left as well, leaving only Megan in the classroom. I walked to my desk, stopped the recording before engaging the voice recorder. When I turned to Megan, I saw her trying to leave the class. “Where do you think you’re going,” I said. </p><p>“The lesson is over, isn’t it,” she shot back angrily, but I was wordy enough to know that her anger was paper thin, and her face was red with embarrassment. After all, she had spent most of the lesson masturbating, and to insult to injury, failed to impress her target with it. </p><p>“For the others,” I said. “There are still a couple of things we need to go over.”</p><p>“I’m not interested,” she said. She continued to walk towards the door. </p><p>“If that’s what you prefer,” I added, and she continued. “I would walk directly with the administration if you’re unwilling to resolve it,” I added, and her steps froze. </p><p>“You wouldn’t,” she spat as she turned with great speed, a movement that treated me with the full view of her lower half as her skirt fluttered. </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I,” I answered calmly. “It’s clear that you’re trying to get both of us kicked out of the school with your ridiculous antics. I’m just trying to save my job.” </p><p>“You think the administration would believe you before me?” she said with a laugh. “All it would take a sob story about the big-bad professor threatening me with bad grades, and you’re history.” </p><p>“You’re right,” I said, surprising her. “Or more accurately, you would have been right, if I hadn’t been recording the lesson for reference, to identify my own improvement points.” And just like that, her skin turned whiter than a supremacist rally. </p><p>“You what!” she exclaimed. </p><p>“I said I have been recording the lesson for my personal reference.” A smirk danced on my lips. “Of course, I wasn’t expecting it to net some scenes that would fit perfectly for some late night distraction, but that’s luck.” </p><p>“You…” she stammered, unable to continue for a moment. “You pervert!” </p><p>“Keep it low if you don’t want others to come here,” I warned her. “And I don’t think you could call someone pervert, miss I-masturbate-in-classrooms.” She coughed in shock, not expecting me to call her this explicitly. “What do you have to say for yourself,” I added. She said nothing, realizing, for the first time, the stupid situation she had pushed herself in. “Miss Collins, an answer please,” I said. </p><p>“It was a bet,” she said, her voice a bit more than a whisper. “The girls in the sorority dared me for it, and I didn’t think much about it. I’m sorry, professor,” she said, her expression turned into a fake vulnerability. The shift was impressive, though obviously not enough to trick me. </p><p>“Apology not accepted,” I said, and her fake expression melted instantly, leaving anger alone on her face. “I’m not in the habit of acting nice to people who tries to ruin my life, Miss Collins, so you need to work better before convincing me to your sincerity.” </p><p>“How,” she murmured. </p><p>“Let me show you,” I said before suddenly starting walking towards her. I let my teaching persona to crack, giving her a glimpse of my true personality. Not fully, of course. I didn’t want her run away screaming, or faint helplessly. Just enough to make her realize that she was messing with someone she didn’t fully comprehend.</p><p>As I walked towards her, she walked back, trying to avoid me. But she lacked the awareness to realize that she was walking deeper into the classroom as she tried to avoid me. She realized it when her back hit to a wall, but it was too late to do something. I was already in front of her, cutting her path to escape. Even better, the weird shape of the wall blocked the view from the entrance. </p><p>“So, Megan,” I whispered. “Do you have a guess what is next.” </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered, gasping slightly. </p><p>“Let me enlighten you then,” I said, and pressed one of my hands to her shoulder, pinning her in place. The other slid underneath her skirt, caressing her wet folds. </p><p>“What are you-” she tried to exclaim, but I had no intention of letting her finish her sentence. And, since my hands were currently busy, the task fell to my lips. I pressed mine against hers, enjoying her warmth. Her mouth opened in shock, and I leveraged the opportunity to slide my tongue into her mouth. She stiffened even more. I knew how to loosen her up. Two of my fingers disappeared into her wet tunnel, dancing inside her mercilessly. </p><p>It took a while for her to start reacting, and her hands found my chest. She tried to push me away, but it was a soft one, lacking conviction, easy to ignore. I continued. Her next attempt to push me away came from her tongue, trying to launch an ineffectual counterattack to balance my assault. Not only that one failed as well, but also its only effect was to increase the pleasure I was feeling even further. </p><p>I let my hand, the one that was on her shoulder, to travel lower, until it found the edge of her top. I didn’t waste any time before pulling it down, though I was careful not to rip it off. The last thing I needed was the gossip it would create if someone saw a student with a ripped top leaving my class. Still, I pulled her top enough to put her bra on display, a flimsy piece that barely resisted when I pulled it down as well, leaving her tits bare for my attention. </p><p>I didn’t lose any time before sinking my fingers into their expanse, tasting their softness, their malleability. I could feel her lips trembling as she moaned helplessly, the taste of cherry filling my mouth. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than whipping my cock free, and taking her hard until she begged for mercy, her body trembling with orgasm. </p><p>Unfortunately, the location was not conducive for that, so I did the only thing I could. I pulled back without a warning, leaving her gaping with the sudden absence. She stumbled forward, her trembling legs unable to keep her weight, and she found herself on her knees. It was a perfect position to introduce her to my rod, but someone could come in any second. “That was just a sample of what might happen if you try to push your luck, cutie,” I said. “Think hard before trying anything else. You have been warned.” </p><p>Before she could process her shock, I walked away, leaving my student behind, gaping in shock, and trembling with the sudden absence of pleasure… </p>",

    "content": "<p>There was a certain pleasure in watching Brenda turn towards me once again after discreetly locking the door, her eyes wide with shock, her eyes stuck on the movement of my arms as I forced my shaft deeper into Natalie’s throat. I gestured Brenda to walk towards the shelf before turning my gaze downward, only to met with Natalie’s panicked gaze, begging for a reprieve. I just forced even deeper, enjoying her rising panic as she struggled to keep silent. </p><p>“Where should I place those files,” Brenda asked without prompting. </p><p>Smart girl, I thought, creating an excuse to stay in the room without my prompting. Though, if I was reading the excited glances she threw towards the table correctly, it was less about helping me, and more about enjoyment at seeing the woman who previously dominated sharing the same submissive position. It suggested that my unofficial assistant would be much more helpful than I had first thought, especially with her obvious thrill in seeing Natalie being dominated. “The top shelf would be the best,” I said before stalling for a second. “Actually, would it be a bother if you rearrange the shelf completely,” I added, ignoring the panicked tap on my leg. </p><p>“Sure,” Brenda said, but instead of doing that, she placed the files on her hand on the top shelf haphazardly, then turned towards me. I dragged my finger vertically through the center of my chest. She smiled sultry in understanding, her hands rising to her chest to fix the issue of her being overdressed. Her fingers danced over her buttons, her shirt parting to reveal a lacy white bra, deficient in the area it covered, just tight enough to push her breasts up in a perfect presentation. </p><p>Not that they needed much help in that front, as shown when she reached to her back without a prompt, loosening the hold of her bra. It slid off enough to reveal her nipples, erect in arousal. I could see a smirk widening on her face as I managed to bring my gaze back to her face from the momentary distraction. “How about this way, Nathan,” she asked, her words stretching in a barely hidden amusement. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I answered even as I put additional pressure over Natalie’s head, pushing my shaft even deeper into her throat. She looked up, her eyes burning with fury, but she had no recourse other than tapping my leg helplessly, struggling to keep silent. “But the filing needs better presentation.” </p><p>“You think my presentation is not enough?” Brenda drawled with a smirk, cupping her breasts, pushing them upwards. </p><p>“I wouldn’t say no to some improvement,” I answered, my hands still on Natalie’s head. </p><p>Her smile widened on the challenge. I was surprised when her feet slipped out of her shoes, but understood the reason a moment later. She started walking across the room, making little noise without her heels clicking on the ground. Free from the noise, she was free to walk around freely. Her bra loosened further with her movement, giving me a glimpse of her nipples. “Better?” she asked. </p><p>“Better,” I approved, then glanced down to confirm Natalie was still sufficiently distracted with her task to notice the subtext. I turned my attention back to Brenda. She loosened her skirt, but she chose to pull it up even higher rather than to push it down. Still, it wasn’t exactly hardship from my end, the skirt was barely long enough to cover her panties under the normal condition. Pulled up like that, it barely hid anything. </p><p>Then, she tried to take a long step, only for a painful gasp to escape her mouth, her hand sliding towards her backside. Walking around with an anal plug wasn’t a simple task, after all. “Are you okay,” I asked her in mock concern. </p><p>“Yeah,” she gasped, but this time, her tone was intentionally overdone. “It hurts. Maybe you should kiss it and make it better.” </p><p>“Don’t tempt me,” I said, ignoring the increase of Natalie’s struggle. She seemed unhappy with the sudden flirting, but she lacked the leverage to make her dissatisfaction matter. Her lips continued to dance up and down over my shaft, more mechanical than I would have preferred under more regular conditions, but with her under my absolute control, it just made it more enjoyable. The beautiful, half-naked figure of Brenda, trying to twirl around the room erotically, but stalling with occasional pain, was the sprinkles on top.</p><p>I was driving closer to the cliff. “It looks good, you can leave them like that,” I said to Brenda. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, looking as disappointed as I was. But I just nodded. While it was fun to play with Brenda present, I couldn’t push her to the next level while Natalie was still in the room. I had pushed my chances enough as it was. Brenda pulled her skirt back its place and fixed her bra while I forced my shaft even deeper to Natalie’s throat, straining her ability to keep her gagging constrained. </p><p>Curious about what I was going to find, I looked downward, catching Natalie’s face. Anger was flaring her eyes as she struggled to keep her voice down. Her rage was burning bright, defying her attempts to keep it hidden. But even with her flaring anger, she had managed to keep her voice down until she heard Brenda slamming the door close. “Bastard,” she managed to mumble rather loudly despite the presence in her mouth. She put her hands on my knees, trying to use that as leverage to push away. But, my earlier treatment had exhausted her. She lacked the power to push, leaving her under the domination of my hands, helpless as I impaled her face repetitively. </p><p>Toying with Natalie while receiving a show from her impudent secretary had gone a long way to bring me to the land of happiness. I could feel an ocean begging to be let out, and I had no reason to deny it. Still, it didn’t mean I couldn’t have one last laugh. I loosened my grip over Natalie’s head, who pulled back almost instantly. </p><p>Only for her face to be painted with my thick spray. She tried to pull back, but my table didn’t allow it. Her expression of shocked outrage was delicious as my liquid covered her string by string while she had no option but to receive. </p><p>I pulled my chair back only after her face was covered completely with my mark, allowing her to rise up. She took a deep breath as she dragged a finger on her face, like she was having trouble believing what had just happened. Frankly, it wasn’t hard to emphasize with her. She had been defiled and humiliated at the center of her power while she could do nothing other than taking it with a smile. And to make things even worse, it was solely due to her mistakes, at least to her knowledge. All told, it was worse for her than the encounter in the casino. </p><p>Still, she managed to keep herself from shouting, or even uttering a snide word, as slowly stood up. The only obvious indicator she had was the frown in her face, defying her attempts to fake a smile. She was burning with a desire to say something harsh, or maybe to move straight to stabbing, but in the end, she chose to stay passive. She was too smart to do otherwise.  </p><p>I passed her a napkin, not bothering to hide my smug smile. She slowly dragged it over her face, getting rid of the most obvious parts of my gift. There was still no hiding what had just happened, but it was better than keeping her face covered completely. She lowered the napkin, preparing to say something, but I cut her off before she could begin. “You were a real sweetheart, boss,” I said with an exaggerated cheer. “But now I need to go back to work. These documents aren’t going to audit themselves.” </p><p>My comment caught her flatfooted, giving me enough time to fix my pants. I gestured her to pull to the side, and she took a drunken step, freeing my path to my desk. I pulled my chair closer, my pen on my hand, dancing over the documents, directly from the point we had just left. </p><p>During that show, I continued to watch her from the corner of my eye. At first, the anger flared on her face, thinking that I couldn’t see her. It was replaced with a panicked realization soon after, as she realized that her earlier efforts about to become a complete waste. She had two choices in front of her. She could either escalate it to point that would ‘ensure’ my distraction, or write-off as a bad investment and get away. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel disappointed as she started walking towards the door after picking up another napkin. Truthfully, I was expecting more than a quiet surrender from her. Maybe it was my own overestimation, I tried to reason as I kept my eyes on the papers, my pen dancing over them. Maybe it would be easier to just expose and get rid of her if she was going to be that boring to play…</p><p>I had been distracted from my musings by an audible click of the door. I raised my eyes with surprise, only to met with a reinvigorated figure. a daring smile coloring her face. It was an artificial smile, clearly forced and completely insincere, of course, but for me, that made it even better. She was trying to fight back, “Wouldn’t it be a pity to spend such a beautiful afternoon working on unnecessary paperwork,” she drawled even as her fingers found the top button on her blouse. </p><p>I leaned back, shifting my full attention to her as she closed in with slow, measured steps, every single one causing her body to dance attractively. “Maybe, but I’m having trouble thinking a better alternative. I feel like you have one in mind, boss,” I answered, not bothering to underline the last word. The circumstances were enough for that task.  </p><p>“I don’t think you’ll have too much trouble guessing,” she answered as her shirt was unbuttoned with a lingering slowness, each button revealing more of her creamy and delicious skin. “If not, maybe we should discuss your position again,” she said. I nodded, trying to look impressed. An expression that was getting increasingly easier with each passing second as the amount of skin on display increased. </p><p>Soon, her blouse went away flying, leaving the task of covering her perky tits to her bra, a task that it was too flimsy to complete successfully. Their lacy delicacy barely supported her breasts, not that her breasts needed any. I acted like my attention was fixed on her breasts, suggesting to her that she was being successful on her task. “I feel like I have an idea,” I said. “But why don’t you show it to me in detail, just to make sure there is no misunderstanding.” </p><p>“Of course,” she said with a gasp, the best way to conceal the bitterness in her tone. But I would have let it go even if I wasn’t trying to trick her, due to her fingers finally finding the zipper of her skirt. I watched with anticipation as she pulled the zipper down with torturous slowness. She turned her side to me, giving me a view of her expanding show. I licked my lips as she let the skirt to fall to the ground, revealing her panties, even skimpier than her bra. </p><p>Even better, I could see a very distinctive wet patch directly above her core, showing me that she was enjoying the moment despite all. The fact that her body was enjoying her total loss of control must have been killing her. I could see her face contorting with anger, likely assuming that her display was enough to distract me from her expression. I let her continue to think so. </p><p>I pushed my chair away from my desk, providing her a decent space to work her magic. She closed in slowly, trying to maximize the allure of each step, her heeled shoes hitting the ground with a distinct click, underlining her lingering, confident walk. Altogether, it was an amazing way to hide her real feeling. Too bad for her that I already knew what I was looking for.  </p><p>Interestingly, my situation had its own challenges as well. As she walked towards me, wearing nothing but a set sexy underwear, its black color harmonizing with her hair perfectly, complemented by her heeled shoes and tan-colored, knee-length socks, I was tempted to take the lead. A voice inside me was begging me to bend her over the table, taking her mercilessly like I had taken her secretary barely an hour ago, violating both of her holes. But I persevered. </p><p>Then, Natalie was in front of me with all her glory. She leaned forward, showing an expression of arousal, which was a credit to her acting ability. I looked into her eyes as she pressed her hands over my shoulders, looking for a clue that would prove her arousal was fake. A search that turned out to be fruitless, suggesting that I wasn’t the only one that was enjoying the situation; a small miracle considering her penchant for the dominant position, both in life and in bed.  </p><p>Soon, she leaned forward, breaking the eye contact as her lips hovered over mine, close enough for her hot breath to dance over my skin. “How’s that for a start?” she gasped erotically, making my pants tight enough to hurt. My face must have reflected my discomfort, as her face lit up in an expression reminiscent of the times that she humiliated me in front of the other employees. Just a sliver of power, but in her mind, a way to recover her lost control. </p><p>I couldn’t wait to disabuse her of that particular notion. </p><p>“Promising,” I whispered, letting my voice to hitch in a way that would suggest a sudden rush. I wasn’t the best when it came to acting, especially with my pride thumping on my ears, begging me to teach her another lesson. Luckily, she missed any clue that might have appeared on my face in the rush of victory. I leaned back in an enchanted manner. While it was tempting to explain her the situation immediately, it was going to be much better when I pulled the rug under her just before she thought she was victorious. </p><p>“Promising?” she repeated dismissively as she sat on my lap, but without pushing her full weight on it, just teasing softly. “Is it just it, promising? I would have expected something more inspiring from you, Nathan.” As she spoke, her hips started to rock, caressing my erection softly in an insistent manner. </p><p>“Lovely, inspiring, reminding me of a goddess who deigned to visit the mortal world for a moment,” I listed rapidly, trying to convince her that she had the control. I was afraid that I laid it a bit thick when her expression flickered into a frown for a moment, instantly lowering my eyes on her breasts to avoid suspicion. Thankfully, when I raised my gaze, the confidence ruled her expression once more. </p><p>“Much better,” she said smugly. “But this goddess expects worship if she was going to deign giving more than just a glimpse.” </p><p>“My pleasure,” I answered as I leaned forward, pressing my lips on her collarbone in a short, fleeting contact. It was a short one, but she shivered nonetheless. The angle of my head was preventing her from seeing my face, so I was free to smirk smugly. If she had thought the effects of our night in the casino had stayed in the past, she was wrong. That night allowed me to learn the secrets of her body, where I need to caress, lick, press, and smack to drive her into the depths of ecstasy. I could have her trembling and begging in a few moments if I wished so, but stretching the moment was more fun. I dragged my finger along her spine, extracting another shiver from her tight body. “How is this, my goddess?”</p><p>“Passable,” she answered, but the rebuke she tried to deliver was not very effective when her voice was trembling with the signs of her rising desire. She slid forward, dragging her tongue over my ear, suggesting that I wasn’t the only one that used the night as a learning opportunity. But it was a challenge I was yearned to meet. I let my other hand join the struggle, caressing her stomach while the other was busy testing the small of her back. But she reacted when my fingers moved downward, trying to slide inside her panties, she grabbed my wrist, preventing me from succeeding. “What’s the hurry,” she murmured, but I could sense her urgent panic, doubtlessly remembering what happened the last time I had unrestricted access to her most sensitive spot. “Good things come to those who wait.” </p><p>That statement was patently false, of course, nothing other than a painful mediocracy waited the idiots who decided passive acceptance was a good way to get what they wanted. Only in movies people got nice things despite their passivity. The real world belonged to ones that dared to reach forward and grab the opportunities with both hands. Still, I let her drag my hand away, not wanting to disrupt the little game that was going on between us. After all, there was a difference between the passivity of a deer and the patience of a tiger. </p><p>I kept my hands on safer locations as she pressed herself tighter on my lap, her weight firm on my shaft. She started rocking softly, enough pleasure to placate me without tempting me to push forward. Once again, I let her do so, but used the time to focus on the most sensitive spots of her body, my fingers scouring with the occasional assistance from my lips. Watching the way her expression was transforming was almost as good as her hips dancing on my lap, her confidence eroding slowly by the torrent of pleasure. </p><p>   It was enough teasing, I decided, reaching for the hook of her bra. It clicked open with a familiar twist from my fingers, and my other hand jumped to pull it off her body before she could reach. “Hey,” she exclaimed as she tried to catch her bra, but she was slow to react, and her bra was lying on the ground before she could even react. She tried to jump onto her feet with outrage, but her legs chose that second to tremble, causing her to stumble. </p><p>I was quick to grab her arm, protecting her from a painful fall. I quickly unzipped my pants to pull my shaft out as I pulled her onto my lap once more, something that she failed to notice until it was too late. Her eyes grew in shock when my length pressed against her entrance, but once again, my fingers proved faster than her reaction. The delicacy of her underwear worked to my benefit, the fragile fabric giving me no trouble as I ripped it off, leaving her without its protection, however weak. </p><p>I didn’t bother to start soft, knowing just how aroused she already was. I pushed my full length inside her, one hand wrapped around her wrist to force her down while the other reached for her lips. It proved a sensible decision as my fingers were barely on her lips before her mouth opened and she let out a loud cry, loud enough to bring rest of the office to us if it wasn’t for my fingers. </p><p>I pressed my fingers tighter as I suddenly stood up, her legs wrapping around my waist, looking for support, while another yelp escaped her lips only to be stopped by my hand. “Quiet!” I ordered sharply as I looked into her eyes, her wild panic tastier than honey. I could see the warning was working as intended, so I pulled my hand away from her mouth, both of them landing on her hips instead. </p><p>I started walking with her still on my lap, each step driving my shaft into her once again, but she was alert enough to control her moans. I walked around the room, her panic growing deeper as I closed on the window. It wasn’t a big window, and with no tall building near ours, so there was no risk of being seen unless one walked close enough to be seen from the parking lot. The idea of pushing her against the window, slamming repeatedly as she begged for mercy on fear of getting caught by one of her employees was tempting, but ultimately impossible. Walking that close to the window would be caught by the security cameras, creating a dangerous piece of evidence that I couldn't control. </p><p>And it wasn’t the like the situation that was in hand was too horrible to contemplate. With my boss on my lap, doing her best to play the obedient slave as I wandered around the room was fun enough. I sank my fingers deeper into her firm hips, forcing them to rise just a bit, enough to give me the perfect angle. Then, I slammed without mercy, forcing her mouth to open in preparation of a cry. My hands were occupied, barring them from preventing her cry, not that they were needed when a more convenient method was available. </p><p>I captured her lips in a hard kiss, my tongue roaming in her mouth. It was amusing to see her eyes popping open in shock while I invaded the soft crevices of her mouth, enjoying her taste. She tried to pull her head back, but the situation afforded no leverage for her, leaving her under my mercy. With the situation demanded, I could feel the sensation rising inside. “I’m almost there,” I whispered amusedly, making panic blossom on her face. </p><p>She managed to push herself off my lap at the last second, my seed covering her naked belly as her feet hit the floor. She just stood there, breathing hard. “Nice distraction,” I said casually as I took a napkin from the table. “I’m exhausted, and you look so too, maybe we should call it an early day,” I added. </p><p>“Sure,” she managed to say between her breaths, making no movement to get her clothes, which were lying around haphazardly. “Just sign the rest of the accounts, then we can leave.” I nodded, giving her a reason to smile in satisfaction. Too bad for her, I had already taken required notes and exceptions on the files, freeing me from the consequences. I sat on my desk, signing the rest of the documents while she made a show of dressing, in one last attempt to distract me, unaware of the uselessness of her action…</p>",

After twenty minutes of fruitless struggle to fall back unconscious, I surrendered and stood up.</p><p>I looked at the small, uncomfortable shower I had downstairs reluctantly, until I realized that there was nothing that was preventing me to use the one at the upstairs. None of the occupants could really argue against it after the quality times we spent together. </p><p>I quickly undressed, and went out with only a towel around my waist. Until upstairs, I saw no one, but I realized that my plans were ruined when I arrived there. I could already hear the water running. Or was it ruined, I quickly corrected my thoughts when I noticed only Nicole’s door was open. </p><p>I carefully twisted the doorknob, careful not to make any noise as I peered through the crack to see it was indeed Nicole that was there, looking exquisite as the warm water flowed around her, stealing the foam around. I stepped inside and closed the door, doing my best not to make any noise until the door was closed. “Good morning, Nicole,” I said. </p><p>The surprised shriek that left her mouth was quite beautiful. “Stephen,” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” </p><p>I shrugged like my presence here was something ordinary. “The shower downstairs was having some problems, so I decided to use this one,” I explained, dropping my towel mid-sentence, which revealed my hardening arousal. </p><p>“But-” she said, trying to draw rightful attention to the absurdity of the situation, but I cut her off. </p><p>“Come on, Nicole, it should be okay. A little shower together shouldn’t be a big deal after all the moments we spent together, right?” She stayed silent, but the delicious blush that spread through her whole body told me where her mind currently was. I didn’t miss the opportunity it afforded me, and stepped inside the shower. It was a snug fit, as it wasn’t exactly designed large enough for two people. </p><p>“I should go,” she murmured. “So that you can shower more comfortably.” </p><p>“Stop,” I said, wrapping my arm around her waist, though it turned out to be unnecessary. She stayed frozen as the warm water flowed over us, and I reached for the soap. “Let me help,” I said as I squeezed a dollop of liquid soap in my hand before bringing it over her back, tracing it over her spine. She trembled under my touch, but it wasn’t as interesting as the way she pushed her bottom towards me until my shaft was pressing between her cheeks. Interesting initiative, showing her body had already accepted the thing her mind did its best to reject. </p><p>My hands continued their journey over her wet skin, getting more adventurous with each passing second. One slipped lower on her back, the other shifting to her front, drawing a determined path towards her breasts. “The lock,” she murmured suddenly as my fingers brushed under her breasts. “The lock is broken, what if someone decides to enter.” </p><p>“Good point,” I answered before reaching towards the water valve, increasing the hot water, which started to fill the cabin with hot steam, enough to obscure the view. “Much better, right?” I asked. She gave no answer, but her silence might also be about the way I started to rub her bottom, or my fingers finally clasping around her breasts. I squeezed softly. “Should I remind you about the cost of avoiding answers,” I whispered into her ear. </p><p>“No need,” she moaned in panic. </p><p>“Then, answer the question,” I said, underlining my comment with my tightening grip around her breast. </p><p>“Yes, it’s much better,” she gasped, a loaded, erotic sound that begged for more. It was impressive, just how malleable she was, unable to put even the slightest resistance against my predations. I continued exploring her body, not bothering to act even the slightest like it was about helping her shower. </p><p>“So, my dear Nicole,” I whispered. “Do you have anything to do tonight?” </p><p>“No,” she answered, the way her voice trembled music to my ears. “Why?” </p><p>“We have some more costumes we need to go through,” I said. “In particular, there is a librarian costume that would fit you deliciously, complete with the garter belt.” </p><p>“Why are you doing this?” she whimpered, helpless. </p><p>I smirked at her flailing attempts of resistance. Weak, not because I represented a huge presence pushed her down, but because of the way she was wired, unable to sustain even the slightest resistance once she had accepted my authority over her. A true treasure, I thought as I brought my fingers at her entrance, exploring her entrance. “I’m doing nothing,” I said. “Or better put, I’m doing nothing you don’t want desperately. Or would you like to try to convince me that your wetness is solely due to the shower, that your own desires had no part play on this.” </p><p>Her reply was another helpless whimper, so I decided to help myself on the exquisite treasures she was offering. My fingers slid inside her repeatedly, each increasing her voice a bit more. But before I could slide inside her, I was interrupted by the door opening. “Occupied,” Nicole shouted in panic, despite lack of sight, owing to the steam that filled the room. </p><p>“Sorry, mom,” came the reply from Katie. “Madison’s cousin just dropped me off, and I need to finish my make-up. I’m almost late. And it’s not like I can see anything from the steam.” </p><p>Ideally, I should have stayed motionless, allowing Nicole to deflect the situation without distraction, but it wouldn’t have been as fun. I quickened the pacing of my fingers. “Isn’t it earlier than usual,” Nicole asked, but her voice rose halfway as my fingers pushed deeper inside her. </p><p>“There is an early assembly today for some kind of event, so the bus is going to pick us up earlier than usual.” </p><p>“Good!” Nicole answered, but her response turned into a loud moan when I decided to push the things into the new level, and slid my shaft inside her without warning, pushing deep inside her without waiting for her to get used to her presence. The result was a deep moan that filled the room. </p><p>“Are you okay, mum?” Katie asked, worried. </p><p>“It’s nothing,” Nicole managed to stammer. “I just hit my finger to a corner.” </p><p>“Ah, I see,” Katie answered. “Anyway, let me finish my makeup and I’ll go.” </p><p>The next few minutes passed relatively quickly, nothing but occasional whimpers let out by Nicole that drowned by the noise of the water. But Katie’s presence had put a bit of fight into her, she was trying to push me away. It was a weak, ineffectual display of power. But it was enough to annoy me, so I strengthened my grip on her thighs and changed my rhythm, impaling her with long, hard moves that slowed only at the last second, a small mercy for her to keep silent. </p><p>“It’s done, mom. See you at the dinner,” she said. A moment later, the sound of a door slamming shut echoed in the room. At that moment, she turned towards me, her face telling me that she had some pointed comments about what had just transpired. </p><p>But I had no intention of listening to them, which was why I wrapped my hand around her hair and pulled her back, until her back was pressing against the wall. I released her from my grip, but only because I was already in front of her, my arms on both sides of her, ready to prevent any attempt to escape. “You seem like you’re about to say something,” I ordered. “Go ahead.” </p><p>Her lips parted, but her earlier determination was already lost, unable to sustain itself through the sudden change in the situation. I didn’t allow any words to form nevertheless, pressing my lips against her ruby lips, my tongue invading her mouth to steal her ability to speak. Under a rush of assault, she was unable to make any noise other than occasional low-pitched moan. </p><p>I pushed my hips forward, and her warmth enveloped my shaft once more, filling me with desire. Only after that, I vacated her mouth, trailing kisses on her cheek on my way to her neck. At my destination, my teeth joined the fray once more, leaving a string of hickeys over her neck, each squeeze accompanied by another feminine cry, tempting me to push even harder. Soon, I was at the edge of my ability to hold back. When an orgasm hit her, making her tighten around my shaft, I was barely able to pull out, spraying on her stomach instead, which cleaned almost instantly under the torrent of warm water. </p><p>“It was a good shower,” I said, punctuating the sentence with one last peck on her lips before stepping out, leaving her alone in the shower, trembling under the effects of monumental arousal. “Don’t forget to visit me around twelve for the new costumes, and not to mention the client asked us to do one additional swimsuit,” I added as I quickly dried myself. I stepped out and went back to my room, luckily managing to avoid the girls. I hadn’t been looking forward to explaining why I was leaving the shower wet despite Nicole being there. </p><p>     <strong> *****       *****       *****       *****       ***** </strong></p><p>I was editing some of the photos I got from the earlier sessions when I heard a knock. “Come in,” I shouted, and Nicole walked in the room. “Hello, honey,” I said, my gaze back to the computer. “The costume is behind the screen, you can go and change there.”</p><p>“We need to talk,” she said, uttering the chain of words that was the name of the relationships everywhere. But her tone, flickering with indecision, barely above a whisper, told me that even after the three hours’ of determination behind it, it was still fragile.</p><p>“Go behind the screen and change,” I ordered. “We can talk whatever you want to talk during the shoot. We’re already late as it is.” She looked like she was about to argue, but another hard glance from me was enough to take the wind off her sails. Her gaze slid off my face and she walked towards the screen, defeated. She let out a whimper when she saw the swimsuit for the day, but it was a credit to her training that she didn't complain.</p><p>It was a good thing that I had seen her naked before, because otherwise, I didn't think I could have resisted the sight in front of me. She was wearing the last one from the swimsuit set, a set of string bikini that consisted of triangles barely larger than coins, held together by strings barely thicker than hair. Moreover, it was slightly transparent in its pure white color, just enough to hint me the treasures that lay behind. On her neck, I could see the hickeys I had left in the morning, peeking through the makeup. In total, it was even more revealing than the burnt orange one I had tricked her to try. </p><p>I gestured her to walk towards the set, and she did so, her ass, naked despite the valiant effort of one lone string, tumbling attractively with each step. I asked her to take a basic pose, launching the business part of the shot. Her awkwardness disappeared as she followed my commands without the slightest hesitation. Surprisingly, it took less than five minutes to take all required poses, her natural talent enhanced by the experience she gathered. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, calling the shot over. I could have undressed her on the set as I did previously, but that was getting a bit repetitive, so I decided to go with a different strategy this time. “Why don't you come and we can check the pictures together.” </p><p>I walked back to my computer without waiting for an answer, certain that she would follow. I leaned to plug the memory card, and she was standing next to me when I righted myself. “Take a seat,” I said.</p><p>“But there is no chair-” she started explaining before my arm wrapped around her waist and pulled her closer. </p><p>“It’s more comfortable than a chair, right,” I said, despite knowing it wasn't exactly true. Most chairs didn't have a certain thickness in the middle to press against her entrance. She tried to shuffle away, but my grip was tight around her waist, preventing her from sliding away, reducing her resistance to dry-rubbing. “Calm down, sweetie,” I said mockingly. “All in a due time. Why don't we go through some of your pictures first. I don't think you have seen any of them before.”</p><p>I clicked the folder that held the photos from the first day. “Let’s go back in the history first,” I said even as I pulled her a bit tighter, making sure my shaft was comfortably snug between her legs. I went through the first two dresses we had taken that day, as I amusedly watched Nicole’s eyes grew shocked, with a generous dash of arousal and hesitant anticipation mixed in. The reason was simple. In her mind, the first two dresses had been quite conservative, an impression that was getting smashed steadily as I revealed several photos I might deem as ‘interesting’. The soft caresses my hands left all over her body as we browsed the photos might have a bit of effect as well. </p><p>“How do you find the photos from your first shoot ever,” I asked her. </p><p>“Too revealing,” she managed to say, an answer that supposed to be admonishing, but lost its effectiveness by the following moan that left her mouth as I flicked one of her nipples. It wasn’t exactly convincing at the first place, at least not after just finishing the set for a string bikini that covered nothing other than the essentials, and especially not while she was sitting on my lap in the exact same ensemble. </p><p>“Really,” I said, dragging my fingers at the edge of her swimsuit. “Then, I wonder what you would say for your next set.” With a click, I moved on the last dress we had taken the first day, a tiny black dress, too tight for her underwear. A gasp escaped her mouth as I revealed the first picture without her underwear, realizing that just how revealing the dress looked. “Beautiful, right?” </p><p>She was about to answer, but I moved on the next photo before she could. Her answer froze on her lips, forgotten as her leaning pose, displaying a deep cleavage on my screen. “Daring and beautiful, right?” I asked, but didn’t receive an answer. Distracted, she didn’t even comment when I wrapped my arm around her waist once more, lifting her a bit, my other arm pushing my shorts and underwear down, so when I lowered herself once more, my shaft pointing between her legs, its top rubbing her entrance, insufficiently covered by her swimsuit. </p><p>“It’s too much,” she moaned in desperation when I shifted to the next pose, one she enabled in her desperate attempt to reduce the amount of cleavage she was putting, only to end up in a pose that revealed her bottom completely to the camera. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit. “Don’t tell me you weren’t aware of it at that time,” I said, my hand sliding down her belly until it slid past the string that was supposed to protect her modesty, but doing a terrible job. </p><p>“Of course I wasn’t,” she stated correctly, but it would be utterly unconvincing to any passerby. After all, it was hard to claim so, when just a few days later, she was sitting on my lap, undressed for all practical purposes, passively accepting as my fingers fondled her womanhood. </p><p>I wondered whether it was possible to convince her otherwise as well. She had already proven that she was vulnerable to suggestions in her distracted state, maybe I could convince her that her memories were less reliable as well. “Really? You’re saying that you were completely unaware of how revealing you were, and it was not an attempt to seduce your poor, hopeless tenant.” </p><p>“It- it wasn’t,” she said, stammering as my fingers slid inside her. </p><p>“Yes, very convincing,” I said, pointing at her wetness on the screen. “It seems that you were really unaware, look how dry you were.” </p><p>“It’s not-” she tried to say, but I prevented her from finishing her sentence when I slid my fingers, which was previously testing her wetness, into her mouth. </p><p>“Yes, you weren’t, just as you aren’t now, right?” I said, enjoying the way she obediently sucked my fingers coated with her juices. </p><p>“I’m not…” she gasped in denial after I pulled my hand back, but I could see the doubt growing on her face as she started to suspect her own recollection under the mounting evidence, her vulnerable state playing a big part on the success of my ridiculous scheme. </p><p>“Of course you’re not,” I said amusedly as I pulled the string that was holding her bottom together, and it slid away uncommented. The move that followed it was a bit more noticeable. I grabbed her hips by both hands and lifted her, only to pull her down directly above my shaft, impaling her deep in one smooth movement, extracting a moan filled with pleasure. “You’re not the kind of woman that would drive a helpless boy like me with your innocent act until he has no option but to take you in the very floor you’re helplessly squirming, right?” </p><p>“I’m not,” she said, trying to lift herself off my shaft, but her trembling legs betrayed her at the last second, and her weight impaled her across my full length, followed by another moan. </p><p>“Yes, I can see that,” I said even as I grabbed her breasts, sinking my fingers into her flesh. “It’s evident by the struggle you’re putting to extract yourself from the situation.” </p><p>“No,” she said in denial, trying to lift herself with a renewed desire. I let her try freely as she rose, only to give a gentle push that resulted in her impaling herself deep with my shaft. The same scene repeated a few times, each repeat taking less strength to send her deep into my shaft. Soon, I didn’t have to do anything as she started to complete the pattern herself, not requiring any interaction from me. </p><p>The balance continued as I quickly passed through the swimsuit photos and arrived at the nightwear section. First ones, I quickly passed, only showing a few interesting ones, then I reached the transparent negligee that I managed to convince her to try without a bra. “Yes, Nicole, please tell me how that wasn’t an attempt to drive your poor tenant crazy.” </p><p>She tightened as I moved through the photos, each more revealing than the last. “Because… Because you asked me to…” she managed to utter, her voice barely above a whisper. </p><p>“Because I asked you to,” I repeated, then wrapped my hand around her hair and pulled back. I leaned forward toward her lips like I was about to kiss, but stopped at the last second. “You’re telling me that just a word from me is enough for you to ignore all common decency, and display yourself like without a hint of shame.” </p><p>For a moment, she tried to resist answering, but that determination crumbled instantly when I started to push my hips up with the same rhythm, pushing my shaft in previously untouched depths. “Yes,” she admitted in defeat. I leaned forward to capture her lips, rewarding her for her honesty. That proved too much for her, and the orgasm hit her with all the power of an out of control plane, leaving her tightening uncontrollably. </p><p>“Let’s test your determination then,” I said even as I lifted her in a bridal hold, and carried her to the middle of the set. Midway, I pulled the string of her top, leaving her as naked as the day she was born. I laid her in the middle of the set and picked up a camera before she could recover from the orgasm. “Now, part your legs and give me a good view.” </p><p>I expected her to follow my instruction, but the fact that she parted them open without hesitation was a surprise for me. And for her as well, if the fascinated expression on her face was any indicator, but it only made the scene more beautiful, the flash flaring to immortalize her expression, innocently erotic. “Cup your breasts,” I added, and she did so, bringing her elegant fingers over her pale breasts, still carrying the marks of my rough treatment. “Squeeze,” I ordered, and her fingers sank into her flesh, followed by another moan. It was beautiful, following my commands without the slightest hesitation despite the persistent light of shock in the depths of her eyes, like she wasn’t able to believe her own reactions. </p><p>“Now, start masturbating,” I ordered, and one of her hands deserted its mission on her chest to invade her tunnel. I took a step closer, my erection danging in front of her eyes. I hadn’t had to speak for her lips to part before closing over my crown, nor when she pushed forward until half of my shaft disappeared into her mouth. “Look at me,” I ordered, and her gaze shifted at mine, a surprisingly innocent moment that made me even hornier. </p><p>The significance of time disappeared even for me as I repeatedly squeezed the shutter, immortalizing every pass she made across my length, her fingers still following my orders, desperately invading her entrance repeatedly to reach another orgasm. It was getting harder and harder to resist her mind-blowing attempts. </p><p>I didn’t bother to warn her before started spraying her mouth, and an astonished expression filled her mouth. “Keep your eyes on me,” I ordered, watching her expression as she desperately tried to keep my seed in her mouth, but a generous trickle slid from the corner of her mouth, dripping on her breasts. “Good work,” I praised her efforts, and a smile appeared on her face despite her puffed cheeks. “Swallow,” I ordered, and watched her throat constrict in glee. </p><p>“Now, spread the rest on your chest,” I ordered as I took a step back, the camera clicking furiously. “Keep your right hand where it was,” I added when I noticed she was about to stop masturbating. She did so, using her free hand to spread my seed on her breasts while continuing to finger herself furiously. Soon, she climaxed once more, sprawled on the ground, panting and wheezing. </p><p>Normally, I would have called it a day, but even in her exhausted state, I could see that it wasn’t enough for her. I had managed to break a barrier in her mind, which freed her desires, maybe for the first time in her life. I put the camera on the side, with an angle that would cover us perfectly, and turned on the recording. It was a good opportunity to record some homemade porn, I thought as I took a position between her parted legs. </p><p>The way her legs wrapped around my waist, pulling me deep inside her, told me that we were in agreement, so I lost myself in her… </p>",

    "title": "Revenge of a Nerd - 1",
    "content": "<p>Kim was in a hurry as she dashed through the corridors of the school. She had just left the English classroom, where she had received a dressing down from Mrs. Robertson, her English teacher, about her late term paper. It hadn’t been a simple argument, her teacher had dressed her down for ten solid minutes. Insulting, she was eighteen years old, and she still had to listen to the nonsense her teachers spewed. </p><p>Kim hadn’t been able to convince her teacher for what she wanted, but still, it wasn’t a complete waste of time. She had managed to convince Mrs. Robertson to not to fail her, and gave her an extension of 24 hours. A long way from her preferred solution, namely an automatic pass because she was doing her best to represent her school as a part of school’s cheerleader team, which was more important than a measly term paper, but her teacher hadn’t been moved by that argument. Her order was clear, skipping the training in favor of homework. </p><p>Thankfully, Kim had an alternate solution. </p><p>The name of her alternative solution was Mike, one of the few rare scholarship students in the prestigious Vanguard High School, which mostly accepted the children from rich and prestigious families, which were incidentally all-white. The few scholarship students were there to make a weak claim of social diversity. </p><p>And Mike fit the bill perfectly. Not only he was a minority student with excellent grades, but also he was a silent nerd with that talent to blend into the background unless there was an exam or an academic competition, or teachers wanted to make a point about hard work and intelligence. Though the last part had managed to destroy his already slim chances of having a social life. However, it was the same ostracization that made him perfect for her aims. </p><p>She was walking towards the library to meet with him when she saw the worried face of her best friend, Olivia. “Hey, Olivia,” she called as she walked closer to her red-haired friend. </p><p>“Don’t hey me. What did Mrs. Robertson say,” Olivia answered, her voice harsh. If any classmate of hers other than Olivia had dared to use that tone against her, she would have done her best to destroy them socially, something she was more than capable as a few stuck up bitches, led by that pathetic bitch Hannah, had learned the last year. But coming from Olivia, it was easy to ignore, especially when the fate of the cheerleader team was on the line. </p><p>“No worries, I managed to get an extension for it,” Kim explained. “I won’t be flunking the class.” </p><p>“Good,” Olivia said, her tension draining. “Losing you this close to the competition would have killed us. The substitutes are total garbage. It’s a miracle that they can walk straight, let alone dance. How much extra time did you get?” </p><p>“Just twenty-four hours,” answered Kim, smiling widely. </p><p>Olivia, however, lost a bit of her smile. “Bummer. I would have preferred if you were in this training, but it’s better than losing you completely.” </p><p>Kim couldn’t help but smile even more brightly. “It won’t be a problem,” she answered. </p><p>“I don’t understand…” she murmured, then her expression tightened. “You’re going to use that nerd again!” she said, her harshness clear even through her whisper. </p><p>“Yeap,” Kim answered. “It’s a perfect solution, isn’t it? I get a B from my paper, and still join the training.” </p><p>“You’re right, but still…” murmured Olivia. “Are you sure it’s for the best. Can you imagine what would happen if Hannah catches the sight of what’s happening. She could use that to turn the tables.” </p><p>“Come on, Ollie, of course I’m smart enough to factor that. I have told Mike about the importance of keeping it discrete. He thinks that it’s about my father, that if learns about it, he would make sure to kick him out.” </p><p>“Cruel,” said Olivia with a slight giggle. “Though not as cruel as convincing that nerd that you two are secretly dating.” </p><p>“Hey,” Kim said in fake outrage. “I’ll let you know that there is nothing cruel in our arrangement. I get my homework done by my loving ‘boyfriend’, and he gets his dreams visited by my excellence. I even kiss him on the cheek several times. And that wouldn’t have been necessary if he did the smart thing and accepted money in exchange for doing people’s homework. His loss.” </p><p>“Amazing reward,” Olivia said with a laugh. “Still, I don’t know… I never feel comfortable around him. He is always too silent, and there is a something off in his eyes. It makes me feel like he is laughing at us.” </p><p>“Come on, bestie, he is just silent because he is out of his comfort zone. He just transferred here a month ago, and it would be hard even if he wasn’t just a lame nerd. He’s just trying to put a strong front. Otherwise, he would have tried to do push me for more than an occasional kiss on the cheek.” </p><p>Olivia laughed. “Of course,” she said. “You know your ‘boyfriend’ the best. Anyway, I need to go change for the training. And you need to hurry up as well. I don’t want you to be late.” </p><p>“Sure thing,” Kim said before they separated, and Kim continued her way towards the library, where she asked Mike to visit. When she entered, the place was almost completely empty. Her fellow students were not the biggest fan of studying or reading. The exception for that was sitting on the corner of the room, a book -heavier than Kim could lift- open in front of him. </p><p>She couldn’t help but examine him once more as she walked towards him. He was tall enough to dwarf her even when she was wearing heels, and combined with his dusky complexion, it gave him a dangerous air. Well, to be more accurate, it would have given him a dangerous hair if it wasn’t for his dorky glasses and slouched shoulders. His clothes were even dorkier, and they were really loose on his body. A pity, because the few times she had brushed against his arm as they flirted, and it was packing a surprising amount of muscle. </p><p>Pity, she thought. If it wasn’t for his horrible clothes and his passive demeanor, he could be almost handsome. Still not dating material, of course, Kim would never go out anyone less than an heir to a nine-figure fortune. She had standards! But she had to act like it, to make sure she graduated. Her parents would kill her if she managed to fail one or two classes. </p><p>“Hey, honey,” whispered Kim as she leaned towards him, and after a few looks to make sure no one was around, she landed a small peck on his cheek. He raised his head, but looked otherwise unaffected. Still, Kim knew it was false. He had a huge crush on her. After all, why would he agree to spend all that time with her in her house, tutoring her on all of her subjects. He was even willing to stay in her room and finish her homework while Kim went shopping with the girls. </p><p>“Hey, Kim,” he answered. “Are you ready to leave?” </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” said Kim in an exaggerated display of sadness. “I forgot that there is a training session today, and I need to attend to it.” She looked at the ground, fluttering her eyelashes in a way that faked an innocent look. “I’m sorry.” </p><p>“No worries, I know how important cheerleading is for you,” he answered. His tone was unaffected, but they didn’t eclipse the sentiment. Kim felt a bit of guilt. Here she was, leading him on, and he was playing the part of the respectful boyfriend perfectly. “We can always hang out later.” </p><p>The way he said his last statement bothered Kim for some reason, but it was gone before Kim could identify. She shrugged, preferring to focus on more important matters instead. “Actually…” she murmured, trying to sound cute. “I also need to finish my English paper…” </p><p>“And you need my help, I’m guessing,” Mike said. If anyone else used that tone, she would have blamed them for sarcasm, but not Mike. He didn’t have the confidence to snap back at her. </p><p>“Yes,” Kim said. “It would be amazing,” said Kim. “Amazing enough to earn a real kiss, maybe,” she added, with no actual intention of kissing him. She had standards. </p><p> “It sounds amazing,” he said excitedly. It sounded fake, but any emotion coming from him sounded fake, it was basically a personality trait of him, so she ignored it. “What’s the topic.” </p><p>“I don’t remember exactly,” she said. “But I have a printout of the assignment.” He raised his hand. “It’s at home,” she added, slightly blushing. “Can you go right now and start on the paper. I’ll come as soon as the practice is over and help you with.” Of course, what she meant was she was going to go, but only after getting some coffee with the girls. With that, she only had to play the role of shy girlfriend for half an hour before Mike had to leave to catch the last bus. </p><p>“Sure,” he said. </p><p>“Here are the keys,” Kim said as she put them in front of him, and after another peck on his cheek, she was gone for the training.</p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>“Damn, damn, damn,” Kim murmured every time her left foot pressed the ground as she walked on the driveway of her house. She was trying not to put too much weight on her leg, but even then, her attempts to ignore the pain was failing miserably. The substitute cheerleaders turned out to be even more useless than Olivia had claimed. Two of them mistimed their move in a critical time, and collided with her rather hard, and she ended up with a sprained ankle. Thankfully, according to the coach, it was nothing serious. She just needed to rest it for a couple of days, and she could return to training. </p><p>Although, there was a small benefit to her sprained ankle, she realized as she stopped looking for her keys, remembering that she had given them to her fake-boyfriend earlier. With her ankle wrapped, she had the perfect excuse to play the petulant girlfriend, asking him to prepare snacks and such, and he would be too guilty to reject. </p><p>But all those thoughts flew away from her mind when she opened the room, only for a cry to fill her ears. There were a few reasons for her sudden freeze. First, she recognized the source of her voice, it was her older sister, who apparently decided to arrive earlier than usual. Second, and more importantly, it wasn’t a cry of pain, or even shock. No, it was a cry of sexual pleasure, likes of which she only heard in porn movies. And the third reason, Mike’s shoes were still at the entrance, meaning her fake-boyfriend was still at home, listening to her sister having sex. </p><p>“First things first,” Kim murmured as she slowly walked through the large entrance hall, trying to reach the stairs. As she walked, she came across a pale blue blouse, and she recognized it as one of her sister’s favorites, one she wore only the most important events because she believed it to be lucky. She probably had a fundraising event today, and met someone there, Kim decided. </p><p>She continued walking, for once in her life, cursing the size of her house. It was too big to walk with a sprained ankle, especially with her sister’s heated moans echoing in her ears. Kim couldn’t believe her sister brought someone in their house despite her engagement. It wasn’t her betrayal that annoyed Kim, however. Rather, it was her sister’s poor decision making. If she wanted to get some loving, she should be smart enough to go to a hotel discreetly rather than risking discovery like that. All it would take was a jealous neighbor to ruin her engagement. </p><p>She started climbing the stairs, which was rather difficult with the moans of her sister echoing, broken by an occasional slapping sound. Apparently, her sister’s taste was a bit harsher than Kim would’ve thought. And her mood wasn’t improved when she saw a dark green skirt on the bottom of the stairs, and the lacy bra that was hanging from the stairwell didn’t help either. For a moment, her heart was frozen in fear, afraid that her sister and her mystery companion came across Mike on the corridor. That would have been a total disaster.</p><p>A relaxed sigh escaped her mouth as she climbed the upstairs corridor, only to see it empty. She was afraid to find Mike in front of her sister’s room, trying to get a peek for his virgin eyes, tempted by the voices. To be fair, he didn’t have the slimy personality that made her think like that, but in the end, he was still a nerd. With that in mind, she walked to her room, as quick as she could manage with her limp. </p><p>But another unwelcome surprise was waiting for her in her room. It was empty! A glance was enough to show there was a half-written essay on her desk, meaning Mike had been there earlier. But now, he wasn’t. “Maybe he’s in the bathroom,” she murmured to herself. “Or maybe he’s in downstairs, trying to stay away from her sister.” Probably the second one, she decided. As a socially-inept nerd, she could easily imagine Mike huddled in the corner with headphones on, trying to ignore what’s going on. Especially now, with her sister shouting loudly, clearly orgasming. She started to plan how to tease Mike… </p><p>But her plans came to a sudden stop when he heard a male voice. “What I told you about cumming without asking my permission,” asked the voice in a calm but sharp manner. It was an effortless command, like he was supremely confident of the obedience of his subject. But that wasn’t what surprised Kim. No, it was the fact that she recognized the voice that surprised her. </p><p>“It can’t be,” she murmured, trying to reject the conclusion her ears reached. “It can’t be him inside, with my sister…” Maybe she thought it was his voice just because she was thinking about how to tease him. “I must have misheard,” she added, trying to convince herself, but that didn’t prevent her legs from dragging her towards Audrey’s door. </p><p>Another little surprise was waiting for Kim in front of her sister’s door. A pair of panties, matching to the bra that she found on the way, though the surprise was not limited to that. There was a dark patch on the front, revealing the level of arousal her sister was feeling at the moment of separation. And to top all off, her panties were in pieces like they were forcibly ripped off, which almost convinced Kim that she was being paranoid about the identity of the man inside. There was no way Mike, the silent nerd that never once acted against anyone despite all the reasons for it, could have acted determined enough to rip a woman’s underwear off like that…</p><p>She repeated those excuses again and again in her mind, trying to convince herself to turn back, but the pleasure-filled cries of her sister prevented her from doing so. Such a familiar voice, creating such an unfamiliar tone. No, she had to look, and make sure it wasn’t Mike. There was no way that spineless, weak nerd to be someone as amazing as her incredible and confident older sister.</p><p>There was just no way… </p><p>The statement was echoing in her mind again and again as she leaned towards the keyhole, for once happy with the classical internal architecture of their house, giving her a chance to peek inside. She could feel her heartbeat quickening as the distance between the keyhole and her eye dwindled, a small, cold voice in her head begging for her to pull back, trying to convince her that there wasn’t a welcome treasure at the end of the rainbow… </p><p>Then, she looked through the keyhole, seeing the most shocking view of her life. It wasn’t just the identities of the people in the room, which was shocking enough. Her sister, and the dorky nerd she had tricked just to get her homework. But it was just a beginning. They weren’t even on the bed. No, her sister was on the floor, on her hands and knees, taken like a common whore, her strength and confidence nowhere to be seen as she got slammed from behind again and again. The angle didn’t allow her to see her face, but her enthusiastic moans were clue enough about her actual feelings. </p><p>Of course, regardless of all, her sister wasn’t the biggest surprise for Kim. No, that reward went to the pathetic nerd that she tricked as her boyfriend. Or at least, to the man that Kim previously thought as a pathetic nerd. But, seeing him behind her sister, impaling her again and again. His back was turned to her, but like her sister, Kim hadn’t needed to see his face to understand his feeling. This time, it was the stance that clued her rather than voice, but it was equally accurate. </p><p>Seeing him naked was a revelation, and not a welcome one. He stood straight, strong, the small, characteristic hunch on his back nowhere to be seen. In school, despite his tall stature, his presence was faint, like he was a drab gray drawing in a sea of color. But not now, not when he stood behind her sister, driving into her in a speed that made Kim wish that he had a small penis. Otherwise, she didn’t think her sister would be able to walk tomorrow… </p><p>With her suspicion confirmed in the worst possible way, Kim had no reason to wait. She needed to either just walk away, or come up with a way to stop the absurdity that was going on. But she did neither, failing to take any action. She stayed with her eye pressing against the keyhole, hypnotized by the rippling of the muscles on Mike’s back, his milky caramel skin reflecting the light in an enchanting manner. </p><p>His muscles were yet another surprise for her. In school, he was always dressed in loose shirts, and equally ill-fitting jeans. He never wore t-shirts, even in the gym class. She had just assumed that he was one of those weaklings that would struggle to lift anything heavier than a thick book, and he had given her no reason to think otherwise. Seeing him naked showed her just how off-base she had been, and left one very important question. Why? Why exactly he was hiding himself </p><p>But she didn’t have too much time thinking about it, his hand, landing on her sister’s bottom with a loud crack pulling Kim out of her mulling. “I’m thirsty,” he said simply, and Kim pulled back in panic. She could feel her heart thumping on her ears, almost making it impossible for her to hear her sister’s response. </p><p>Almost, but not quite. Kim still heard her sister’s response, though she would have preferred not to hear it. “I’ll bring some to you immediately, sir,” her sister said. Her sister, one of the proudest woman Kim had ever known just called the pathetic nerd that was only there to do her homework as sir, like he was her superior. It was even more shocking than seeing them together, naked. </p><p>She started walking towards the stairs, not wanting to come across her sister at that particular moment, not knowing what to say. Though she was slowed down by her ankle, hurting with each step. Then, she heard Mike speaking once more, changing his mind once more. “Who told you to wear anything,” he said, his voice sharp in its commanding presence. But Kim didn’t waste time comparing his new tone with his usual passive one, far too busy with trying to reach downstairs before her sister could see her. She sped up, ignoring the sharp flare of pain with each hurried step. </p><p>She was on the lowest step of the stairs when she heard the door opening. Her sister was on the corridor, Kim realized, and there was no way she could reach the door before her sister reached the downstairs. So, she did the only reasonable thing, and slipped in the first room that was available, hiding in the shadows. </p><p>She was in the room just for a second when she heard the footsteps at the end of the stairs, closing in a hurry. Before Kim could take a breath, her sister passed in front of her, clad in her birthday suit. Her mouth fell open in shock, trying to process the glimpse she caught about the state her sister was in. Her hair, usually shaped carefully by a hairdresser, had turned into a mussed mess, sticking to her shoulder, signaling the rough treatment she had been subjected to. But even more surprising was her skin. The pale expanse of her pristine skin was broken by red patches, looking suspiciously like fingers. </p><p>It was risky, but Kim couldn’t help but peek from the corner of the door, watching the naked and bruised body of her sister as she rushed towards the kitchen, her shapely bottom dancing freely with each step despite her easily noticeable limp. But the most important detail for Kim was the small droplets traveling down her sister’s thighs; just another immutable clue that her sister was enjoying the treatment, defying all the reason. </p><p>Kim skunked back to shadows as her sister was leaving the kitchen. She had no intention of getting caught. The night was weird enough without a confrontation with her sister. She stayed in the room until she heard the door closed once more, then stumbled towards the entrance. But, in a feeling of sudden vindictiveness, she took her sister’s bra and stuffed it under one of the couch cushions, small revenge compared to her own shock. </p><p>Audrey’s cries were rising once again as she left the house, jumbling her thoughts even further…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I watched Camilla as she disappeared through the bathroom door, considering relative merits of joining her in the shower. But however tempting the idea of assisting the droplets of hot water as they caressed every inch of her body, I decided to stay back. For two reason. First, she needed a bit of space to gather herself before we launched into the other part of our deal. The second, I didn’t trust myself that I could prevent myself from sampling the full range her delicious body offered right after all that happened. So, I changed into shorts, which was much more comfortable than jeans, especially with my constant hardness. Then, I sat on my desk and busied myself with one of the least erotic tasks imaginable, scoring the test. </p><p>It took almost half an hour for Camilla to step out of the bathroom, her cleavage shining with the water, a cleavage that started an inch above her nipples. Her discomfort with the amount of skin that was on display was obvious, but she didn’t have much choice if she still wanted for her bottom to stay covered. The towel was short enough to cover her most sensitive spot, but only barely, a careless step threatening to reveal all. And with her panties drenched during our earlier exercise, she had nothing to wear underneath. </p><p>“Why don’t you come here and help me to grade these papers,” I said to her. </p><p>It was clear that it wasn’t what she expected, but she nodded rapidly. “Where can I get a chair,” she murmured. </p><p>“Just come here,” I said, once again using a harsher tone that I made her associate with orders, and if not followed, punishment. It was a beautiful sight to watch her walking towards me, faster than what would be advisable considering the reach of the towel she had as her only piece of clothing. As a result, she treated me the delicious view of her slit a couple of times. Then, she stood next to me, looking around to find a chair to sit on. </p><p>I didn’t bother to explain to her about the best seat. Instead, I just wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her on my lap. “Professor,” she exclaimed in shock, which then I ignored in favor of pulling her on top of my shaft, which instantly returned to its erect state. Still, I was careful not to open her towel. I wanted to test her limits. </p><p>Her struggles lasted less than I expected, leaving me free to pay attention to the papers open in front of me. It was only cursory attention, of course, making sure what student had written wasn’t complete nonsense. The majority of my attention was on the body that was pressing against mine, enjoying the delicious pressure, especially against my shaft. “What do you think about this part?” I asked, gesturing a poorly written section, filled with big words in a weak attempt to hide his lack of knowledge on the subject. </p><p>She focused on the paragraph I was gesturing, her eyebrows crinkled in concentration as she tried to decipher the paragraph. “A complete nonsense,” she uttered, her sharp confidence contrasting with the situation she was in. It seemed that her academic pride was deeper than I first thought, which made the drop in her grades a bit mysterious. Maybe her relationship with Megan was more skewed than I first thought. </p><p>But despite my curiosity, I avoided asking a question on that. I continued grading papers, with Camilla sitting on my lap, making occasional comments on the sections I gestured, even the relatively good ones. Her comments were usually negative. In any other student, I would blame jealousy, but she was able to substantiate her comments with strong reasoning. </p><p>The little grading session I was holding, like everything else I had done tonight, had an interior motive. More time she spent on my lap, going over the papers, distracted over the mistakes of her classmates, more acquainted she became with my body. At first, she stopped squirming uncomfortably. Then, her flinches disappeared whenever my hand touched her towel, losing the concern that I was just going to pull it off from her body. Soon, her excessive reactions disappeared whenever I shifted my weight, which had the amusing side effect of rubbing my shaft against her slit, my short only thing that separated our skin. </p><p>It was a good time to push her personal barriers. “From your comments, it’s clear that you know your material quite well,” I pointed. “So, why am I seeing a consistent drop of quality in your last few papers? You haven’t even submitted the latest one?” I didn’t need to look to her face to see her blushing at the sudden acquisition. The peculiar way her body stiffened was answer enough for me. Unsurprisingly, she stayed silent until my palm landed on her thigh, stiff enough to make a noise. “How many times I need to remind you, when I ask a question, I expect a prompt and clear answer?” </p><p>“Sorry, professor,” she murmured, but still failed to answer until I squeezed her leg in another warning. “It’s about my private life,” she added reluctantly. </p><p>“My dear,” I murmured gently, in great contrast with my grip, which hardened even further. “I’m your professor, and it’s not inappropriate to talk me about your private life when it’s affecting your work this badly.” I avoided any reference to our current state. It was more amusing this way. </p><p>I turned a bit to watch her expression, cycling with indecision. “It’s because of a friend,” she murmured, coming to a decision quicker than I expected. Megan’s hold turned out to be weaker than I first assumed. Or my pressure was working better than I was assuming. </p><p>“Her name is Megan, she is another student in your class,” she explained, forgetting for a moment that she had already told me about her earlier.  </p><p>“Yes, I’m quite familiar with that particular student,” I said, unable to prevent a mocking edge in my words. Luckily, Camilla was too distracted with the emotional weight of her confession to notice. “I also distinctly remember that, earlier tonight, you had admitted that she was the one that convinced you to take the path of blackmail. Quite a bad friend, I would say.” And not to mention, she wasn’t the best student academically. </p><p>“We met during the registration. She was at her sorority’s desk during the registration, helping the process.” And scooting out the potential victims, no doubt. There were rich girls that joined the sorority as a family tradition, but they were not the best victims, with their experience, and the support network they could rely on. I could understand why Megan chose Camilla. Smart, beautiful, but also timid and inexperienced, she was the perfect candidate to groom into an obedient girlfriend. </p><p>“Tell me more,” I asked, and she explained how Megan had helped her to navigate her way into the college, introducing her to her friends, inviting her to the parties, and during that journey, slowly cutting off her from anyone else she could rely on. Though if I was reading some of the details correctly, she didn’t have many people to rely on to begin with. Soon, Camilla found herself living an extreme life her meager allowance couldn’t support, relying on the handouts from Megan, an implicit threat hanging over her, ready to fall down if she ever dared to turn her back. </p><p>All told, it was a good trap. Not exactly in mafia standards, of course, but considering Megan was just a rich girl with an overinflated sense of her own worth, much better than I would have expected. “Don’t worry,” I said, patting on her shoulder, while shifted carefully, forcing her to run along my length. “I can help you.” </p><p>“How?” she said as she shuffled uncomfortably. She finally paid attention to what had been going on downstairs, but the other topic was too important for her to ignore. “It’s not like she did anything that was actually against the school regulations, and even if she did and I had evidence, her father would just make them disappear. He is one of the biggest donors of the school.” </p><p>“Oh my poor grasshopper,” I said, unable to prevent a chuckle. “Who said anything about going to administration. This problem is too small to waste the precious time of our esteemed Dean. We’re going to handle it ourselves.” </p><p>“How?” she murmured in disbelief. </p><p>“Are you doubting my abilities, honey?” I asked, shifting to my authoritative tone, which caused her to stiffen once more. For good measure, I squeezed her leg, and she yelped cutely. Then, she shook her head desperately, which caused her towel to loosen, dipping enough to enhance her cleavage further, especially with the excellent angle I had. “Good,” I said as I patted her shoulder rewardingly, resulting slight tremors loosening her towel even further. “Because you have more important things to think about, like how you’re going to pay me back for the time I will spend, bringing Megan to heel.” </p><p>“What can I do for you, professor?” she murmured, clever enough to guess the easiest things I could ask from her. </p><p>“I need an assistant to help me grade the papers,” I answered. </p><p>“What,” she gasped, surprised. </p><p>“Why, Camilla,” I said, stretching her name, enjoying the feeling of it on my lips. “With that tone, one might think that you are unsatisfied with the task I had given you.” As I spoke, I let my hands-free on her body once more, exploring her body. </p><p>“No, professor,” she stammered, her blush returned with intensity as she caught under the sudden shift of situation. “It’s just that-” she tried to explain, only to cut when I pulled her towel open, removing the last, feeble protection of her breasts against my fingers. </p><p>“Yes, just that,” I said, indicating her to continue even as my fingers dived deep into her breasts. </p><p>“I would have worked as your assistant even without that,” she continued with a strained voice, which was excusable as ten fingers were driven deep into her breasts, testing their softness. “It’s a great honor.” </p><p>“Even better,” I said as I started rocking my hips. Surprisingly, she took the rhythm, and started rocking in the same motion, enhancing my pleasure even further. “Then you will be doing something you want, and get something you desperately need in return. It’s not common to find deals like that. You should enjoy it as much as you can.” </p><p>“I understand, professor,” she murmured, her hips rocking even further. She tried to sound obedient, emotionless, but the excitement was not too far behind. I wondered what was responsible for her strong reaction. My position as her professor, my willingness to help her, or the twisted details of the situations. Maybe it was simpler, like my ability to treat her body like a toy without losing control for a moment. </p><p>“Good. Then, let me give your first task. I have a particular problem I’m suffering, and you’re going to help me solve it the way I want you to.” As I said those words, I forced her to look into my eyes, waiting for her surrender to appear. </p><p>It didn’t take long for the see the expression I was looking for. She was aware just how open-ended my request was, and a part of her was begging for her to reconsider. It must be strong resistance, considering she managed to stay virgin despite her impressive beauty, but it didn’t have a chance against the situation I had prepared. She nodded once, and when she raised her eyes, I could see the surrender in them. </p><p>I was tempted to write Megan a note of thanks for the beautiful gift she had given me, but that would be disrespectful for the body that was waiting for me to teach her all about the pleasures of the flesh, the extent a rich girl with an overinflated sense of self could never envision. I wasn’t going to teach the full lesson today, of course. With all the emotional rollercoaster she had experienced, she wasn’t in a place to fully appreciate the depths of it. Still, there was a place for an appetizer. </p><p>“Good,” I said, enjoying her surrender. “You need to grade those papers tonight,” I added, gesturing the still-formidable pile of papers open in front of her. </p><p>“Yes, professor,” she murmured, but her voice carried a wisp of disappointment. It looked like my implied suggestion had been more appealing than she would have liked to display. Her disappointment only intensified when I pushed her off my lap, but I didn’t pay much attention to that. I had my important things to worry about, such as controlling myself against the sight of her nether lips, glistening in arousal. </p><p>I didn’t waste any time to push my shorts and my underwear around my ankle, then my fingers found the edge of her hips and I pulled her on my lap, directly above my length. Unfortunately, instead of sitting on the tip, she was sitting on top of my length. Still pleasurable, with her wetness rubbing against my skin, but incomparable against the real thing. She gasped in panic and tried to stand up, but my arm was already around her, preventing her from standing up. “Calm down, Camilla,” I whispered. “It’s just to make it more comfortable for you. We don’t want the fabric chafing your sensitive skin, do we?” </p><p>No answer came, not that I expected any. She was frozen with the sudden escalation, trying to process the sensation. I gave her a moment to realize her virginity was still safe, before pointing towards the paper. “Let’s start,” I ordered, like the situation was nothing out of ordinary. “Sooner you finish, sooner you can go.” </p><p>“Um, professor, is this the best way…” she said, her voice trembling in indecision. </p><p>“Definitely,” I answered. “For the first time, it’s better if I look over your shoulder, to make sure you can handle the task flawlessly.” We both knew that it was a ridiculous explanation, and if I looked over her shoulder, my attention would be on her spectacular breasts rather than the papers she was marking. But knowing and complaining was two different things, as Camilla proved with her silence.</p><p>She reached towards the red pen I used for marking, and pulled the first paper in front of her. When she started dragging the pen over the length of the paper, a cute gesture helping her to track her exact location, I copied that move with my finger, softly grazing her arm. The top of the pen trembled as she shivered, and I pulled my hand away. Just for a moment though, allowing her to contrast the sensation of pleasure and the absence of it. </p><p>She whimpered. It was a cute, needy whimper I ignored in favor of continuing my soft caresses. It was hard, especially when her juices dripped on my shaft, making me imagine the exquisite warmth I would feel the moment I push myself into her virgin hole. Still, I preserved, limiting myself to feather-light touches as she graded the first few papers. </p><p>Then, I decided to speed up. My hands drifted down to her buttocks, tracing over the thick towel that still wrapped her torso, and came to a stop where it ended, my little finger resting on her skin. I let my fingers sink into her flesh, a move which loosened her towel even further, but not enough to completely dislodge it. I gave a soft push, and she moved along the length. Her gasp was music to my ears. </p><p>She turned enough to face me, a movement which ended up in a nice grinding sensation on my lap. I ignored her alarmed expression and continued pushing her until her entrance was dangerously close to the tip, but didn’t complete it. “Go back to your papers,” I ordered her, and she turned back, leaving me free to do whatever I wanted. </p><p>I chose to reverse the earlier movement, pulling her back, making her traverse my whole length, even more pleasurable with her shivering. “Good girl,” I whispered into her ear before forcing her to repeat the whole thing. However, after the first few, I noticed a curious detail. With each repeat, it took less force to start her motion. Wanting to test, I stopped pushing, though I still kept my hands in place. But she continued grinding over my length, going back and forth. I checked to see whether she was continuing to mark the papers, only to see her pen unmoving, forgotten under the rush of pleasure. </p><p>I let her keep the charade up for a couple of minutes more, keeping my hands on her hips as she massaged my lap in a very intimate way. Then, I pulled my hands away. She repeated a few more times until she came to a sudden realization and stopped. She turned towards me, sending me a panicked look, waiting for my reaction, but I let it slip unanswered other than a knowing smirk. She ducked her head and returned to the papers with a renewed hurry. </p><p>Once again, I gave her a couple of minutes to gather herself before I moved to the next stage of my plan. My hands landed on her towel, this time slowly climbing upward, but with an irregular movement that loosened her towel even further. Her cleavage went from indecent to undressed, giving me an unrestricted view of her nipples, and an ever-increasing glimpse of her breasts. </p><p>When she noticed the gradual degradation of her clothing, the weak knot that held her towel together was about to slip away completely. Her empty hand jumped up reflexively, clamping around the knot, also sinking deep into her breast. She fixed it to the best of her ability, but I didn’t let her succeed without a cost. Just as her fingers pulled away, I pulled her towel, loosening the recently fastened towel once more. Her fingers jumped back to the knot to keep it in place. I let her succeed, but continued tugging the towel in every few seconds, reminding her that she had to take care of her towel if she hadn’t wanted to be deprived of her cover, however insufficient it was already. </p><p>During all, she managed to continue marking the papers. She even managed to mark them correctly, I saw after checking a couple of them while she was marking them. I wasn’t pushing her hard enough if she could still mark those papers, I decided. So, I leaned forward, and placed a soft, fleeting kiss on her neck. She froze, shocked by my move. I continued, not surprised by her rather extreme reaction. A kiss might be light compared to all other I had done during our encounter, but it suggested a certain intimacy that was lacking beforehand. </p><p>Only after several kisses on her neck, she managed to start moving. Her pen danced on the papers once again, but her grading was without its previous accuracy. Even better, her hips started gyrating once again, this time without me initiating it. A rush of pleasure caught me in its throes, pushing me to act harder than I had been planning. I bit her neck, and she let out a loud moan in response. More interestingly, her fingers trembled, losing their strength for a moment. For her right hand, it wasn’t very important, just causing a misaligned red line on the paper she was trying to mark. For her left, which was responsible for holding her towel in place, the consequences were harder. Her towel, held only by her tenuous grip, slipped away, leaving her beauty without its barrier to hide on. </p><p>She tried to reach her towel, but I was ready for it. My fingers wrapped around her wrist. I kept my grip intentionally soft, if she wanted, she could easily rip through it and reach to her destination. But she didn’t, instead shifted back to her earlier position, her pen in hand once more, marking the papers. Her left arm was around her chest in a last-ditch attempt to hide her breast, but it was a hopeless failure. Her thin, delicate forearm was barely able to cover her nipples and the small surrounding area, leaving the rest free for my perusal. </p><p>I decided it was enough for tonight, because any more, and I wouldn’t be able to control myself from taking her fully. Even now, I was barely able to keep myself from pushing her on the table and taking her on the papers she was grading. I didn’t cut it off, rather, I let her continue marking the papers without an additional challenge. Minutes passed as her pen danced over the papers, and her bottom gyrating softly over my shaft, trying me to yield into temptation. </p><p>Somehow, I managed to hold back until she finished the last of the papers. “Good work,” I said as I slapped her bottom. She jumped off my lap, treating me with the full view of her slit before her right hand, now empty of the pen, reached and covered it. I could have ordered her to drop it, but watching her struggle was more fun, so I let it slide. “You can go and change.” Just as she was about to disappear behind the bathroom door, I called her again. “By the way, keep your phone closed tonight, and don’t answer if Megan calls. Avoid her tomorrow until my lesson as well. I will handle her after the lesson.” </p><p>She nodded, helpless and confused, her arms still in their ineffectual battle to hide her long-lost chastity. Then, she disappeared behind the door. A few minutes later, she stepped out, fully dressed, but I didn’t react other than gesturing the door, busy going through the last of the papers she graded, which, understandably, was full of grading errors. </p><p>Tomorrow’s class was going to be fun. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I opened the door of my apartment. “Hi, Camilla,” I said with a cheerful voice.</p><p>“He-hello, professor,” she stammered, a sudden blush invading her face as she evaded my gaze, her mind no doubt on what had happened earlier today. And from the suddenness of her blush, it seemed that, under the panic of losing the recorder, she had managed to miss the significance of whose home she was about to visit, only for the full realization to hit the moment she met my eyes. “Sorry for bot-bothering you at this hour. If I can just take it and go…” </p><p>“Nonsense,” I said with a cheerful voice, which didn’t help her to calm down, not that I wanted it in any case. “It’s definitely not a bother. Actually, why don’t you come in for a cup of coffee.” </p><p>“I don’t-” she tried to say, but I cut her off.</p><p>“I insist,” I said, but this time, my voice was lacking in fake geniality. I took a step to the side, and a pointed glare later, she stepped inside, and walked to the bathroom, with all the grace of a stumbling songbird. I gestured her to take a seat on the couch while I walked into the kitchen. “Black or with cream,” I asked.</p><p>“With milk, and no sugar,” she whispered, straining my ability to hear. I said nothing as I prepared her coffee, giving her a minute to gather her wits, a difficult task considering that our last encounter ended with her bent over my desk, being spanked for disobedience, followed by a reward that was even naughtier for her silent acceptance. I filled the cup with black coffee, but the inclusion of a dash of milk broke through its dark, unforgiving surface, bringing its color closer to the skin of my guest. </p><p>“Thanks, professor,” she murmured as she took the cup I presented, trying to bury herself deeper into the couch she was sitting. I acted like I hadn’t noticed it, taking a seat on a chair near her instead. </p><p>“No worries,” I said. “That’s the least I could do after making you come all the way.” Once again, the silence stretched as she drank her beverage. I continued to sip my beer as I waited for her to speak, curious how long it would take for her to gather her courage. </p><p>It turned out that she needed several minutes. I had already moved onto the next bottle, and her coffee was about to finish, when she spoke next. “Professor,” she murmured. “Can I get my re-,” she started, only to cut her own words in a sudden assault of panic. It took a lot of effort from being to prevent the laugh that tried to escape. I knew they were poor in their blackmail attempt, but almost admitting that the device was a recorder was something else. “My vintage music player,” she corrected, looking relieved at my apparent failure of catching her slip up. </p><p>“Sure, let me pick it up,” I said. “By the way, were you able to start your paper,” I said as I walked into the other room to pick up the recorder from my bedroom.</p><p>“No, professor, not yet,” her reply came from the living room. </p><p>“I see,” I answered as I stepped back to living room. “So, you’re still hoping to blackmail me for your grades rather than putting the honest work. Pity,” I continued, my voice perfectly free of infliction, like I was commenting on the weather. In my past occupation, I learned that such a voice was much more effective than anger or pained accusation.  </p><p>The moment my words registered in her mind, she froze, except for her eyes, which grew in a way that displayed the delicious brown of her eyes most beautifully. “W-what,” she stammered. </p><p>“Come on Camilla,” I continued casually as I took a seat next to her rather than my previous seat. “You need to be better at listening. I bet that’s the reason that lately, you’re struggling with the coursework, which puts you into such ridiculous situations.” </p><p>“Professor, I’m not trying to blackmail you!” she exclaimed, her voice much higher than her usual, a surefire sign of a poor liar. </p><p>“Really,” I said. “Then, please explain why you were carrying a recorder with you in your visit, which incidentally recorded this.” I pressed the button, and the sound of her moans, interrupted with her pained cries, filled the room. She tried to jump away from her seat, but I put my hand on her leg, gesturing her to stay. It was a soft gesture. With my wrist intentionally limp, she could have easily pushed my hand away. But instead, she froze under my touch, and continued to sit. “Explain,” I repeated. </p><p>Her silence stretched despite my order. My hand grabbed her thigh, slowly sinking deeper on her leg, enough to drive the seriousness of the situation without actually hurting. “Sorry,” she exclaimed. </p><p>“Sorry for what,” I drawled, letting a dash of fake anger to my tone. Fake, because I was too amused to feel real anger. Yes, technically she tried to blackmail me, but she was as threatening as a kitten trying to bite my finger, adorable even in her most threatening state. </p><p>“Sorry for trying to blackmail you,” she whispered. I could see her trembling, with tears starting to slide from her eyes, no doubt thinking that she was going to end up kicked out of her school. </p><p>I said nothing else, just grabbed her shoulder and pulled her into a hug. “Now, now,” I murmured, patting her shoulder. “Was it so hard.” The unexpected compassion removed her last traces of control, and she started to cry endlessly. I just patted her shoulders, waiting for her tears to dry, her state making me feel guilty about what I was going to do next. Not enough to actually change my mind, of course. She had lost her right to reprieve the moment she targeted me. She was lucky that she didn’t register as an actual threat, therefore avoiding a real retaliation. </p><p>I waited for a few minutes, in which her tears subsided. “Better?” I asked. She nodded, still solemn, but lacking her earlier desperation. “So, who exactly convinced you that blackmailing me is a good idea?” I continued, and once again she clamped down in panic. </p><p>“Why do you think somebody else convinced me?” she replied me in panic. I sent her a casual gaze. “I thought it myself,” she added, too unconvincing to convince anyone with a working half of a brain. </p><p>“Really? You expect me to believe that.” She failed to answer. “Let’s go through the facts one by one. First, I don’t think you can lie convincing enough to trick a pre-school child. Second, I believe myself rather good in assessing people, and it’s not something that you would come up with. Do you want to guess the third?” </p><p>“My clothes,” she murmured helplessly.</p><p>“Smart girl,” I said with a smile, which, somehow managed to make a smile blink on her lips for a moment. “It’s not just those clothes were markedly different than anything else you own, they were too expensive for you as well. Which, incidentally, shortens the possible list of instigator quite a bit.” I smiled gently, and she smiled as well. I felt proud. It wasn’t exactly simple to pull good police, bad police routine with just one. “So, why don’t you make it easier for yourself, and tell me who convinced you that it was a good idea.” </p><p>Her mouth opened, and a whisper got out, barely loud enough to be heard, filled with reluctance. “Megan,” she whispered. </p><p>“Good work,” I said, patting her shoulder once more. “Now, was that so hard?” She shook her head, anguished for giving up her accomplice without resistance. “You certainly earned a discount on your punishment.” The last word managed to bring her to the present. I chucked at her shocked expression. “Really, sweetie. You couldn’t have expected to get away scot-free from a blackmail attempt.” I watched her expression, quickly returning back to despair. “But don’t worry, we’re going to strictly in-house, no need to bring administration in the loop, which would end up with you losing your scholarship.” I didn’t need a verbal answer to know her acceptance. “Now, go and wash your face. We will discuss your punishment when you return.” </p><p>She disappeared behind the bathroom door. I was glad not to hear anything else than running water, particularly a lack of crying. Not that I had found it likely, not after the insights I gathered during our office encounter, but confirmation was always nice. I moved to my bedroom to pick up a few simple implements, and put them in a small bag. I wanted to reveal my surprises one by one.</p><p>I stopped by the kitchen and put myself another drink, a nice glass of aged bourbon. Breaking a beautiful woman like her deserved something more than a cheap beer. I took a seat on the couch, waiting for her to leave. It took a few minutes for her to leave the room, but, examining her as she walked towards me with trembling steps, I was willing to say that it was worth it. </p><p>The most radical change was her clothing; or more accurately, the lack of it. She had elected to leave her jeans and shirt behind, relying on her underwear for coverage. They were much more wholesome than the red set she wore during her visit to my office, their featureless whiteness lacking the suggestiveness of the previous ones. However, weirdly enough, it was more arousing to see her in them. Maybe because the current one fit her personality better, but there was a certain aura the sexier one failed to replicate. </p><p>Rest of her stance supported that. Her eyes were on the ground, except a couple of times she tried to raise them to catch a glimpse, only to fall right back down the moment of contact. A shy blush was on her face, darkening her complexion further. Her stance was similarly accepting, her shoulders slouched slightly, her knees dancing with a hint of a tremble. I took a sip of my glass, the smoky taste of high-grade bourbon burning my tongue. </p><p>“You’re more enthusiastic than I expected,” I said. No answer left her lips, but her body was a different matter. She flinched at my words, instantly, solely from hearing my voice rather than my words, considering its speed. Then, her head dipped down even further like she tried to disappear, her hair falling on her face. I didn’t like it. “Raise your head,” I ordered. She moved slower than I would have liked in following my order, but in the end, she did follow, so I let it slide. </p><p>With her head back in a neutral position, I had a chance to examine her expression more in detail. Her eyes stayed lowered, but her lips were in a different manner. They were dry under the pressure of the situation, whether excitement or fear, I didn’t know yet. That lack of information was not to be borne, I decided. With a negligent motion, I gestured her to walk closer. This time, she stood still until I followed up with a threatening look. She took several steps, each one reluctant, dragging. </p><p>She looked like she was about to stop when she was just a few steps away from me when she stopped. I looked at her with an exaggerated frown. “Why did you stop,” I asked. I didn’t raise my voice, but let a certain sharpness to slip my tone. Her blush intensified at my tone, but she continued walking, until she was close enough to touch. I gestured her to stop.</p><p>This order, she followed immediately. I raised my finger and made a small twirl, asking for her to give me a turn. She did a turn around herself, her hair flailing wildly. “Slower,” I added in an intentional calmness. She dipped her head like she had been just burned, but followed with a slower turn, giving me time to fully appreciate the fullness of her bottom, which managed to look sexy even in her substandard selection of underwear. </p><p>She stood still after completing the turn. I intentionally avoided saying anything, spending my time to examine her body more in detail, broken by the occasional sips from my glass. I noticed some changes as time rolled. Some of them I expected, like her trembling expression. Some came as a surprise, like her hardening nipples, even visible through the thick fabric of her bra. Or the wet patch on her panties, growing rapidly. I thought about bringing her attention to those, but refrained. Watching her struggle in the uncertainty of the situation was fun, especially with the additional pressure from her own body. </p><p>It took almost five minutes for her to gather enough courage to speak. “Sir,” she whispered. </p><p>“Yes?” I asked, trying to make her ask a question, which unfortunately failed to work. She opened her mouth, but her courage faltered. Her tongue darted out, trying to moisten her dried lips before trying again. But once again, no avail. I sighed in an exaggerated manner before patting on my lap. “Come here,” I said. She tried to sit down on my lap. “Not like that,” I corrected. “I want you to lay on my knees, ready to receive the spanking you deserve.” </p><p>It was a credit to her unique personality that she followed my directions without a complaint. She took another step, bringing her body close enough to bite. I managed to keep myself back, but it was a close affair. Thankfully, she was too distracted by the weight of the moment to look at my face. She bent down, her weight pressing comfortably on my legs, her chin resting on the pillow I pulled, while her bottom pointed upward, ready for my attention.  </p><p>The first spank landed without a warning, its sound echoing in the room. A whimper escaped her mouth, more surprise than pain, which soon turned into a restless shifting as I kept my fingers connected, softly caressing the patch of skin I had just bruised. I continued until she lost some of her stiffness, then spanked her bottom once more. This time, she managed to keep silent even as her plump bottom rippled in a way that made me want to rip off her panties, and push myself deep into her.</p><p>But I managed to stay on task, continuing to beat down her bottom with spanks. No protest left her mouth, but the same couldn’t be said for her pained yelps. Despite the delay between each spank -which I filled by caressing the skin I just bruised- it was getting harder and harder for her to keep her voice low. “Try to keep your voice, honey,” I said, using the same tone I used whenever I was speaking to a particularly slow student. </p><p>“Yes, professor,” she replied, her voice strained with pain, but I was experienced enough to catch the undercurrents of pleasure as well, moving under the surface. But, despite her assurance, her conviction turned out to be weaker than the hold of pain on her. The cries restarted. Barely more than a whisper at first, they quickly picked up the volume. Not loud enough to be actually heard by the neighbors, but loud nevertheless. </p><p>Thankfully, I had the solution for that in the bag I had prepared. After a particularly stiff spank, rather than caressing her, I reached for my bag, and pulled a classical ball-gag from it, red and black. “Open wide,” I said as I brought it to her mouth. She turned towards me in shock, eyes wide with shock. In my guess, Megan wasn’t likely to be particularly inventive in the toys department, if a simple ball-gag brought such an extreme reaction. </p><p>Her mouth opened in shock, in obedience or in an attempt to let out a shocked rejection, I didn’t know. Nor I bothered to wait enough to learn, just stuffing her mouth with the ball before she could say anything. She might have wanted to speak against it, but she lacked the will to physically push it back now that it was in her mouth. She waited obediently as I engaged it properly, then took her previous position. </p><p>My surprises were not finished yet. After her panicked reaction to a simple ball-gag, I realized that I couldn’t use the majority of my toys yet, lest I pushed her too much. For now, of course, as I had no intention of letting all those fun implements just gather dust on a drawer. Still, there was one particular one I could use to punish her properly. A paddle, made from aged cherry, carefully wrapped in soft velvet. </p><p>She noticed the change only when it collided with her bottom, the thickness of soft exterior not enough to hide the threatening hardness that lay behind. She let out a muffled cry, louder than the previous one despite the barrier in her mouth. The paddle worked better than I expected, so I decided to make her suffering easier. I could have just reduced the power behind the slaps, but where was the fun in that. “Last ten,” I called, knowing that having a visible target would make it easier to resist. </p><p>But even with the target, she lost her ability to control her voice, crying loudly every time the velvet connected with her equally-soft skin. Still, I didn’t think she was too unhappy with the treatment she was receiving, her juices were gushing enough to drench her panties to the point of transparency. </p><p>“And that was the last one,” I said, but kept my free hand on the small of her back, both to prevent her from standing up, and to caress the sensitive points on her lower back, adding another dimension to her slow torture towards the climax. My other hand was equally busy, dancing over her wet lips, her wet panties the only ineffectual barrier between our skin. Another cry left her mouth, one that was markedly different from the earlier ones. </p><p>“You’re a naughty girl, aren’t you, my dear student?” I asked. She tried to say something, but with her mouth full, only an incomprehensible garble managed to escape. I continued caressing her nether lips, slowing whenever I felt that she was getting too close to a climax. The pain wasn’t the only way to punish. In the correct situation, and if applied correctly, the denial of pleasure could be just as effective. A fact that she started to realize as the minutes passed, my hands dancing over the most sensitive points of her body, but slowing down whenever she exhibited the signs of an impending orgasm. </p><p>Several minutes passed while I continued the treatment that kept her on the edge, extending her ‘suffering’ without mercy. It was a testament to her tension that when one of my hands climbed, dancing around her bra, she gave no reaction, captured under the throes of pleasure. Even better, when I unlocked her bra, she raised her arms in an instant, allowing me to pull it off easily. My fingers continued to trace a path closer to her breasts, grabbing and twisting her nipple. </p><p>It turned out that I greatly underestimated the sensitivity of her breasts, and squeezing her nipple between my fingers proved enough to push her over the edge. I would call it a mistake, but I loathed to call it that when the result was this beautiful. One of the strongest orgasms I had ever had the pleasure of seeing caught her in its throes, making her tremble violently, her nether lips gushing deliciously. </p><p>I pulled my hands away from her body despite my desire to push even further. An orgasm of this scale after a lengthy edge-play, I was lucky that she hadn’t already fainted, which would ruin the second part of my plan. So, I just loosened the bands of the ball-gag instead, giving her the ability to speak. </p><p>She lay listlessly on my knees for more than a minute, enjoying the aftershocks of the explosion she went through. And even when she started to move in a manner that I would classify as fully conscious, she continued to lay on my lap. Waiting for permission to stand up, or the second session to start, I didn’t know. </p><p>But I didn’t give either of them Instead, I just continued sitting, my hands away from her body, waiting for her to react, curious about what she would do. Maybe she would be brave enough to ask for another session, I hoped, or even daring enough to reach to my erection, which was currently pressing against her stomach, hard enough to almost rip through my pants. </p><p>Unfortunately, she acted less brave than I had hoped, and lifted herself from my lap without a word leaving her lips, and stood in front of me. She tried to raise her arms to cover her spectacular breasts, or a part of it at least, as even both of her arms wouldn’t be enough to cover the entirety of those huge jugs. Still, a moot point, as a glance towards her arms proved enough to make her drop her arms to the side, treating me to the beautiful view of her tits, her pristine skin begging me to mark her. And their sensitivity would make playing with them even more fun. </p><p>“Did you learn your lesson?” I asked. She nodded, unable to meet with my eyes. “I shouldn’t need to remind you that, when I ask a question, I expect a proper answer.” </p><p>“Sorry, professor,” she murmured. “Yes, I learned my lesson.” </p><p>“And what lesson is this?” </p><p>She froze, but from her expression, I guessed she was cycling through the possible answers, trying to find which one I would find the least objectionable. “That I need to be a better student, not relying on shortcuts,” she whispered. </p><p>“Good one,” I said, amused by the delicateness of her answer. “Still, you shouldn’t also rely on blackmail to help yourself against the obstacles in your life,” I added hypocritely, ignoring all the times I used that with perfect effectiveness, including two times in the last hour, one against her, and one against Megan. “Still, after all that effort I had put in teaching you a lesson, I believe that I deserve a reward.” I didn’t say anything else, leaving the initiative to her. </p><p>“Yes, professor,” she whispered once again, but I caught a dash of arousal behind her tone. She still looked indecisive, so I decided to give her a little help. I widened my legs, which put my erection to an even better display. Even in her confused state, she was sharp enough to catch the clue, and lowered herself on her knees. A brief struggle with my pants later, my erection stood proud, finally free of its restrictive confines. </p><p>It was amusing to watch her as her gaze stuck to my length, going up and down as she tried to process its size. Her lips parted open, allowing her tongue to dart out, moistening her lips. But her hand, slowly reaching towards in jerky movements, showed her nervousness. I said nothing, and soon, she managed to gather her courage enough to wrap her hand on my shaft. She started pumping, but it was a choppy, disconnected movement, showing just how little experience she had. “Is this the first time you ever hold a dick,” I asked dismissively. </p><p>I wasn’t expecting her to nod in a trembling manner before continuing with her task. My smirk widened, surprised by the rarity of the gem that found its path to me. It must be the reason for Megan’s power over her. Camilla probably grew in a conservative family, maybe even home-schooled, only to fall into Megan’s web of opulence and popularity. And with Megan, she learned about the female form. And now, it was my job as her teacher to teach her about the opposite sex. </p><p>“Use your lips as well,” I ordered, breaking my earlier decision to leave things for her initiative. While it was amusing to watch her flail, with her apparent lack of skill in hand jobs, it would take ages for her to bring me to climax. At least, with her lips, it would be a fun activity. </p><p>Her eyes jumped to mine in shock, like I had asked something incomprehensible, which I thought was completely undeserving. From what I had seen, she had no such reservation munching between what lay between Megan’s legs. Still, her wordless protest, like every single protest she had, proved to be short-lived, ending with her gaze sliding away. She parted her lips and leaned forward, trembling. Excitement or nervousness, I didn’t know, nor did I care, more occupied with the beautiful effect it had on her breasts. </p><p>A gasp escaped my mouth as the warmth of her mouth wrapped around my girth, bringing relief to my erection, which had been suffering from lack of attention all night long. I brought my hand on her cheek, and dragged my thumb softly, trying to encourage her to swallow more than just the tip. She missed the cue, so I brought my other hand on the top of her head, pushing slightly, for a more direct message. This time, she followed the direction, diving deeper on my length. </p><p>With her occupation with trying to swallow more of my shaft, I had time to busy myself with other things. I dragged my hand down from her chin, dallying a bit on her neck before landing on her shoulder. She shuddered beautifully as I drove closer to her breast, her sensitivity showing itself. Never one to miss such an opportunity, I let my hand climb to the endless hill that was her breast, and sank into its heavenly softness. She whimpered, a sound that was muffled by a certain presence in her mouth. But since she obediently continued her attempts to swallow my shaft, I gave it no weight. </p><p>I let my other hand, which was on the top of her head, to fall down next to other, occupying itself with her other breast. She raised her gaze to met mine, but unfortunately for her, it only made me more aroused. There were precious few men who wouldn’t feel aroused when such an innocent look turned to his side while his shaft was lodged in the mouth of its owner, and I was not one of them. So, I just ordered to go deeper, which she followed immediately. </p><p>She was obediently focused on her task, which freed me to focus on kneading and massaging her breasts. I ignored the temptation of forcing her to a deep-throat. It was the first time for her, and it was better to leave such a laborious activity for later. For the second time, most likely.</p><p>“You’re doing great. Keep it like that,” I added. I could feel myself nearing a climax, so I started squeezing her breasts in an intensified desire. I closed my eyes, focusing on the sensation. A few minutes later, I could feel an impending explosion. I didn’t bother to keep it back. I certainly deserved it. “Try to keep it as much as you can,” I ordered as I sprayed into her mouth. </p><p>I knew that she would fail miserably even before I gave that order, but watching her doing her best to keep her mouth shut even as her cheeks bulged was a show in itself. And the fact that I continued to squeeze her sensitive mounds didn’t help her as well. “Now, swallow it,” I added. Once again, her eyes turned to me, begging, which made it even more fun. “I said swallow!” I repeated in a much sharper tone, underlining my statement by squeezing her nipples mercilessly. </p><p>I watched her in surprise as she swallowed it. I wasn’t surprised because she swallowed, but she managed to experience another climax while swallowing it, the mixture of rough treatment of her breasts and my harsh order enough to trigger it. “You’re going to be even more fun than I expected,” I murmured, uncaring if she heard it. </p><p>“What?” she murmured listlessly, but from the lack of panic, I guessed that she failed to understand it in her distracted state. </p><p>“I said go and take a shower, and we’re going to talk after it.” </p><p>She jumped at her feet at my order even as she wobbled on her trembling legs, weakened after her latest orgasm. She walked towards the bathroom. But as she walked, she turned and send me a fleeting glance, filled with confusion, desire, and shock. </p><p>Teaching her properly was going to be fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s talk about the rules of the game,” Madison started as her eyes darted between me and Katie. “We spin the bottle, and the unlucky one picks either truth or dare, and the others gives the challenge or the question in alternating order. If you don’t answer the question, or complete the dare, you have to take a punishment.” </p><p>“What punishment?” Katie asked worriedly. </p><p>“Nothing much, maybe a couple of shots for each violation,” Madison said. </p><p>“Let’s make it three,” I interjected with a smirk. “Just to keep things fun. It shouldn’t be that easy to wriggle out of a dare.” Katie looked at me doubtfully, but refrained from saying anything after a slight nod, probably because she was under the impression that the target was Madison. In reality, I was making a bet on her vulnerability against the suggestion, rather than alcohol. </p><p>“Fine by me,” Madison answered as she sat across me. As usual, she was less than careful when she was sitting down, leaning forward more than it was strictly necessary, enough to inform me about the lack of a bra. Katie coughed pointedly, informing that I wasn’t the only one that noticed the malfunction. Katie scuttled closer and put her hand over mine possessively. Madison just smirked at her. </p><p>“Let’s start,” I said, reaching towards the bottle, anxious to prevent an actual argument from breaking out. Not because I was worried, but because I wanted to keep their low-level antagonism simmering under the surface. More negativity they felt, more they would push each other without needing my explicit involvement.</p><p>I pushed, and we watched the bottle as it wobbled for a moment before coming to a stop, pointing at Madison. “Good,” Katie jumped in enthusiasm. “Truth or dare?” </p><p>“Quite a hurry,” I cut her off. “Have we already decided that you’re going first?” </p><p>“Can I, honey?” Katie said with an exaggerated fluttering of her eyelashes. A genuine chuckle left my mouth at her display as I nodded. “Good,” she added before turning to Madison once more, a smile edgier than her usual one tugging at her lips. “Truth or dare?” </p><p>“Let’s start with a dare,” Madison said with a smile. </p><p>“Bark like a dog,” Katie followed instantly, a victorious expression on her face. Her eyes bounced towards me for a moment, making her intentions clear. She was betting on the fact that something like that would detract from Madison’s attractiveness. </p><p>But the way Madison smirked told me that she had a different view. “That’s the way you like to play? Humiliation?” Katie’s smirk widened, pointing at the bottle in a rare display of viciousness, though it wasn’t very convincing or threatening on her face. Madison didn’t react, and Katie reached for the bottle and a glass, ready to fill it for Madison. “Not too fast,” Madison said, stopping her from filling the glass. </p><p>“You’re going to do it?” Katie asked, shocked. </p><p>“Of course,” Madison said before shifting her position. She stood on all all-fours, a move that put her already enhanced her cleavage to perfect display. The satisfied look she sent to Katie left no mystery about whether it was intentional. Katie didn’t look happy with the realization that her ‘genius’ plan had backfired. She glared at me, her expression shifting into a warning one when she realized the exact location I was focusing, but I ignored that in favor of examining the curve of Madison’s breasts. Partly because it was a beautiful view, but mostly to make Katie angrier. This kind of anger worked quite well in destroying inhibitions. Meanwhile, Madison barked playfully a couple of times, both preceded by a low-key rumble that caused her breasts to jiggle in a very interesting way.</p><p>“It's enough,” Katie said, cutting her off, louder than necessary. Madison resumed her sitting position, though she was leaning further than necessary, a smug expression covering her face. Katie spun the bottle once more before Madison could say anything, but this time, the bottle ended up pointing herself. </p><p>“My turn now,” Madison said, her smile getting even wider.</p><p>“Wait a minute,” Katie interjected. “Maybe Stephen wants to go first.”</p><p>“Of course,” I said despite preferring Madison going first. I didn't have the luxury of asking anything truly embarrassing due to the role I played. If I started pushing, Katie would realize what was going on. “Truth or dare?” </p><p>“Truth,” Katie answered relaxedly. </p><p>“Have you ever kissed a girl?” I asked, fully expecting her to answer negatively. The thick blush that spread on her face was a surprise, but not as much as the matching one Madison was sporting. Interesting, I reckoned. Very interesting. Maybe there was another dimension to their rivalry I failed to notice. Silently, Katie reached for the bottle, filling three glasses before drinking them in a great hurry. A pointless gesture, considering that in her silence, I already received my answer.</p><p>She gave the bottle another spin in silence, resolutely avoiding my gaze. The bottle spun, the room silent other than the friction between the floor and the bottle. It ended up pointing at me. “Truth or dare?” Madison asked, who managed to gather herself quicker than Katie could.</p><p>“Truth,” I said, not really feeling stressed about anything she might ask me. She didn’t know anything about me, meaning she lacked the leverage to prove for weakness. </p><p>“How big is your ‘thing’?” she said with a huge smirk on her face. </p><p>For a moment, the dominant expression on my face was surprise as I looked at her. Not that I had any problem answering the question, considering both girls were intimately aware of its exact dimensions. And it wasn’t like I had anything to be ashamed in the first place. Then, I caught Madison looking towards Katie, revealing that I had misunderstood the target of her question. “Are you sure you can handle that information?” I said, a confident smirk back on my face. </p><p>She bristled at my words, remembering a time that she failed spectacularly to handle it. “I’m sure that will not be a problem,” Madison said, challenge bright in her eyes. We were lucky that Katie was still distracted by the question, and failed to notice the subtext in the discussion. </p><p>“If that’s what you think,” I said dismissively before separating my hands by a considerable degree. </p><p>“You’re lying!” Madison argued. “Prove it!” </p><p>I shrugged dismissively, barely managing to keep myself from commenting on Katie’s amusing discomfort. I let my hand fall towards my belt, and Katie flinched, expecting me to go through with it. “You asked, and I answered. If you want to verify it, you need to spend your dare on it.” </p><p>Madison smirked satisfactorily like she expected me to give that answer all along. “It’s okay. I have another way to verify. Katie, is he telling the truth?” </p><p>Her blush ever-increasing, Katie found herself unable to utter a word, but under Madison’s expectant gaze, she managed to give a small, hesitant nod. It was not a great mystery what she was trying not to imagine. “Really?” Madison said in a fake-surprise. Another situation where Katie’s distraction turned out useful. “You’re a lucky girl, Katie,” she said before spinning the bottle once more, which ended up pointing at Katie once more. “Truth or dare?” Madison asked. </p><p>“Truth,” she whispered after an indecisive delay. </p><p>“Good,” Madison jumped. “Have you ever given Stephen a blowjob?” </p><p>Katie glanced towards me, unsure. I shrugged, leaving her free to tell whatever she wished. Her gaze bounced between the bottle and Madison. In the end, she reached for the bottle for another set of shot. When she reached for the bottle, her movement was much more aggressive than her usual, which gave me hope that my ploy was starting to work. </p><p>“Dare,” I said, seeing the bottle was pointing at me. “I believe it’s your turn, honey?” </p><p>“Yes, it is,” Katie said even as she grabbed my hand aggressively. “Why don’t you give me a kiss,” she said with a giggle, leaning forward invitingly, but I could see her eyes sliding towards Madison. Some kind of revenge for Madison’s latest question, I presume. Katie was staking her territory. Not exactly a bother, so I wrapped my hand around her waist, pulling her closer before smashing my lips over hers. I didn’t know what kind of kiss she wanted, but at that point, I didn’t care much as well, pushing my tongue against her mouth, passing through her barrier before she could even realize my assault. Under my touch, she stiffened for a moment, but mellowed soon after, showing that our training sessions weren’t a total waste. That, or the trick with the drink was working better than I expected. </p><p>“That was impressive,” Madison said in a pronounced cheerfulness, which might or might not be there to hide the annoyance she was feeling. Jealousy, or the annoyance at being left out, I wasn’t sure. “Should I assume that this new dare is available for everyone?” </p><p>“Sure,” Katie said offhandedly, her thinking impaired by the high of the heated make-out session she just experienced. “Not that you can handle it of course.” </p><p>That statement caught everyone by surprise, including Katie if her sudden freeze was any indicator, but Madison didn’t allow her any time to recover and fix the sentence. “Perfect, then. Especially since the next turn with Stephen is mine,” she said as she spun the bottle once more, which stopped at herself. “Damn,” she murmured in mock despair, but didn’t neglect to send a saucy wink at me. “Maybe next time, but for now, pick one, Katie.”</p><p>“Dare,” she said, rightfully afraid of the embarrassing questions Madison could come up with. </p><p>“Remove your shirt,” Madison said almost instantly. </p><p>“That shouldn’t be allowed,” Katie countered. </p><p>“No honey, you’re the one that added that kiss to the list of dares. After that, you can’t chicken out on that,” Madison countered. </p><p>Katie could have, of course, she could have still argued that the kiss was not on the same level as stripping. But she was not in a state particularly conductive for critical thought, so she went with a simpler solution. “I can if I choose to drink instead,” she said, downing another three shots. I was lucky that they hardly contained any alcohol, because I didn’t want to explain to Nicole how I was responsible for her daughter’s coma. Then, she spun the bottle once more, which ended up pointing Madison. </p><p>“Dare,” Madison said, sending me a saucy wink. “Make it count, tiger!” </p><p>“Can I take this one,” Katie jumped before I could say anything. </p><p>“Sure,” I said, though it was less from generosity and more because I failed to find a dare that would make it fun without causing Katie to storm out in anger. And Katie had seen the wink Madison sent, so I was willing to bet Katie was feeling vindictive. </p><p>“Hey, that’s unfair,” Madison called, her expression not collaborating with her words.</p><p>“You need to drink some as well, so let’s go with something simple that would force you to the bottle. And since you made it easier by not wearing a bra, I would be a fool not to take it. Remove your shirt,” Katie said. </p><p>“Real creative, Kat,” Madison said dismissively. Katie pushed a full glass towards her, about to fill the second one when she came to a halt because of the location Madison’s hands were reaching. They had resolutely ignored the glass in front of them in lieu of grabbing the hem of her shirt. </p><p>“You cannot,” Katie stammered.</p><p>“Why not,” Madison answered, her shirt already halfway up, revealing her belly, smooth and attractive, without a drop of excess fat. “You’re the one that gave the challenge, I don’t see why you’re the one that is complaining.” </p><p>“But-” Katie tried to argue, but her shock was apparently bigger than her desire to explain her reasoning, leaving her silent after Madison’s shirt came off, treating us with the beautiful view of her tits, partially restricted by her curly hair spilling on her chest. Not that I was complaining, as it made her even sexier. </p><p>“Let’s continue,” Madison said, reached towards the bottle and gave it a spin. </p><p>“Truth,” I said after the bottle decreed that I was to be the next victim.</p><p>“Spoiler,” Madison said, followed by a crystal laugh that caused her tits to tumble attractively, something I was able to enjoy freely because Katie was watching it dazedly as well, too focused to notice where my attention was. “So, what was your most erotic experience.” </p><p>“Kinky,” I said. “Are you sure your cute ears could handle that story.” </p><p>“Why don’t you try and see,” Madison answered with a challenging smirk. </p><p>Her earlier shock finally abated a bit, Katie was watching me as well, a dash of arousal mixed in the kaleidoscope of emotions. Her presence made the story I had in mind wholly inappropriate, therefore even more tempting. “There was once a young widow called Emily, who called me to create a set of photos,” I started, fudging the details a bit, but otherwise staying accurate as I told, in extreme detail, how I seduced Katie’s stepmom to her and her best friend, a stream of events which culminated in the bedroom while rest of the family was in their rooms. </p><p>“That was…” Madison trailed, her breathing shallow, her eyes dilated. If Katie wasn’t here, she would be in my lap, doing her best to hump me mercilessly. </p><p>“Hot,” Katie completed her sentence, her arousal no less pronounced, burning temptingly. I couldn’t help but feel disappointed, as if I was a bit further in the seduction of Katie, I could have pushed for a threesome, something that would be very enjoyable with two girls as competitive as Madison and Katie were involved. Alas, with things as it was, it wasn’t worth the risk, so I spun the bottle once more, and it pointed at Katie. </p><p>“Dare,” she said, still dazed. </p><p>“I’m sure you’re feeling hot, why don’t you remove your shirt?” Madison asked. It was technically my turn, but I wasn’t an idiot, so I watched silently as Katie stood frozen for a moment before starting to pull her shirt off, revealing her lithe body, constrained by an ugly bra that failed to display her beautiful assets to their full potential. </p><p>Then she froze, helplessly comparing her appearance with Madison, and finding herself coming short. I leaned towards her ear and whispered. “Don’t worry, you’re beautiful.” At my words, Katie stood straighter, and jealously flashed through Madison’s face. Next few spins passed quickly, focusing almost exclusively on shedding clothes, which ended up all of us in various states of revealing. Madison was just wearing panties and I was reduced only to my boxers while Katie had managed to hold onto her bra in addition to her panties. </p><p>Madison spun the bottle once more, once again bringing the turn to me. “Dare,” I said. </p><p>“You know what’s next,” Madison said with the smirk of a cat who fell into a tank of fresh cream. “But don’t even think about hiding it with your hands.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said, then, without a warning, wrapped my arm around Katie’s waist and pulled her on my lap. She let out a shriek that turned into a giggle halfway as I got rid of my boxers. </p><p>“It’s not fair,” Madison said even as she leaned forward, her hair parting to clear the view of her breasts, which only made my shaft harder, to a noticeable degree if Katie’s moan was any indicator. “Lucky slut,” she murmured softly, a statement Katie failed to catch, too busy in her distraction. </p><p>“You shouldn’t have so specific setting in your conditions,” I said. Meanwhile, Katie shifted until my shaft pressing tightly between her cheeks before looking at Madison with an expression of total victory. It must have been rare, for Katie to be preferred compared to the more classically popular Madison, which, once again, proved that high school boys had no taste. Both girls had their own charm and beauty, Katie was just as worthwhile. </p><p>“Okay,” Madison said resignedly before another spin, which pointed at herself. “Dare,” she said. </p><p>“Why don’t you come here and give Katie a little kiss,” I said even as I wrapped my arms around her waist. </p><p>“Sure,” Madison said, as if to ignore Katie’s strangled gasp, but I could see that under her bravado, she was as panicked as Katie. “But Katie doesn’t seem as enthusiastic, so it is a bust.” </p><p>I had no intention of letting her get away that easily, so I leaned forward until my lips were brushing Katie’s earlobe. “She’s bluffing,” I whispered.</p><p>“It’s a good excuse,” Katie said, emboldened by my words. “But all I’m hearing is the gawking of a chicken.” </p><p>“You think so,” Madison said, the insult helping her to push away her reticence. She scuttled closer until their faces were less than a foot apart. “You’re claiming that I’m too afraid to press my lips above hers, and looking for an excuse.” </p><p>I could see that Madison was desiring the touch, but was afraid to take that last step, afraid of rejection. Katie was starting to suspect as well, if what her heartbeat told me was true, its elevated beat like a drum under my fingertips. I tightened my arms around her waist comfortingly, reminding her my statement. “You’re bluffing,” Katie said, and I was proud to notice only the slightest tremble in her voice. She was blossoming under my tutelage, and I couldn’t wait until the harvest time. </p><p>“Try me,” Madison answered, closing the distance even more. Katie watched her, slightly trembling, and I had a feeling only my presence that kept her in place, and even that was losing its effectiveness as Madison drew closer. The solution, I pressed her tighter against my shaft, its hardness suitably distracting her as Madison closed the distance. Then, it was too late, Madison was already pressing her lips against hers. </p><p>It was surprising to see them actually kissing, but not as surprising as the fact that either of them hadn’t pulled back, choosing to deepen the kiss instead, in a way suggested that the tension between them might have a different source. The night was getting interesting, I thought… </p><p>At that point, lady luck decided that she had been favoring me for too long, and decided to throw a bump into my path, one that failed to account for, risking to derail everything. The door opened, and a voice that I heard earlier rang in the room once more. “Maddy-” she managed to say before a strangled cough cut off her own words. “What the hell is going on here!” </p><p>“Penelope!” Madison exclaimed as she jumped to her feet, her arms doing their best to cover her chest. “I can explain!” </p><p>“Really,” Penelope answered. “Go ahead.” Madison looked in confusion, but her lips stayed closed. “When you’re on it, make sure that it’s an explanation auntie could hear as well.” </p><p>“You can’t tell mom,” Madison said, her panic palpable. </p><p>Penelope smirked vindictively. “And tell me why not, especially after all those useless-cousin-with-stupid-dreams comments. I think it would be fun for auntie to learn how much of a deviant her daughter is.” </p><p>“Umm,” Madison murmured even as Katie tried to get smaller, which only helped for my shaft to press harder against it, then her face alight with sudden inspiration. “Stephen!” she said. “He is a photographer, and I’m sure he could help to arrange a few auditions for you.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as the expression on Penelope’s face turned from casual vindictiveness to hopefulness. And just like that, I got a good handle of Pelenope’s personality. She was a textbook character, beautiful and bountiful, coming to the big town with a desire to reach fame, only to come to a standstill after realizing entering to the show business wasn’t as simple. “Really?” she managed to ask in a cracking voice. </p><p>“Sure,” I answered even as I pushed Katie off my lap. There was no reason not to push the stakes further, especially since I wasn’t in the crosshair of the fallout in any case. A distressed sound escaped Penelope’s mouth as her eyes turned to my erection, her face alight with shock. She examined it for a couple of seconds, then let out a strangled gasp and closed her eyes. I sighed in an expression of disappointment. “But your extreme reaction to nudism doesn’t bode well. An actress shouldn’t be shocked that easily.” </p><p>“Really?” she murmured in shock, her hands still over her eyes. It was ridiculous how easily she was following my statements. Just a few sentences, and I could already say that she was extremely gullible. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered, knowing that technically it was true. With great reluctance, she pulled her hands away and opened her eyes, struggling to keep them away from my midsection, but failing occasionally. It was cute just how naive she was. I leaned down to pick my underwear. “However, it has been too late already, and I need to leave, but give me your number, and I’ll make sure to call you in a couple of days so we can talk more.” Talk, and make her pay for interrupting such a beautiful opportunity that was almost about to end with a threesome. It was sacrilege. </p><p>“Okay, let me pick a pen and paper,” she said before dashing away, uncaring about the way her tits jumped with her hurried steps. It was going to be fun, making her pay.</p><p>“Okay girls,” I said even as I dressed quickly. “It was an interesting evening, but it’s for the best if I disappear after she returns, as it’s best if we don’t push her.” Both nodded, still trying to process the shock of being caught in such a compromising position. “See you tomorrow,” I said to Katie before leaning forward and capturing her lips for a short but intense kiss, then left the room, closing the door behind me. </p><p>Then, Madison’s cousin came back running, a piece of paper in her hand. I liked the way she came, her tits jumping up and down in a way that begged for my hands to wrap around them. “Penelope,” I greeted her. </p><p>“Please call me Penny,” she managed to say between deep breaths. </p><p>“Penny it is,” I said, grabbing her hand gently before bringing it to my lips. “It’s a pleasure,” I said. </p><p>“Thanks,” she managed to murmur even as the blush crept at her face. I guessed it was the effect of seeing me naked. </p><p>I took a step towards her, and she reflexively took one back. I angled my next step carefully, and she found herself trapped between me and the wall. “As I said, I need to run, but I’ll make to call you the day after tomorrow. I even have a small job you might be interested in, how that it sounds for you?” I asked, leaning a bit closer with each step. </p><p>“It sounds amazing,” she managed to whisper, frozen in indecision with the sudden shift in the situation. </p><p>“Perfect,” I said and gently caressed her cheek before walking away. Her presence had been a surprise, but not an unwelcome one, I thought as I walked into the chilling night air… </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>I couldn’t feel but elated as I drove back home. Yes, my plan had been derailed unexpectedly with a surprise visit from Madison’s cousin, but at least, a total crisis scenario had been prevented, with the added bonus of another prospective model. Penelope, or Penny as she wanted to be called, was a very unlucky girl. Tall, blond, and voluptuous despite being slim, she would have made a killing as a model a decade ago as a top model, but the fashion was different. Still, I was sure that I could arrange ‘something’… </p><p>Once again, I left the car a block away from my final destination, this time, not wanting to wake Nancy or Nicole off with its noise. But when I unlocked the front door, I was met with the evidence that Nancy was still awake. The TV was still on, a dance of naked flesh blaring prominently on the screen, muted to keep the rest of the house unaware. Another midnight indiscretion, I noted with excitement. </p><p>And this time, I was in a prime position to catch her in the act. She had positioned herself to get an unobstructed view of both the stairs and basement door, which would have allowed her time to recover. But she had one glaring mistake, her back was facing at the front door, assuming no one would arrive this late. A dangerous omission…</p><p>I did my best to close the door as silently as possible. Yes, she was engrossed in the erotic scene in front of her, more than one way if I was reading the way her shoulder was moving correctly, but that was no reason to take silly risks, not when she generously created such an interesting opportunity for me right after our amazing photo shoot.</p><p>She was even dressed for the occasion, I realized as I walked closer. I could see a very familiar bra strap going over her shoulder and nothing else. I sneaked nearer until the distance between us reduced to a few steps, and she somehow managed not to notice my presence. I confirmed that she was wearing the set of underwear I gifted to her, and nothing else. For almost half a minute, I waited behind her, curious whether she would notice me, but she was far more engrossed with her fingers, circling around her knob repeatedly in an attempt to push herself into a climax. Even better, I was able to sniff a dash of alcohol in the air, not enough to make her drunk, but enough to impair the speed of her thoughts.</p><p>I waited until her eyes closed in anticipation of an impending orgasm before taking my last step, and carefully picked up the remote without alerting her, to prevent her from changing the channel in a hurry. I wanted the movie to run in the backdrop as we talked. I watched silently as she pushed her panties to the side, her fingers sliding inside her repeatedly in an effort to push her over the edge, her other hand over her breast, mauling her breasts, speeding up her journey. </p><p>Then, she started to tremble as the pleasure overwhelmed her senses, her lips parted open to let out a string of pleasure-filled moans, one that tempted me to lean forward to silence her lips with mine. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a viable path of behavior, not for yet at least. Instead, I chose to break her single-minded focus on my words. “Good evening, Nancy. Busy night?” </p><p>Muffled shriek she let out was beautiful, making me wish that pushing towards her lips was an option. But I consoled myself by hovering above her as she searched for the remote hurriedly, her assets jumbling around, her almost invisible underwear no help in hiding their hypnotic movements. “Stephen!” she whispered after giving up the search for the remote, barely audible volume of her voice doing nothing to hide her shame. </p><p>“Nancy,” I replied. </p><p>“Where did you come from,” she whispered as her arms wrapped around her chest, her legs crossed to hide her entrance, appetizingly wet. </p><p>“I was out, but are you sure you want to play twenty questions in your current state?” She looked at me helplessly, but said nothing. “I guessed as much. Anyway, I need to catch up my sleep, but don't forget to drop by at midnight tomorrow for another session.” I waited until I received a hesitant nod, then left for my own room. I needed my sleep. Tomorrow was going to be exhausting.</p>",

    "content": "<p>For once, Sarah was glad for the loud blare of electronic music. It helped her to keep her mind away from the indignity she had suffered, losing her panties in the hands of a bullying security guard. A pathetic man that she shouldn’t even bother to talk with, preferring to walk away after a slap. But she didn’t, not with one important factor, preventing her from acting. </p><p>Her guilt, borne from her encounters with Erik. Yes, she had done it to save their business, but that didn’t change the fact that she had betrayed her wedding wows. It was why she was in the club, attempting to pay back her infidelity by protecting Thomas’ daughter. It wouldn’t absolve her guilt, but it would ease it somewhat. </p><p>At least, that was what she was repeating continuously as she walked into the club proper, instantly assaulted by a flaring rush of colored light and deafeningly loud music. The crowd that was filling the place, enough to make walking a challenge, hadn’t helped any. She took a step into the crowd, looking for something to step on, trying to find where Megan was in the sea of bodies. </p><p>She saw a small platform in the corner, where a beautiful redhead, clearly in the employ of the club, was dancing, dressed in an extremely exotic piece of leather clothing, which consisted almost completely of belts and strips. Frankly, it was a miracle that the dress, if she could call it that, managed to cover the essentials. The platform was tall enough to allow her to look for Megan. Still, she hesitated, for one simple reason. The platform was also very visible, and would put her in the sight of a significant number of dancers. Something she wouldn’t feel enthusiastic for even if she wasn’t risking to flash the crowd in one wrong step. </p><p>She continued looking around, hoping to find a lookout that wouldn’t put her in the display for a bunch of horny men, but her search turned out to be in vain. Cursing her luck, she started walking towards the platform, but even the journey hadn’t been simple, littered with several ‘careless’ hands, accidentally finding their way to her body, making her mood even worse. She started considering that maybe she had been too harsh on Megan, that maybe she could handle herself in the club. After all, she was an adult. </p><p>Then, a busty blond caught her attention, making her turn, hoping that she just saw Megan. It turned out that she didn’t, but seeing that random blond was enough to change her mind. The same blond girl that reminded him of her stepdaughter was squeezed between two men, her face twisted with drunkenness and pleasure. They were still dressed, but it didn’t prevent her face from twisting in pleasure. Sarah could easily imagine Megan taking her place after several drinks. She wasn’t the best decision maker even when she was sober, and alcohol just made things worse.  </p><p>With a heavy heart, she started climbing the stairs. She could feel her feet getting heavier with each step, easily rivaling the weight of her heart as she took the last step. The redhead turned towards Sarah, her face alight with sensual excitement. Sarah would have preferred annoyance. She quickly turned her back towards the redhead, her eyes browsing the crowd as she tried to find where Megan was. But before she could succeed, she felt a pair of delicate hands resting gently on her waist. “Hello, sweetie,” whispered the redhead in her ear. “Ready to dance.” </p><p>“I’m just looking for my friends,” Sarah answered even as she tried to parse the crowd, trying to find the familiar figure of Megan. Not the simplest task with a packed crowd, and flashing neon lights with different colors didn’t help either. </p><p>Sarah hadn’t thought that would deter the redhead from teasing her, which was why she wasn’t surprised when she felt the hands on her hips, trying to trigger a sway. “You might be looking for the president honey,” the redhead whispered into her ear, her lips close enough to tickle her earlobe. “But you have to dance while doing so if you want to do it from my platform. Either dance or step down.”  </p><p>It wasn’t a comfortable dilemma by any means, but it was far from the worst she had faced during the day as well. And, if she denied it, her sacrifice to enter the club would go to waste. Helpless, she started swaying her lips, her hands flying in the air. “Is this enough?” Sarah asked without bothering to turn, her eyes still on the crowd. </p><p>“Not a bad start, kitten,” the dancer answered. “You have a flair, at least. But you need to do more if you want to stay more than a few seconds here. You need to impress the people if you want to stay here.” That managed to Sarah turn to her, shocked. Redhead nodded her head towards the wall, where a hulking security guard watched them like a hawk. “Not my call, sweetie,” the redhead said, but her tone wasn’t slightly apologetic. “You either impress Mr. Big-hands there, or he makes to step down after a second.” </p><p>“I hate this,” Sarah murmured, wishing that she hadn’t stepped out of her bed today. Today definitely wasn’t her day. No point delaying the inevitable, she thought as she turned towards the sexy dancer whose hands were roaming on her body. From the excited expression on her eyes, Sarah guessed that it wasn’t only the business rules that made her insistent about her dancing, but nothing beneficial lay at the end of that particular line of thought, so Sarah ignored it. </p><p>Instead, she spent a moment with her eyes closed, trying to sink herself into the rhythm. Her body started following the music, made easier by the pair of hands on her body, pushing her hips to direct her, her fingers sinking into her hips harder than necessary. Sarah made sure to turn towards the crowd once more before opening her eyes, not wanting to see the expression on the redhead’s face. It would be easier without her clear enthusiasm. </p><p>She continued looking around, but the task was difficult enough without adding intense dancing as a requirement, and redhead behind her -getting handsier with each passing second- wasn’t making it any easier. Sarah just ignored her, a reflexive response against the conflict that was getting exceedingly common in her life. </p><p>She continued to accept the molestations of the redhead passively, her eyes desperately passing over the crowd again and again, trying to spot a familiar blond figure. A rush of relaxation spread to her body as she saw who she was searching towards the far side of the bar, chatting with two other girls that they came here with. But giving the dancer a free rein during that moment proved to be a mistake. Sarah had ignored the danger of her fingers as they roamed over her dress despite their consistent journey towards her hips, not expecting any trouble worse than she was actually in. </p><p>Big mistake, as she learned a moment later, when the hem of her dress suddenly lifted by a pair of greedy fingers. A sudden rush of jubilant cries rose from the crowd, far too louder to be the normal response. The words from a pair of lips, which was sucking her earlobe just a moment ago, was enough to clear that mystery. “No panties, huh,” said the redhead, reminding Sarah one important fact she had forgotten in the complicated situation she was in. </p><p>Sarah said nothing, not that she could. She reached for the hem of her dress and pushed it down, trying to hide her most intimate part from a huge crowd. She wished that erasing it completely from their mind was a possibility, which unfortunately was not. Instead, she turned, wanting to leave the podium with an obvious display of anger, but a pair of arms around her waist prevented her. “Let me go,” said Sarah in a rare display of anger. </p><p>“Sorry, sweetie,” the redhead answered even as she reached to the folds of her ridiculously deficient leather dress, and somehow pulled a small piece of paper from it. “I didn’t expect you to go commando, you didn’t seem like the type.” She gave a blinding smile to Sarah, but she wasn’t feeling especially forgiving. Sarah felt even less forgiving when the redhead stuffed her fingers into her cleavage, the sensation of paper clear against the skin. “As an apology, I just gave you my number, call me if you need anything. I owe you one.” </p><p>“Thanks,” Sarah murmured, but more out of social convention rather than actually forgiving her for displaying her most intimate part to a crowd full enough to resemble a human pool. </p><p>“No trouble, bestie,” the redhead answered with a cheer. Sarah prepared to step off the platform, assuming the ordeal was over. But before doing so, she learned that the redhead had one last plan. A pair of lips smashed against her lips, scouring her lips mercilessly. Once again, Sarah’s panic prevented her from acting, forcing her to stay still as she was being kissed by a woman in the middle of a crowded nightclub. </p><p>Sarah didn’t know for how long the kiss lasted. But when it ended, she was stumbling drunkenly despite not having a drop of alcohol. She stepped off the platform and quickly dashed away from the crowd, not comfortable with the way they were looking at her, especially the men. She wasn’t able to hear them, but she didn’t need her ears to make a good guess about their discussion, their rude gestures clue enough. Her fingers dug the card from her chest, and was about to throw it on the ground, but chose to put it in her purse at the last second. Maybe it would be useful one day, she reasoned. </p><p>She needed a sanctuary, so she dashed at the bathroom. Thankfully, it was still early, there was no line, which allowed her to find a stall to rest. She sat down, breathing hard like she had just run a marathon. “What the hell I’m doing,” Sarah murmured, her hands on her cheek as she sulked in desperation. Like it wasn’t enough that she had become a cheater, she also ended up exposing herself in a huge crowd. Her only consolation was it was hard for her to be recognized with all the lights. </p><p>However, she learned that it was a false hope as well. The moment she stepped out of the stall, she was met with a suggestive whistle. She turned at the source, a short brunette with an even shorter dress, only to receive a wink. “Good dance, gorgeous,” she said with a suggestive tone. Sarah ignored her, focusing on reapplying her lipstick instead. “Stuck up bitch,” the brunette murmured a second later, showing her unhappiness on not receiving a response. </p><p>Sarah ignored the insult just as she ignored the earlier comment, and left the bathroom. She left Megan alone enough as it was. Back in the dance floor, she did her best to ignore the occasional brushes as she cut through the crowd, trying to travel towards the bar, where she had last seen her stepdaughter, wishing that she hadn’t changed her position.</p><p>When she arrived at the bar, she realized a few things, only one of them positive. The good thing was, she had just found Megan, who had moved from the bar to a dark corner. However, her friends were gone, and even worse, they were replaced by two large men, standing around her. It might be mixed with a casual discussion at first, but Megan’s discomfort was clear on her face. And the men around her had been carefully cutting her path to retreat, locking her in place. And Megan lacked the personality to push through them. </p><p>Sarah dashed towards them, intent on saving her stepdaughter. As she got closer, she started to hear snippets between the two men, enough to understand that they were aggressively courting her step-daughter. “Come on, sweetie, don’t be a buzzkill,” said the one with the black hair. “We’re going to dance for a while, nothing more.” Even worse was Megan’s expression, confused and conflicted, enough for Sarah to guess what she was thinking. She was unhappy with the attitude of those men, but considering to accept their offer just to deflect the situation. </p><p>Sarah stood behind them, and saw Megan’s expression brightening with her presence. “Hey, Megan, I was looking for you, let’s go,” she said. “Sorry, gentlemen, but we need to go,” she added, barely acknowledging them. Megan raised her hand, and Sarah was about to grab it when she felt a tight grip around her wrist. “What’s the hurry, sweetheart,” said the black haired man. “Why don’t you join us.” </p><p>“I prefer not to,” Sarah answered, trying to pull her hand away, but it only made his grip tighten further. </p><p>“I don’t care what you prefer, sweetie,” said the man, leaning further. Only then, she was hit by the sharp smell of alcohol, realizing she had miscalculated. She should have called just called the security instead of interjecting herself. She looked around, hoping to see anyone, but the corner they were in was relatively sparse, and none of the people around looked like they were willing to </p><p>“Hey, that’s the chick from before,” said the other suddenly. “The one dancing without panties.” </p><p>Despite the terribleness of the situation, Sarah couldn’t help but felt ashamed when she realized that those two men had managed to catch a good view of her most private place. “Nice,” said the black haired one as he put his hand on her waist, trying to pull her closer. Sarah prepared herself to shout, hoping someone would notice. </p><p>But before she could do so, she saw yet another hand reaching from behind, this time wrapping around his wrist. “That’s enough,” called a familiar voice. Normally, it would have filled her heart with despair, but under the current circumstances, she was willing to make an exception. Sarah turned to see the tall figure of Erik standing behind the other man, towering over him by a couple inches. “You guys look a bit worked up, why don’t you step out for a breather.” he continued. </p><p>At that moment, Sarah’s hatred towards him was shadowed by her gratitude. She didn’t expect him to last against two men of course. While Erik was taller than them, both thugs looked more muscular than him. But their fight would be enough to get security close, which was the most important part. “I think you’re making a mistake,” said the other man, and took a step towards Erik. </p><p>“You think so,” Erik answered. Sarah didn’t notice him moving, but suddenly, the one he was grabbing fell to his knees, his pained shouts loud enough to cut through the music. The other thug looked as surprised as Sarah, and failed to react before the security guards arrived at the scene. </p><p>“That’s enough, punks. All of you, out-” the security guard started, only to stop suddenly the moment he looked at Erik’s face. “Mr. Delmore!” he exclaimed. </p><p>“A bit slower than usual, Frank,” Erik answered. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Delmore,” he added as his posture straightened. </p><p>“Just be more careful, Frank. We want everyone to have fun, and they can’t do that if they don’t feel secure, right?” Erik answered, standing casually, like he wasn’t still forcing a man considerably more muscular than himself to his knees, making him whimper like a baby. “Just lead this two gentleman to outside. I’m sure they’ll appreciate some fresh air.” </p><p>With that, the security guard dragged two men out, leaving her alone with Erik, and a dazed-looking step-daughter. Megan spoke first. “Sarah, what just happened,” she said, from the slur in her tone, Sarah could easily guess she had more than a couple of drinks. She also sounded confused. Another effect of her slight drunkenness.  </p><p>“Nothing happened, honey,” Sarah answered, louder than usual to make herself heard from the blaring noise. “Let’s just find a place to sit so we can catch our breath.” </p><p>“Why don’t we all sit in my booth. It’s empty, and it has an excellent view of the club,” he said, pointing at the second floor. </p><p>Sarah prepared to reject. The last thing she wanted to do to have another meeting with him. The memory of the restaurant was still fresh. But once again, Megan was faster than Sarah. “VIP section, cool,” she exclaimed and hugged Erik, before dashing towards the fancy velvet door that separated two sections. </p><p>“Shall we,” Erik said, and started walking without waiting for her to answer. She stayed frozen for a moment, but he continued, confident that she was about to follow. In any other situation, she would have just turned and left him, stuffing those expectations to his nose, but not when at the cost of leaving Megan alone with him while she was drunk. She followed him, her steps quick to catch him… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When Amelia turned towards me, the flickers of doubt was alive on her face once more. Her urgent need to prove something was absent after the disappearance of her boyfriend, loosening my grip over her. Loosening, but not completely lost, and I had no intention to repeat my earlier slip.</p><p>Trusting her arousal to speak its magic, I let my hand disappear into her hair. I tightened my grip as I carefully watched her expression, looking with signs of dissatisfaction, but found flaring ambers of desire. Secure in the knowledge that I was on the right track, I pulled her head back roughly, which brought her mouth to a convenient angle. Her lips opened in preparation of a protest, a reflexive action only. My lips proved to be faster than her reluctant words. They closed over hers, cutting the path of her words. </p><p>Interestingly, during the debacle, she had managed to miss one extremely important detail. My fingers were still resting inside her panties, pressing gently against her wet lips. As a true gentleman, it was my job to remind her. I twisted my fingers, teasing her knob softly. She let out a surprised cry, but my lips were up to the task of muffling her words, so the only effect was the opportunity to slip my tongue into her mouth in another layer of domination. </p><p>I let the moment to stretch for a while, ensuring her arousal was high enough to prevent her from changing her mind. With each passing second, her struggles lost their power, and her moans intensified. After lengthy treatment, I pulled back. “You like this, don’t you,” I said, enjoying the expression of the helplessness on her face, mixed with desire. “You cannot stop yourself.” </p><p>“No-” she tried to say, but two of my fingers, sliding inside her wet tunnel, more than sufficient to cancel the rest of her words, replacing them with a shocked yelp. I closed in for another kiss. As much as I would have enjoyed her cries, they risked pulling an audience, which would be extremely inconvenient. I had no intention of dealing with several old coots having heart-attacks. </p><p>I only pulled back after she managed to develop a layer of control over her cries. “You need to be honest with your desires, my dear professor,” I murmured softly into her ear even as I continued to pump my fingers. “Do you think we would be in this position if your dreams weren’t filled with the scenes from the last night, where I took you against the door of your home.” She stayed silent. “It’s a fitting parallel,” I commented casually. “The first time, I took you against the door of your home, now, it’s the door of your office.” I let a second to drag in silence. “Maybe it’s not about me at all, and you have a fetish for doors?”  </p><p>“Shut up,” she whispered, blushing, but I counted it as a win, as her efforts to get away had disappeared completely. Her body was pressing against mine, her naked tits resting on my chest. </p><p>I decided to follow her advice and stopped speaking. That decision left my lips without a job. A waste, I decided. I let my lips roam freely over her neck, sucking a particularly tasty-looking spot that carried the signs of my attention from the last night. Despite her best efforts to keep it contained, a moan slid out from its prison, filling the room with a raspy voice that flared my desires even further. </p><p>Still, the pleasure was not thick enough to make her forget where she was. She squeezed her mouth to prevent another moan from taking the same path for freedom. She even brought one of her hands over her lips to reinforce the barrier, the other resting against the wall to keep her balanced. </p><p>With both of her hands busy, I was free to invade her body however I wished. Their first destination was the back of her bra, unlocking it with a fervor that reflected my arousal. Yes, her bra was away from anywhere that mattered, but its presence was still annoying. My fingers followed the straps, pushing them aside, trying to divest her torso from the last scrap of protection they had. Her eyes found mine, begging; to make me stop, or hurry up, I didn’t know. But I liked gambling enough to bet it was the latter, so I pulled off her shirt. She readily opened her arms, even as it left her mouth without a barrier to keep her voice low. As a gentleman, I was ready to assist her in her plight, and caught her lips in a tight kiss that muffled any cries that might let out.  Her shirt came off, followed by her bra shortly after. Both ended up discarded in an abandoned corner, leaving her body defenseless against my grabby hands. </p><p>I let my lips trace down. With her hands-free to return their task of keeping her silent, they were free to tease her other sensitive spots. A journey they started with a brief stop on her neck, before moving down, following the path that was created by her delicate spine, leaving a few kissed on each soft bump. </p><p>All the while, one of my hands were still buried in her panties, teasing her entrance relentlessly even as her juices gushed around my fingers. The other was free to dance over her body, reacquainting itself with the delicious contours of her body. Then, without warning, I grabbed her hair and pulled, forcing her to twist until it was her back that was pressing against the door. I pressed my body against hers, our gazes aligned. Her eyes told a story of arousal and surrender.</p><p>Then, I had let her hair go, leaning down to capture her nipple between my lips instead. I rolled it gently between my lips, with the occasional assistance from my tongue. One of my hands slid into its previous place in the confines of her panties, returning to its earlier task. The other one, already sunken deep into the supple flesh of her breast, was making her challenge to keep her voice down even more difficult. Despite her reinforced vigil, occasional whimpers escaped their prison, my assault intensifying with each second. </p><p>  My concentrated assault worked even better than I had guessed, though the location likely played an important role, the risk of being caught always at the forefront of her mind. A lapse of control, resulting in her unmistakable cries echoing through the corridors of the school, would destroy almost everything she had built during her short but overachieving career. </p><p>I understood exactly how she felt, because I was also under the same delicious pressure. I might not care about the job itself, but I needed it as a cover. Even more, there was a risk that a local newspaper might run the juicy news of two teachers being kicked out for workplace fraternization. From then on, it was a virtual certainty that someone from mafia would pick on it, and the chase would begin anew. Any rational person would have pulled away, correctly prioritizing their life over the momentary fancy of mind-blowing sex. </p><p>Admittedly, I didn’t exactly count as a rational person. After all, a rational person wouldn’t have joined mafia despite better options. And even if he did, double-crossing the same organization, with its well-armed, trigger happy executioners would never be an option, regardless of the sums involved. Which was why, instead of stopping like any sane person would do when Amelia started trembling under the effects of a stiff orgasm, I grabbed her hair roughly, dragged her to her table, and pushed her down, her skirt conveniently bunched up. </p><p>My hands worked like lightning, releasing my belt, followed by the rest of my clothes, and my shaft was dangling freely. Another push, this time sidelining her panties, soaked with her juices enough to turn transparent, giving me free access to her entrance. My only warning was my hands, sinking into her buttocks as I leaned forward, once again capturing her body between mine and an object, this time her precious desk, the physical embodiment of her authority. </p><p>I pressed my shaft against her entrance, tasting her burning arousal in a more intimate way. I could feel her stiffen, but it was about her expectations and excitement rather than fear. Her bottom wouldn’t have risen invitingly otherwise, giving me the perfect angle to defile her. Then, I pushed inside her scorching hot tunnel, her walls tight around my girth as I invaded her mercilessly. </p><p>Her first reaction was to let out a loud cry, which was, thankfully, muffled sufficiently, thanks to her hands pressing against her mouth. I pulled back, only to impale even deeper, which forced another cry out, this time even louder. “Keep it down,” I warned, punctuating my request with a stiff slap on her bottom. Admittedly, my actions weren’t exactly helping, but I was well past the point of caring. </p><p>“I’m trying,” she murmured. “Maybe if you-” she tried to add, but that, I interrupted with another spank. </p><p>“Rejected,” I said mockingly even as I pushed myself even deeper into her. On my skin, I could feel her burning desire, roaring even stronger after her first orgasm. No matter how hard I pushed inside her, her walls tightened around my shaft, trying to keep them inside. “I’m sure you can manage it though, professor. After all, there is nothing you can’t do, right?” </p><p>Her hands pulled away from her mouth, and her lips parted open, but before she could form a word, my hand landed on her bottom, preferring to squeeze her plump flesh. She was barely able to bring her hands back to her mouth to suppress the next cry. “Better,” I called with a smirk. </p><p>Next few minutes passed in silence, discounting rhythmic sound of flesh hitting flesh, mixed with occasional moans she barely managed to muffle. Her tunnel continued to squeeze me relentlessly, pushing me even closer to arousal, but I stayed inside her. Only at the last second, I pulled back, covering her panties with my seed. She continued to lay there listlessly. I left her like that, fixed my pants, and left the room, though I checked to see corridor was empty before. </p><p>I stepped on the corridor, leaving Amelia behind, used and exhausted. It was tempting to start another session, as I had quite a bit of time to kill, but I decided to cut it short. I still needed to attend to Megan. As a teacher, it was my responsibility to educate her about ill-advised actions, and their consequences…  </p><p><strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>For the next stage of my plan, I stopped by my office, and pulled a couple of phone numbers from the system. Then,  I went back to my minuscule apartment I temporarily adopted as my residence, getting a packaged lunch on the way, a large burger, with extra fries. Not my usual fare, as I tried to stay away from heavy food for lunch, but after all that happened, I was deserving a reward. Not to mention that I needed energy for what was going to happen in the next few hours. I pulled a beer from the fridge for good measure, then took a seat on my computer desk. </p><p>I turned on my computer, and started fiddling with the keyboard with one hand, leveraging the other to destroy the greasy reward I had acquired. After turning on a few programs that would prevent my location from being detected, I clicked on the last tool, and a large -and currently empty- room appeared on my view. A room that I had visited just yesterday, its visuals communicated through the infected computer of its occupant. For a second, I lamented that the room was empty. Even back in the business days, I never liked stakeouts. </p><p>But I decided to stay put and wait for Megan to arrive, suppressing my dislike for stakeouts. Not because I lacked a more direct way of reaching Megan, but because that way would be too effective. Yes, I could go to her and show that I had enough evidence to screw her over, dominating her directly. It would barely take an evening to teach her the mistake of selecting her targets carelessly. But then, boredom would return. I needed to take it slow, showing my hand as little as possible, letting her think that she had a hope of escaping my web. </p><p>I had just finished my food, and getting a second bottle of beer when I heard the sound of a door slamming, accompanied by the slight cracking of my speaker. Miss amateur blackmailer had arrived, I thought, hurrying back to my room to check the screen. “Jackpot,” I murmured. Megan was indeed back in her room, but she wasn’t alone. A certain Latino student was with her, whose wrist was captured in the tight grip of Megan, getting dragged towards her bed. </p><p>Their mode of dress caught my attention. Unfortunately, Camilla wasn’t wearing the clothes she was wearing in the morning, choosing to replace them in favor of a modest skirt, and a utilitarian shirt in boring brown, which became even more unremarkable with her dusky skin tone. Thankfully, Megan had gone other way to compensate for it. She was wearing jeans, but they were tight enough to be painted on her, displaying her long legs to maximum effect. And her tank-top granted me with a delicious view of her belly, its whiteness standing out against her bright red hair. “Delicious,” I murmured. I couldn’t wait until I tasted her directly.  </p><p>“What do you mean you lost the recorder,” Megan hissed, her face twisted as if she was trying to breathe fire, her fiery hair fitting her mood completely. Camilla mumbled something, too low to be heard from the speaker. “Speak louder, you stupid slut,” Megan ordered, making me realize that I wasn’t the only one that couldn’t hear Camilla’s fragile whispers. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Camilla said in obvious distress. “It must have fallen off from my pocket while walking.” </p><p>A cry escaped from Camilla as Megan’s grip tightened around her wrist. “How can you be that careless, you idiot. What do you think would happen when someone finds it. We’re screwed.” With that, Megan launched an angry tirade, Camilla’s shoulders lowering further with each shout. I sighed, once again reminded of their amateurish approach. There was no point in Megan’s panic. Even if a third party found it and went to the administration, only Camilla and I would have been harmed by it. There was no reference to Megan’s name, and Camilla looked cowed enough to keep her mouth shut about Megan’s involvement. </p><p>Still, I didn’t want to watch their fight for an hour, so I sent a mail to Megan from my official account, informing her that I had found an old-style music player in my office, and maybe it was hers. Her phone rang but she ignored it, busy listening to Megan’s angry exclamations, forcing me to send another mail. This time, she checked her phone, and her face lighting up in panic. “It’s the professor,” she exclaimed happily. “I forgot it in his room!” </p><p>“Stupid girl,” Megan called. “Why are you happy, it means that we are caught!” </p><p>“No, we’re not,” Camilla informed her as she showed her the mail. </p><p>Megan’s panic replaced with elation as she slowly read my mail. “That schmuck,” she called with a peal of merciless laughter. “I knew he was an idiot, but this much.” She waited a few seconds, clearly enjoying the moment. “Quick, write him back and say that you are going to go to his office and pick it up as soon as possible, before he smartens and realizes it’s a recording device.” </p><p>I shook my head in exasperation, surprised by the ease they believed to my paper-thin cover story. Getting underestimated this much was annoying, even if it made my self-appointed task easier. A few exchanges later, Camilla left in a hurry, leaving Megan alone in the room. “Incompetent nerd,” Nancy murmured to the empty room as she sat on her bed. “Why do I even bother?” </p><p>A minute later, she stood up once more, a movement that presented her body, which could be described as willowy if it wasn’t for her impressive chest. She sighed, dragging her fingers through her luscious red hair, trying to calm herself. I reached for my burner phone, about to send her the first of many messages when I noticed she was reaching for the button of her jeans. There was no harm in a short delay, I reasoned as I leaned back, taking another cold sip from the bottle. More vulnerable, the better. Though my viewing pleasure paid an important part as well.  </p><p>I watched in rapt attention as she slowly peeled off her jeans, revealing the milky expanse of her legs, ending with a g-string in the same hue with her hair. She carelessly threw the jeans on her bed. Doing that, she gave me the first glimpse of her bottom, tantalizingly white. I couldn’t wait until I christened her pristine skin with my slaps while I thought her a lesson about the importance of care on target selection. </p><p>Then, her shirt followed the same fate, and put her flawless back on display. Just by looking at her, I could easily tell that dieting and gym took the lions’ share of her day. I waited for her to turn back to give me a good view of her breasts. After being subjected to her aggressive cleavages that hinted, but never showed those treasures, I couldn’t help but feel curious. But instead, she took a step towards the bathroom, threatening to deprive of that sight. I had no intention of waiting for her to finish with the bathroom. A pampered rich girl like that could easily spend hours in there. </p><p>I pressed the send button on my burner phone, and her phone, which was currently sitting on her desk, vibrated violently. She glanced towards the desk, trying to decide which one to prioritize. For a moment, I was bummed, thinking that she was going to pick the shower, which would mean I had to sit in front of the computer for a while, waiting for her to leave. But thankfully, after a moment’s consideration, she chose to check her phone instead, and turned towards the desk. </p><p> The desk which also held the webcam that I was using to observe her, treating me a direct view of her breasts, which were just as spectacular as her endless parade of cleavage had suggested. They were firm enough to argue against the existence of gravity, enough that I would have suspected plastic surgery if it wasn’t for the absolute perfection of her skin. They were just large enough to fill my palms, tempting me with the promise of the time where I could sink my fingers in their depths. With each step, they rippled just enough to ensure their naturalness. </p><p>Then, she arrived at her destination. There was a lazy, disinterested expression on her face when she first reached her phone, which then turned into a slight frown when she read my message. ‘You made a bad mistake, sister,’ the message read. She looked at the screen for a few seconds, like she expected it to fold just to escape her gaze, but this time, it didn’t work. Instead of writing an answer, however, she put the phone back on the desk. So I sent another message in hurry. ‘You have been careless in the task that was appointed to you,’ read the next one. </p><p>This time, she typed a quick reply. ‘Who are you, and what do you mean?’ she typed. </p><p>‘I’m just a sister from our sacred alliance, concerned by the way you have failed to contain your sacred role,’ I typed, trying to replicate the nonsense dialect those sorority girls preferred to use. There was a simple reason that I acted like another girl from the sorority, other than not wanting to reveal my full hand. Things would escalate too quick if she knew she had lost those files to someone outside, which would bring too much commotion. As long as she thought it was another sorority girl that had the recordings, she would treat it as a high-stakes hazing, allowing me to escalate slowly. </p><p>‘What do you mean?’ she typed, her annoyance growing, but I could also read beginnings of fear as well. I hadn’t answered for a few seconds intentionally, using that time to sending another mail to Camilla, explaining to her that due to a last minute thing, I had to leave the office, but I could always give the device back to her tomorrow. </p><p>Or she could swing by my home if it was particularly urgent. </p><p>Camilla’s instant reply, assuring me that she was going to be there in a few minutes wasn’t a surprise, but it was a slight disappointment. It was clear that, despite the treatment she received early in the morning, it hadn’t occurred to her what kind of follow-up might await her in my place, away from the risk of being intruded by another student. </p><p>With that issue resolved, it was time to send another message to Megan, who was awaiting my mail with a worried expression on her face. ‘You have failed to secure the most important asset of our holy sisterhood,’ I said, followed by a picture of the recordings I had removed from the secret compartment in her nightstand. The expression of total panic would be enough to bring me to the full mast if I hadn’t already been in that condition.  </p><p>She dashed towards the dressing stand, her tits shaking with each hurried step. She tried to open the secret container, but with her shaky hands, she failed to open it in the first few repeats. Trembling fingers weren’t the best tools for disengaging fragile mechanisms, it seemed. </p><p>After a not-so-brief struggle, she managed to open it, only to meet with its emptiness. “Fuck,” she called as she looked the empty box for a few seconds, then she slid it back, uncaring whether she harmed the mechanism, and stumbled back to her bed, like she had just had drunk a chain of shots, prepared by an enthusiastic frat boy. She just sat, trying to process the loss of their precious recordings. I just watched her, enjoying her despair alongside her beautiful and poorly dressed silhouette. </p><p>A minute or so later she stood up, and walked back to her desk, where her phone lay forgotten. ‘You made your point,’ she wrote. ‘Now bring them back.’ </p><p>‘Come on, dear leader,’ I wrote back. ‘You can’t be possibly thinking it will be that easy, right? First, you need to learn the importance of duty.’ And before she could add anything else, another message appeared on her screen. ‘Or, I could just send them to alumni with a cute note explaining who is responsible for their loss, if you prefer so?’</p><p>Her expression was answer enough, but I wisely waited until she sent an actual message. No need to alert her that my leverage wasn’t limited to just a few, though admittedly impressive, recordings. It took a minute before her fingers reluctantly danced over her screen. ‘What exactly it’s going to take? Promotion in the ranks, money, something else?’ </p><p>‘No sister,’ I wrote back. ‘It’s not going to be that easy. First, we’re going to make sure you’re appropriately punished for this grave oversight.’ I waited until I saw a resigned expression on her face, then sent the next message. ‘A stiff spanking might be a good start.’ </p><p>A wave of impotent anger, mixed with confusion, akin to one that appeared when I stole a kiss off her pouty lips appeared. ‘So, are you going to come to my room,’ she wrote resignedly. </p><p>‘Nope,’ I answered. ‘Unfortunately, I don’t have time to deal with your silly revenge attempts, which would sure to come if you knew my identity. So, this time, you’re going to handle it yourself. Please spank yourself five times, on the naked skin. And all on the left side, please.’ </p><p>She looked at the screen with distaste, reluctantly typing a reply. ‘Okay,’ she said, then waited a minute before writing another. ‘I’m finished. Is that it.’</p><p>I couldn’t help but snort. It wouldn’t be believable even if I didn’t have a real-time feed of her room. ‘Come on, my dear leader,’ I wrote. ‘Do you really think I would just take your word without evidence. Not that I believe you did it. Now, why don’t you actually do it, but send me a picture of your bottom after finishing it.’ And after a last moment’s fancy, I added. ‘And don’t you dare to keep your slaps weak. I will make you repeat if I don’t like find the contrast enough. I want to see fingerprints there.’</p><p>She continued looking at the screen with growing fury. For a moment, I was sure that she was going to throw her phone to the wall, or do something equally pointless, but she managed to suppress her anger. She walked to her bed and bent over, her left hand pressing there for balance, and the right one collided with her bottom three times in rapid succession.’ Then, she waited a minute to redness to grow before taking the photo of her ass. </p><p>‘Nice panties,’ I wrote back. ‘However, the redness is not enough. It’s clear that you haven’t pushed yourself enough. I’m willing to bet you didn’t even spank yourself five times like I asked you.’ </p><p>‘I did!’ she wrote. </p><p>‘No you didn’t, and more you try to lie, harder you’re making it for yourself.’ I was about to ask her to repeat the performance, but this time, with a recording to prove it, but then, my doorbell rang. ‘Still, you’re lucky that I have other things to do today. We will be discussing your disobedience tomorrow. Be at your room tomorrow evening, eight, sharp, or I’m not responsible for the consequences.’ With that, I turned my phone off, followed by my computer, the last thing I saw on the screen was a mug, smashing against the wall as Megan lost control. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was Monday, and I was back at work, sitting on my desk at my newly assigned office. I couldn’t say I was perfectly comfortable. The furniture I had ordered was yet to arrive, making the room feel like a loaner, but it still beat the hellhole I had been living since my reassignment. In front of me, several files were open. Financial reports for the department. </p><p>An extreme sense of pleasure filled my body as I went through the paperwork, searching for another trail of evidence to ‘accidentally’ stumble into another irregularity, which then would be presented to Natalie as a random finding which needed instant correction, as it was clearly a mistake that needed to be fixed. </p><p>But admittedly, the anticipation of another revenge session wasn’t the reason for the rush of pleasure that kept me in the edge of orgasm. That honor went to Brenda, who was currently under my table, her blond hair covering my lap, her lips around my girth as she bobbed her head repeatedly in an effort to push me over the edge. Quite enthusiastically as well, I must add. I was impressed with the speed she adapted to her new station. I hadn’t even needed to touch her head as she did her best to devour the entirety of my shaft. </p><p>“Perfect,” I murmured as I came across a mistake. Brenda tried to pull back, but I pushed my fingers through her hair, preventing her movement. “I’m not talking to you, sweetheart, go on with your work,” I said even as I examined the details of the bill, to see whether it would lead to me to the direction I wanted. It was much easier to audit someone when you already knew where the bodies were buried. You just needed to find a path that looked plausible from a glance, and voila, you were there. </p><p>With the evidence I was searching in front of my fingers, the next step was to call Natalie for another talk. I decided to send Brenda to call her, because I knew that such a visible sign of encroachment into her territories would annoy her even further. Too bad for her that she could do nothing to get back, not when her career was balanced against my checkbook. </p><p>Of course, I had no intention of sending Brenda away before she finished her current task. But I was a kind boss, so I decided to assist her. My right hand joined the left over her head, then I pushed her down without warning, hard enough to lodge my shaft deep into her throat. She took it like a champion, just softly gagging a few times even as my crown clogged her breathing. I kept her down several more seconds, then allowed her to pull out for a breath. A few more repeats, and I was filling her mouth with my seed. </p><p>When she pulled back, her cheeks were puffed with an attempt to contain my seed, but impressively, none of it stained her lips. “I’m impressed, Brenda. You’re a quick learner, just as I like,” I said, patting her head gently as she swallowed my seed, the flare of anger barely surviving a second in her sea of submissiveness. “Go and fix your makeup,” I ordered. “Then, I want you to send Natalie to my room. Say her that I need to talk with her about something important.” </p><p>“No,” she stammered. I understood the reason for her hesitance. She might be inefficient when it came to academics, but she was quite smart when it came to understanding office politics. And calling Natalie to my room in short notice was insulting enough. Using her own secretary for delivery just enhanced it. And Brenda was savvy enough know that her temporary role as my emissary would do nothing to blunt Natalie’s anger towards her, especially since she couldn’t lash out to me, making Brenda end up as the victim. All told, her panic was justified. Too bad for her, that I had no intention of catering to her disobedience. </p><p>“Did you just talked back to me,” I said. A flash of panic passed through her face as she realized the gravity of her mistake, but it was too late. “Stand up,” I ordered. She stood up, her legs trembling. “Turn back, and put your hands on the desk,” I added. She was quick to follow it, uncaring of the fact that her skirt, short enough to barely cover her bottom while she was standing straight, slid up, revealing her choice of panties for the day. I put my fingers on the small of her back, where the low-cut of her panties ended. “You know what is next, right, slut,” I murmured. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, her trembling, vulnerable voice enough to stiffen my shaft once more. </p><p>“Good, because you seem to trouble learning I don’t like the back-talk.” My touch slid down, caressing her naked flesh. Then, without a warning, my touch turned into a spank, echoing in the room. “Let’s see, maybe a physical reminder would work better.” She whimpered. “I want you to count them,” I said as I spanked her once more. </p><p>“Two,” she moaned helplessly. </p><p>“Do I need to educate you in maths as well,” I said, even as another spank landed on her bottom, this time on the opposite cheek, making her redness symmetric. “You need to start from one.” </p><p>“One,” she mumbled between her bitten lips, trying to keep her voice contained. </p><p>I let out a defeated sigh, overdone on purpose. “Speak clearly,” I added, even as I slapped her bottom once more. </p><p>“One,” she said, loud and clear discounting the soft tremble in her tone. I shrugged. I had expected her to move up, which would give me an excuse to roll-back the count. But even I couldn’t get everything I wanted, I thought as I continued spanking Brenda, who followed up by counting. “Ten,” she moaned after a while, her voice mixing up with a gasp as I dragged my fingers over her panties, her wetness evident even through the fabric. </p><p>I leaned forward, my breath falling on her neck, her body trapped between the desk and my body. “The last one seemed to be a bit off. Maybe we should take it from the beginning.” Her body froze in a manner I would have categorized as fear without my familiarity with her reaction. She was excited enough to beg me for a repeat, but smart enough to realize doing so would just backfire. “Or maybe not,” I added, amused by the sudden flash of disappointment going on her face. </p><p>I let it slide uncommented, pulling open the bottom drawer of my desk instead. Hearing the noise, she tried to turn to check the source. I grabbed her hair. A sharp tug was enough to make her stand still, though it also had another nice effect, smashing her bottom against my erection. She wiggled her bottom softly. It was a tempting idea, but not tempting enough to make me abandon my plan. </p><p>I leaned down and pulled down two items. A small bottle of lubricant, and an anal plug that shouted its presence thanks to its bright pink color. Brenda strained her neck to see what I just pulled, but I kept them in an angle that she couldn’t see. “You’re being a naughty girl,” I said, my palm meeting with her flesh once more, darkening its redness. “Stop trying to get a peek.” </p><p>That turned out to be enough to remind her about her place. First, I freed my shaft from the confines of my pants, as it was getting quite stuffy in there. Then, I grabbed the edge of her panties, dragging them down in a torturous slowness, ignoring the way she trembled in anticipation. I let them go when they were around her knees, and focused my attention on her entrance, sopping wet with anticipation. I caressed them for a second, but hadn’t dallied for long. Her trembles were beautiful, but I had another hole in mind. </p><p>My gaze fell into her puckered hole as I opened the bottle of lubricant, spreading it over the plug that was going to slide into that hole moments later. I rested my shaft against her slit, teasing slightly. Her bottom rose in response, giving me a better angle to slide inside. It was lucky that my door had a lock, leaving me free to use it -and her- however I wished. </p><p>“You want it, don’t you, you dirty slut,” I murmured even as I slid the top of my shaft inside her. She just moaned in response. Normally, I would be quick to inform her about my displeasure when she failed to answer a direct question, but for once, I decided to cut her slack. In a moment, she would have enough to keep her occupied and more. </p><p>A surprised shout escaped her mouth as I pressed the well-lubricated dildo against her puckered hole. “Silence,” I ordered even as slid my shaft deeper into her without warning. Her mouth opened in preparation of an even bigger shout, but I was ready for it. I pressed my empty hand against her mouth, muffling her voice. </p><p>I kept my hand over her mouth even after her cries subsided, replaced by moans as I continue to push inside her repeatedly. After all, fun as it was, it was just the appetizer, with the main event still awaiting. “Are you ready for it,” I asked. I felt her stiffen at my question, but didn’t wait for an answer before sliding the thin end of the plug inside her. She achieved the impossible, tightening even further as I struggled to push it into her back door. </p><p>“Holy shit, you are tight. Don’t tell me it’s the first time it’s being used.” She gave no answer, not that it was necessary. The sudden blush on her face, thicker than anything I had the pleasure of seeing on her face, was more than enough as an answer. “That’s amazing. Who would have guessed that I would be lucky enough to get your only remaining cherry,” I continued cheerfully as I pushed the dildo deeper, my shaft sliding in and out of her tunnel repeatedly. </p><p>Minutes later, I pushed the plug deeper in one last push, lodging it completely into her bowels, earning one last earth-shattering cry from her which made me glad that my hand was still over her mouth, the only thing that prevented the office drones from rushing in. “Try to keep your voice low, slut,” I ordered. “Or do you want everyone to rush here, to see you bent over on the desk, panting like a bitch in heat.” </p><p>She gave no answer, but even I wasn’t merciless enough to blame her for it when a blank expression covered her face, signifying the overload of pleasure she was experiencing. She seemed to enjoy the invasion of her alternate hole more than I would have first thought. Soon, she collapsed over my desk, her arms trembling too badly to support her weight. I let go of her mouth in favor of sinking my fingers into her bottom, and started slamming into her mercilessly. </p><p>Her grip around my girth tightened even further as her juices gushed out, pulling me dangerously close to a climax of my own. I barely managed to pull back, spraying her bottom with my pearly liquid, contrasting brightly with her ass, which burned bright red after my merciless spanking. “I hope that was enough to make the lesson stick,” I murmured as I fixed my clothing. “Otherwise, I might need to bring out a few toys to make the lesson permanent.” </p><p>She nodded absentmindedly, still under the effects of the monumental climax she had suffered through. Then, my words managed to infuse through her haze, panic blossoming on her face once more, but it was edged with anticipation, suggesting that my threat resonated with more than her fear. “Understood,” she said, her gasping tone tempting me to push her down to continue our adventure. </p><p>“Good, then go and ask Natalie to visit me. We have things to discuss.” At my words, an alarmed expression went through her face, but it was mellower than the first time, showing the session worked as intended. Another moment passed with indecision, then she nodded. “Good, but don’t forget to visit the bathroom before her office. You’re a mess.” </p><p>Once again, she nodded, then stood up despite her trembling legs. Her hand reached towards her bottom, trying to reach the head of the pink plug on her bottom, but my fingers, wrapping around her wrist, preventing her from doing so. “That stays,” I ordered. </p><p>“But-” she managed to say before I grabbed her hair, tugging hard. </p><p>“I said, it’s going to stay for the day.” I kept my gaze on hers until she nodded helplessly. “Good, and don’t even think about removing it during the day. You never know when I might decide to check.” </p><p>With that resolved, she quickly fixed her clothing, then walked out. It was a pleasure walking her to get away, each step was taken gingerly, trying to accommodate the presence stretching her tight hole. </p><p>It was a fun sight. </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>I knew who was on the other side of the door as soon as I heard the knock, as currently, there was only one person in the company that had the need to visit my room while displaying obvious signs anger. “Come in,” I called. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when the door opened, only to reveal Natalie. She was dressed in a power suit, sharp black jacket over her spotless, impeccably ironed shirt, complete with a tight pencil skirt and black stilettos. The business equivalent of plate armor. It was different than her usual ensemble, a mixture of stylish and relaxed. She clearly wore it in an attempt to compensate for what had happened during the weekend. Too bad for her, for me, it only highlighted her weakness, and I had more than one way to break through her openings. “You ‘called’ me,” she spat out. </p><p>“Why don’t you come in,” I said, gesturing to a chair.</p><p> She walked there, but her face was sharp enough to cut steel, her steps echoing on the room. She stopped in front of my table, but instead of sitting down, she chose to watch me from a standing position, trying to seem intimidating. A waste of energy, as it made her look even more vulnerable, as it was quite difficult for her to intimidate me after our latest encounter. “Is this about the weekend! We agreed to never talk about it!” </p><p>“Calm your panties, sweetie,” I said as I rested comfortably, ignoring the storm on her face, my words stretching lazily. “It’s not about anything that happened in the casino, or in the hotel.” I smirked. “Or anything that had happened in the plane, or plane’s bathroom, with or without the flight attendant.” It was amusing to watch her face get redder and redder as I went deeper on the list. I was tempted to go more into detail about the things we shouldn’t mention, but the redness of her face dissuaded me from that path. Not because I was afraid of her, but I needed her to be reasonably coherent for the next stage of the plan, not yelling in a poor attempt to cover her anxiety. </p><p>“What’s it about then,” she asked, her voice just a shade lower than an unrestricted shout. A voice that would have caused anyone else in this little office to dash away in panic, but not me. I calmly twisted the printouts of the file so that she could read. “What’s this,” she asked, the anger replaced with dismissiveness as she looked at the pile of papers, each covered in numbers. </p><p>“Financial reports of the department,” I said in a soft voice. After all, there was no need for me to bother impressing her with my tone, when the content did it effectively already. She tried to look unaffected, but with her face losing all of its color, it wasn’t what I would call a successful attempt. “I was going over them, and I found a couple of things you might want to go over.” </p><p>“Really?” she said, her voice cracking with panic. She pulled up a chair close where the paper lay, keeping her gaze firmly on them. “Why did you bother going through them,” she asked. </p><p>Her poor display of information gathering was enough to put a smile on my face, but thankfully, she was too distracted by the papers to notice it. “It pertains my new role as the sales manager. You weren’t expecting me to sign into the role and take over the responsibility for them without going through them, did you?” </p><p>“If you wish to do so,” she said, trying to sound casual, but it was hard with her voice trembling. “But there is no reason to bother with them. Your time is too worthwhile to waste going through the financials. We need you outside, bringing in new clients.” </p><p>“Really, looking at the numbers, things don’t seem so bad if we include the order that we had managed to get from Harrison.” </p><p>“Yes, that helped,” she said, clearly unsatisfied with the necessity of admitting it, but she was smart enough to realize angering me wasn’t a winning proposition in our current situation. “Still, a few more clients wouldn’t hurt.” </p><p>“I understand. Then, why don’t we quickly go over the numbers so we can make sure everything is in order, and I can sign to take them over, and move on the important stuff. I only have a few hours to finish them.” I had no time pressure, but I added that to give her an angle she could work to prevent me from working on them. Even now, pushing her too hard was not an option I wanted to take. </p><p>She nodded, and we started going over the documents I had prepared. It was amusing to watch her struggle to explain the discrepancies in numbers. It wasn’t that she was a bad liar. She was good enough to convince a lot of people with her well-thought excuses. Misrepresentations, typos, system errors, small tweaks to stay compliant to company policies of the client… Corporate speak at its best. Her lies might even be enough to convince me if I didn’t know the extent of her tricks. </p><p>But unfortunately for her, it wasn’t the case, so her excuses met with my good-humored but factual rebuttals, destroying them with ease. I was careful never to blame her, but continued doing my best to find different reasons for not signing my name before logging a request for correction. She tried to dissuade me from going through it, trying to look like she was trying to spare me from the extra work that would result from it, but I neatly ignored them, curious what else she was going to do. </p><p>“Would it be a bother if I come to your side of the table,” she asked, fifteen minutes after her arrival. “It’s a bit hard to work like this, my neck is starting to hurt.” </p><p>“Sure, go ahead,” I added, curious where she was going with that. She stood up with an exaggerated sigh and stretched. It was a very peculiar way of stretching, one that had put the curves of her body to my viewing pleasure, while informing me the fact that a few buttons of her blouse had been undone during our discussions. I was impressed. I hadn’t even noticed her fiddling with them. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured as she pulled a chair next to me. I hadn’t missed the fact that another button had come undone as she sat down, enough to reveal that she was wearing a lacy bra that looked far too fragile to contain her spectacular breasts. </p><p>I ignored the blatant invitation it in favor of moving to the next item on the list. It would have been a lie if I claimed I wasn’t tempted to push her over the table and take her on the exact spot I took her secretary barely an hour ago, but I kept my desire in check, curious how much she was going to push. “What about this one,” I asked instead, pointing at a line of expense with no further explanation. “It’s above the limit of discretionary expense, but doesn’t have any note or approval to justify it.” </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I caught a flash of panic that she suppressed a moment later, replaced with her face docility. “It’s Brenda,” Natalie explained dismissively. “She can be a bit careless filling the reports, since they are mostly for record purposes. But we can go and check the actual records instead if you think it’s worth the effort.” She followed with a sigh that communicated a good-natured frustration. </p><p>“You don’t seem to be that enthusiastic,” I asked cheerfully. </p><p>“Not really,” she sighed as she pulled back, though she still leaned forward to enhance her cleavage. “It’s such a waste of time, spending an hour in that dusty room, hunting for a useless invoice.” </p><p>“It’s not like I have anything better to do,” I said, once again ignoring the blatant invitation. This time, I wanted her to be the initiator. Another flag to surrender in our little game. </p><p>Her confident expression slipped for a second, revealing the panic underneath, but she was quick to repair it. “I might have an idea,” she gasped even as she put her hand on my leg, slowly trailing upwards. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said even as I leaned back, indicating that I was planning to stay passive. “Why don’t you show me what you have in mind, boss.” </p><p>Her expression slipped again, this time with anger, but I acted like I had missed it while looking into her cleavage. She said nothing else as she reached to her blouse, unlocking the remaining buttons. It parted open, treating me with the sight of her slightly transparent bra, the pinkness of her areolas slightly visible. But that wasn’t as interesting as the sight of her nipples, pushing against the fabric in search of their freedom, suggesting that I wasn’t the only person in the room that was feeling aroused. I smirked, amused by the betrayal of her own body. I could easily imagine her thoughts, cursing herself.</p><p>To her credit, she managed to keep her feelings bottled, her hand, freed once more, landed on my thigh. Then, it started to climb while gently massaging my leg. But, her gentleness disappeared the moment she reached to my belt, freeing my waist from its hold in a quick, almost desperate, maneuver. The button and the zipper shared the same fate a moment later, leaving her free to delve deep into my boxer. “Wow, it looks like somebody missed junior a lot,” I said mockingly. “You should have dropped by after the breakfast, boss. You don’t need an excuse for it. My door is always open for you.” </p><p>“I’ll keep it in mind,” she said as her hands tightened around my erection tighter than necessary. My only answer was a smile as I watched her struggle containing her anger. But even as she struggled for control, her hand started moving up and down over my shaft. Her grip was hard, but her movements were rhythmic and enjoyable. For a minute, I let her continue massaging my shaft while still confined in my underwear. Then, I pushed my boxers down, revealing the full glory of my shaft for her eyes once more. </p><p>Her eyes widened, but she had to struggle to pull her sight away from it. When she did so, she found herself looking at my eyes, filled with an amused glee. She blushed, her lips parting like she was about to say something. I was tempted to order her to start sucking, but kept my silence, leaving the initiative with her, curious when she was going to push forward. </p><p>Not soon, I learned. Minutes passed as she continued caressing my shaft, with no indication of pushing forward, happy to kill time. I looked at her, trying to look bored to remind her that inadequate service might result in unintended consequences. It wasn’t a happy message for her, but she was smart enough to understand the risks. Her hand sneaked behind her, and a brief struggle later, her bra came undone, sliding down to reveal her spectacular breasts to my sight, still leaving few marks from our last encounter. I wondered how she explained them to her girlfriend.  </p><p>Then, she left her chair, and fell on her knees in front of me, her hand sliding lower on my length. Good, I thought. She was finally doing something fun. “You better go a bit deeper under the table,” I ordered. “Just in case someone walks in.” </p><p>“Shit, we forget to lock the door,” she exclaimed. She tried to stand up, but I pressed my hand on her shoulder, keeping her in place. “Stay,” I said. “No one would see anything with you under the table, but they might be suspicious if the door is locked.” She still looked like she was about to reject, so my free hand went through her hair and pushed her head down. She couldn’t argue with my girth in her mouth, could she? </p><p>As I predicted, her struggles disappeared soon after, her head started bobbing. It was fun, no doubt, but I was already planning the ways I could push her further. I reached for my phone, and sent a quick message to Brenda, telling her to come to my room as soon as possible, but act completely normal when she arrived. </p><p>A minute later, the door opened, and Brenda stepped inside. “Hi Brenda, how can I help you?” I said before she could ask me where Natalie was. Underneath the table, Natalie tried to pull back in shock, but I kept my hand over her head, preventing her from pulling back. While doing that, I had made no attempt to obscuring what was going on. Brenda’s eyes grew in shock, realizing the exact location of her dear boss. Not that it was a hard puzzle for her, she was in the exact same spot minutes ago. I gestured her to play along. </p><p>She nodded, but still in shock. “I’m here for the bring the documents you asked for,” she said, only the slightest stammer in her tone, still shocked with the realization. </p><p>“Ah, I forgot,” I said with an overdone gesture. “Why don’t you place them on the shelf, then,” I added even as I gestured her to lock the door. I didn’t want any surprise visitor for the next stage of my plan. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was around dinnertime that I arrived back to the house. A dangerous time since from the security camera, I could see that the occupants of the house were preparing to start their dinner. A rather dangerous situation for me. The act I had established was like a paper towel, risking a collapse with the slightest unexpected wind. It was an apt description, considering the adventures I was having with each of them, dangerous even in their lonesome. A wrong word, an expressive look picked by another, and my little scheme folded like a crooked building during an earthquake…</p><p>I could have simply avoided the dinner, loitering around for an hour or two. But there was a certain temptation in danger. And seeing their shocked expression as I subtly needled them about our encounters would be too delicious to miss. I wasn’t above admitting the irony of taking such a risk for pride, especially after all the criticism I had for Nancy about her dangerous reliance on pride. But even that realization wasn’t enough to dissuade me from the idea. I was willing to bet that each of them, distracted by their own concerns, would miss the signs the others made. </p><p>They were already around the dinner table when I opened the main door and slipped inside. All turned towards me, matching thick blushes on their face. I was glad that I had sexual interactions with all three of them. If it was only one or two, the others would certainly catch such an obvious display. It was a different deal when each was distracted by their own concerns. “Hi girls, good evening,” I said, only to receive three mumbles in response. “Would it be too much of a bother if I sit with you for dinner? I’m famished.” </p><p>“Of course not,” said Katie, jumping before other two could even react. “Let me fill a plate for you.” </p><p>“Thanks, Kat, you’re a true doll,” I said even as I pulled the chair, sitting across the seat Katie just vacated, Nicole at my side. It was the best position, because my relationship with Nancy wasn’t conducive for anything touchy, not to mention, the top she had, cut through with a deep cleavage more revealing than her usual clothing. Normally, it wouldn’t be enough to make her too distracted, but I had a feeling there was another factor in play. Like a certain set of underwear that might or might not be hidden under her clothes. </p><p>Different than Nancy, Nicole was dressed downright conservative, a knee length skirt and a shapeless blouse. She was trying to separate herself from her earlier experiences, I decided. Trying to forget the moments where she squealed under me without restriction with each push. Of course, I had no intention of letting her forget those memories. I slid my hand under the table, and squeezed her leg softly, reminding her of my touch.   </p><p>Nicole’s mouth opened in shock, but I expected her that to happen, so had already turned to Nancy and asked a question. “So, how it is going since we last talked,” I asked. A very innocent question it was, or it would be if she wasn’t in my basement just hours ago, dressed less than a stripper in the VIP section. So, instead of giving a normal answer, or catching the expression of total shock on her stepmother’s face, she just mumbled something vaguely positive. </p><p>“Here is your food, Stephen, my mom’s famous lamb stew,” Katie said cheerfully, disrupting the mood of the table. Too cheerful to be natural, I noted, so I assumed it was her way of ignoring the fact that the last time we spent together, she was on my lap, fondling my shaft. A difficult impression to shrug for a virgin who hadn’t even seen a male member until then. Still, I couldn’t help but notice that she was yet to wear the clothes I gifted to her. </p><p>“Thanks, Kat,” I answered, once again my nickname for her going unremarked around the table as each was distracted by their own challenges. I took a bite of the stew, which was as good as Katie promised. Another amazing trait of Nicole, she was as excellent in the kitchen, almost comparable to her performance in the bedroom. “It’s really delicious. You’re an amazing cook, Nicole.” </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, the blush spreading to her face too bright for such a simple compliment. Nancy failed to notice, still unable to process what had happened, but Katie did. It wasn’t a full-blown suspicion like she consciously realized that there was something wrong, but her glance rested on Nicole a second too long, a barely perceivable frown on her face. </p><p>It was best to nip it in the bud, I decided as I slid my foot out of my shoe and brought on Katie’s leg, rubbing softly. It wasn’t a sensitive location that I targeted, but still, I expected her overreaction. Even when my toe rubbed against her shin, her eyes popped open in shock, showing the wisdom of my choice. Anything more, and it would have been noticed even in this table. </p><p>Still, she must have felt that the others might notice, so she threw a question. “Stephen, mom thinks that Nancy’s top is too revealing and she shouldn’t wear it. What do you think about it as a photographer?” Her attempt of distraction worked, and the rest of the table turned towards me after a brief angry glance aimed at her. </p><p>I looked at Katie even as I prepared for an answer, warning her that her distraction wasn’t without a cost. The blush on her face showed she understood my implication even before my foot started to trail the inner side of her leg. I shifted my gaze to Nancy before the others could notice it, and examined her silently for a moment. Nancy blushed further as my gaze fell on her cleavage, despite it being nothing compared to the one she had earlier the day. More interesting, I could see the edge of a familiar black bra, and when I raised my gaze in an unasked question, she resolutely avoided it. “It fits you,” I said, keeping my voice as even as possible.</p><p>I heard Nicole taking a breath, so before she could say anything, I turned to her. “Don’t you think so as well?” I asked, underlining the question in the form of my hand, sliding under her skirt to caress her thigh. </p><p>“Maybe it is,” she murmured, showing great restraint by keeping her voice relatively even, enough for the others to miss. </p><p>Even as I continued to tease them in their special way, I finished my dinner quickly. What I was doing was an exhilarating fun, my heartbeat almost loud enough to be heard. Unfortunately, it was also too risky to push for even more. Things were balanced on a knife’s edge, risking disaster at the slightest mistake.</p><p>“It was a delicious dinner, Nicole, but I have to run,” I said. “There is a couple of emails I need to sent to clients.” </p><p>Just as I pushed the chair back, Katie spoke. “Stephen, do you have half an hour later in the night?” </p><p>“Sure, for what though?” </p><p>“I need to write a paper about art history, and I was hoping to get a few insights from you. It’s really important,” she said, but the shy smile tugging the edge of her lips suggested it might be something else she wanted. </p><p>“Sure,” I said, “Just knock whenever you’re ready.” </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>I was just about to finish my work when I heard a knock on my door, followed by Katie’s voice, asking whether she could enter.</p><p>“Come in,” I called even as I closed the current picture I was working on. I didn’t think she would appreciate the almost naked pictures of her sister on my computer. The door opened to reveal her thin figure, this time wrapped in a knee-length loose skirt and an equally baggy t-shirt. For an unfamiliar eye, it might have looked like she was trying to look as unattractive as possible, as they weren’t the most flattering of the clothes, but there was another detail I managed to catch, both pieces were thin enough to barely impede the sensation of touch. Considering the activities we were in the last time, it wasn’t hard to guess it was intentional, and even if I failed that, the demure smile on her face was enough to remind me that. “By the way, where is your notebook?” I asked, unable to keep myself from teasing her a little. </p><p>“Notebook?” she asked confusedly as she walked the stairs. </p><p>“Notebook,” I repeated. “The one you are going to take your notes on as you question me about the art history.” </p><p>She stopped instantly, her gaze finding my face to check whether I was serious, dreading to inform me about she had something else in mind and the interview was just a foil to come to my room. But her gloom melted when she noticed the teasing smile on my face. “Jerk,” she murmured in good humor as she continued her walk until she stood in front of me, waiting for me to act. </p><p>I had other ideas in mind, so I turned towards her in my chair, but did nothing, waiting for her to act. A few seconds passed, and she started to sway indecisively as nervousness struck her, but she failed to take action. I deliberately sighed in a display of disappointment. “You need to be more comfortable, not just receiving intimacy, but initiating it as well,” I said even as I caressed her arm with a finger. </p><p>There was a serious expression on her face, telling me that she understood the significance of what I was asking, however slight it looked at the first glance. All of the intimate actions during our fake relationship had been initiated by me, and now I was asking her to take an active part on that. Interestingly, the realization of its importance didn’t delay her actions by much. Her expression shifted into one of resolution as she plopped herself on my lap. </p><p>“Better,” I said. “But it’s just a beginning, let’s see how far you can push by your own violation.”</p><p>Her layer of self-confidence trembled at my words, so she took a deep breath in an attempt to reinforce her calmness. She brought her hand on my face, slowly caressing my cheeks, trying to replicate my casual intimacy as her fingers danced over my cheek. An impression that was trickily difficult to achieve in the normal conditions, and plain impossible with her fingers, shaking with nervous excitement. </p><p>At first, she was simply adorable, but as the seconds rolled, her confidence rose, her fingers started to move in a more confident manner. More interestingly, she pressed her other hand on my chest for balance as she started to slide forward bit by bit. </p><p>What surprised me, however, that she didn’t stop like I expected when she was at the middle of my thighs, but continued forward in a steady rate, until she was sitting directly above my shaft, which had grown quickly in response to her presence. </p><p>“Very impressive,” I murmured, making her beam with a satisfied smile, one that was a perfect mixture of cute and sexy. Tempted, I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a surprise kiss, my arm curling around her waist reflexively to prevent her escaping when I felt the hand on my chest pressing further. </p><p>However, in a complete surprise, my arm stayed limp around her waist because she didn’t try to pull back. Instead, her hips started to dance simultaneously with her lips, grinding my lap in a repetitive yet enticing move. I repressed the desire to push my tongue in her mouth. Aggressiveness would give the decision-making back to me, and that was the exact opposite of what I wanted to happen, the kiss was already a mistake from that end, one that could be compensated. There was no need to enhance it with another that the plan might not recover from. </p><p>The fruits of the plan started to show, when I felt her tongue caressing my lips, requesting an entrance, too timid to push its way through. I parted my lips, accepting her hesitant presence into my mouth, gently caressing my tongue. I let go of the control of the time, and focused on enjoying the sensation. </p><p>She only pulled back when she was in a dire need of breath, the limited intake from her nose unable to meet the needs of her rising excitement. Her face was alight with arousal, her eyes shining as she found herself in the throes of an unfamiliar excitement. I could see an unworded question in her gaze, so I just nodded in approval. </p><p>Her face brightened even further as she leaned forward my lips, but the more captivating detail was her fingers, wrapped around my wrist. She gently pulled my hand. It slid under her skirt, where I expected her to stop, so I was quite surprised when she dragged it until my fingers were over her bra. </p><p>Never one to reject such an invitation, my fingers started to dance over her breasts, increasing her muffled moans despite her bulky bra reducing most of the impact. I considered pushing further, but she acted once more before I could. Caught in the heat of the moment, her fingers found my other wrist, this time leading it under her skirt. </p><p>But surprises were not over yet. A few seconds later, even as my fingers danced over her thighs she slid her bottom a bit. At first, I had thought that her last move had pushed her out of her comfort zone, but her adventurous fingers disabused me of that notion soon after, when they started to tinker with my belt, her impatience clear in her hurried touches. First, my belt fell open, then the buttons of my pants. Contrary to my expectations, she didn’t slow down a bit before grabbing the edge of my underwear and pulled down, releasing my shaft to her attention. </p><p>Only after her fingers grazed my cock, she pulled away from the kiss, a sudden hesitancy dominating her face. I nodded, indicating her to continue, and she wrapped her fingers around my girth once more, this time much surer, the soft texture of her hand making me even harder. Then, her lips closed over mine once more. </p><p>At first, I have done nothing other than softly massaging her skin at the locations she led my hands, as she explored my length in motions that got more confident with each repeat. Soon, she was pumping me in an enjoyable rhythm, her enthusiasm more than enough to compensate for her novice skills. I decided to go forward. It was hardly fair for her to visit the third base when I was still failed to capture the second fully. </p><p>My hand slid from her belly to her back, gently trailing her spine upwards until it arrived at the hooks that were keeping her bra in place, and a twist later, the hook had separated, loosening the hold of her bra over her chest, enough for me to cup her small yet firm breasts easily, but I had more interesting ideas, seeing that she failed to notice what had just happened. I traced the bands of her bra until I reached to the point where they met with the straps. Bingo, I thought when I checked to see the straps were detachable as well. A struggle that was slightly lengthier than the one that was required to unhook the bra. I mirrored the same motion at the other side, divesting her bra off any support, so when I pulled it off, it came off easier, no pesky shuffling required. </p><p>That managed to penetrate her bubble of focus. She tried to pull back, but my hand was ready, pressing her back to keep her in place. Her struggle lasted a while, but I didn’t take it seriously, considering her hand was still around my girth, pumping rapidly. As expected, her struggle died a few scant seconds later, leaving my hand free to explore her body as my desires directed. </p><p>Our bodies were conveniently pressed together, allowing me to feel the jolt that passed through her body when my fingers danced over her breasts, teasing her nipples with fleeting touches. Her rhythm quickened, both of her hands and her lips, her tongue asking permission to enter once more. This time, instead of letting her enter without any comment, however, my tongue jumped out to meet her in the middle. If she wanted something, she needed to fight for it. </p><p>Minutes passed in the same position. I was tempted to push further, but that would waste all my efforts to entice her to take initiative. I could feel a release was growing steadily, but I didn’t warn her until the last second, where pulled back from the kiss without a warning. “I’m cumming,” I said. I had to admit, watching the panic bloom her face played no small part on my final climax. In her panic, she grabbed the easiest thing she could use to cover it, her shirt. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in satisfaction as she looked at the large stained patch in front of her shirt, nor when she raised her fingers to examine them in shock, stained slightly white despite the presence of her shirt. </p><p>“Good work,” I said. My words managed to cut through the shocked haze of her face, grounding her back to reality. She looked at me, her mouth open, but no words leaving it other than an indecipherable mumbling. “You’re better equipped to convince Madison about our ‘relationship’, now that you are experienced about the mechanics.”</p><p>“Right!” she mumbled in an expression of complete shock, showing that the supposed reason had managed to slip out of her mind in the heat of the moment. “It’ll definitely come useful tonight.” </p><p>“Tonight?” I said. Even as I decided to leverage the position of my hands once more, one under her skirt, the other under her shirt. started caressing her once more. Somehow, she managed to register the attention. </p><p>“I’m going to stay at Madison for a girls’ night. Kind of a slumber party. We do that around once a month. Her mother is going to pick me up in half an hour.” </p><p>I should have left it alone, but the potential for fun was too hard to resist. “And what would happen if I sneak at Madison’s bedroom window halfway. Do you think it would help us sell the ruse even better?” </p><p>“Too risky,” she replied. I didn’t answer, but just continued to tease her with my fingers while looked into her eyes. It didn’t take long before she nodded in resignation, but there was no hiding the excitement blooming on her face despite her best efforts.   </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>It was around eleven when I decided to leave the house once more, this time, my destination was Madison’s house. Still, under the effects of our encounter, it hadn’t taken long to convince Katie that a visit from me in the middle of the night would be all that was required to remove Madison’s doubts. It didn’t need mentioning that I had different intentions of course. I even had a large bottle of juice mix with me, mixed with less than a shot’s worth of cheap vodka, just enough to give it a taste, and nothing more. It was against my moral code to sleep with a drunk girl, but giving them juice and telling it was alcohol was different. A sober girl that was convinced of her own drunkenness was always an interesting thing. </p><p>For once, the upstairs held no distraction for me, so I went to my car, and a quarter of an hour later, I pulled to a street, around a hundred meters away from Madison’s house, assuming that her parents wouldn’t appreciate a stranger in front of their home. And when I walked there, I could see the lights from the window Katie described as Madison’s room, on the second floor but easy to climb, even with the bottle in my hand, thanks to a conveniently located balcony. </p><p>A few seconds of moderate exertion, and I was standing on Madison’s balcony. I glanced inside and saw that Katie and Madison were there, but I had to hide when I noticed they weren’t alone. There was a third woman in the room. Well, not exactly in the room, she was standing at the doorway, obviously there to talk in passing. However, I was less interested in what was being said and more interested in the identity of her. She was tall, blond, and fit, and sported a pair of large tits that begged my fingers to disappear in them. Her clothing, a short and tight, but unfortunately opaque, negligee, was only partially useful in hiding her amazing body. </p><p>I watched her as she closed the door and disappeared, couldn’t help but feel disappointed that I didn’t have the opportunity to mess with her. Then, my gaze turned towards the other occupants of the room, more than enough to compensate for the loss of the stranger, though neither of them was dressed as enticing as her. Katie was wearing the familiar set of pajamas she had worn in her earlier visit, and Madison was wearing shorts and shirt, a bit too tight to be comfortable sleepwear, but doing wonders to show her figure. Even in a slumber party, she was vain about her looks. </p><p>I waited another minute to make sure the blond bombshell wasn’t about to visit them once more, then knocked the window softly. Both turned towards the window, Katie in expectation, Madison in surprise, showing that Katie followed my order and didn’t mention my visit. I gestured them to open the door, of which Madison reacted much quicker because Katie was busy watching her for her reaction. </p><p>“Stephen, what a surprise. What brought you here?” Madison said as her gaze traveled over me. I was glad that Katie was unable to see her expression, as with the suggestiveness she managed to pack in her gaze, even Katie would understand there was something else going on between us. Still, the suggestiveness wasn’t half-interesting as the challenge mixed in there. Defeated again in our last encounter, she was burning in a desire to prove that it was another fluke, that she was the superior one. A challenge I was more than happy to take every time. </p><p>“I was planning to visit Katie already, and when she texted me where she was, I decided to see you as well. It’s not a bother, is it?”</p><p>“No it’s not,” she said before turning towards Katie. “Though I will have a talk with someone about the rudeness of a guest before checking with the owner.” </p><p>“Good,” I said, raising the bottle that went unremarked until now. “I would have hated if my gift went to waste.” </p><p>“Is this what I think it is?” Madison said, while Katie looked at me, alarmed at the prospect. </p><p>“It probably is,” I answered. “Why don’t you be a good girl and bring us three glasses, so that you can make sure.” Madison left the room in a hurry, leaving us alone with Katie, who was busy glaring daggers. “You don’t approve,” I stated. </p><p>“I don’t, it’s illegal, not to mention very unhealthy.” </p><p>I sighed. “Come on Katie, don’t be a stick in the mud. You’re nineteen, you can drive, enlist, even marry, but a bit of cocktail is suddenly too much? It’s a stupid law and stupid laws deserve to be ignored.” </p><p>“Still, it’s unhealthy,” she repeated, but this time much quieter. </p><p>“Not much if you indulge only occasionally. And, it would be fun to mess with Madison when she is a bit wasted, right?” With that, she looked a bit thoughtful. At that point, I was betting on her friendly rivalry would be enough to convince her, not that it would work as she had hoped. I was sure Madison had drunk enough to know what I prepared was almost completely juice, making Katie the target of the tonight’s shenanigans. “Just make sure not to drink too much.” </p><p>Before she could answer, the door opened and Madison walked into the room, carrying three shot glasses, and one larger bottle, its intended purpose revealed by her next words. “Who is ready for some truth and dare?” </p><p>“Good choice,” I said before throwing a cushion on the floor, gesturing Katie to do the same. Madison passed the glasses to me before sitting herself, and I used the opportunity to fill the glasses with shots. “A bit of juice before starting,” I said, passing one glass each, the last with me. “Cheers.” </p><p>Madison drank her in a smooth motion just a second after me, while Katie looked at hers for a few more seconds before raising to her lips, her face scrunched as she sipped it, expecting it to taste horrible. “Hey, it’s not that bad,” she said. “I was expecting something bitter, listening all those people complaining about it.” </p><p>It was fortunate that she was distracted, because it gave me enough time to signal Madison to play along when she looked at me questioningly about the non-existent amount of alcohol in the mixture. She looked at me questioningly, and I subtly gestured towards Katie, once again banking on the rivalry between them. She looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded, just like Katie did a minute ago. </p><p>The female rivalry was such a useful concept. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was one of the rare days I didn’t have much to do, so I used the opportunity to get another couple hours of sleep, then decided to walk upstairs to get a quick breakfast. Still, there was something more important than my mind, what to do if I saw Nicole there. It wasn’t a desperate challenge, but more of an exercise of picking the best option from a list of interesting ones, ranging from torturing her in a feigned ignorance to bending her over on the kitchen table before slamming into her in a frenzy. </p><p>Unfortunately, I could see most of the options were out as soon as I stepped into the living room. It wasn’t that Nicole was absent, I could see her bustling in the kitchen. Unfortunately, Nancy had the idea of waking up early as well, and was currently sitting in front of the TV, her notebook open in front of her, her pencil dancing on the paper occasionally. “Morning, Stephen,” she said in a chipper tone. </p><p>“Morning to you as well,” I answered, but my attention was on Nicole, who turned towards us in a sudden move. Thankfully, Nancy was looking towards me so she missed it, as Nicole’s expression shouted about our secret, impossible to miss. “Why are you so chipper this morning,” I asked in an attempt to keep her gaze on me until Nicole managed to calm down a bit. </p><p>“Come on Stephen, I’m always a pleasant person,” she said. I sent her a deadpan expression that expressed my differing opinion. It was the first time I had seen her before noon without an expression that screamed bloody murder with a possibility of torture. She chuckled. “Okay, maybe I’m a bit more cheerful than the usual,” she answered. “But I couldn’t help but feel excited, another publisher declared their interest to my book.” </p><p>At that moment, she sent a panicked glance towards Nicole, only to turn back a second later. Luckily, her own concerns about blowing the secret of previous rejection prevented her from examining Nicole. Secrets sure come handy. I stood there for a few minutes, listening to Nancy ramble about the great opportunities that the publisher created for her, before reminding her that I have yet the breakfast. </p><p>I moved to the kitchen, which happened to be a half-open style, which meant that I could see Nicole was watching me nervously as I closed in. Equally unfortunately, it meant that Nancy was in a prime location to see what was going on the kitchen, which meant I had to restrain myself. A difficult task when Nicole looked at me with the expression of a trapped doe that already accepted her fate, surrender radiating from her face. It was a good development, as I was afraid that things would develop in a different direction </p><p>“Good morning Nicole,” I said, each word underlined with a barely concealed excitement. Nancy, already back on her notebook, missed it. Nicole didn’t. Unfortunately for her, I was already at the door, cutting her escape route. Not that I would forcibly keep her there of course, but I learned about her enough that my presence was enough to dissuade from an attempt. And without forcibly breaking, she was deliciously trapped. </p><p>I walked towards her, and she took a reflexive step back. She might have taken another one if it wasn’t for the kitchen counter pressing against her bottom. I took one more step until we were face to face, and raised my hand like I was about to caress her cheek. I would have expected her to try to avoid my touch, but she surprised me by leaning forward to my fingers a bit, the shock on her face telling me that it was an unconscious reaction. </p><p>Even better, I thought as completed the motion by reaching the cupboard behind her and picked a bowl instead of deepening the touch. Then, I walked to the table, leaving her alone with a mixture of relief and disappointment, the result of the fight between her mind and her desires. She was coming along nicely. </p><p>She failed to move while I was preparing the cereal, except leaning forward slightly when I passed near her to pick the cereal, fearing and desiring my touch at the same time. But I took distinct care to stay away from her. Fondling her was always a pleasure, but it was curious what she was going to do if I neglected her obvious desires. </p><p>The answer was not much, much to my disappointment. She looked at me in a barely-disguised disappointment when I sat down on the kitchen table, then started walking around l, doing her chores. I thought that she lingered a bit too much whenever she leaned forward to do something, but even if her objective was to tempt me into action, it was hard for her to succeed in a pair of loose sweatpants. </p><p>I wondered whether my assumption about her actions was accurate or just my imagination as I finished my breakfast, not that it mattered much. As far as I was concerned, she had ample opportunity to leave the kitchen, putting herself away from my grasp, and I had no problem taking it as a tacit approval even if it was done unintentionally. </p><p>Conveniently, she was at the sink, rinsing a few pieces of cutlery when I finished my cereal. I walked behind her, careful not to make any noise that might alert her. I reached around her to put the bowl in the sink, but the real action was my shaft, already erect in anticipation, pressing against her bottom. A shocked yelp escaped her mouth. </p><p>“Is everything okay, mom?” Nancy shouted from inside before Nicole could say anything. </p><p>“A plate slipped off my hand, no big deal,” Nicole answered while I turned to check whether Nancy was looking towards here. She wasn’t, busy with her writing instead. Not one to lose such an opportunity, I put my hands on her hips, my grip tight enough to prevent her from moving as I pushed my shaft between her asscheeks, unfortunate that both of us were dressed. “Stephen!” she whispered, a barely audible voice that she managed to fill with fear and arousal. </p><p>Instead of answering, I chose to linger at the exact same pose for a few more seconds before pulling back, quite reluctantly I might add. However, no matter how tempting was the idea of pulling her sweatpants and plunging deep into her core, enveloping my shaft with the warmth that I had been acquainted deeply last night, it wasn’t worth risking with Nancy in the next room. Yes, she was distracted with her writing, but it wasn’t very likely that the distraction would be enough to make her miss what was going on. Still, the idea of Nicole bent over the kitchen counter, desperately trying to keep her voice low, was a tempting image. I shelved the idea and pulled back, leaving a frozen Nicole behind. </p><p>I stood in front of Nancy on my way back. “Do you have anything to do later today?” I asked, my voice low. </p><p>“No, why?” she asked, but the way she blushed suggested that she had an idea for what I was going to summon her. </p><p>“I was thinking of having another shoot,” I added, then smirked. “I was thinking nurse.” I chuckled against her sudden blush before continuing my walk, intending to set up perfectly before Nancy arrived. </p><p>It took around half an hour to prepare the set, so I spent rest of my time perfecting the photos I took in Nicole’s session, each photo reminding me the ‘interrogation’ scene that followed it, especially the ones with the ripped costume. I was debating the merits of going upstairs and forcing Nicole into the bathroom, when my door opened following a short knock. “Hi Nancy,” I said, looking at the redhaired girl that tiptoed down the stairs. </p><p>“Sorry that I’m late,” she said. “But unfortunately, mom was doing chores around, so I wasn’t able to walk in without being noticed. The last thing we need is my mom catching me modeling. She is a real prude. Can you imagine the disaster that would follow?” </p><p>“Definitely,” I answered, but my mind already on the image of two of them, dressed in thematic outfits, maybe warden and the prisoner, following my commands instantly. “Why don’t you go and change, the costume is already behind the screen,” I said, then spent the small break that took her to dress for imagining two of them together, following my orders as they cycled through the poses, each steamier than the last…</p><p>Then, Nancy took a step out the screen, pushing the imaginary thoughts out of my mind. Not that it was surprising, dressed in a nurse costume, she was simply exquisite. Of course, if she had worn that in an actual hospital, I doubted the doctors would be able to do any work, not surprising considering the costume had used only half of the fabric that was required for a full set, and as a consequence, it barely went an inch below where her ass ended even when she was standing completely straight, and the small slit on her left side only enhanced impact even more, showing the edge of her panties, naturally white, but definitely not boring, cut adventurously and consisting of more lace than actual fabric. The top wasn't shaped too differently. Since it was hard to keep it low generally, the designer had chosen to compensate putting a cleavage that dipped low on her chest, enough to put an enticing display despite still closed buttons. An even deeper cleavage was on her back, revealing her fit body. The mask, white with black embroilment, completed the view with the assistance of a pair of stilettos. </p><p>A whistle of appreciation left my lips before my brain could properly engage, but thankfully, it made Nancy's lips curl in amusement, owing to the fact that it was the second session, and she was starting to feel confident. The same mistake would have ruined my plan a day ago. “Are you ready?” I asked, which made her take a standard pose before nodding.</p><p>First few minutes passed predictably, where she followed my directions through a range of standard poses. With two shots completed, I had a good idea how the rest needed to be, and could have called it enough and filled my business obligations. </p><p>However, I decided to take an alternative path and stretch it with a lot of unnecessary poses, most unpublishable in any kind of commercial aim if my plans held true. After all, I had access that was nonnegotiable only until the costumes were complete, and I wanted to use them to a maximum effect. More she got used to working under the flashes, easier time I would have to convince her to a second shot.  </p><p>Still, it seemed that the day was full of surprises, as Nancy sent me a mischievous smirk, clear even through the half-mask that kept her expression veiled. Then, she turned her back and bent over, her short dress riding upwards, giving me a flash of her bottom. It lasted only for a second, but it was enough for me to burn the scene to the sensor of my camera alongside my memory. “Nice instincts,” I praised her the same way I praised Nicole, though in this case, it wasn’t entirely earnest. She was an extremely beautiful woman, but she lacked the instinctual presence Nicole had. </p><p>Not that it prevented me to press the shutter button quick enough to risk breaking it when she replicated the earlier pose, this time facing towards me, acquainting me with the deep valley between her breasts, all while she continued to smile mischievously. I had interacted with women enough to know she was enjoying the perceived power she had over me, so I acted appropriately aroused, and intimidated just a touch. Outgoing women like Nancy liked the idea of perceived power over men through feminine means, but it was a delicate balance. A dash too much fear, and they would lose interest faster than a mayfly. </p><p>I did my best to keep myself from overreacting, which, at times, had been a laborious challenge, such as the time when she reached to the buttons that were keeping her cleavage modest -for a very liberal definition of modest- and flipped them open without a concern. However, it turned out that, under the heat of the moment, she had underestimated the full extent of the cleavage under different conditions. There wasn’t any issue when she was standing. It was still revealing enough to cause chain accidents of course, but Nancy expected it to happen, so she was able to meet it with a confident smile. </p><p>For things that were going to happen when she bent over, she was less ready. She tilted forward in an attempt to replicate her earlier pose, but this time, she moved too fast, forgetting that the bra she was wearing underneath was thinner than paper, weak enough to unable to contain her breasts without the support of her tight costume. I stopped clicking, instead of enjoying the sight, not sure which part was better, the view of her spectacular breasts, or the expression of utter panic and loss as her confident facade crumbled all by itself. </p><p>It was not that I hadn’t wanted to immortalize the view as she bustled helplessly, but I had a feeling playing the gentleman would yield benefits much better than the dubious benefit of a few photos, no matter how amusing it would be to have her total freak-out in the record. So, I just watched as she managed to break her shock and turned her back, furiously imprisoning her breasts behind their white prison. “Ready to continue?” I asked after giving her a few seconds to gather herself. </p><p>The answer came in a trembling whisper that required a small miracle to be heard. “Yes,” she said, impressive just how many trembles she could squeeze in a one-syllable-word. We continued the shoot, but mortified by the accident, she was little better than a robot. Thankfully, I already had all that I needed, because the new photos were completely unusable. </p><p>“That’s enough for today,” I said a couple of minutes, calling the event over. “You were amazing as always, Nancy. You cannot believe just how many of the models would allow me to finish in just one session.” It was a compliment that actually happened to be true, though it said more about the lives of some of the amateur models I had worked with, half of them hangover from the last party, the other half acting like divas in an attempt to feel important in the last couple of years they mattered before their beauty faded. </p><p>“Was it good,” she asked even as she removed her mask, her bluster back, but an overdone fake to hide her ashamed expression. </p><p>I thought about acting like I hadn’t noticed the difference, but then, a more interesting idea popped into my mind. “Why don’t you go and change? We had good progress today, but I think you prefer to rest a bit? There is no shame feeling mortified with your first wardrobe accident,” I said, pushing a careful hint of condescension into my voice. Not too much, which would only make her angry at me, but just a dash, which would make her doubt herself. Something fun awaited me if she reacted the way I expected. </p><p>“No need,” she said loudly, waving her hands to underline her statement. “It was nothing. I can handle whatever is next!” </p><p>With a statement like this, I couldn’t help but push her more. “Are you sure? The next one is a tough one, maybe it would be better if we take it tomorrow.” </p><p>“I can handle whatever you can give,” she replied, pushing her chest forward in a proud manner, but it only helped to accentuate her cleavage. </p><p>If that wasn’t a challenge, I didn’t know what it was. “If that’s what you wish, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Those words were enough for her smile to lose its luster, but it was too late to pull back, especially after the challenge she just declared, so she nodded resolutely. “Go and change, I’ll pass you the next costume from the top.” Another small detail that would make it harder for her to change her mind, making her commit to the action by undressing, so she would feel obliged to finish. </p><p>She walked behind while I walked toward the case that kept some of the old clothes in. I had a costume that was interesting, but it required a last-minute substitution to generate impression I wanted. She said she would be able to handle anything I could give, and I intended to test it. </p><p>A brief rumbling later, I pulled a thin black bra, my fingers clearly visible from the other side. A few seconds more, and I was holding matching panties, equally transparent other than a thicker part to cover her entrance. With them in hand, I moved to the costumes, and picked the librarian outfit, minus the bulky underwear that came with it, though I still picked the garter belt and stockings, a sinister smirk on my lips as I did so. And there was a good reason the costume came with thick underwear, the skirt was short enough to be classified as a belt. The shirt was large enough to cover her top, but wasn’t exactly help since it was distinctly transparent, not the kind that was slightly see-through under the perfect conditions, but the kind that made one doubt whether she was wearing a shirt in the first place. The black heeled shoes and thick-framed glasses that came with the package was the perfect way to finish the set. </p><p>“What’s this!” she said with a strangled voice a second after I passed the clothes to her. “I might as well go naked.” </p><p>Imagining her naked under a constant barrage of flashes was an enticing dream, but unfortunately, one I didn’t have any time to waste for. I decided to answer her with one of the most annoying four-word combinations in the English language. “I told you so,” I said, then continued after a small pause. “We can delay or cancel it if you think you can’t handle it. I’m sure the client will be understanding.” Kind and understanding words, the absolute opposite of the approach I had for Nicole, but I had a handle of Nancy’s personality enough to know that was the right choice. </p><p>A moment passed in silence, but not enough to make me doubt that maybe I was wrong on my assessment. “Wait a minute,” she replied. “I didn’t say I can’t handle it, I was just surprised after the last one.” </p><p>“It’s your choice,” I said before walking back to my camera, put a new memory card, and replaced the battery as well. My instincts were telling me that they might come in handy. Less than a minute later, I heard the footsteps from the side of the room that I set up the screen. The temptress that stepped out was exquisite, justifying all efforts I spent wearing her down. With each step, her tits tumbled interestingly despite one of her arm pressing on them in a vain attempt to hide them from my view. In vain, because sooner or later, she had to remove her arm, and delaying it only made it more torturous for her, and more enticing for me. </p><p>“You look enchanting,” I said with complete honesty. She actually did, black frames of the glasses contrasted perfectly with her flaming red hair, and added a mature flair, as much maturity she could display with most of her body free for my view. Her legs went for miles for my viewing pleasure, and her hand-width skirt did nothing to reduce their view, too busy trying to cover her bottom. Even at that task, it failed, occasionally riding up enough to show a hint of her ass. Well, technically the garter belt and the stockings hid quite a bit from the view, but it only enhanced her sexiness more. </p><p>It was difficult, to suppress the desire to throw down my camera, walk towards her, and bend her over the nearest table. She was the culmination of every librarian fantasy I had when I was younger. Unfortunately, I was aware that a premature attempt likely ended up in a kick on the ball. “Are you ready to start?” I asked her instead. She nodded, but the arm around her chest told that she wasn’t. She needed to get used to the way she was dressed, but words wouldn’t be very helpful on that. </p><p>The action would work better, I decided as I triggered the shutter once more, its distinctive click echoing in the silence of the room. She looked at me with the expression of a wounded dove, a beautiful look that failed to penetrate my lust-fueled heart. Helpless, she leaned forward in a few basic poses, though her arm was still on her chest, censoring the view. </p><p>It was as amusing as to watch her struggling to hide, made even more fun since she had no one else but her pride. I had given her three chances to exit, and she picked none of them even after seeing the clothes she was about to wear. “Ready to put your arm down,” I said. She nodded hesitantly, but the arm stayed where it was. “We can take the poses from behind if you would feel more comfortable,” I offered. This time, her nod was much more enthusiastic. </p><p>Her enthusiasm was shortsighted, I noted as she treated me her rear view. Distracted by the upcoming specter of displaying her breasts, she had forgotten the tininess of her micro-skirt. Her absentmindedness didn’t last long. “Now, lean in a bit,” I asked her, and she did so, only to freeze a second later in shock when the chilly breeze of the room hit her bottom, reminding her the deficient coverage her skirt provided. </p><p>I was surprised as well, but for a different reason. I could see the evidence of her arousal on her panties, drenched thick enough to make only opaque section transparent, treating me with the first view of her nether lips, puffed up invitingly. I took a few quick photos before she could even attempt to raise her hands to cover it. “Try to keep your arms relaxed,” I ordered, and she followed, showing me she had no idea what she was revealing, and I had no intention of informing her as well. “Perfect, now you can stand straight once more,” I said, barely holding myself from asking her to touch her toes, mostly because it was too early. I wouldn’t wait for a second if I believed she would follow it.</p><p>She cycled through a few simple poses, but even then, any move that pushed her skirt up slightest made the photo unusable for anything other than an erotic magazine without heavy editing. A dire concern, it was not, so I continued to ask her poses that would move her to skirt more than the slightest, each scene pushing my heartbeat up more and more. Still, on the back of my mind, I started to debate whether she an exhibitionist. She always dressed revealingly around the house, but I always assumed it to be more of a casual confidence, but the extreme arousal she displayed led me to question it.</p><p>Then, it was time to push her to the next level. </p><p>It wasn’t just that I wanted to see her breasts for a while, as the view of her ass was more enough to compensate, and her wetness was a true gift, making her panties even more revealing than the devious mind that designed it. Still, she was unaware just how revealing it was, which took quite a bit from the fun I felt. I wanted her to curse her pride with each flash, blaming herself for unnecessarily putting herself to this situation. “It’s time to face the music,” I called her, causing her to freeze in indecision once more. </p><p>This time, I let her think, curious whether she would fold or continue. A few seconds later, she turned, proving that her misguided pride was stronger than her modesty. Her breasts were as spectacular as I imagined, based on the loose shirts she wore around the house, and her rock hard nipples, pushing the fragile fabric forward made things even better. Still, her expression was even more interesting. The resignation was there, so was the pleasure, layered with guilt. She enjoyed it, but felt guilty about it as well. An interesting conundrum that left me very enthusiastic to exploit. “You’re a spectacular beauty, sweetheart, no need to feel self-conscious,” I said, knowing that it would make her even more self-conscious about her looks, but not enough to stop the shoot, not after she came all that way. “Now, why don’t you open a couple buttons then lean in to give a bit of cleavage.” </p><p>She followed that instantly, her shirt, even when combined with the bra, hid absolutely nothing, so there was no actual harm in popping open a couple of buttons. “Is this alright?” she asked, trying to sound casual, but unable to keep her voice from cracking. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I snapped a couple more photos. “But I wouldn’t say no for more.” </p><p>“How many?” she asked even as she brought her hands towards her chest. I could see them trembling slightly, but acted like I failed to notice it. </p><p>“As much as you can handle,” I answered, curious just how far she would go. For Nicole, or even Katie, I would have stopped a while back, afraid of pushing them too much too soon, but Nancy was different. She was moving under her own violation, driving full speed through the path I had created, picking up the speed with each request. </p><p>Her next move was a good example of it. She reached for her buttons, unlocked one, then looked deep into my eyes. I sent a smirk at her, wordlessly daring her to continue. She did exactly that, but I wasn’t able to prevent the surprise from infecting my expression when she continued with no sign of stopping, her movements quickening as my shock grew. Soon, the shirt dropped to the ground, leaving her bra as the only piece of clothing on her. “Is this enough?” she asked, her smile curling challengingly. I doubted that she could have displayed that courage without a mask, not that it detracted any from her sexiness.  </p><p>“It never is, but I don’t think my heart can handle more,” I answered in an appreciation that I didn’t have to fake. “Now, put one of your legs on the chair.” She did so, giving me the perfect view, nothing hidden from my view. “And that is the final one,” I called, ending the session. I wanted to push her more of course, but even her self-driven demeanor had limits, and there was no need to push her too much.</p><p>“Umm,” she murmured, her courage flailing now that the spell was broken. “Can I keep the costume?” </p><p>“Unfortunately, you can’t,” I answered, because I needed them for another shot with Nicole. Currently, they were simply too risque even with anything I could do on photoshop. Her expression fell, but I had an idea why she was asking for it. “However, you can keep the underwear if you want.” Her brightening expression told me that I was correct in my assumption. </p><p>“Anyway, I need to go out as well, so why don’t leave with me, you can always change back in your room.” I let out a relaxed sigh when she nodded approvingly for that as well. I wanted to be away when she realized just how revealing her panties had become, so that she could spend a lot of time worrying about it before our next talk. A quick visit behind the screen, and I passed her clothes back to her. </p><p>“Shall we?” I said, pointing her to stairs. She climbed, and I followed, availing myself the amazing view the angle generated… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The next day, I was idling in my office, killing time until Amelia’s arrival. Normally, she would have been in the office before nine, looking me with a smug admonishment, berating me for being late without saying a word. But after the last night, I wasn’t exactly surprised when I passed in front of her office, only to see the door firmly shut. I just smirked and went to my own office, satisfied in the knowledge that she had a class at eleven, meaning I would be able to catch her at lunch break before she could disappear. </p><p>We had a lot to talk about…  </p><p>But my daydreams about how to treat my dear adviser professor cut short with a soft, hesitant knock on the door. “Come in,” I called stiffly, planning to send whomever that dared to break my concentration. But that thoughts changed when the door opened, revealing the blushed face of a familiar figure from yesterday’s activities, though at that time I had trouble seeing her face, since it was buried between Megan’s legs. </p><p>I watched her, my eyes widening with interest. I was still unable to remember her name, but visually, I remembered her well enough, always sitting on the first row, diligently noting every word that left my mouth, and always preparing painstakingly-detailed papers, though she started to miss a few classes here and there during the last few weeks. </p><p>More importantly, during the class, she was always dressed in loose clothing that led me to think she had a rather shapeless body, though thanks to the view I stumbled against, I had learned that it wasn’t very accurate. Currently, she was wearing a long coat that went well past her knees. It was enough to arouse my suspicions even if she hadn’t looked panicked enough to faint. The weather was too nice to require an overcoat like that, and she wasn’t fashion-conscious enough to wear it as a part of the set. Also, even I could tell that it was an expensive piece, latest fashion to boot. Far too expensive to be owned by a scholarship student.  </p><p>“I hope I’m not interrupting, professor,” she murmured, her voice hitching halfway. “I know it’s your not your office hours, but I had a couple of questions about a paper we need to deliver today. May I steal a few minutes of your time for them?” Even as she said that, she stepped inside, closing the door behind her. </p><p>I fixed my gaze on her face, and she instantly started squirming, essentially shouting that she had an ulterior motive for her visit. The best thing would be to kindly inform her that I was too busy and send her away. Asking her to keep the door open would be another safe option, keeping me insulated from whatever plan Megan had hatched. </p><p>Not for a moment, I thought that my nerdy Latino student was here by her own violation. </p><p>But I was bored while waiting for Amelia to arrive, and I had a tendency to make unwise decisions when I was bored. “Sure,” I said cheerfully. “I always have a few minutes for one of my best students.” An expression of guilt passed over her face at my statement. Such innocence, I thought, considering whether I should just tell her that I was aware of she was trying to ambush me in behalf of Megan, and wouldn’t work. </p><p>But before I could say anything, her trembling fingers reached for the string that worked as a belt for her overcoat, her blush intensifying even further, showing just how reluctant she was about the move she was about to make. Still, she pulled it free despite her obvious unwillingness, revealing what she had underneath, and all my thoughts about calling off her ploy burned in flames. She was wearing a white skirt, which was barely long enough leave her choice of underwear as a mystery, and the fact that it was a pleat, threatening to float away with the slightest wind didn’t exactly help. Her legs went down for an impressive length, displaying her delicious olive colored skin for my viewing pleasure. </p><p>Her top wasn’t any better. It was a crop top with a matching white color, contrasting attractively with her darkish skin. Its fabric was too thin to hide what was lying underneath, and its excessive tightness hadn’t contributed much to the primary function of concealing what lay underneath, including a dark red bra, more lace than cloth, too thin to provide effective support, suggesting that the firmness of her breasts was all natural. From their excessive tightness, I was willing to bet that they belonged to Megan as well, commandeered for the sake of their ploy. </p><p>A soft whimper escaped her mouth as she pulled her arms out of the coat, though I acted like I hadn’t noticed it. She turned her back to me, and took a step towards the hanger, the slight movement enough for me to confirm that her panties were in matching color with her bra. She hanged her coat, but then, instead of turning back, she reached for its pocket, and pulled something black and pressed its button, before sliding it back to its pocket. She positioned her body to prevent me from seeing it, but forgot to factor the mirror for that.</p><p>I barely managed to keep myself from facepalming against her ineptitude. It was obvious that she had just engaged a voice recorder, and combined with her extremely revealing clothing, it didn’t take a genius to realize that she was trying to use the same trap Megan had attempted earlier, but with the intensity raised to eleven. It actually hurt my pride. Yes, I was trying to stay low-key, but just how much of an idiot they thought me, to fall for such an obvious trick. </p><p>“Please take a seat,” I said, not exactly bothering to hide my hungry gaze on her body. Compared to the evidence I had over them, a voice recording was practically useless even if she could bring it outside, and I wouldn’t let it happen in the first place. I decided to act passive, curious just how far she was going to go. </p><p>“Thanks, professor,” she whispered in a way that tried to be unashamedly sexy, but came across as scared instead. She took a few more steps, and lowered herself on the chair, though her hands stuck on the edge of her skirt, pulling it down hopelessly in an effort to keep herself covered, only to fail. The skirt simply didn’t have enough material to keep her hidden while sitting. She took a deep breath, which nicely enhanced her cleavage, and crossed her legs to hide her core, making the best of an impossible position. </p><p>“So, why are you here,” I asked, still trying to remember her name, but coming up blank. </p><p>“I was having some trouble with the latest paper that you have assigned,” she started. “With all the midterms and papers piling up, I don’t have the time to finish it. And I need the grade it will bring to maintain my scholarship.” </p><p>“I see, and you’re here to ask for some extra time,” I said, acting obvious, mainly to mess with her. She was having trouble even at the beginning of the script, which was barely above the script of a porn movie, and I was curious just how far she would be able to push it before fainting. </p><p>“Umm, I had something more permanent in mind,” she murmured, her gaze falling on the floor. “Maybe an …” she said, but rest of her words were an illegible mumble that was impossible to understand. </p><p>“Sorry,” I said, not even bothering to hide my smirk as I leaned back. “I wasn’t able to hear what you said next, can you repeat it, but louder.” </p><p>She raised her eyes, reminding me a rabbit that wanted nothing more than running away from the snake, but was overwhelmed by the shock. “I said… Maybe we could come to an arrangement.” </p><p>“I see,” I said, my smirk transforming into something different. It was still technically a smile, my lips stretching sideways to reveal my teeth, but there was certain darkness to it I had cultivated in the years in a job that included death as a daily struggle. Megan hadn’t had a chance, her eyes stuck like she was hypnotized. “Why don’t you go and lock the door, and we can talk about how inappropriate your suggestion was.” </p><p>Despite its phrasing, there was no doubt that it was an order, and she treated it as so, jumping to her feet, forgetting the way she dressed for a moment, her skirt floating to give me a perfect view of her slightly transparent panties, and more importantly, a distinct wet patch that suggested maybe it wasn’t just fear that kept her frozen helplessly. She locked the door. “Sit,” I ordered, and she walked back to her previous seat, but before she could take her earlier position, I tapped my table. “No, here.” </p><p>The invasion of shock on her face was made even more interesting by the fact that I could detect the undercurrents of arousal on the edges of her expression. Her mouth opened, but she was unable to utter a word under the weight of my gaze. She walked towards the table, silent other than her dragging steps, and stood in front of me, like a gift that was waiting to be unwrapped. I decided to thank Megan for her thoughtful gift. Not only she sent me her beautiful but weak-willed girlfriend, but she was kind enough to dress her in a way that removed any chance of her displaying an ounce of self-confidence, then made her propose an illegal scheme that would see her kicked out the school if she did so. They even created a recording of the event in their own violation. </p><p>“Sit,” I repeated, and she sat down. I leaned back, spending a minute to examine her body. The clock ticked, with her getting more and more uncomfortable with each passing second. Soon, she opened her mouth to say something, but I cut her before she could manage it. “Don’t speak unless I ask you a question,” I ordered. Her lips strewn shut with an audible click. I watched her for another minute before asking the first question. “What was your name again?” </p><p>The question was dismissive enough that even under her current condition, it made her expression flare in outrage, though it extinguished instantly under my gaze. “Camilla,” she murmured obediently. </p><p>“Camilla,” I repeated slowly, tasting the way it flew on my tongue. “Camilla, it’s too good of a  name for a cheating student who is too lazy to finish her homework, don’t you think?” </p><p>She started trembling. “Yes,” she murmured, her voice bringing the wind of unshed tears. </p><p>“Now, I could just walk out directly to the dean and explain your immoral proposal, and you would wave your scholarship goodbye before the nightfall.” </p><p>“Please-” she started, leaning forward in a panic, but I raised my hand warningly, and the rest of her sentence cut off ineffectually. </p><p>“Was that a question?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she whispered, ducking her head down. </p><p>I let the silence to stretch for a few seconds before continuing. “Still, you’re lucky that I’m not heartless enough to destroy your future because of one silly mistake.” A smile flickered, which I killed with my next words. “Of course, that doesn’t mean I’m going to let you go without punishment. After all, it’s my responsibility as your professor to teach you responsibility. Isn’t it so, Camilla?”</p><p>“Yes, professor,” she murmured, but I could see her head jerking towards her coat, where her recording device was hidden. She was clearly hoping that I was going to say something incriminating, which would end up in her victory. I couldn’t wait until smashing her pathetic plans, but before, I was going to have some fun.” </p><p>“Good girl,” I said, but let a bit of my desire to slip into my tone. She shivered. “Now, stand up,” I ordered. She did so. “Turn to the table, and put your hands on the desk, and lean forward.” This time, her movements were slower, acutely aware just how she was going to look with the deficient cover of her skirt strained even further, but she followed my direction nevertheless. Another whimper escaped her mouth when I put my hand on the small of her back, trailing down slowly, but its volume was nothing after I slapped her bottom, the portion still covered with her skirt, without a warning. A cry escaped her mouth. “Silent!” I ordered. </p><p>“Sorry,” she murmured. </p><p>I thought about increasing her punishment, because technically, it wasn’t a question, but I let it slide. Even with the current plan, it was a toss-up whether she would be able to resist without fainting. I spanked her other cheek, still targeting an area that was covered by her skirt. This time, only a soft whimper escaped her mouth. “Better,” I said, letting my hand trail upward once more, tracing her spine. Then, when I arrived where the strap of her bra lay, I pushed her on the table. </p><p>Her breath escaped explosively as her tits hit the table. She tried to stand up, but I kept my hand there, pinning her in place. Her struggle soon ceased, realizing she had no way of escaping, but she trembled in a way that tempted me to cut the chase, pull down her panties, and ram her mercilessly. </p><p>I managed to repress that desire, and instead, used my free hand to pull her skirt up, leaving her ass only with the deficient cover of her lacy panties, two red patches matching to the color of with where my hand landed. Another spank landed on her ass, this time my hand meeting with her naked skin, its crisp sound echoing in the room. Impressively, she managed to keep her voice to a whimper after that, and following two, but then, the fourth overwhelmed her, and a cry escaped her mouth, one she barely managed to muffle. </p><p>“Tch, tch. I thought I had ordered you to keep silent. It seems that even incapable of understanding even the simplest orders. It’s no wonder that you’re here, trying to whore yourself for homework.” I wasn’t able to see her face in our current position, but the redness of her neck suggested that it hit her even harder than I intended. Apparently, she was quite sensitive about her academic capabilities. “I better help you to keep silent.” </p><p>I hooked my finger on the edge of her panties, and started to pull down. “What are you-” she started, only to cut with another cry when I punished her for speaking out of turn with another spank. </p><p>“What did I tell you about speaking out of turn?” I asked. </p><p>“I shouldn’t do,” she answered with another desperate whimper, intensified by the fact that I had finished dragging down her panties down her legs, leaving her clean-shaved nether lips naked for my viewing pleasure. I bunched them into a ball, their dampness teasing my palm.</p><p>“Good,” I repeated even as I patted her ass gently. “Now, lift your feet.” She raised her feet one by one, allowing me to pull free her panties. I rose back, and slowly walked around the table until I was in front of her. I crouched until our eyes were in the same plane, enjoying the look of total surrender in their chocolate brown depths. “Now, open wide,” I said even as I brought the makeshift gag towards her mouth. </p><p>I could see one last spark of rebellion dancing in her eyes as she tried to reject my order, but it failed to survive for more than a second in the depths of the surrender she was experiencing. Her plump lips parted open, and I stuffed her mouth with the panties she was wearing just moments ago, stained with her own juices. </p><p>With that task complete, I walked around the table once more until I was facing her naked bottom, filled with darker patches. I resumed her punishment. First few, she managed to resist, but soon, her cries rose once more, muffled by her panties. “And that’s the last of them,” I said after a particularly hard one. She whimpered once more, carrying a message of relief. </p><p>But the final chapter was yet to commence. </p><p>I put my fingers on her bottom once more, and she flinched despite its gentleness, conditioned by the earlier rain of spanks. “Don’t worry,” I whispered, my voice equally soothing. “Your punishment is complete. And since you have been such a good girl, taking it without a complaint, you earned the right for a reward.” </p><p>Since she was unable to speak, I didn’t waste any time before sliding a finger inside her. She was sopping wet, and my finger moved forward with no resistance, until they come up with a barrier. It was a nice surprise, to find out my new toy was not only a socially constrained nerdy beauty, but a virgin as well. Would wonders ever cease? </p><p>I pulled my finger back, not wanting to break it before its time. I wanted her to beg helplessly before I took her virginity. Instead, I slid towards her knob, drawing irregular circles around, triggering another wave of muffled moans from her. It took just a few seconds before she started shuddering helplessly as a spectacular orgasm hit her much earlier than I had expected. I left her trembling on the table, though stopped for a moment to pull her panties from her mouth, and threw them into the bottom drawer. Then, I walked to the hanger and grabbed her coat. Pickpocketing her recording device on the way back was trivial. </p><p>“It’s time to go, my slutty nerd,” I said after I walked back to the table where she still lay, her bottom naked, still trying to throw the effects of her climax. “If you continue to lay like that, I won’t be responsible for the next thing I’m going to do.” Those words managed to cut through her haze, and she stood up despite her trembling legs. The mixture of shock, shame, and longing were delicious enough to tempt me to risk everything to thoroughly educate her, but I had other plans. Not to mention, she would be much more fun after processing what had happened, and what awaited her more. </p><p>Neither of us said anything as I held up her coat, allowing her to slip inside. Then I passed her a napkin, which she used to dry her tears. Luckily, she wasn’t wearing a lot of makeup. It was still apparent that she cried, but I didn’t fear for sending her out in that condition. Her nerdy personality would help there, with everyone assuming she cried because of a B- or something equally asinine. “See you later,” I said with a wide smirk after I unlocked the door, gesturing her to leave. She barely reacted to my comment, just walked away, secure in her knowledge that there wouldn’t be any repeat. </p><p>She would be, if she had bothered to glance back and noticed the presence of the voice recorder between my fingers.</p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>The surprise visit from Camilla worked quite well to distract me from the boredom as I waited for Amelia to leave her classroom. I didn’t want to miss her visit, so I picked up a bundle of quiz papers which we fought about yesterday, then hid on a corner with a prime view of her door, but otherwise obscure. </p><p>It was a good thing that I hid before Amelia could visit, because she appeared at the end of the corridor five minutes before the class supposed to end, walking towards her room in one of the most noticeable sneaking attempt I had seen. And distracted by her own hurry, she failed to check both sides, and consequently missing my approach. She opened the door and slipped inside, only to come face to face with me when she attempted to close the door. </p><p>The panic that bloomed on her face as we came face to face was beautiful. She tried to slam the door, but with her fingers weakened with the creeping panic, a careless press against the door was enough to stall the movement of the door for me to slip inside. The door slammed loudly, but only after I was inside. “Hi, Amelia,” I said cheerfully as her shock-ridden brain tried to process why I was still inside.</p><p>She stood silent for a moment, allowing me to examine her clothing. Jeans and a conservative blouse, downright boring compared to yesterday’s ensemble. “Hi, James,” she stammered before managing to pull herself together a bit. “I’m a bit busy, so if that’s not something urgent, maybe we can talk it later,” she added hurriedly. </p><p>“It’s about yesterday,” I said, doing my best to keep my expression neutral. </p><p>A moment, I thought that she was going to a total breakdown, but impressively, she managed to pull a facsimile of calmness after a deep breath. It wasn’t a very stable one, with numerous cracks visible, but it was impressive nonetheless. “Look, James,” she said, her voice impressively even. “It would be best if we forget about yesterday.” </p><p>“I don’t understand,” I said, trying to sound confused. “Yesterday, you were talking differently.” </p><p>“That was yesterday,” she said, feeling more confident after a lack of push from my side. </p><p>“I see,” I said, nodding resignedly, then raised the papers I was holding. “So, you don’t need the papers graded anymore?”</p><p>“Papers?” she said, dumbfounded, her lips parting slightly in confusion as she tried to reorient the discussion. </p><p>“Yes, papers,” I affirmed. “The ones you told me to grade urgently yesterday. What else I could be talking?” </p><p>“Of course, papers,” she repeated, nodding blankly. Keeping back a burst of laughter was difficult after seeing her uncomprehending stare on instead of her usual sharpness. Then, it clicked that I was ignoring the last night justs like she was asking me to, and she relaxed slightly. A critical mistake, but that, she was about to learn a bit later. “Can’t the paper wait until tomorrow. Or better, a few days?” </p><p>I pushed through her obvious attempt to earn time. “Clearly not, since you were very insistent about them yesterday. Let’s just sit down and finish them. It won’t take more than thirty minutes.” I smirked. “Unless you can’t handle working together, of course?” </p><p>The dig to her pride worked just as good as I hoped. “Of course I can,” she said, gesturing for her desk, inviting me to sit down. With that, we started working. At first, the atmosphere was almost normal, which was an achievement considering the unspoken weight of last night, enough to make me think that we could have kept our relationship purely professional.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of doing so. I started with random touches that could be mistaken as accidental. A caress here, a lingering touch there… It worked even better than I would have thought, her blush intensifying with each touch, and causing her to lose track of her words for more than once. The effect was even more pronounced when I started slipping innocent innuendos, which left her stammering in panic. </p><p>“I need to go,” she murmured barely ten minutes later, making a show of checking her phone. “I have something urgent to do.” </p><p>“If that’s an emergency,” I said. I stood up, and caught up with her just as she was trying to reach the doorknob. The temptation was too strong to do anything other than replicating the exact scene from yesterday. I pressed my hand on her back, forcing her against the door. </p><p>“James, what are you doing!” she exclaimed, though her shout would have been more effective if she hadn’t pushed her ass towards me, meeting my crotch halfway. It was clear that I wasn’t the only one that longed for a repeat. </p><p>“You’re a smart girl, my dear Amelia. What do you think I’m doing?” I said even as my hands slid under her blouse, caressing her flat belly, enjoying her shivers. </p><p>“You can’t…” she murmured. “Not here…” she added, barely audible. </p><p>“You know the drill, sweetheart,” I added. “Just like last night. Tell me no, and I go away. Stay silent, and I show you a pleasure you never experienced before.” </p><p>I realized that I overreached just as the words left my mouth. It was too forceful, enough to cut through the spell that captured Amelia. A glance to her face just confirmed it. I was loosening my hold in anticipation of her negative response, when we were interrupted by a knock on the door. “Amelia, please, can we talk,” said the familiar yet annoying voice of Amelia’s boyfriend. </p><p>“Fuck off, Henry, we’re through!” Amelia exclaimed, confirming his status as an ex-boyfriend, not that it was surprising after he left her in the hands of gang members, and only my fortunate presence saved her from a bad end. </p><p>“Please, Amelia, just give me one last chance,” he begged. “Let me explain.” I smirked at the lucky turn, letting my hands wander freely over Amelia’s body, and her only response was to push her hips harder against my crotch, moving cyclically. </p><p>Revenge was an interesting motivator. Here she was, about to reject my advances, but the presence of her boyfriend reminded her that she wanted payback above and beyond just dumping him. And fucking like rabbits on the other side of the door while he pathetically pleaded on the other side of the door worked wonders as revenge. Which was why she put no resistance as I slid her blouse upwards, too busy unbuttoning her jeans. </p><p>I pulled her bra to the side, leaving her breasts, which carried the marks of my aggressive mauling, naked for my attention. “Fuck off, Henry,” she exclaimed after her boyfriend claimed that his desertion wasn’t such a big deal. “It was pure luck that I managed to get away,” she continued even as she pushed her jeans down, allowing my fingers to trace over her panties. </p><p>“Damn, you’re wet,” I murmured, enjoying the sensation. </p><p>“Shush,” she said to me, but her expression was replaced with alarm as I squeezed her breasts hard, pushing a display of panic to her face. “I’m going to tell you once more, Henry. You either go away, or I call security for harassment, and we will see how fast your bank would drop you after such a scandal.” </p><p>Henry hadn’t answered, but his footsteps were audible enough as he disappeared away, leaving his ex-girlfriend to my mercy… </p>",

    "content": "Sarah was sitting on her living room, cycling between two messages she received a few minutes apart. <p>Earlier in the day, she had achieved a small miracle, managing to slip through the front door without getting caught. Neither a neighbor nor her husband saw her as she left Erik’s car and dashed inside, half-naked. Annoyingly, the former was even more important. She could have explained her lack of clothing to her husband as an attempt to seduce him, and it would work swimmingly as long as he hadn’t noticed that she came from outside, or why her makeup was disturbed and her lips were stained with a white sheen. However, there was no real way to explain why she was getting out of an unfamiliar car, wearing nothing but a skirt to a neighbor. </p><p>After her stressed afternoon, she decided that had deserved a treat. She drew himself a bath, opened a good bottle of wine, and started consuming it in the grasp of the bubbles after a shower to get rid of the stains. It helped to calm her nerves after her latest ordeal. </p><p>She was out of the bath, laying on her bed, wearing a fluffy bathrobe while trying to finish the bottle of red when her phone buzzed twice. The first one was a familiar tone, informing her that the sender was her husband, so she ignored it. A communication blackout was the least he deserved after he had deserted her in the restaurant. She knew that she was being unfair, that he didn’t know the indignities she had suffered to make sure his business deal went without a hitch. But her knowledge was little help soothing her anger.</p><p>She wouldn’t have opened the phone if her phone hadn’t rung in another familiar tone. It was from Megan, Thomas’ younger daughter from his first marriage. She reluctantly reached her phone. Megan, unlike Kelly, was very supportive of her marriage, so she did her best to be accommodating to her whenever she needed something. If only she wasn’t that needy, Sarah thought with a sigh, but she felt a stab of guilt in her heart in the same instant. She knew that Megan wasn’t trying to abuse her goodwill, but more often than not, she had found herself in a compromising position. All because of her gullibility. </p><p>Sarah knew that Megan wasn’t stupid. Academically, she excelled enough to get a major scholarship, and she continued to shine in college. But she had a very innocent way of looking at people, easily believing whatever bullshit they were spewing. Sarah had lost the track of how many times she needed to give her a bit of extra allowance because Megan gave all she had to a ‘friend in need’, not to mention endless shopping trips to replenish items that her friends had ‘borrowed’, a category that mainly consisted clothing, but also included a few electronic gadgets, and a laptop. </p><p>Sarah jumped up to her feet in panic as soon as she read the message Megan had sent, informing Sarah that a few of her sorority friends had invited her to the Butterfly club, and asking her whether she would have wanted to join them. “Fuck,” Sarah murmured even as she typed a positive answer, then dashing towards the hair dryer. </p><p>Megan’s destination was the reason for her panic. The Butterfly Club was one of the most exclusive locations in the city, though it was almost impossible to gain admission unless you were a movie star or a rich man that wouldn’t bother to pay a mid-range five-figure tab for a night’s entertainment. But that was the case for men. </p><p>For women, admission criteria were different, though not necessarily easier. A pleasant face and an amazing body was a start, but they also required an informal referral from one of the regulars. Sarah had gone there once with the insistence of her friends, but she felt uncomfortable with the unspoken expectations of her friends, who had already integrated themselves with some of the old but obviously rich guys. Sarah had decided to beat an early night, which ensured that there was no repeat invite. </p><p>Sarah was alarmed, because Megan was too gullible to extract herself from the situation before the danger was present and clear, and at that point, it would be too late. The men there were too experienced in converting starry-eyed girls into their playthings. She wished it would be possible to convince Megan not to go, but she could easily imagine her saying that she trusted her friends, and she could handle herself. If she was there, she could pull her away before things collapsed into a disaster. </p><p>With her hair dried, she stood in front of her wardrobe, looking for an appropriate dressing. She had a clear idea about what appropriate meant in there. A dress tight enough to look like painted, and with a deep enough cleavage to show the absence of a bra. Like the silver dress she had worn yesterday, which pushed her into the disaster she was facing. </p><p>After a quick search, she had decided on a light blue dress. It was tight, though not as much as the silver one. It was almost conservative on the chest area, though it compensated for it by the deep cleavage that went deep in her back, stopping at the level where her panties began. It was still tight enough to not to allow a bra, and the only panties she was able to wear were thin string ones that, for any practical purpose, was non-existent. A pair of heeled shoes, fragile enough to look like it was about to snap, completed the ensemble. She would have preferred to dress more conservatively, but that would just result in her being turned away at the entrance. </p><p>With the question of attire solved, she sent a message to Thomas, informing him that she was going out with Megan to keep her safe, something he wholeheartedly agreed, as he was also aware of her daughter’s issues with people’s motivations. Though Sarah chose not to mention that they were going to the Butterfly Club, knowing he would try to forbid Megan from going there, which would trigger an unnecessary fight that would end with her going there, but angrier. Wolves there would smell her vulnerability from a mile away. </p><p>She called for a cab while picking a long coat that would hide her dress. The last thing she needed was neighborhood gossip about her nightlife, though fending the eyes of the driver was almost as important. The taxi pulled in front of the house a few minutes later, and she stepped inside. “Butterfly Club,” she murmured, trying to ignore the sudden gleam in driver’s eyes at the mention of her destination. But the sudden hunger in his gaze as he tried to penetrate her coat, was just another condemnation of the club. Sarah could only imagine the amount of flesh he had seen. </p><p>Sarah appreciated the fact that the driver hadn’t tried to chat her up, and gave him a generous tip before getting out, her arms around the skirt of her coat to prevent a last-minute slip, much to the driver’s annoyance. She waited a few minutes, watching as richly dressed men, with scantily-clad girls in their arms, got out of their expensive cars, slipping inside the club door. Occasionally, their gaze fell on her, making her skin crawl. Her instincts shouted her to turn back, that nothing good awaited her inside, but she stayed for Megan’s sake. She couldn’t allow her to walk inside alone. </p><p>After a few minutes of wait, another taxi pulled at the entrance, and four young women in various states of undress stepped out, only one of them familiar. “Megan,” she called as she walked over them. She was glad that Megan had the idea of dressing conservatively, or at least, conservative in comparison by the other dresses. She wore a tight jean that looked tight enough to be painted in, a g-string peeking at her back as she leaned forward, and a shirt that left her stomach bare. Combined with her soft makeup, she was barely noticeable with her friends, whose clothes covered less than average swimsuits. </p><p>“Sarah,” Megan exclaimed happily in response. “I’m so glad you can make it.” They hugged, and Sarah used the opportunity to examine her friends, each of them looking sluttier than the last, making her glad that she had come here. “Let me introduce my friends…” Megan introduced them, but Sarah ignored to learn anything other than their names. There was no need. The club would be too loud to talk, and Sarah had no intention extent her presence other than the amount that was strictly necessary to extract Megan. </p><p>“Let’s go inside,” called one of the girls. “It’s chilly outside.” </p><p>Sarah wanted to say that the weather was quite normal for anyone that went outside with something that wouldn’t be mistaken for underwear, but that would have been unproductive, so she stayed silent. They walked at the entrance where two impressively-sized bodyguards were standing guard. </p><p>“Hi, Kevin,” giggled two of the girls simultaneously. </p><p>“Hello girls,” the guy answered in a casual manner. “Another night of partying?” </p><p>“You know it,” one of them answered as she stepped forward without prompt, her arms open. He started patting her body, stretching it longer than what was necessary for a search, not that she could hide anything underneath it. Meanwhile, the other bodyguard started searching for one of the other girls, but he was much more professional. Sarah knew whose hands she preferred to feel on her. </p><p>The girls finished being searched one by one, disappearing through the ornate door. But her plans hadn’t worked as well as she had hoped, because the first bodyguard was significantly slower to finish his search, leaving only her and Megan in the queue as he finished the first girl. She could have walked to professional one, but it would leave Megan in the hands of the other, and she lacked the assertiveness to force him to stop. So, reluctantly, without saying anything, she stepped towards the sleazy one, who was watching her close in with a hungry gaze in his eyes. </p><p>He put his hands on her body, caressing her stomach softly, though thankfully over her coat, but his hands moved much slower than it was necessary. Meanwhile, Megan’s pat-down finished and she went inside, leaving Sarah alone. “What’s your name, sweetie,” he asked in a tone that made her skin crawl. </p><p>“None of your business,” Sarah lashed out before she could consider just how ill-advised it was. Something she considered immediately after under the angry glare of the bouncer.</p><p>“It seems that you don’t want to enter the club,” he said with an angry smirk as he pulled back, taking a step to close the entrance. “Go away.” </p><p>“But…” Sarah murmured, once again cursing her impulsiveness. “I need to go inside, my friends will wonder-” she continued until the bouncer cut her off. </p><p>“They will do nothing,” he said with a matter of fact tone. “Those sluts are busy looking for a sugar daddy to pay for their latest toy, and I doubt they will leave it just because one of their friends had a bigger tongue than her brain.” </p><p>“But, I need to be inside,” Sarah moaned desperately. </p><p>“You should have thought that before trying to treat a working man like garbage while preparing to suck the cock of the rich guys for shiny trinkets.” </p><p>“You don’t understand,” Sarah said, putting her arms over his biceps. “I’m not here for finding a sugar daddy.” </p><p>“Yes,” he deadpanned. “You’re here to study for the finals.” </p><p>“No, I’m just here to take care of my … friend,” she said, deciding to say stepdaughter at the last second, deciding to keep it simple. </p><p>“That’s definitely more believable,” he answered with a flat tone. “Go away sweetheart, before I decide to ban you from the club permanently.” </p><p>Sarah tightened her hold around his arms, her fingers sinking in his shapely biceps. “Please,” she repeated, letting her desperation free. “I need to go there to take care of her. Please.” </p><p>He looked into her eyes for a couple of seconds before letting out a small laugh. “Holy hell, you’re telling the truth. You’re here to take care of your friend.” He stalled for a second. “Let me guess, the ditsy blond who barely managed to fit her tits into her dress, right?” Sarah nodded, failing to comment on the insulting way he referred to her stepdaughter. “Okay, I’ll let you inside,” he said, and a smile popped on her face. “But you need to show me just how committed you are,” he added, and her smile died just as quick. He turned to his friend. “I’m going inside for a more thorough search,” he said to his partner, who just sighed after sending a pitying look at Sarah.</p><p>Before she could answer, she felt his fingers wrapping around her wrist, pulling her in tow as he walked through the entrance, and she found herself in a dark corridor, tastefully decorated with silver and white furniture. Unfortunately, Megan and the rest of the girls were already gone forward, depriving Sarah of the last excuse she could use to save herself from the arms of the brute. She could have just turned back and left, but then, she would have to explain to Thomas why she had let Megan went into such a dangerous place alone. So, she allowed the bouncer to drag her to a door hidden behind a particularly bulky piece of decor. </p><p>She found herself in a small room, barely larger than a wardrobe, containing nothing but a hanger and a chair. “Let’s search you more thoroughly,” he said, an ugly smirk coloring his otherwise handsome face. “Since you are here to protect your friend, maybe you decided to smuggle a weapon was a good idea.” </p><p>Sarah knew that was next, so she didn’t bother to react when he leaned towards her, his hands landing on her stomach once more before aggressively climbing up, groping her tits, barely bothering to dress it up as a search. He looked at her, egging her to say anything, but she kept silent, knowing that there was nothing she could say that would make things better. </p><p>“Remove the coat,” he asked, and she reached for her buttons, struggling against her reluctance to remove them. Only time her indignities in the hands of her husband’s nemesis, she realized, as, before that, she would be trembling helplessly in such a situation. After deepthroating a stranger behind the couch her husband was sitting, the situation wasn’t as oppressive anymore. </p><p>She put her coat on the hanger and turned back, trying to ignore his catcall. It was hard to ignore that, though not as hard as ignoring his hands, which started exploring her body, not bothering to give the slightest pretense of search, sinking into her tits, the thin layer of her dress only thing to separate her flesh from his disgusting touch. For a moment, she feared that he was about to pull down her dress, but he let his hands roam on her body once more, trailing her spine, which left her insides tingling despite her best effort. </p><p>Her breath quickened as his hands landed on her bottom and squeezed hard. But, surprised with the reaction of her body, she failed to react when his fingers hooked around her panties. “Wait-” she exclaimed, but it was too late, as her panties already around her knees. </p><p>“Just lift your feet, and the search is over,” he said calmly, like he didn’t just dislodge the only piece of underwear she was wearing. She just sighed, knowing she wasn’t in a position to argue, and lifted her feet one by one, allowing him to free her panties. “Naughty,” he said, examining them for a few seconds. He lowered it, and she opened her hand. Instead of giving them back, he slid them in his pocket. “You can go now,” he said, his expression insufferably smug.</p><p>“But-” she tried to argue, only for him to cut. </p><p>“You didn’t think I would allow you to get away scot-free after your disrespect, right? You’re lucky that I’m keeping it limited. That’s the deal, take it or leave it.” She looked at his eyes for a few seconds before lowering it helplessly. “Good girl,” he said, then opened the door and left, leaving her alone, with a conspicuous absence of her panties… </p>",

    "content": "Lady luck seemed to compensate for the treacherous turn she had taken during the heist, which left me scrambling for my life. <p>The reason for my thoughts, the material I had found in the secret compartment I had looted in Megan’s room. I had been expecting it to be something related to their sorority. But the initiation videos for the last twenty years was a treasure that was above and beyond even my deepest expectations. The videos depicted an impressive number of rich girls from wealthy backgrounds, going through a range of humiliating and sexually degrading tasks, all safely enclosed in a digital recording. Technically, the videos were encrypted, but the year of initiation and the sorority name, separated by a dot wasn’t exactly the safest password. Nor a plain text file on Nancy’s computer was the best place to hide the password. </p><p>Even a cursory browsing was enough to reveal them as a true treasure drove. I was able to recognize a few minor celebrities, along with several wives of local heavy-hitter politicians. I couldn’t help but curse my luck. Just a few of those videos would be enough to elevate me through the ranks after a careful blackmail routine. But now, I lacked the background to use it to its full extent.  </p><p>I sighed. There was no point losing time imagining what could have happened. Especially since, even without my network, I could still leverage those videos for a decent payday. A few hundred grand, or even a million if I was lucky. A tidy addition for my retirement fund, which would go a long way to compensate for the payday I just lost. </p><p>I stood up, and stretched to relax my numbing limbs. I had been sitting in front of the computer since for a while, and my desk wasn’t exactly the most comfortable one. I needed a drink. I glanced to my liqueur cabinet, considering the merits of a stiff double, but decided otherwise. After spending hours in front of the computer, I wanted to immerse myself in the crowd.  </p><p>I decided to call a taxi instead of driving, partially because I hated the bucket of rust I bought to keep a low profile, partially because of the old habits. It would have surprised the citizens, but the mafia respected the casual laws like drunk driving much more than ordinary people. We didn’t drive drunk, we didn’t have pointless loud parties in our homes, and most importantly, we always paid our taxes. All to make sure the police had no probable cause poking around our property. That’s how the law caught us. It was funny, but tax evasion was much easier to prove than a well-planned murder.  </p><p>I chose a rundown bar that had a tendency to play the louder end of the classics,  mostly thrash metal with a smattering of power mixed, though their impressive selection of bourbon was equally important. Decorated with sparse lights and bulky furniture, it was a perfect location to skulk in a corner and indulge in a few drinks. </p><p>The first glance into the place showed me that I had made a good choice. It wasn’t crowded, just a bunch of young men, barely out of the cusp of teenagerhood, were playing pool on one corner while wearing matching colors. Likely gang members. A smattering of other people was spread through the bar, enough to fill the background with a comforting white noise without making it annoying. For a moment, I hoped that I was going to have an unremarkable evening, an opinion that I conservatively revised when I saw two familiar figure entering the bar just a few minutes later. My dear professor Amelia, and her annoying fake-biker boyfriend, Henry. </p><p>I hunched my back a bit, trying to avoid being seen. The last thing I needed was for them to notice me. They were annoying, though each in their own way. She would try to ask about the papers in a weak attempt to impose her authority, and he would do his best to convince he was the alpha male, yapping like a small dog with an attitude problem. I had no desire to ruin my mood by listening to their bullshit, even though Amelia had managed to dress in a way that managed to arouse my interest. Gone was the librarian look with sharp business clothes and glasses, replaced by a loose miniskirt that looked about to fell off in a stiff wind, and a crop-top with a deep cleavage while leaving her stomach bare. Combined with her short stature, she was a quintessential biker-chick. Apparently, my dear adviser had some hidden depths, and some treasures she carefully kept hidden… </p><p>They took a seat at the opposite side of the bar, close to the pool table since people tended to sit away from the gang members that was obvious in their allegiance, but of course, mister fake biker was too tough to be intimidated by a bunch of boys. From the interested looks the gang members throwing towards Amelia’s side, I could see a disaster breeding, but I kept myself from involving. Maybe he would learn his limits after a good beating, however unlikely. </p><p>My prediction turned real soon after. One of the gang members threw a few random statements towards them to test their response. Henry studiously ignored the words despite the glare from Amelia, who was clearly expecting more from her ‘tough’ boyfriend. Her silent shaming worked. Under her angry glare, Henry chose to reply with a less-than-flattering comment, his slurring showing that he had indulged in more drinks than it was recommended. </p><p>From there, it rolled out predictably. A minute of verbal argument, followed by a few punches that sent Henry down hard. The pain had cut through the alcohol-induced bravery, and he scampered out of the bar when the boy reached to his pocket and pulled a knife. </p><p>It would have been amusing to watch him run away with his tail between his leg, if he hadn’t forgotten he wasn’t alone. Amelia stayed behind, caught flatfooted by the sudden burst of violence, frozen stiff. Still, I wouldn’t have cared if I hadn’t caught the look of the boy that floored Henry with a punch. Youth, the rush of adrenaline, and alcohol was an explosive combination, especially to a young gang member with friends to impress. And I could read his warped thoughts from the look he sent towards Amelia. </p><p>I sighed resignedly, but stood up and started to walk towards them without losing any time. I didn’t run, because any sudden movement would have escalated the situation before I was in a position to intervene. Letting things continue was an option, but it was one that I had no intention of taking. Yes, my relationship with her wasn’t the best, but a slight dislike was no reason to leave a woman fending against three boys with an overabundance of courage and entitlement, and not enough common sense. </p><p>“Look at it boys,” said the one with the knife. “The idiot had decided to leave his girlfriend as compensation.” Amelia jerked awake, the comment finally breaking the shock she was in, but it was too late, the boy stood in front of her, cutting her escape route. The other two laughed, while one of them had a disapproving expression about what was about to happen, I was willing to bet that it wasn’t enough to stand against his friends. The other patrons looked disapprovingly, but made no move to interject. Maybe they would have after the boys pushed to the next level. But the doubtful bravery of the crowd wasn’t a reason for me to keep my hand back.  </p><p>“It’s a nice one,” joined the more enthusiastic one, taking a step forward. Amelia took a step back in reflex, pushing herself to a corner, concealed from the rest of the bar. A big mistake, as less the crowd could see, easier for them to ignore. She was lucky that I had seen things unfold, as she could have easily found herself under their mercy. After this point, she was locked even if she close to shout. It carried the risk of escalating the situation even further. </p><p>Recognizing the risk, I quickened my steps. I was there before any of them had the opportunity to say anything else, stepping between them and Amelia. “Hello guys,” I said calmly. Too calm, considering one of them had pulled a knife the second I stepped between them. I hoped for them notice just how calm I was while being threatened with a knife and back off, but unfortunately, it wasn’t very likely. Young boys drunk with their perceived powers made bad observers. </p><p>It rolled on as I expected. “It’s not something you want to be a part of it, old man,” the aggressive one said in a manner he no doubt thought as intimidating, and he swung his blade in a wide arc. I wasn’t alarmed, because I could see it wasn’t going to connect, he was too far away from me. A move purely for intimidation purposes. </p><p>Which was why he looked surprised when, instead of scrambling away in a pathetic whimper, I caught his wrist. Surprised, he wasn’t able to put any resistance when I squeezed his wrist, forcing him to drop the blade. The other righted themselves in alarm, their hands getting closer to their waists, but I raised my hand to halt their advance. “Sorry gentlemen, reflexes,” I explained as I pushed my attacker back towards his friends. We all knew it was a bullshit explanation, but it gave them an excuse not to escalate the situation. </p><p>The aggressive one looked more than willing to ignore the opportunity, but the reticent one put his hand on his shoulder, urging him to stay back. I nodded in appreciation. “I had seen Henry had managed to ruin your evening as well,” I started. “Sorry about that, he is kind of an ass. How about I make it up to you guys. Since I have the misfortune of knowing him, I can’t help but feel responsible.” </p><p>“I know a way-” the aggressive one started, his gaze turning towards Amelia, his intention obvious, but his friends were quick to silence him. Smart, I thought. I could see that the boy was going to go far. A survival instinct, combined with good observation, was more important than anything else while living at the edge of the law. </p><p>I reached for my pocket, slowly and in an exaggerated motion, aware that violence could erupt if they thought I was pulling a weapon. I pulled three bills instead, hundreds, and threw them on the table before gesturing towards a waiter. “Bring me a bottle of whiskey,” I said before turning to guys. “With ice or without ice?” I asked in a forced normality. </p><p>“With ice,” said the calm one, throwing a glance towards the aggressive one when he looked like he was about to argue. Good, I thought. He also had a presence to control his lackeys. </p><p>I repeated that to the waiter from the distance, then leaned and picked their blade. A bit of show to convince them following me was a bad idea had the potential to be useful. “It has been a pleasure, guys,” I said. “However, we need to go, but we can play some darts the next time we meet.” With that, I swung my arm without a warning. They jerked up in panic, then turned to look behind when the blade thudded, sank firmly on the dart board. It wasn’t the bullseye, but it hit the board reasonably close to the center, a decent achievement considering the blade lacked balance. </p><p>I grabbed Amelia’s hand and dragged her with me as I walked towards the exit, each step even and careful. Running away would imply that I was actually afraid of them, which would destroy the earlier impression I had on them. She held my hand limply, unable to process the sudden turn of events. I even sent a small nod towards the gang members as I passed them, reinforcing my calm impression. Even after the show, the situation was too fragile. I could have fought against them, of course, but that would only bring undue attention to me. Not to mention three-to-one was not the best odds, especially with the added responsibility of protecting Amelia. </p><p>We managed to step out of the bar safely, and I called for a taxi. Amelia was still silent, though her grip around my fingers was tight enough to hurt. I said nothing. She needed something real to anchor her to prevent her from going hysterics, and a bit of pain was considerably better than trying to deal with her out of control cries. We took our seats, and she murmured her address, too silent for the driver to hear, forcing me to repeat it. </p><p>Discounting the rumbling of the engine, it was a silent drive. Amelia slid closer to me, trying to hold my arm tight. I threw my arm over her shoulder and pulled her close. She rested her head on my chest, her arms tightening around my torso. At first, I tried to ignore the distinct feeling of her breasts pressing to my chest, her top too flimsy to cut the sensations. I kept my gaze forward, giving her space to gather herself. I had assumed that she was still battling with fear and shock. </p><p>Then, I started to realize that my thoughts about the source of her silence might not be as accurate as I first assumed. My first clue was the way she moved. First, she started shifting, with the side effect of rubbing her breasts to my chest. I tried to ignore the enticing sensation despite a certain awakening of my body. I assumed that she was trying to get comfortable in our awkward seating arrangement, but the movement continued, a bit too rhythmic to be just a search for a new position. </p><p>When I turned to look at her, her hands started to move as well, slowly moving around, rubbing my chest in a circular motion. But, even with the clues, I was surprised when she looked up, desire burning deep in her eyes. I was surprised to the point I failed to say anything the moment her hands slid down, landing on the rapidly growing bulge on my pants. The expression of her face was exceedingly familiar. I have seen that on the faces of some women that hung around the mafia despite having no need of money or services. They turned on by the idea of danger, longing to listen to the stories of gunfights and melees, hunting for the rare nights where the fights occur. </p><p>Seeing my annoying professor was one of those thrill-sluts was a surprise, but the surprise only let my body free to move in a familiar pattern. I started rubbing her shoulder, and a smile burned wide on her face, glad to see me responding to her less-than-subtle advances. A small voice inside me tried to tell me that she had just gone through a traumatic experience and the gentlemanly thing was to gently let her down, to allow her recovery.</p><p>It was a good thing I was not a gentleman, I thought as I squashed the voice of reason. She was a big girl, if she wanted some spicy moments to conclude the night, I was more than ready to assist. And it was going to be definitely fun after all the pointless remarks and angry bursts I had to listen just to keep my identity covered. I turned my body a bit so that I could face her without hurting my neck, then leaned down to capture her lips. </p><p>Enthusiastic, she met me halfway in a searing kiss that conveyed her burning need, her tongue trying to push into my mouth aggressively. Unfortunately for her, it was where I drew the line. I had already accommodated her petty dominance during the day, and I had no intention of allowing her to establish a similar balance for tonight, or any night. I used my free hand to grab her hair, and pulled it, hard enough to force her move. She opened her mouth in a surprised moan, though my lips were more than up to the task of suppressing the noise. Leveraging the opportunity, my tongue slipped into her mouth, ravaging it to my heart's content. </p><p>Her tongue tried to wrap around mine in a vain attempt of pushing it away, but she lacked the strength and the will to dominate me now that I stopped playing the meek assistant. I continued kissing her, each passing second reinforcing the new balance of power. I could feel her desire to dominate lessening by each passing second. I wasn’t surprised by her early capitulation, as her domineering demeanor at work was too forced to be a part of her nature. </p><p>Only after I made sure the lesson about our new balance of power sank into her consciousness I pulled away from the kiss. There was still a long way until it took a hold irrevocably, but it was a start. I examined her as I let her catch her breath for a second. Her lips, slightly bruised by my rough kiss, was parted open, allowing her to breathe rapidly in an attempt to calm her nerves. Her eyes, shining with excitement, was locked to mine, the green shine in their depths begging for more. </p><p>I was gentleman enough not to disappoint a woman begging for pleasure. I patted my lap, inviting her to a more comfortable position. She didn’t lose a second before climbing on my lap. “Hey, that’s too much-” the driver started to say, but stopped midway, courtesy of a hundred I passed to him. He fell silent, and after a threatening glare, also kept his gaze away from the rear mirror.</p><p>I put my hands on her legs, her already short skirt climbed more thanks to the way she was sitting, barely able to cover her underwear. My hands slid under the deficient cover of her skirt, sinking into her plump bottom. She moaned once more, this time, unfiltered by my lips, echoed in the confines of the car. I leaned forward, this time clamping to her neck instead of assaulting her lips, littering her pale skin with hickeys. She moaned unbidden, uncaring about the consequences, but I was amused, imagining the effort it would take for her to hide it from the students. </p><p>I couldn’t help but let out a matching moan when her hips started moving. After all, I was already aroused due to compromising position I had caught Megan and her friend, and all the naughty videos I had liberated from there was like adding gasoline to an already burning fire. Factor in the rush of adrenaline I had just experienced, and it was a miracle that I managed to keep myself from fucking her in the taxi. We couldn’t have arrived at her fast enough. </p><p>I didn’t even wait for her to leave the car in her own power when the car finally came to a stop. I wrapped my arms around her waist and lifted her, stopping only to pass another fifty to the driver for his cooperation before stepping out, her legs wrapping around my waist, making the task of carrying her even easier. We were in front of a small house with a cute garden, a calm place that was a perfect fit for an academician. For a biker slut dressed in a micro skirt and almost-see-through blouse, aroused uncontrollably by the threat of physical assault she had just experienced, not so much. </p><p>My arms were tight around her waist, making it impossible for her to get down as I walked towards her door. Even after arriving, I didn’t let her step on the ground, squeezing between the door and my body as I invaded her mouth mercilessly once more, my hands acquainting themselves with the contours of her body, sliding under her blouse.</p><p>“I can’t invite you inside,” she murmured, speaking for the first time after giving her address. I would have been annoyed if it wasn’t for the burning arousal on her face. I was impressed, despite the relative simplicity of her plot. In front of her own house, her work personality was seeping back to the surface, asking her to take control. She still wanted sex, but she also wanted me to beg, allowing her to regain control of the situation. </p><p>However, I was too experienced to fall for such juvenile traps. More importantly, I knew exactly how to teach her a lesson. “Okay,” I said with a forced nonchalance as I gently let her down, continuing to hold her for another second until her legs stopped trembling badly. Still, I doubted she could stand if she hadn’t been leaning on the door. </p><p>“What do you mean, okay?” she said in a shocked tone, showing that she had never considered that possibility. </p><p>“Very simple word, okay, commonly used to convey an affirmative message,” I explained, replicating the annoying tone she used whenever she explained a complicated word in the classroom. “You’re the boss. If you don’t want me inside the house, who am I to disagree.” </p><p>It was a real struggle not to laugh for her expression, arousal battling with disappointment. Even funnier, her pride was too strong to take her words back without my begging, and she was too confused to find a way to sidestep the situation. I let her wallow in despair for a second, then she turned her back, reaching for her keys…</p><p>Only to find herself smashed against her door as I pushed, pinning her immobile. “What are you-” she started to say, only to cut short when my hand disappeared under her skirt, pulling down her panties. “James,” she whispered in panic. “What are you doing!” </p><p>“Since you’re not going to invite me inside, I decided to finish the job I started here,” I whispered, each word slow, measured. “But, of course, if you don’t want to do,” I added, my fingers sliding inside her wet slit. Her panties were around her ankle, too far away to guard her most sensitive spot against my merciless assault. “Just say the word, and I’ll walk away.” </p><p>I smirked at her shocked silence, stuck between two options, each incomprehensible in their own right. If she stayed silent, she was going to be taken against her own door, where all it took a curious neighbor to ruin her reputation irrevocably. Alternatively, she could just whisper a negative word, and I would walk away, leaving her free but aching… </p><p>I waited almost a minute for her to say anything, only to met with silence, broken only by her gasps filled with a burning need. It wasn’t exactly a surprise, the wetness I felt on my fingertips as I danced at her entrance suggested the other was an impossibility. I couldn’t help but feel a smirk blooming on my face as I freed shaft from the confines of my pants. </p><p>A moan escaped from my mouth as I pushed inside her, only for her walls to clamp around tightly. “You needed this for a long time, don’t you, slut,” I whispered, and felt her tightening around even further. I impaled her without bothering to moderate my speed, my shaft disappearing all the way inside, and earning another cry, this time much louder in response. “You enjoy being taken against the door like a common whore, don’t you?” I continued as I started slamming into her with a quick rhythm. “Maybe that was why you were such a bitch at work, trying to tempt me to bend you over the desk for punishment.” </p><p>She opened her mouth, about to answer. But from my perspective, her mouth had more important things to do, and she shouldn’t exhaust it by forming words. With that, my hand grabbed her blouse and pulled it to the side. The fabric was too sensitive to resist my pull, and fallen on the ground helplessly after a brief ripping sound, which helped her words to transform into a panicked yelp. I ignored, too busy subjecting her bra to the same treatment, and soon, she was half-naked, the chilly evening wind caressing her sweaty skin freely. </p><p>“That’s too much,” she murmured in panic. I understood where she was coming from. However scandalous getting caught in your garden while having sex was, it couldn’t have compared with the same neighbors meeting with the view of her naked tits, dangling freely with each push. </p><p>“I don’t care,” I answered even as pulled back. I grabbed her waist, and forced her to turn towards me. “Or should I just walk away, leaving you without a release.” I looked deep into her eyes, enjoying the shock mixed with an overwhelming arousal. Her answer was obvious in her silence, but I wanted her to submit. “I asked you a question, professor,” I whispered mockingly even as I caressed her cheek. “And I expect a prompt answer.” </p><p>“Continue, please,” she whispered, on the edge of incomprehension. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said before lifting her, only to bring her down directly onto my shaft. Her legs wrapped around my waist once more, her back resting against the door. I impaled her again and again, her moans getting louder with each repeat, soon forcing me to kiss her just to silence her, not that it was a great difficulty. I ravaged her mouth mercilessly, ignoring the flailing resistance she tried to put.</p><p>The presence of the door, combined with the tight grasp of her legs, was enough to keep her in place, leaving my hands free to explore her body once more. “You afraid of your neighbors seeing your beautiful tits, right? Let me help you with that.” And with that I placed my hands over her breasts, squeezing hard. A moan escaped her mouth.   </p><p>Then, she tightened around my shaft in a surprise arousal, suggesting that it wasn’t only the risk of physical threat that she enjoyed. The risk of getting caught in a compromising position seemed to work just as well. A very valuable information, I realized even as I pulled out her, leaving her to stand on her own feet once more. But her legs were trembling too badly to actually manage to support her, and she slid against the door until she found herself sitting on the ground. Perfect positioning for the thing I had in mind the next. </p><p>“Open wide,” I ordered, and she did. A panicked expression passing through her face a second later after she realized what I had in mind, but it was too late. My shaft was already between her lips, traveling deep into her mouth. “Go ahead,” I ordered, and her hands lifted to her head level, one catching the base of my shaft, the other massaging my balls, with a much greater skill than I would have expected her before tonight. </p><p>Feeling supercharged after all that happened, it hadn’t taken long for me to risk toppling over the edge under her enthusiastic assault. I pulled out at the last second, covering her sweaty face with my seed, quite a bit landing on her shiny black hair, contrasting sharply. Only then, I saw a flickering flame of anger, though it was nothing compared to the sea of pleasure it swam in. “See you tomorrow, professor,” I murmured, then turned back, leaving her in front of her own door, naked, dirtied, and confused. </p><p>Tomorrow was going to be fun… </p>",

    "content": "A bone-weary exhaustion filled my being as I left Nicole’s room, spent after the hours of practical training I had bestowed on Nicole. As I walked towards the stairs, there was only one thing in my mind, getting a rejuvenating sleep. But before I could arrive at the stairs, someone stepped upstairs, risking my plan. “Stephen!” Katie said with an obvious surprise. “What are you doing here?”<p>A reflexive answer came out before I could really think. “Looking for you. I wanted to talk to you about Madison,” I said, fervently hoping that she didn’t ask why my shirt was crooked and missing a button. I could hardly say that it broke off while I pulled in a hurry, too excited to finally bend over her stepmother after several extended foreplay sessions where I molested her to my heart’s content. </p><p>While I had to say that to distract her from my state of dress until I could come up with a better way to hide it, I was quite aware of its drawback. A drawback that was realized when Katie grabbed my hand in an alarmed expression. “Not here,” she said before she dragged me to her room, a weird reversal of what I just did with her stepmother. </p><p>It wasn’t that I had any objection to be in her room. Nancy was away, and Nicole was unconscious with an equal measure of pleasure and shame, it was a good time to push our closeness to the next level. I could have used somewhere else of course, but anything other than a few quick kisses was not an option in anywhere public, and she could hardly be convinced to come to a hotel room without making her tense and defensive. No, the problem lay with my exhausted state, after spending hours with Nicole, more than anything I needed a long sleep to soothe my bruised flesh. </p><p>I didn’t beat myself on it much though, using the small distance between the stairs and Katie’s door to fix my appearance as much as I could. “What are you doing, mentioning her name in the middle of the corridor?” she said, her eyes grew wide in fear. “What if my mother heard it?” </p><p>A deadpan expression was my first answer. “What will happen if she heard it?” I asked. </p><p>“It…” she started, only to come to a sudden stop as she went over the sentence in her head once more. “Sorry,” she said sheepishly.</p><p>“No worries,” I said even as I walked and sat on her bed. She looked displeased on my presumption, but her demeanor prevented her from saying anything about it. So I promptly ignored her in favor of examining her room. It was disappointingly stereotypical, a small bed with red and white sheets, a boring desk full of books, and a couple of posters over the pale pink walls, both groups needlessly popular. The room needed some character. </p><p>I discreetly glanced at her, and saw she was still standing, a confused expression on her face, meaning that my slight pause achieved its aim, disorienting her enough to pass the control of the conversation back to me. “So, let’s talk about Madison,” I said. “But why don’t you take a seat first.” </p><p>She reached to pull a chair, but I patted the bed invitingly, causing her to freeze in indecision once more, one I broke a second later with the sharp glare I sent to her way. She sat on the bed, but sat at the corner, with more than two feet between us. “That’s the thing I’m talking about,” I said, pointing at the distance between them. “This kind of small signs starting to make her suspect that something is off with our relationship.” </p><p>“But we don’t have a relationship,” she exclaimed, her face burning red. </p><p>I shrugged. “Well, there is no problem as long as Madison knowing it as well.” She shook her head hard, showing that she didn’t want something like that happening. “Then you need to learn how to be more relaxed with my presence.” </p><p>It seemed that my last kiss affected her more than I expected. She started speaking, her eyes firmly on the ground, trying her best to ignore the fact that we were alone. “I know, but it’s hard. Are you even sure that Madison is suspecting something?” </p><p>“It seemed that she was trying to decipher something. But maybe I was wrong. As long as she acted normally during the second half of the movie, there is likely no problem. I just hope that she wasn’t excessively distracted and silent, like she was trying to put the pieces together.” </p><p>I knew that Madison was silent and distracted because she had been struck with a chain orgasm following our small yet heated embrace, but Katie didn’t have that context, nor had the experience to realize that it wasn’t a usual behavior of someone that just realized something. But my comments disguised as predictions were accurate enough to throw off her balance. “That’s what happened!” she exclaimed as she jumped in panic, the fear taking precedence over the reason. </p><p>“Then it’s bad,” I said, not allowing her any time to recover. “The next time we meet with her, we need to be more convincing, or she might realize it’s all fake.” </p><p>“But how?” she wailed. </p><p>“Simple,” I said, keeping my voice as even as possible to hide my excitement, ignoring her theatric exclamation. “We need to make sure our intimacy looks natural, and the easiest thing we can do is to practice.” </p><p>“Practice!” she repeated. </p><p>“Yes, Katie, practice. There is no way we could sell the ruse if you continue to freeze at my slightest touch.” </p><p>“I don’t freeze when you touched me,” she said. “Do I?” she followed a second later with a whisper. I didn’t bother to verbalize my answer, just reached and grabbed her hand, and she froze even worse than she did at the cinema. However, it was not surprising. The cinema was loud and dark, and the raunchy movie on the screen didn’t hurt any in terms of making her more receptive to my advances. Now, under bright fluorescent lights and with her attention brought to that exact fact, her reaction was much more noticeable. “Oh god, there is no way Madison didn’t notice it. My school life is over!” </p><p>“Well, it was dark and noisy, which is why her belief is still in suspicion level. As long as we can convince her the next time we meet, nothing will happen.” She looked at me with a hesitant smile, asking for reassurance. “Don’t worry, we can do this,” I added, then patted on the bed. “Come, sit, so that we can start.” </p><p>And just like that, the doubt and hesitancy were back on her face, but she was walking towards me so I didn’t comment on it, no matter how small was her steps. Soon, she was in front of me, lowering herself on the bed, but I had other thoughts in mind. I wrapped my hand around her waist, changing her path with a small pull so that she ended up in my lap. “Stephen!” she exclaimed loudly, wiggling to get free. </p><p>“Silent, or Nicole might decide to see whether something was wrong. It might be tough to explain why you’re on my lap.” </p><p>“Okay,” she said demurely before getting a second wind. “But let me go!” </p><p>“No,” I countered in a calm tone that took the wind out of her sails. “Think it of a shock therapy. It will be harder at first, but will give a much better result.” </p><p>“Can’t we go slower,” she asked while wiggling subconsciously to make herself more comfortable in my lap, a move that started to awaken my shaft despite my exhausted state. I cursed the fact that she was wearing a thick skirt, reducing the enjoyment I would get from her lithe but firm bottom. </p><p>“We can,” I answered. “But only if you’re willing to take a bit of risk. If Madison calls us for another date before the slower way gave results, she might realize what is going on, wasting all of our efforts to this point.” </p><p>“What if I said we’re busy?” she asked. </p><p>It was a simple but elegant idea, but it ran contrary to my aims so I killed it. “Too risky. She’s already suspicious, and if you start to deflect her, she might take it as confirmation.” As I said that, I tightened my arms around her waist even more, pushing her bottom tighter over my growing shaft, a detail that she managed to lose in her confusion. I couldn’t wait until she realized what was growing beneath her. </p><p>“Okay,” she said resignedly. </p><p>“Perfect,” I said. “Then just relax, press your back to my chest, and try to stay silent as much as you could.” As soon as she nodded, I leaned forward and pressed my lips to her neck, made easier by the fact that her hair was shaped into a bun. Predictably, she froze, but I didn’t let it stop me from my next move. I kept my lips on her neck in a lingering kiss, sucking softly even as I brought my arms around her waist higher until my forearm was supporting her breasts. Not that they needed any, I just wanted to touch them.</p><p>It was the panic that freed her from her shock this time. The arousing sensation of fonding a young and beautiful woman managed to overcome the bone-weary exhaustion of certain parts of my body, and my erection rose to its full stature, to a point that was impossible to miss even by an emotionally-distressed virgin. “Stephen!” she exclaimed in shock as she attempted to jump in a display of pure reflexes, but my hold was too tight for her to succeed. </p><p>“Calm down, sweetie. Or have you forgotten the objective of the exercise?” </p><p>Her panic subsided after that reminder, but not her protest. “But I can feel your… Thing… It’s too much!” </p><p>“Hence the name of shock therapy,” I answered clinically. “It wouldn’t be effective if it didn’t push your barriers.” I had no idea whether shock therapy worked like that, but she didn’t know as well, which was the only important thing. Once again, I used the opportunity to better my position, aligning my shaft with her bottom, lodged between her cheeks. Something she missed until it was too late. “Are you ready to continue?” She didn’t answer, so I decided to push her a bit more. “Look, Katie. I’m giving you hours from my busy schedule because you asked for my help after putting yourself in a bind. However, there is no point of me wasting all that time if you’re not going to put the same effort.” </p><p>“Okay,” she whispered in a barely audible voice, almost enough for me to feel bad about the blatant manipulation of a young woman. </p><p>Almost, but not quite, which was why I used the opportunity to shift one of my hands to her leg. After all, young as she might be, she was still legally an adult, and more importantly, I was a selfish bastard. “Better,” I said even as my hand glided over the skin uncovered by her skirt, her goosebumps a physical entity under my fingers. “So, how was the school?” I asked.</p><p>“What?” she asked, blindsided by the casual question.</p><p>“I asked about the school,” I said before sighing resignedly. “It’s another part of the training. You need to be able to speak about topics like this when we’re with Madison, like our intimacy is nothing but a casual habit.” </p><p>“I understand,” she murmured before launching a staggered explanation about the school, slowing down whenever my hand tickled the edge of her skirt, pushing it up bit by bit. When her long-winded explanation about the last math exam was finished, the hem of her skirt had moved upwards considerably, revealing most of her thighs, attractive despite their thin appearance that suggested she preferred staying inside over exercising. </p><p>I decided to move the discussion to the next level. “Very interesting, how about the literature,” I said, while I slid my other hand from the bottom of her shirt, grazing my fingers over her naked belly, making her shiver, with the added benefit of silencing her effectively. “Come on, Katie. I asked you a question.” </p><p>“It’s fine,” she managed to whisper in a trembling voice. Her eyes were dry but I could hear the oncoming tears in her voice. “I’m sorry, but it’s too much.” But even then, I could sense that was her rising arousal that was unbalanced her. </p><p>“No worries, honey,” I answered cheerfully, pulling my hand away after one last caress. “You were very brave, trying to push yourself despite your discomfort.” Naturally, I avoided mentioning that she was trying to cover up her own fuck up, as a forthcoming honesty was seldom a useful trait in life. I pulled my hands away, letting her stand up. </p><p>“Thanks,” she answered, smiling after the unexpected compliment. </p><p>I walked towards her door, checking my phone, in an angle outside her line of sight, to see whether the corridor was empty, which thankfully was. I didn’t want to come across Nancy in my exhausted state as well. Nicole had been exhausting enough before the small session with Katie. Actually, it was the only reason I let Katie go that easily. I could have pushed her farther, but it would have been a chore for me as well, which beat the whole purpose of doing it in the first place. Still, I turned towards her just before leaving. “Be at my room tomorrow morning, six-thirty, sharp, so we can do a second session before you go for the school.” </p><p>Then, before she could answer, I left the room, my mind already on the things I would do, unhampered by a bone-weary exhaustion. </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>The sound of the alarm blared in my cluttered room at the dead of the morning, far earlier than my usual time, but I was waiting for a guest, and had some preparations before the arrival of my quest, some of them I was supposed to do the last night but felt too exhausted, such as hiding the costumes that was revealing enough to scare Katie, and putting a few clothes that might catch her interest to a more central location, more revealing than her usual ensemble without looking completely slutty. </p><p>I managed to finish them faster than I thought, meaning I had enough time for a quick shower. One that afforded me an interesting opportunity, I realized as I was walking to my clothes drawer, only to stop midway, wrapping the towel around my waist instead, curious to see her reaction to my limited nakedness. </p><p>It was exactly six-thirty when I heard a soft, hesitant knock on the door. “Come in,” I called and Katie appeared at the end of the stairs, first lights of sunlight highlighting her silhouette, a frame around her innocence. Under the reverse light, her facial expression was concealed under the shadows, but I didn’t need it to understand her reaction to my state. The surprised yelp that escaped her mouth was clue enough, or the fact that she was frozen stiff. “What are you waiting for?” I added.</p><p>My admonishment proved enough to jolt her into action. She stepped inside and closed the door, a bit too loud for my tastes, but not a big risk since Nancy always woke up late, and Nicole would be too shy to visit just to check a random noise after yesterday’s encounter. So, I walked back to my bed in lazy steps, slow enough that when I sat down, Katie was already in front of me. </p><p>“Good morning,” she said in a voice even more tense than her usual. Considering she was in a stranger’s room, and that stranger was wrapped only in a towel, it was a deserved reaction.</p><p>“Morning,” I replied in a smirk even as I examined her clothing. She was wearing a set of conservative pajamas that covered everything except her neck and her hands, either because she woke up late and hadn’t had the time to change, or she wanted a more conservative set to prevent an easy access. Since I could see a carefully applied layer of light make-up, I was willing to bet that it was the latter. “Are you ready?” I asked. </p><p>Her gaze slid over my body, lingering over my sculpted chest for more than what was strictly necessary before moving to the towel. She looked hesitant, and for a moment I was afraid that I pushed her too much, but the nod that followed a few seconds later was enough to assuage my feelings. </p><p>She tried to sit next to me, but that ended predictably when I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her onto my lap, causing her to freeze once more, an opportunity I leveraged to wrap my arms around her waist once more to prevent her from escaping. “So, any plans for today?” I asked. </p><p>“Nothing much,” she answered even as she shifted to sit more comfortably, careful to keep her movements limited to not to arouse the attention of my shaft. But, there was one difference she wasn’t aware, I wasn’t on the verge of exhaustion after spending hours to make Nicole faint from an overload of pleasure. Her next words disappeared into a yelp as my shaft answered her wiggling by turning rock-hard in an instant. </p><p>“Is something wrong?” I asked with a mock concern even as I did a wiggle of my own to ensure my length was aligned correctly, teasing her bottom. I understood the reason for the intensity of her shock. Trying to maximize the coverage, she had failed to factor in the fact that the thick fabric of a jean-skirt was much better to insulate against the touch than the silky texture of a thin pajama bottom, and the fact that I was wearing just a towel didn’t help any.</p><p>“N-no, of course not,” she stammered in one of the least convincing lies I have ever heard. “Why don’t you tell me how is your business going?” </p><p>Not a bad example of quick thinking, especially since a considerable amount of her blood had rushed to her face, leaving her deficient. I thought about ignoring her poor attempt of deflection and force her to speak once more, but the opportunity on the other side was equally interesting. “There are a few challenges…” I started, then let my mouth to go through a standard talk about photography. </p><p>At the same time, my full attention was on her body, reading her minute responses as my hands slowly started to wander over her body to ensure I didn’t push her too far too soon. First few minutes, I played conservative, as she had been already pushed too far with my mode of dress, with a non-negligible effect from being a stranger’s room. Soon, she started to relax, and I allowed my hands roam freely over her legs and her belly, with occasional accidental touch to the bottom of her breasts. She turned slightly for the first two times that happened, her lips parted in preparation, but a firm gaze was enough to dissuade her both times. Following times, she didn’t react other than a slight shift in her body. </p><p>That shift, I did nothing to prevent because I realized that there was an important side effect for all of her movement. The corner of my towel had been dislodged when she took her seat, and every time she shifted, the towel slid a bit more. Soon, the thin fabric of pajamas was the only thing that was separating our flesh. It was tempting to push them down in a sudden move before sliding inside her, but unfortunately, it was also very inadvisable. Her attraction was obvious, but her demeanor didn’t permit something that aggressive. </p><p>Interestingly, her shifts become more regular, almost rhythmic as she slid back and forth. The pleasure of rubbing seemed to register in her subconscious mind. I couldn’t wait to see her reaction when she realized she had been rubbing to my naked shaft all along. </p><p>But imagining the blossoming of a cute shock on her face was not enough to satisfy me. One of my hand slid inside between the gap between the top and her skin, caressing her naked stomach once more. She froze the moment my fingertips touched her burning skin, depriving me of the pleasurable caresses her bottom was delivering. It was not to be borne of course, which was why the fingers of my free hand sank to her bottom, forcing her to continue her gentle rocking. </p><p>That proved enough to push through her tenuous self-control, and she jerked up. I considered not to allow her to get up, but let her jump when a more interesting scenario jumped to my mind. I let my towel slide completely, allowing her to think that it was her sudden movement that was responsible. It wasn’t as enjoyable as watching her as she realized where she had been sitting for the last five minutes, but easier to explain as well. “Careful,” I said in a loud voice, acting like I was surprised. </p><p>She turned towards me reflexively after my shout, only to let out a strangled cry of her own. An expected reaction, since she met with a full-sized erection in all of its naked glory, though I was a bit surprised when instead of closing her eyes or turning her back, she continued looking at it, her eyes unmoving, her face contorted with surprise. I waited for a short while, curious what she would do, getting more and more sure with each passing second that it was the first time she had seen a naked boy. “Do you want some popcorn?” </p><p>“What?” she murmured at first, her gaze still fixed on my midsection. I could read the moment the question registered fully, where her face was scrunched with confusion, which turned into a blush in short order as she remembered the exact situation she was in. She turned her back, the motion accompanied by another surprised cry. “Stephen!” </p><p>“What?” I said, dismissing her implied accusation offhand. “You’re the one that pulled my towel, and you’re the one that is ogling me naked.” I reached down and pulled the towel on my lap, but this time intentionally loose, my erection obvious from the large tent. “You can turn back now.” </p><p>She turned to me once more, but this time her eyes were kept above the neck level. I smirked at her obvious struggle to prevent her gaze from dipping down. “Maybe I should go,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“What’s the hurry,” I countered. “It was barely ten minutes. You should stay a while more, so that the training takes hold.” I shrugged before bringing out the big guns. “Of course, you might think that getting uncovered by Madison is no big deal, and in that case, please go ahead.” It was a true struggle to keep my sense of victory away from my expression when she started to turn once more in an obvious attempt of taking her earlier seat. “Keep the direction,” I ordered. </p><p>Her desire to argue was obvious from her face, but her lips stood unmoving as she sat on my lap once more, at the point where my knees barely started. A reasonable distance, but one that I had no intention of allowing, so I wrapped my arm around her waist once more, and a small application of force later, she slid past the middle of my thighs. The fact that my shaft was pressing against her was just an added bonus. “Is it better?” she asked in a small voice that melted ice.</p><p>But my heart was made of sterner stuff, so I just nodded dismissively, normalizing the absurdity of our deal, forcing the normal to become absurd. The situation was much more intimate when I continued my explanation about the photography. I could see from her face that my words failed to register as her gaze alternatively focused to my face or drifted unfocused. I had a good guess about what she was thinking about, though my hands that were caressing her back didn’t help as well. </p><p>“What I said just now?” I asked without a warning, in the tone of a strict teacher that enjoyed catching his students unaware. At the same time, my hands didn’t even stagger in their task of gently massaging her back. </p><p>“Camera settings,” she answered in a rush of panic. </p><p>“Correct, I did mention that,” I said, and she looked relaxed, a calm that I gleefully destroyed with my next words. “But it was ten minutes ago. You need to be more focused Katie, while getting distracted from the conversation could be explained easier than freezing with just a touch, it implies that it’s something novel for you, therefore suspicious.” </p><p>The way she dipped her head with admonishment was objectively cute, tempting me to slide my finger under her chin, force her to look upwards before capturing her lips in an aggressive embrace, but I had a feeling that she would escape from my grip like a startled dove. </p><p>So, I continued speaking instead. “Why are you distracted?” I asked. She stayed silent, but the point her eyes focused was answer enough. “Is it the first time you seen one?” Still silent, she shook her head hesitantly. “First time in real life?” I asked, this time receiving a nod. “That would be a hard thing to explain if Madison catches it, we need to fix it now.” </p><p>This time, her lips worked faster than her mind. “How-” she started to murmur before her words came to a sudden stop and her gaze met mine. </p><p>“Simple, we’re going to give you some experience with it,” I said even as I pulled the towel off, which required a strong tug as a part of it was stuck between our bodies. Once again, she tried to pull back, but this time weak enough that I was able to prevent her from pulling away with my hand limp on her back. Understandable since she was a virgin that found herself with a full-sized erection between her legs, pressing to her stomach threateningly. “Why don’t you caress it for a moment.” </p><p>She looked at me questioningly, a timid light flickering behind, but I could see her hand from the corner of my eye, sneaking closer to my shaft, trembling softly. Soon, I felt a fleeting caress on the side, but it didn’t make me as happy as the curiosity that appeared in her expression. Seeing her obvious attempt to gather courage, I stopped pushing her, waiting for her to act. “Are they always this big,” she murmured, more to herself rather than an actual statement. </p><p>“I have yet to receive any complaint, so I’m willing to bet some of them falls on the smaller side,” I answered, unable to resist the opportunity to brag. </p><p>I hadn’t had to wait for long. I felt another touch a few seconds later, but this one lingered over a few seconds, and her gaze slid away from my face in favor of observing herself in her new task. The next attempt saw contact of not just one finger but her whole hand, and more importantly, stayed wrapped around my shaft as she listened to its throbbing. Leveraging her distraction, I slid my hand under her top once more, this time getting nothing more than an errant glance even as it pushed her top up enough to reveal her smooth belly. The perfect distraction. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was almost seven, and she needed to prepare for school, lest we risked revealing what we were doing to Nicole, a risk I wasn’t willing to take yet, not even after our last encounter. “Maybe we call it a day,” I said. “You need to prepare for the school,” I added after seeing her confused expression, a sudden rush of disappointment telling me that I was on the right path. </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured, and stood up after one last caress, a weird attempt of defiance I guessed from her sudden rebellious expression, one that fit as much as a puddle in Savannah, chasing after a giraffe. </p><p>“By the way,” I added, arresting her walk. “I have a couple of clothes left from the earlier shots, why don’t you take them. I have a feeling that you’re going to like them.”</p><p>She walked towards the chair I pointed and started examining the ones I separated. A blush spread through her face, but it was more of a sign of her perspective, as they were downright conservative compared to what Nancy wore on a daily basis. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured and left the room in quickened steps, leaving me to plan the next lesson. </p>",

    "content": "I went through my plan for the day during the morning shower. Yesterday I had ended up dedicating my attention to the daughters due to a range of coincidences, giving Nicole with an unintentional breathing space. Now, it was the time to focus on Nicole once more before she could come in terms with the latest events. Still, in a way, the break had been a fortuitous event. It allowed her to endlessly think about the way she surrendered under my touch, or at least, I assumed she did. I certainly thought about her a lot. <p>With that in mind, I walked upstairs, and took a seat in the corner, where I could watch the stairs comfortably while staying concealed from anyone that was checking the room from the upstairs. It was likely that Nicole would try to avoid meeting, so I decided to preemptively ambush her. </p><p>I had to wait twenty minutes before I heard the first footsteps on the stairs. Nicole, I guessed, because neither Nancy nor Katie had a reason to stop every few steps, like they were checking the surroundings to avoid a particular someone. I stood up, and started walking towards the stairs, so that I can ‘accidentally’ run at her. </p><p>She was already at the bottom of the stairs when she realized she wasn’t alone. She actually yelped in surprise when she noticed me, looking ready to run back upstairs. “Good morning, Nicole,” I said cheerfully like it was a completely ordinary encounter between a quest and a homeowner. </p><p>“Morning, Stephen,” she answered, trying grab my offer of acting normal as her lifeline. She attempted to sound casual, but it came out as a panicked yelp. I ignored it.  </p><p>“So, where are you going,” I asked her, nodding towards the small bag she was carrying alongside her casual clothing. </p><p>“I need to go for some grocery shopping,” she answered. </p><p>I knew it was a bogus issue, as the fridge was mostly full. She was trying to get away from the house in an attempt to avoid what had happened between us. “Perfect, since I don’t have anything to do, I can come with you for help.” </p><p>It wasn’t hard to see that it was the last thing she wanted in her need to keep the distance. “You don’t need to bother. I’m sure you have a busy schedule. I can handle it myself,” she said. </p><p>“I insist. That’s the least I can do for a kind hostess like you,” I said and started walking before she could say anything else and left the house. When she walked out of the front door a minute later, I was already at the driver’s seat, the passenger side open invitingly. An assertive woman would have ignored the forced invitation, but then again, she wouldn’t be in her current position if she had been remotely assertive.  </p><p>Next two hours passed amusingly. For me, at least. She was tense, expecting me to start pushing her any moment with innuendos, or even explicitly lewd comments, which made my decision to act like a true gentleman for the expedition quite fun, watching her confused expression as she started to doubt her recollections of the events that happened in her bedroom under my behavior. I could almost hear her thoughts as she asked herself whether her memories were real, or just her imagination. </p><p>“By the way,” I said with a conversational tone as I finished filling the fridge as she put the non-perishables to the shelves. “We have another shoot for today.” </p><p>“Umm, I’m not sure I can do it today,” she said, her tone equally casual after two relaxing hours we spent together, thinking there wouldn’t be any consequences for her rejection. Which was why she looked shocked when I turned towards her with a steely expression. </p><p>“We have another shoot today,” I repeated verbatim, but this time, my tone allowed no dissent. She looked stricken, caught flat-footed by the sudden change. I said nothing, but kept my gaze firmly on her eyes. A few more seconds passed in silence as she tried to restart her thoughts, but I was familiar with her enough to know that she was horrible at adapting sudden changes. </p><p>And I had no intention of allowing her time to process it. I tapped my foot on the ground, signaling my impatience. Her nod was reflexive. “Perfect,” I said as I wrapped my arm around her waist, ignoring the way she stiffened as I led her towards the basement. </p><p>A fun time awaited us at downstairs. </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>It was interesting to watch how easily Nicole took a submissive role once more. A few words, a sharp glance, and once again, she was a wound-up doll that followed my direction at the slightest coaxing. She neither said anything nor put the slightest struggle to escape from my arm, softly wrapped around her waist, pulling her body against mine, tight enough to rub with each step. Nothing until we arrived in the basement.</p><p>“Your costume is already behind the screen,” I pointed, but otherwise gave no explanation, curious about how she was going to react to a costume of a barbarian princess. Adapted to Halloween, therefore with a significant deficit of fur and fabric of course, as it would defeat the point of costumes. </p><p>The strangled gasp she let out had let me understood that Nicole wasn't thinking the same, and frankly, I understood her perspective. From the perspective of the area it covered, it was less revealing than some of the swimsuits she tried the last time, but they didn't carry the suggestiveness of the costume she was going to wear now, not to mention people were desentethysized against the revealing swimsuits. Even the ones that were made from thin strings and nothing else didn't ooze the same sexiness with a modest set of lingerie. It just failed to match their mystery and suggestiveness. </p><p>I could have let Nicole alone behind the screen for a few minutes, allowing her to adapt the idea of wearing that extremely revealing costume, but not when I had a better idea. I gave no warning before walking towards the screen and pushed my head forward so I could have an unrestricted view of her. “What is taking you so long,” I said in a casual tone, like it was completely normal to peek on her while she was naked other than her panties, looking at her costume with shock apparent on her face.</p><p>A shock that multiplied as she turned to look at me. “Stephen!” she exclaimed reflexively in an effort to display the unacceptability of my action. </p><p>An insinuation that I resolutely ignored, as I let my gaze fell on her body, particularly on her impressive breasts, bare for my attention. A look that reminded her of her nakedness, which she attempted to cover up by pulling the costume close. The costume didn’t cover much, not that it was surprising. She was trying to use the skirt of the costume, and it was designed to cover very little even when properly worn, held against her body like that, it was barely better than a handkerchief. “You were taking too long, so I assumed that you’re having trouble with the costume,” I explained. She opened her mouth, but I continued before she could, cutting off her denial before it could even form. “I can see that I’m correct. Sit!” </p><p>“What?” she murmured, caught flat-footed by the surprise order, but I was happy to note that her body, conditioned by the hours we spent on the set, reacted before her conscious mind could even process it, and sat down. </p><p>I smirked in satisfaction. “Very simple, you were taking too long, so I decided to help,” I said even as I reached for the first part of the costume, a fur-lined top that created with best of the fantasy tropes in mind for a barbarian princess, covering barely more than a revealing bikini top. I couldn’t wait to see its effect on Nicole’s bountiful breasts. I had a feeling that it would look even better. “Now, raise your arms.”</p><p>She opened her mouth like she was about to argue, but just a glance was enough to silence her this time. “Come on, we don’t have all day,” I said, then smirked. “It’s purely professional.”. Her expression conveyed a rightful doubt, but still, she followed my directions and let her arms unfold, leaving her tits naked for my attention once more. </p><p>I had to admit, I was tempted to ignore the need for the shoot and sank my fingers to her inviting globes, intensified by the knowledge that her only reaction would be a whimper of protest. Unfortunately, I needed to finish photographing the costumes first I had any hopes of getting repeat works from them, so I limited myself to a few ‘accidental’ caresses while fixing her top, with her frozen stiff during the service.</p><p>The next step was even more interesting, I concurred as I palmed the next piece of clothing, ruby colored panties with far more lace to be useful as anything other than a costume. “Raise your legs,” I ordered. After all, I needed to remove the one she was wearing to put the other on. The way her legs were trembling as she lifted her legs was tempting enough that I would have said screw it if it was anything other than my career on the line. Instead, I hooked my fingers around the edge of her panties, pulling them off slowly over her trembling skin. </p><p>She crossed her legs in a vain attempt to keep them hidden. “Keep them up,” I added, showing the panties she was going to wear during the action. For a second, she did nothing, trying to wake up from the trance I had forced her in, but her fledgling resistance broke with a touch when I put my hand on her leg, squeezing softly. Her legs parted open, almost automatic, displaying her glistening folds, showing I wasn’t the only one that was feeling overcharged. Not that I needed my eyes to confirm that, her pulse beating strong under my touch… </p><p>It was almost a sacrilege, dressing her up so that she could hide behind the lacy fabric, but I tried to console myself with the fact how tasty it was going to unwrap her once more once both of us were supercharged after another shoot. Her wordless begging after the last shot was a memory to cherish for eternity. I helped her to wear the boots, though made from satin and bows, they resembled long slippers than actual boots, and its murky red color didn’t help to sell them either.</p><p>“Stand up,” I ordered, and just like before, she did so without a word of protest. “Beautiful,” I murmured after finishing her to put up her skirt and passed the sword that came as a prop. “Smile,” I added as I stood up, the final piece of the costume, the mask, in my hand, though I delayed putting it on, enjoying the sight of the barbarian fighter that wouldn’t look out of place in a Conan comic, except for her submissive expression. Thankfully, I was doing a photo shoot for Halloween costumes and not a thematic drama, so her out-of-character expression was a non-issue.</p><p>I placed the mask on her face, then turned my back and walked into the set itself, not bothering to call her. Footsteps followed me a second later, and she was already in front of the screen when I was back to my camera. “Ready?” I asked. She nodded, and I started ordering her through the poses. </p><p>First ten minutes, I focused solely on the commercial poses. I wanted to finish them as soon as possible, because I had a second set in mind for my private collection, one I couldn’t wait to immortalize. “Excellent,” I called. “The easy part is over.” She looked at me questioningly, her eyes not without worry, but I ignored it in favor of the next command. “Remove your mask and throw it away. We’re done with it.” </p><p>Her hand was shaking as she followed my request and the mask off and threw it on the side, allowing me to see the death of her last flickers of confidence, survived solely due to the cover of the mask. “Now, raise your sword like you’re about to defend yourself from an assault.” With that, I had run her through a basic set of movements. “You’re surrounded, about to be taken captive. Show me that desperation,” I added. </p><p>It turned out to be easy an expression for her after she saw the next prop I was planning to use. Her expression fell as I raised the rope from the ground. “You have been captured,” I said, unable to prevent glee from infecting my voice. “Now, put your arms in front of you and press your wrist together.” </p><p>“Why?” she whispered, low enough that I had to strain even to hear, then promptly ignored it in favor of focusing the way I tied her hands. I didn’t want to leave any bruise in such a visible part of her body. </p><p>“Now that you have been captured, I want you to look helpless, unsure what was about to happen to you,” I said. She brought the expression to the surface perfectly, owing to the fact that it was actually what she was feeling. However, admitting that wouldn’t help me forward my plan, so spoke once more after a couple of photos. “Not sincere enough,” I said. “I want you to be afraid of what is going to happen when the warden arrives.” I decided to help a bit, putting my finger on her chin, before slowly dragging up, tracing her lips. “Better,” I murmured as the camera clicked several times, recording the scene as she trembled under my finger. </p><p>“But not good enough,” I added. I took a step back, my fingers on my chin as I made a show of thinking. “I got it,” I added. “It’s your costume, it looks too pristine.” As usual, she didn’t have an answer, and I closed the distance once more, slipping my fingers through her hair, mussing it like she had been in a tussle. Then, once again, I traced my finger on her face until I reached her lips, but this time, I cut a line over her lips, distorting her carefully applied lipstick. “Still not enough,” I said, and let my hand fell freely until it was on her chest level, then hooked around her top before she could react, pulling harshly. The fragile texture of the costume gave easily, and one side of the costume dropped to the side, enough to reveal the pinkness of her areola. </p><p>I took another set of photos, ignoring her silent panic, mixed with resignation. I put the camera on the side, and stood in front of her, hulking and intimidating. “Now, imagine that I’m the warden, and you need to convince me to let you free, by whatever necessary. Understood?” She nodded. “When I ask a question, I expect a response!” I said, letting my fingers slide in her hair once more, but this time, I pulled it, hard enough to force a cry. </p><p>“Understood!” she yelped. </p><p>“Perfect,” I said even as I leaned forward, my lips close enough to tickle her earlobe. “Then, show me your desperation, your need.”</p><p>“Please, Mister Warden,” she whimpered. “Please let me go.” </p><p>“Not good enough, princess,” I whispered into her ear, which was completely true. Even if it had been a real situation and I had the intention of letting her go free, her erotic desperation would have changed my mind. No warm-blooded male could have resisted abusing the helpless beauty that lay in front of him. Luckily, I had no such intention in the first place. I had been playing with Nicole long enough. Today was the day she became mine, not just in mind but also in body as well. </p><p>Regardless, I was happy that it wasn’t only fear that caused her to tremble as I dragged my finger over her arm, getting closer to the fragile string that kept her top on its place. “Let’s discuss what exactly you need to do for your freedom, princess,” I said even as I used my other hand to bring her still bound hands towards my belt. The deal as clear as it could be without relying on a picture book with step-by-step drawings. However, the question wasn’t whether she understood the order, but whether she would follow it. After all, it was far deeper than anything else I asked her. Even the encounter in her bedroom didn’t compare, because she was just a passive participant that lost control. </p><p>Several seconds passed as my heart rate increased progressively, fearing I had pushed her too far too soon, that I had overestimated the impact I had on her. But then, her fingers moved, freeing my waist from the oppression of my belt. The button of my pants soon followed the same fate as she deftly battled them despite her bound wrists. Tangled with my erection, pulling down my underwear was a nominally more difficult challenge, but she nevertheless handled with grace, or as much of it one could display in this situation.</p><p>“Show me your skills, warrior-princess,” I said, making a token effort to stay in the role. “You have ten minutes to succeed.” I showed her my phone, where a chronometer already running down from the declared time. It broke the already thin immersion of the scenario I was trying to create, but it was worth it to see the panic blooming on her face as she realized she had an actual time limit to finish her task. </p><p>Then, she surprised me by leaning forward and capturing the crown of my shaft, covering it with the exquisite warmth of her mouth. I would have expected her to her to still act recitient, losing some time by dallying. Instead, she pushed deep without any hesitance. It wasn’t that her motions were smooth. No, they were choppy and hesitant, cluing me that it had been quite a while since she last served to a man in this manner. I shrugged dismissively. It wasn’t a big problem, not when I had a lot of time to teach her about the intricacies of good service, and the fact that she took the initiative was far more important. </p><p>There was a problem, I realized as the minutes rolled. I was already overcharged with the dressing session, and the actual shoot did nothing to reduce that fact. And regardless of her current level of skill, Nicole was an extremely beautiful woman, dressed in a sexy costume that failed to contain her bountiful breasts, doing her best to bring me to climax. I could feel my climax forcing itself to existence, minutes before the declared time. But I didn’t want to let Nicole off the hook. </p><p>When in doubt, cheat, an old adage said. I decided to pick that as my guide, and a couple of touches later, I had extracted four minutes from the countdown, leaving only seconds before Nicole’s appointed timeline. I wasn’t afraid of her noticing, as humans perceive time unusually in emotionally-charged situations. The current one definitely qualified. </p><p>“Time is up,” I said when my phone buzzed, alerting us the fact that it reached zero, only one of us aware of the trick behind its premature conclusion. I expected her to pull back in a dejected expression, but apparently, she hadn’t run out of the ways to surprise me yet. She looked up, meeting my amused gaze while still keeping my girth between her lips before pushing even deeper, trying to extract my seed in an increased urgency. </p><p>As a true gentleman, I decided to help her. I pushed my hands through her hair once more, impaling my shaft deep into her throat. She wheezed in an effort to breathe, but made no attempt of pulling back, letting me dominate her mouth without the slightest protest. </p><p>Already close to the edge, that proved enough to break the barrier. I filled her mouth with my seed, only a groan as a signal. Caught surprised, she failed to contain it, a trickle flowing through her cheek, spilling on her breasts. I pulled out, leaving her to struggle for her breath while I reached for my camera. It was a moment that deserved to be immortalized. </p><p>Then I dropped the camera in lieu of reaching my phones, checking whether the public area was free. I didn’t want to come across one of the daughters during the next part. Thankfully, the corridors were clean. “It was a good attempt, princess,” I whispered. “However, you failed in the task you have been set. Are you ready for the punishment?” </p><p>She nodded, trying to look resigned and despondent, but there was no hiding of the excitement that lay behind her eyes, unaware that I had a plan that was going to push out of her comfort zone, even her recently expanded one that included getting deepthroated after getting dressed in an unfamiliar costume by a man that she just met last week. </p><p>She stood up when took a hold of the excess part of the rope that bound her hands together, but surprise dominated her expression once more when I, instead of untying her, started walking. The rope was short and had little give, and very quickly she faced with a choice, to walk or to resist.</p><p>And walk she did, though her reluctance rose once she realized I was once again walking towards the stairs once more, a resistance that got stiffer in each step. Intolerable, I decided as I suddenly stopped and turned to her, looking questioningly, stairs helping me to tower over her even more than the usual.</p><p>“What if we come across someone,” she asked with a trembling voice. Nancy, she didn’t bother to say, as Katie was already away at school, leaving her the only possible option. A likely concern since she lacked the advantage of a few strategically placed cameras feeding real-time input to her phone like I had. </p><p>Still, I had no intention of allowing her to question me without a payback. “Are you afraid that your daughter sees you in a naughty costume,” I asked. She nodded hopefully. “Okay,” I said, and she smiled, one that lasted until I showed what I had in mind as a solution, grabbing her top. She looked panicked, but before she could say anything, I pulled it, ripping away the already damaged piece of cloth, leaving her chest bare. “Is this better for your satisfaction? Now, they cannot see most of the costume,” I asked. </p><p>“But-” she started, only for her words to die when I subjected her skirt to the same treatment, leaving her only with her panties. And her slippers, I corrected, though I doubted she took it as a consolation. </p><p>“Any other issues?” I said even as my finger hooked around the edge of her panties, threatening to subject them to the same treatment if another word left her stained lips. She must have understood the message, because she fell silent, leaving me to walk out while pondering how lucky I was to come across a submissive beauty like her. Here I was, risking to expose her to her daughter in her current state, and she was accepting it after a whimper of protest.</p><p>Of course, I had no intention of actually revealing her, at least not at this point, so I checked the cameras before stepping into the room, careful to hide the screen from her sight. Her acceptance wouldn't have extended for me having surveillance over her daughters. </p><p>It was funny to watch the change in her steps when we stepped into the living room, her reluctance evaporating instantly as she tried to cover the distance through the shared space as quick as possible. I deliberately slowed down my steps, curious whether she was going to push me to move faster, some interesting punishments in my mind if she dared to do so. </p><p>Unfortunately, she didn't, and we climbed the stairs to the second floor without any further issue. I started walking faster by midway, not because I pitied her, but because it was starting to get boring as I walked at the front, depriving myself from the beautiful sight she provided. So, I was just as enthusiastic as her when we reached her bedroom, though for distinctly different reasons. </p><p>Only after I took a step inside I turned back, watching her slip inside with rapid steps, her tits jumping attractively with each step. I wished that it was possible to take her while leaving the door open, or even better, in the corridor, as it would have been legendary to watch her climax while watching the door panickedly, but unfortunately, that was not an option. I couldn't take the risk of Nancy stumbling to the scene, destroying the amazing progress I managed to attain in this short time. </p><p>I closed door, then took a quick few steps towards until I was standing directly behind her. A part of me was telling me to continue playing with her until she begged for release. But the time was over, my arousal decided. I had played with her for too much. It was the time for the main course. </p><p>I pressed my hand between her shoulder blades and gave her a slight push, and she found herself on the bed in a converted doggy position, where she had to balance herself with her hands still bound. I ignored the shocked yelp she gave out, instead choosing to slap her bottom, hard enough to leave a nasty mark. When I pulled my hand back, it wasn’t empty. I had given a tug to her panties, and its fragile fabric gave easily. I ended up with her panties in my hand, and she found herself wearing only slippers. </p><p>I popped a couple of fingers inside her, ramming repeatedly in a frenzied pace to loosen her before the main even while my other hand worked to free myself from the prison that was my pants. Less than a minute later, we were ready for action, and a majority of that was to get rid of my clothes, as she had been wet enough long before we left the studio, her panties drenched with the evidence. </p><p>Her moans, rising unbidden, was better than the celestial music for my ears. I would have let her continue, but I wasn’t willing to risk Nancy getting curious and checking the room. “Are you ready for the main event?” I whispered as I leaned forward, my shaft caressing her entrance as my lips caressed her ear. She whimpered positively. “Or maybe I should have mercy and let you rest. After all, you did the best you could.”</p><p>“Please!” she whimpered helplessly, quieter than a whisper but packed with a need that would have melt stone. </p><p>My desire to tease her was no match for it. “As you wish,” I said and pushed my shaft deep inside her. Her body, burning with an unmet desire, almost sucked it inside, earning a cry of her, loud yet satisfied. “You need to keep silent though,” I said with glee. “You don’t want Nancy to drop by to check on you, right? Or maybe you would like to explain why it’s something she should ignore.” </p><p>She opened her mouth, but I never learned what she was about to say. The reason was simple, I stuffed her mouth with the same lingerie she was wearing just moments ago, still stained with her juices. “Better,” I said even as I quickened my pace, uncaring of the effect now that her voice was permanently muffled. She didn’t show the slightest inclination to struggle, accepting with an obvious pleasure as I claimed her hole with a great fervor, underlining my ownership with occasional slaps to her bottom until both sides burned red. </p><p>I could feel her rapidly closing to the edge. In another situation, I would have slowed down, torturing her with an orgasm that refused to finalize, but I didn’t feel like it when my own heart burned with a matching need. Instead, I pulled out of her momentarily, just enough to push her a bit. She found herself lying on her back, her great tits pointing upwards. I grabbed her legs, pulling up a bit to ensure her bottom was elevated appropriately before sliding inside her once more. My hands, free once more, sank deep into the inviting flesh of her tits, leaving deep red marks that nearly matched the new color of her bottom. Soon, she started to shudder under the effect of an earthquake, one strong enough to leave her a half-drunk, trembling mess.</p><p>Still, just because I couldn’t torture her with a delayed orgasm didn’t mean that I couldn’t have messed with her at all. “I’m almost here,” I commented, but still continued to slam inside her, not giving the slightest inclination to pull back. The comment cut through her haze like a knife. She tried to say something, but her words were blurred by her makeshift gag, not that it was hard to understand what she was trying to say. Panicked, she was trying to inform me that she wasn’t currently on the pill. </p><p>Still, I waited until the last second, amused that an aborted sentence her only attempt to stop me from cumming inside her. No follow up, no attempt to push me away… Apparently, her surrender was even more complete than I had given credit for. I pushed a few more times, watching her tits jiggle unrestricted with each push, then pulled out just as it was about to spray, and painted her tits with my seed. “You’re lucky that I’m such a nice guy,” I said, punctuating it with a not-so-weak slap on her tit, one that failed to break her relaxed expression. I reached and pulled the panties out. “How was it?” I asked even as I pulled the rope off, freeing her wrists.</p><p>“Amazing,” she murmured, the haze dominating her mind once more now that the danger was passed. </p><p>“Good,” I said and waited for my shaft to jump back to life while she slid deeper into the haze. It took just a minute for my shaft to flare into life, as her beaten, stained, yet still beautiful body was good enough to resurrect the dead, yet enough the shaft of a young man enthusiastic for a few more rounds. “Are you ready for the second round?” I asked. </p><p>“Second?” she managed to mumble shocked, the question waking her from the haze she was trying to disappear into. </p><p>“Of course second,” I said as I pressed my erection against her entrance once more. “You didn’t you could get away with just a few minutes, right? We still have hours to go?” I said, sliding inside her, intending her to teach how real sex worked. </p><p>“Hours-” she repeated in shock, one that turned into another moan as I impaled her once more, but her eyes were still cloudy. It was a mystery, how many rounds she was going to last. A mystery that was quite enjoyable to explore…  </p>",

    "content": "Maria was a twenty-two years old student with an attitude problem, something to be expected when one grew up as a member of multimillionaire family that was more interested in multiplying these riches than tending to their own children. And the trust fund that deposited a mid-five-figures allowance to her account each month didn’t help any, nor the boys that bustled around her continuously, impressed with her beauty. <p>Currently, she was driving a small, black convertible. She was also wearing a small, bright red dress that went deep enough in her chest to give an extended preview of her treasures, requiring constant care to maintain the limited coverage it provided to her treasures. The wind slid hard through her hair as she drove through the abandoned road, with a considerably higher speed than what was allowed. </p><p>She had a very good reason to ignore the speed limit. She was late for a party. Normally, it wouldn’t be a problem, as one of the socialites of the town, she preferred to be fashionably late. But today was an exception, as there was a hunky linebacker that was visiting the party that she was looking forward to get acquainted, but so was that slut Eleanor. Maria wanted to be there before that upstart could make much progress. Not that she would be putting out for him of course. He looked like an entitled asshole that would think he deserved to make the choices, failing to acknowledge to treat her tenderly as she deserved. She did have standards.</p><p>She wasn’t worried about the speed she was making, because the road she was driving was always empty late evening. Or so she thought until she noticed a car on her rear-view mirror, one with bright, flickering lights on top. “Fuck,” she murmured. Police, the last thing she needed. For a moment, she considered pushing the pedal to the limit, trying to ditch it, after all, a shitty state car wouldn’t be able to catch up with her beautiful speed car, but she refrained. It was very inconvenient, but her trust fund had certain requirements that, if violated, could result in significant reductions. A challenge that she could ill-afford at this point in her life. </p><p>She pulled on the side, then grabbed the sides of her dress and pulled it down a bit, enhancing her cleavage even further. More than once, she had managed to avoid a ticket like that. The amount was trivial, but she already had two speeding tickets for this year, and the third one came with the temporary loss of her driving license, and a corresponding drop in her allowance as per her trust fund guidelines. </p><p> She started cursing when she saw the figure stepping out of the car. A policewoman, meaning both her dress and her perfect figure - maintained through a combination of semi-illegal nutrients and endless pilates sessions- had become a liability rather than an asset in avoiding her ticket. She reached to her bag in panic, hiding several banknotes in her hand as the policewoman closed in her car, cursing herself for having a couple of drinks before leaving the house. She hadn’t drunken much, but it was enough to add a DUI charge to her bill if she turned out to be a jealous bitch. </p><p>A relaxed sigh escaped her mouth as the policewoman drew closer, enough for Maria to see the details of her figure. She was a tall, statuesque woman whose voluptuous but powerful figure showed even through the baggy policewoman clothing. Her face was more striking than beautiful, too different to be called classically pretty, but impressive nevertheless. Enough that she wouldn’t feel intimidated by her beauty, Maria thought. </p><p>“Ma’am, do you know why I pulled you over,” she asked, her voice smoother and more melodic than Maria had expected. </p><p>She looked at her, fluttering her eyes in an attractive manner in reflex, but stopped with a blush when she met only with a raised eyebrow. “No officer,” she said, trying to sound vulnerable now that the sex wasn’t an option. She would have tried intimidation track, but looking at the icy blue eyes of the policewoman, she didn’t believe that it would work. “I don’t know why you pulled me over.” </p><p>She sighed, a resigned sound that told the tale of numerous times she had heard the exact same words, then pointed at the sign which Maria conveniently pulled under. “I pulled you over because you were doing 85 in a 30 zone. Do you have any idea how dangerous it is, both for you and for the others.” </p><p>Maria edged to side to look at the sign, cursing herself at the misfortune of pulling exactly under the reminder of her rule-breaking, which would make harder for her to get away scot-free, as visual reminders of rules and authority made it harder for people to deviate from the rules even when there was no direct connection. It was one of the few things she had wholeheartedly listened in psychology lessons, how to better manipulate people. “I’m so sorry officer,” she said, trying to sound like a vulnerable teenager. “I was going for an important event and lost the track of my speed. Please forgive me.”</p><p>“With all due respect, losing the track of your speed while traveling through a dark country road doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in your driving skills, or your general awareness,” she said, but her melodic voice was soft enough to suggest that Maria had a good chance of getting away. “I’m afraid that if I just let go, I’ll be just enabling you for more.” </p><p>“I understand, officer,” Maria said. “But there was an emergency, and I was trying to get there. I’m sorry to break any laws, and I promise I won’t be doing it again. Is there a way that we can forget that ever happened.” </p><p>Her expression softened quite a bit. “We’ll see,” she murmured. “License and registration please.” </p><p>Maria was acutely aware of her cleavage as she leaned forward, and not in a good way, afraid of begetting jealousy. She pulled off her registration from there, and pulled her license from the small designer bag she had. She passed both to the police officer, including the extra banknotes that she managed to slip inside. No harm sweating the deal a bit, she thought.</p><p>The officer flipped through the registration until the money Maria slipped inside had fallen. “What’s that?” </p><p>Maria felt the hairs on her neck rise at those words. She considered the merits of ignoring the question, or acting like it was just an accident, but the softness of her voice was enough to convince her that going forward was the better option. She sounded receptive. “A small gift,” Maria murmured. “For your consideration.” </p><p>“I see,” the policewoman murmured softly in a kind voice, one convinced Maria that the issue was solved satisfactorily. She was reaching towards the key when the patrolwoman spoke once more. “Please step out of the car.”</p><p>Maria felt the beginnings of a panic in her heart. It wasn’t just her words, but the subtle shift in her tone, sounding dangerous despite its softness. “Officer, I-” she started speaking, trying to recover, but the policewoman cut her off. </p><p>“I said, step out of the car,” she repeated in a sharper voice, no crumble of softness remaining. Maria realized that she had fucked up, badly. She opened the door while trying to suppress the feeling of panic that was rising in her heart, trying to think up a way that she could save herself from the situation. “Put your hands on the side of the car, and stand straight,” she added. </p><p>Maria did so, still trying to think of ways to get away without losing a portion of the access for her precious trust fund. “Officer-” she tried to interject once more, only to be cut again. </p><p>“Silence,” she ordered, and Maria felt her hulking presence just a step behind her, the height difference even more apparent with the flats she was wearing to make driving comfortable. “Offering a bribe to a police officer is a felony, did you know that?” </p><p>She did know that, but failed to consider consequences while trying to escape the ticket itself, not when the previous officers she had bribed accepted the offer without any complication in similar situations. After all, it was just a ticket. And it was just her luck to come across a principled one that was also immune to the carnal ways of resolving the issue. </p><p>“I asked you a question!” the policewoman said, after a couple seconds of silence, cold and professional. </p><p>“No, officer,” she said reflexively. Playing ignorance had a better chance of working, she decided, but still afraid that things would escalate. It wasn’t that she was afraid of going to jail. No, the family lawyers were skilled enough to get the case thrown in the court, but she also knew that they were instructed to never reduce the sentences below community service. To make the lesson stick, in her mother’s words. But Maria could ill afford to have a picture of herself in those ugly jumpsuits, doing community work. It would destroy the image she had carefully cultivated, and the less said, the better for the possibility of a someone like Eleanor getting a hold of such pictures. </p><p>“Good,” the policewoman said, her voice softer once more. A flicker of hope found itself back to Maria’s heart. “The only problem is, I don’t believe you,” she continued, and that flicker died just as quick. “You are a textbook spoiled rich girl. Nice car, slutty dress, and the expectations that just because you can wave a thick wad of cash, everything will work out well. Today is the day you learn that it’s not always the case.” </p><p>A whimper escaped Maria’s mouth, feeling intimidated as she watched the policewoman through the reflection, her presence getting more intimidating with each passing second. “Please,” she whispered, trying to sound pitiful. </p><p>“Silent,” she ordered. “It’s search time. Let’s see if you’re hiding anything interesting.” </p><p>“Go ahead,” Maria said, relatively calm. At least, she was clear on that front. She never carried any drugs with her, nor her dress had the capability of hiding anything. She felt a pair of hands pressing against her back, somehow feeling strict despite their softness. They did a complete circle, meeting at her belly before traveling several inches and doing a repeat, rapid and professional. However, when a few repeats later, her hands arrived at the edges of her breast, trailing them in a much slower manner, hinting suggestiveness, hope was alight in Maria’s heart once more. Maybe a sexual solution wasn’t as impossible as she first thought. “Officer,” she gasped, trying to add a certain mischievous innocence in her helplessness. “Is there a different way we can handle it without escalating it.” </p><p>She didn’t answer, but for Maria, she hadn’t had to. Not when her hands started exploring the edge of her breasts with a deliberate slowness, passing over the barrier to tease the parts of her globes uncovered by her dress. Soon, her hands trailed down until they were resting on the bottom part of her dress, meaning her fingers were directly on her bottom, squeezing softly. “Maybe,” she whispered, her lips close enough to touch her earlobe. “I’m a firm believer of teaching a lesson to children so they won’t end up being spoiled, and the current legal system is not always effective doing that. If you agree to keep your mouth shut and consent to my way of teaching punishment, maybe I could be more lenient.” One of her hands slid past the edge of her dress, trailing her inner thigh. “What do you say?” </p><p>Maria hadn’t had to fake the enthusiasm in her tone when she whispered a positive answer. It wouldn’t be the first time she felt the female touch, and the officer was an impressive specimen of womanhood, even though she was different than her usual lowers. “I accept, officer,” she said. </p><p>“Good,” she whispered, soft and sensual, her fingers trailing over her nether lips, the presence of her lacy panties doing little to reduce the sensation. A purr escaped her mouth. Things had worked out quite well, she decided. </p><p>Then, everything shifted. </p><p>Maria felt a presence pressing between her shoulder blades, and she found herself pressing against the hood of her car. The fingers that had been trailing her nether lips gently took a hold of her panties. Maria felt a sharp tug, followed by ripping sound, and a sudden breeze downstairs. “What’s going on!” she said even as she tried to struggle, realizing her expensive panties were in ruins, but she a finger over her lips, cutting her words. </p><p>“Shush, little girl,” the officer whispered, her lips once again tickling Maria’s earlobe. “You asked me to take over your punishment, and I’m doing exactly that.” She pulled back, then forced Maria to turn until she was looking at her face, sharp and intimidating. “Or do you want to renege on our deal.” A chill spread through Maria’s body as she shook her head desperately. “Good girl,” she said, and just as sudden, an unfamiliar warmth replaced the chill, similar to, yet different from post-coital bliss she was acquainted quite closely. </p><p>She hadn’t had much opportunity to think about the reaction of her body, however, distracted an explosion of pain no her bottom, followed by a sharp sound. She yelled in pain, but the hands that held her prisoner didn’t listen to her plea, and landed on her bottom a second later. “It hurts,” she complained, though the sense of humiliation was not far away from pain. </p><p>“Good,” the officer said even as her hand bounced from Maria’s firm ass once more. “Pain is a good teacher. Is this the first time you’re being spanked?”</p><p>“Yes,” she admitted. Her parents were a strictly non-physical, both in punishment and in praise, and the rare boy she took to bed knew better than treating her anything other than the princess she was.  </p><p>“Pity,” the officer murmured. “I doubt you would be such a spoiled failure if your mother hadn’t been too busy for a few spanks when you were younger. Pain is a good teacher.” Her hand landed on Maria’s butt once more, this time even harder to reinforce the message. “Still, all is well. I’m here to fix it.” Another beat. </p><p>Maria had lost track of the beats that was raining on her bottom, paying more attention to the tears that were gathering on her eyes, occasional one sliding down her cheek, disrupting her makeup. Then, the assault stopped, as sudden as it started, allowing Maria to take a breath. “Is it over?” she murmured, her voice cracking under the weight of unshed tears. </p><p>“It is,” the officer said. Maria tried to smile to celebrate the end of her situation, but a sudden hollow feeling in her prevented her from enjoying it. Before she could examine the reason, the officer spoke once more, destroying her equilibrium all over. “With that’s out of the way, we can move on the real event.”</p><p>“What real event?” Maria said, or tried to say, as she made an attempt to stand straight, only for a hand to press on her back once more. Her chest collided with the hood of the car, her breath escaping explosively, murdering the second half of her sentence. She tried to take another breath to enable her words, but before she could, she felt her fingers pressing against her entrance. She opened her mouth, but shocked with the sudden escalation of events, she didn’t know what to say. Convenient, as the fingers slid inside her mercilessly, forcibly pulling a cry off her lips, destroying her ability to form words for a foreseeable future. </p><p>Maria felt confused as she never felt before as she lay on top of her car in an abandoned stretch of road, fingers of an Amazonian police officer impaling her repeatedly, a mixture of familiar and unfamiliar sensations invading her mind like never before. She wanted to say something, but with her mind shorted out, all that left her mouth was bottomless cries that echoed on the dark hills that surrounded them. She didn’t understand. For all accounts, she should have been hating the moment she was in, penetrated forcefully by a stranger with no regard to her desires and sensitivities, like she was a toy to be trashed. </p><p>But she loved it. Not just the boundless pleasure radiating from her core with every pump of fingers, but also the glowing pain off her butt, which the chill of evening air unable to soothe completely. But most of all, she loved the absolute loss of control she experienced, more lost than an autumn leaf under a gale wind, flying to the parts unknown, bending under her will, helpless to do anything. </p><p>With that realization, a dam broke inside, and pleasure enveloped her body with an orgasm that she never felt before. Flashes filled her field of vision, drums covering her ears. It was fortunate that her weight was against her car, as her legs lost their ability to carry any load, trembling horribly. </p><p>She felt something pressing against her lips. Her mouth opened, and a weird, unfamiliar taste filled her mouth. A second later, she realized it was her own taste that invaded her tastebuds, but like everything else, she just accepted it passively. </p><p>“I think you learned your lesson,” the officer whispered into her ear. “Have a nice evening.” Maria listened to the footsteps getting away, followed by ravings of an engine, and a car driving away, leaving her alone with her thoughts, more jumbled than ever. </p><p>But she knew one thing. It was just a beginning... </p>",

    "content": "My heart was beating my chest mercilessly while I directed Katie towards the snacks bar, and more importantly, away from the room where Madison was busy trying to gather herself back to a shape where she could mix with the people without indecency charges. Thankfully, I wasn’t lacking material to distract her. “How was the movie?” I asked. <p>“It was okay,” Katie answered, but her burning face indicated her feelings about the movie was a tad stronger than her mild description had suggested. Her shyness was begging for me to mess with her, so I wrapped my arm around her waist, pulling her closer. “Stephen!” she exclaimed in protest, but she made absolutely no attempt to pull back. Despite all we had done, she was still feeling still under my unfamiliar touch, which would be annoying if I couldn’t see her obvious enjoyment. </p><p>Still, it was something that needed to get better. “You need to be able to feel more comfortable with casual intimacy. Think about what would happen if Madison had stepped out, seeing you trying to stay in distance. Do you want her to be suspicious after all the effort you have put in this?” She looked away, but let her body to relax in my embrace, which was all I needed. I put my finger below her chin, pushing slightly, leading her to raise her head. Her eyes met mine questioningly, but before her lips could form that question, I captured them in a slow, lingering kiss.  </p><p>With Katie softened and Madison exhausted, I had high hopes for the second half of the movie, and even more for the date that would follow. Unfortunately, the kiss was cut by the annoying ringing of my phone. I raised it in annoyance, intending to close it before shifting my attention back to Katie’s pretty lips, only to be forced to change plans when I noticed the name on the display. The caller was a client that I was trying to set a meeting for the last six months. “Sorry, I need to take this,” I said to Katie before raising the phone to my ear, stepping away to talk. </p><p>The call lasted for less than a minute, but it managed to derail my plans for the afternoon. “Sorry, Katie,” I said with a genuine regret in my voice. “But it was a last minute emergency from an important client. And they are too important for me to blow.” Which was accurate, as I was trying to get some work from them for the last few months, but failed because they already had a working arrangement with one the bigger agencies in the town, but apparently, the money they were asking was starting to get too much, hence their willingness to test some new talent. Katie was a smart girl, able to understand what I was driving at, but I still told it explicitly. “They just invited me for a meeting, and unfortunately, it’s just half an hour later.” </p><p>“It’s okay,” Katie murmured, though her expression told a different story. It wasn’t hard to emphasize, because I was feeling quite bummed as well. Everything had been aligned, the movie, mood, not to mention the opening I had been struggling to arrange in an elegant fashion that left me just a step away from success. Alas, sometimes plans didn’t work as expected. </p><p>“Thanks, honey, you’re very understanding,” I said before hugging her for one last time, pressing my hands to her back, low enough to be dangerously close to her bottom. Her expression of shock was understandable, as there was little chance Madison would jump out from the door at the exact moment of my hug. She was frozen like a cute Popsicle when I pulled back. “See you at home,” I added before she pushed through her shock to say anything, and walked away. </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>It was nearing midnight when I finally pulled my car to the driveway. I was sweaty, exhausted, and hungry, though none of them managed to reduce the sense of satisfaction I was feeling. Not after I had managed to get a sizable job from one of the biggest fashion companies in the town. Yes, it was a limited budget work for a seasonal line of clothing they were trying to enter, and I could easily lose it if my work was substandard, but regardless, it was an amazing career opportunity for me. </p><p>I glanced at the back-seat, where a large box lay, filled with costumes, next to a smaller one that filled with a range of plastic accessories, from handcuffs to plastic weapons. It was unexpected for a large lingerie company like that to enter a niche market like adult-focused costumes. Or not, I amended my thoughts a second later, remembering the way people dressed around the school in the last Halloween. People liked to free their inner perverts that day, and it made sense for them to be there. After all, it wasn’t just underwear they sold, but the promise of sexiness. </p><p>However, my mind was back on more important topics as I stepped out of the car, like who was going to model for them. Nicole was a given, but unfortunately, I couldn’t use her for the whole set. The client had asked for variety. Maybe I could Katie to pose for them, especially for the tamer ones. After all, while she owed me for helping her issues with Madison, I doubted that it was enough to convince her to dress as a slutty maid, in a costume that was barely fit to be called underwear. Madison might have been willing to help, but that wasn’t without its challenges, such as explaining why I was living in Katie’s basement. </p><p>I must have done something nice to get lady luck’s blessing, because I met my answer as soon as I stepped in the living room. Nancy was at the kitchen table, examining the piece of paper in her hand with an expression of total disbelief. I hadn’t needed to ask her to know it was a letter informing her about the rejection of her book, a development which left her in the hook to pay back a significant amount. I couldn’t have engineered a better solution even if I tried. </p><p>“Hi, Nancy,” I said as I walked towards her, with the boxes in my hand. </p><p>“Hi, Stephen,” she murmured in response, not even bothering to lift her head as she answered. There was an aura of sadness around her, one that tried to keep people away, but I ignored it in favor of walking closer to her, stopping only to drop my load on a spare chair. </p><p>I pulled the chair next to her before speaking once more. “You don’t sound well. Am I right to assume it’s the letter from the publisher, and it has an answer different than what you were hoping?” </p><p>“Right in one, do you want a medal,” she answered bitingly before her sarcasm was replaced with panic. “Oh my god, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.” </p><p>I waved her apology for her blowup with a careless gesture. “Don’t worry about it. You are annoyed, and lashing out is to be expected. No offense taken.” </p><p>She nodded resolutely. “Still, I shouldn’t have said that. It’s not like you had anything to do with this monumental disaster.” </p><p>“Is there no hope left? It’s a definite rejection.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, it is.” She took a deep breath, her voice hitching. “And you know what’s annoying. It’s not like they have a trouble with anything important. One of them accidentally mentioned that the editor that picked my book had a fight with the owner. Canceling my book is just a way to show her who is the boss.” </p><p>“Disgraceful,” I said, though I could scarcely say I was shocked. It was one of the nasty lessons of the business world, a career could easily be ruined by the battle of giants, stampeded under their feet as they battled. “Still, look at the positive. It means that your book is as good as you think. It should be easy to find a new publisher.” </p><p>“Maybe, but I need to pay the advance in a week. I don’t have that kind of money.” She sighed deeply. “My mother is going to kill me.” </p><p>I carefully hid my smirk before speaking. “Maybe I could be in assistance.” </p><p>She turned to look at me so quick that I was sure she got whiplash. “How? Can I borrow some from you to match the advance?”  </p><p>“Unfortunately not,” I answered, but pointed at the box of clothes before she could answer. “However, I just received a box of Halloween costumes, and I need a model for them. Maybe you could be that model. There is a lot of costumes to do, and if you do all I ask, you should be able to cover your advance with your earnings.” </p><p>An expression of indecision wasn’t something unexpected. “Me? A model,” she murmured, unbelieving. </p><p>“Why not,” I countered. “You are a young, beautiful woman who would look amazing in those costumes, and I’m a decent photographer if I so myself. I’m sure we can handle them perfectly between us.” </p><p>“Really,” she said, her indecision replaced with a blush, showing her weakness for compliments, not to mention an opportunity to enjoy her exhibitionism without repercussion. “Do you think I can do it,” she said. But her enthusiasm wasn’t long-lived. “But I can’t. Can you imagine the reaction if mom saw them.” </p><p>Nothing much, I guessed, considering some of the pictures that rested comfortably in my hard disk, but I couldn’t tell Nancy that. “You don’t need to worry on that account. Each costume comes with a mask, so no one will know you’re the model.”</p><p>She stilled for a second, but a smile slowly pushed to her face as she assessed the idea. “We need to do the shots when no one else is at home, to make sure mom doesn’t come across it,” she said. I nodded in satisfaction. Her focus on the logistics of the shots meant she was close to capitulation. “And how many costumes do you have?” </p><p>I quickly went through the potentials, and which would fit Nancy the best. Probably six, I decided, cycling through the costumes, mentally assigning some of them to Nicole as well. “Eight,” I said, leaving myself a margin of two in case of a last minute change, or for some experimentation if I could manage to finish easily. </p><p>“Eight,” she repeated, surprised. “That’s quite a bit of money for each costume.” </p><p>“Modeling is a lucrative business if you can find regular work. The trick is to establish a network to bring that.” I shrugged. “Still, we could discuss the opportunities of an alternate career another time. Are you willing to model for me for the Halloween costumes?” </p><p>For a moment, she stayed silent, but I couldn’t say it was a surprise to receive her eventual nod, agreeing to my proposition. With no job and no opportunity, she would either tell her mother about her sudden need of cash, creating a crisis that wasn’t best advised for an adult that still lived with her parents, or she would model for me. Funny thing was that Nicole would be able to give her the money without any issue, as she was suddenly cash-rich thanks to her own modeling. A smirk appeared on my face, imagining how they would react if they learn each other's side gig. Too bad it would be too damaging for me to risk it, no matter how entertaining it would be. </p><p>“Let’s go then,” I said, then stood up, only stopping to pick up the box before continuing towards the basement. I was halfway through the stairs when I heard her footsteps, rapidly getting closer, but I chose to say nothing. I had already the box and was removing the first uniform from it when Nancy stood in front of me. </p><p>“Are we going to do it right now?” she asked in a tone of total disbelief. </p><p>“Sure,” I answered. “Do you have anything else to do?” </p><p>“No, but-” she said, only to be cut halfway. </p><p>“Perfect, then we can start now,” I said, doing my best to convey the finality of the decision. </p><p>Caught flat-footed by the sudden change of demeanor, she wasn’t able to do anything but nod passively. “Is that my costume?” she muttered a minute later, trying to sound nonchalant, but a slight tremble in her tone betraying her discomfort. She might be a closet exhibitionist, but she did that in her own terms. Forced to dress in a revealing dress was different. Still, she managed to fake a confident look.</p><p>I just nodded, trying not to show my satisfaction. Artificial self-confidence was one of the easiest emotions to manipulate, especially if it was built on a shaky foundation. It didn’t take a genius to know that I could push her well-past her comfort zone. Whenever I pushed her to a new level of discomfort, she would do her best to fake comfort, like it was her own idea in the first place. </p><p>“It doesn’t look a lot,” she said when I lifted the first costume up for her view, a thematically-modified police uniform, its skirt short enough to qualify as underwear. The shirt was slightly transparent as well, not to mention short enough to leave the stomach bare. The accompanying underwear looked substantial though, enough to cover the deficiencies of the costume up to a point. </p><p>“Don’t worry, this is not everything,” I said as I passed the set to her before starting my search in the other bag. A flicker of hope appeared on her face with my words, only to wither when I showed her the rest of the costume, a midnight-blue mask that would cover the upper half of her face, and lace-covered handcuffs, and a pair of stilettos in the same midnight blue color. “You can change behind the screen.” </p><p>For a moment, she was frozen in an obvious internal accounting, measuring the relative benefits of canceling the deal and explaining the situation to her mother. But as the saying went, pride came before the fall. Her resigned expression was enough answer. She nodded in a confident manner, almost enough to be believable if it wasn’t for her steps, being forcibly dragged towards the screen. I was tempted to poke fun at her, but I was reticent of changing her decision before her full commitment.</p><p>I busied myself with technical details as I waited for her to come out, setting up the lights, ensuring the batteries were fully charged, and various other small tasks. But five minutes later, there was still no sight of her. “Is there something wrong?” I asked despite guessing she was feeling too shy to step out. “Do you need any help with the costume?”   </p><p>“No, no!” she answered in an obvious display of panic, proving the accuracy of my guess. “I had a bit of trouble with the shoes, but I  managed to fix it. I’m coming out now.” </p><p>I had to wait another minute despite her assertion, but the resulting view was well worth the wait. I had known the beauty that rested under her casual clothes thanks to her revealing tendencies. But dressed in a slightly-transparent costume built from a small piece of fabric while still maintaining the idea of a policewoman, she looked exquisite, like a present that was begging to be unwrapped. Her mask just added to the mystery. </p><p>However, despite her striking beauty, she failed to exhume the effortless eroticism Nicole had displayed from the first moment she stood in front of the camera. I couldn’t help but feel disappointed despite knowing it was unfair. Nicole was a miracle in front of a camera, instincts of a model coupled with the demeanor of a servant. Nancy was still beautiful, and I was good enough to fake the emotions through the camera, especially with an easy prop like a sexy-policewoman uniform. The presence of her underwear, visible through the thin fabric reduced the difficulty to a trivial level.  </p><p>“Okay, stand in a way that feels comfortable to you and give me a smile,” I said. I wasn’t expecting her to cross her arms around her chest in an attempt to reduce her display, but I allowed it to pass uncommented. Showing herself in front of the camera was much different than the calculated displays she put out for me occasionally. This time, she had no control. Still, I said nothing, as mellowing her was much more important than needling her, or making sure first few test pictures looked nice. </p><p>First few minutes, I hadn’t said anything other than small pose corrections, letting her get used to being photographed. “Now, let your arms fell to the side,” I said, only to get a baleful glare which was visible even through the mask. I snorted in amusement. “You don’t think we can complete whole the set with your arms crossed around your chest, do you?” Her expression implied that she was willing to consider that possibility, but I glared at her silently until she dropped the idea, and her arms with it. “That’s better,” I said as the shutter clicked once more, immortalizing the view, including her breasts under the deficient cover of her costume. </p><p>“Is it over?” she murmured when I stopped after a few shots, taking a small break to examine her figure. </p><p>“Not even close,” I answered in good humor. “It’s a commercial shoot, we need a huge range of photos to ensure we have what client needs. Now, cross your arms under your chest.” She did so, which enhanced the view of her chest considerably. “Amazing,” I said, and a proud smile popped to her face, one that was instantly replaced with discomfort after my next words. “Could you please pop open first two buttons.” </p><p>“Two?” she asked in a trembling voice, rightfully so as even in the current state, the costume had a considerably deep cleavage. </p><p>“You know what, you’re right,” I murmured. “Two wouldn’t give the desired effect. Make it three,” I ordered, acting like I had misunderstood the reason for her complain. </p><p>“Three?” she repeated, this time barely a whisper. </p><p>“Come on, Nancy, we can’t finish it if you try to push back for my every order,” I said, underlining my words with a sharp look. Her expression showed that she didn’t appreciate my comment, showing a marked difference from Nicole’s meek obedience, but she didn’t say anything. Not surprising, with the responsibility of paying her advance back hanging above her like the sword of Damocles. With trembling fingers, she reached for the buttons, undoing them one by one, my arousal growing with her widening cleavage. I took a few more photos. “Perfect, now, bring your cap over your cleavage, and raise the handcuffs in the other.” </p><p>I have ordered through a few poses, but I could read the signals that she was reaching her limit. I decided to bring today’s shoot to an end, as I already had more than enough to accommodate the client’s needs. But before calling it over, I had one last image in mind that I wanted to immortalize. “It’s almost over,” I said consolingly, and she smiled. “I just need to take a couple of photos that actually use the prop,” I explained as I walked towards her. </p><p>“Pass me the cuffs, then put your hands behind your back,” I ordered. She didn’t look very enthusiastic about the idea, but passed them to me nevertheless before putting her arms behind her back, and I put the cuffs on. It was a struggle to pull my hands away from her body after setting up the scene, as with forcing her arms her back also enhanced her cleavage considerably, straining her bra’s capacity to keep them contained. Especially attractive, the corner of her areolas peeking through the edge. </p><p>After the brief struggle against my desires, I managed to pull back without creating a scene, and took a few quick photos before ordering her to sit down to the chair and lean forward, then took a few more photos, wishing that she didn’t have the mask on, because the angry expression she doubtlessly wore would have been an amazing contrast. Alas, we didn’t always get what we wanted. “Congratulations for successful completion of your first photo shoot,” I called as I walked back to unlock the handcuffs. I didn’t even consider faking her about the customary hug, having a good idea the explosive reaction that might follow. </p><p>“Finally,” she murmured in elation. </p><p>I could understand her concern, as it was a difficult thing to undress in front of a stranger, and the nice thing was to act understanding. Luckily, I was not a nice person. Actually, I could go as far as to say I was an old-school bastard, which meant I didn’t have to act nice. “We can skip the rest if it was such a bother to you,” I commented even as I walked away, my voice intentionally cold. </p><p>“I’m sorry Stephen,” she said as she took a few quick steps, in which I had to struggle to keep my gaze away from her chest, as the flimsy bra was creaking under the pressure of her sudden movement. “Don’t think that I’m not appreciating what you’re doing. You’re a lifesaver. It’s just that it was more exhausting than I had first thought.” </p><p>“It’s tougher than it looks,” I said, my voice warmer, but the sting still there to remind her about her ungratefulness. It was better if she felt a bit unsafe in the deal we made, making her more compliant to my future request, especially the ones that involved sexier costumes. I watched her disappear behind the screen, my mind busy planning the next stage. </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>Still, my plans for that night was not over. I reached for another small bag after Nancy left my room, revealing a bunch of small cameras. I went upstairs, and a couple minutes later, they were hidden in various corners of the room, giving me a continuous feed of the living room. It was a decision I reached after my last encounter with Nicole, where I carried her naked through the living room without knowing whether someone was there. </p><p>I returned the room and turned on my phone, checking the visuals to see everything was working perfectly. High-definition visuals of the living room told me that it was. Just as I was about to turn off the phone and go to sleep, however, I caught a movement around the stairs. Nancy was walking downstairs, dressed in her usual revealingly casual sleepwear. </p><p>There was a smirk on my face as I continued watching, remembering the last time when I almost caught her in a very compromising state. Her sneaky walk, and the occasional fearful glances she sent towards the door, all suggested that the following minutes were going to be interesting.</p><p>I pulled my shaft from its confines as she turned on the TV, and the scenes from an erotic movie filled the screen. Her hand slid inside her deficient shorts, her face alight with the first scraps of pleasure, still glancing towards my door often, as the risk of being caught pushing her even deeper on the road of pleasure. Scraps that built-up quickly to a roaring inferno in seconds, telling me that, for all of her complaints, she enjoyed being in front of the camera, deficiently dressed, as much as I enjoyed staying behind, recording that sights.  </p><p>Her other hand found her breasts, but unfortunately, slid under her shirt, depriving me of an interesting sight. Another disappointing dimension, her hands quickened in their rhythm, and soon, she started shuddering, well before I could even bring myself to climax. Still, having a recording of her, frantically masturbating after a session was a sufficient reward. I watched as she stumbled forward on the stairs she walked down just minutes earlier, her alertness long forgotten. </p><p>My tenancy got even more fun. </p>",

    "content": "It was an amazing experience, watching my landlady panting and wheezing after an earth-shattering orgasm brought by my fingers, even if a part of my mind was busy with that to do next, aware that I need to act before she could gather herself enough to throw off the spell. The easy choice would be just pushing her down and having my way with her on the basement floor. She was in no mood to reject my advances. But I couldn’t help but feel that it somehow cheapened the impressiveness of my achievement. <p>Her bedroom, a flash went through my brain. Her bedroom, demanded a voice from the depths of my male ego. I wanted to have her in her own bedroom for the first time, violating her most sacred sanctuary as well as her body, in declaration of my full ownership. </p><p>With the decision made, I moved on to the next problem, how to travel to her bedroom without arousing suspicion. The simplest solution would be to let her redress, allowing her to walk upstairs under her power. A simple solution that would prevent a total meltdown if we came across one of her step-daughters at upstairs.  </p><p>But once again, I was reluctant to go with the simpler option. It was a tame, colorless solution that destroyed the excitement of the moment, not to mention allowing her to gather her wits together to a degree, risking to waste all my efforts that led to the point. The better option sparked in my mind as I watched her struggling to stand up, only for her trembling limbs to fail. “Let me help you,” I said with a smile as I fell on my knees and slid my arms under her before standing up. A yelp escaped her mouth as she found herself in a bridal hold, her arms wrapping around my neck in an instinctual panic. I could feel her shivering on my arms, pressing tight against her as they kept her hovering.</p><p>But it was nothing compared to tremble that passed through her skin when she realized my destination, climbing the stairs. “What are you-” she started, only for her sentence to cut halfway when I shushed her. </p><p>“I’m bringing you to your room, of course,” I answered, my voice was an epitome of calmness like the situation was perfectly ordinary. </p><p>With that answer, she stilled for a while. Not because it was a reasonable or convincing one, but it was so out of the ordinary that she was unable to process. I was at the top of the stairs, and about to open the door when she found her voice again, this time tinged with panic. “Stop!” she whispered. “What if my daughters see us?” </p><p>“That would be unfortunate,” I answered to her, but didn’t let it delay me even a second from opening the door. It would be unfortunate, I agreed in my mind, considering the near-impossibility of seducing them if one of them saw me carrying the almost naked figure of their stepmother in the middle of the night, bearing the obvious signs of a successfully concluded sexual encounter. “But it’s already late, and they should be in their rooms. If you keep your voice down, there shouldn’t be any danger.” </p><p>There was no TV sound in the room, meaning Nancy wasn’t in the living room for another round of carnal pleasure, probably spooked by the near-miss of yesterdays. An unfortunate occurrence in any other situation but this one. I continued my trek through the living room and reached to the stairs which led to the upstairs, and she didn’t make a whit of sound, frozen in shock. </p><p>I decided to liven up the situation a bit, so I slid my hand over thighs until my fingers were caressing the edge of her bottom. She whimpered in shock as I took the first step on the stairs. But the voice was nothing compared to the moan that left her mouth when my hands slid further, probing her nether lips. I looked at her mockingly despite a small jolt of adrenaline, afraid of being caught. The expression of growing panic, delicious in its fullness, told me that she was aware of the same risk, a risk that was affecting her much stronger. Her hands, previously limp in their exhaustion, jumped to her lips in an effort to suppress her voice.</p><p>A good call, I noted, as I had no intention of leaving her alone just to keep the risk down. My fingers slid inside her, several beats for each step we cleared. She cried, but her voice was unable to escape from barrier her fingers created, woven tight in front of her lips. At least, not in a volume that would matter. </p><p>Rest of the journey passed quick, though it was certainly memorable with Nicole squirming helplessly under my touch while doing her best to keep her voice suppressed, her body rubbing to mine in a natural consequence. I enjoyed the sensation with the each second of movement despite the annoying barrier my clothes presented. Still, I wished I took the time to remove my shirt at least. It wasn’t like my bare chest would make the situation any worse. </p><p>Her bedroom door was conveniently cracked, allowing me to open it with just a push, no need to allow her feet on the ground, which would lend a portion of control back to her. Just a sliver of power, but it was better if she was lacking even that, helpless under my grasp. </p><p>I pushed, revealing a pastel-colored room, furnished sparse, unassuming, not rating anything other than a glance, especially with my encumbered state. Nicole was a beautiful, curvy woman, and she wasn’t exactly short either, meaning that carrying her wasn’t something that could be called a trivial effort. Not that I wouldn’t be willing to carry her for much longer, I corrected in my mind as I glanced forward, watching the relief spreading to her face, assuming that the unique situation she found herself trapped in was finally over. I couldn’t wait until informing that there was still a third act left to play in our little tale. </p><p>I let her on her feet, my fingers getting out of her wet tunnel, accommodating despite her tightness, though needed to wrap my fingers around her arm for a moment, supporting her trembling legs as they adapted to the unexpected strain. </p><p>An expression of confusion passed over her face as she found herself in a situation well-outside her comfort zone, standing in the middle of her own bedroom with a man that she knew for a few days, naked for all practical purposes. For a while, she stood still in a display of total confusion, her arms risen to cover her breasts, though they were limp, aware that it was well-past to point of hiding. </p><p>Seconds passed silent, and she did nothing but looking on the ground, overwhelmed with the situation. A part of me wanted to see for how long she would stand without uttering a word, waiting for my command. Unfortunately, my patience was not limitless, especially under such tempting circumstances. Instead of waiting for her to gather her wits, I sat on her bed. She turned towards me, resolutely avoiding my gaze. “Apologize!” I suddenly ordered, my voice sharpest it had even been all night. </p><p>Her surprised expression, I expected. After all, it was the reason I gave her that order, without any explanation or apparent reason. “I’m sorry,” she stammered automatically before realizing she didn’t know the reason for it. “What did I do?” she added seconds later, confusion marring her face. </p><p>“It’s even worse that you aren’t aware,” I added, doing my best to keep my face straight. “I have put all that effort for your comfort, carrying you upstairs to help you since you were having trouble walking, but whispering a word of appreciation seems to be too much of a bother for you. Quite rude, don’t you think?” </p><p>“I am truly sorry,” she repeated her earlier sentiment, surprising me even more. I was expecting more resistance against the stupid crime I just created. I wondered just how much I needed to push her before she gave the slightest push-back. </p><p>“I accept your apology,” I said, and a note of relief passed through her face, one that lasted until my next words. “However, you won’t learn without a bit of reminder to help the message stick.” I patted my leg, inviting her to my lap, and an expression of total shock passed through her face, as well as the beginnings of an outrage. Though the second part of the equation didn’t take much to disperse. A hardened gaze was all it took to bring back her chastised expression. She took a step forward like she was hypnotized, followed by another one, and soon, she was lowering herself on my lap. </p><p>I had to admit, I was tempted to whip out my cock and slide inside her. By this time, it was obvious that there would be no repercussions if I did so, she was like a puppy, eager to please after a mistake. Instead, one of my hands found her waist while the other pressed her back, forcing her to lay on my lap, her bountiful butt primed for my attention. “Physical pain might be the best reminder,” I said nonchalantly like it was nothing out of ordinary, though my apparent calmness hid my own nervousness. I had been pushing her too far too soon, risking an explosion even counting her submissiveness. </p><p>The first spank landed before she could formulate a response, echoing in the sparsely furnished room. Her cry followed, more from the shock than pain. However, what surprised me was not her cry, but lack of a subsequent response, showing that she had already internalized the situation. I had expected an adverse reaction after seeing her angry expression after mentioning the punishment, so her accepting silence was a surprise. Once again, I had adjusted my estimations about her level of submissiveness as I spanked her several times, each accompanied by a soft yelp from her. </p><p>“And that’s ten,” I said as my hand came into contact with her bottom once more, this time caressing softly instead of a painful collision. “That much should be enough to remind you to show gratitude, right?” </p><p>“Yes,” she whispered, her voice hard to distinguish from a pointless mumble. I assisted her to stand up, and she righted herself in front of me. I watched her, a smile worming itself to my face despite my efforts to look serious, but it didn’t bother me. From her small flinch, I could see that it didn’t come across nice or accommodating, so it worked better than a stern look for my purpose. A second later, her face was alight with realization, understanding what I expected, though it took a few seconds for her to gather the required composure to part her lips, whispering the required words. “Thank you.” </p><p>I chuckled. “You’re welcome,” I said, dragging my finger across her cheek softly, happy to notice that she hadn’t flinched, nor she tried to cover her tits, which were hanging naked, her nipples hard like diamond. I let my gaze explore her body one last time, recording every detail before I turned and left the room, despite the temptation to push her down and have my way with her. I had pushed her more than I should, and another day’s wait should mellow her perfectly for the next step. </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>I had woken up later than I had planned, mostly because I had been feeling supercharged due to my late night encounter with Nicole. Sleep was elusive when enough hormones to resurrect the dead man coursed through one’s veins. I had to masturbate a couple of times just to calm myself enough to sleep. </p><p>I took a quick shower, then moved to my desk, processing the photos I was going to send to the client, carefully separating the work ones from the ones I took for my personal pleasure. I had no intention of sharing the true Nicole with a bunch of faceless office drones after all.</p><p>She was mine. </p><p>It was afternoon when I climbed up the stairs. I wasn’t afraid of Nicole’s reaction. I understood her enough to know that she wouldn’t be able to bring herself to acknowledge the events that happened at either bedroom, or at the road in between. Indeed, if my prediction was correct, she wouldn’t even be in the living room, trying to avoid my presence as much as possible, hoping in vain that time would be able to solve her confusion. Admittedly, it might have if she had a few weeks to deaden the emotional impact. Fortunately for me and unfortunately for her, I was too close for her to get such a long break. </p><p>I would have liked to lounge in the living room, just to see her face when she came down, but I had other things to handle. Katie had sent me a message, informing me about another date I needed to attend. I refrained from berating her by saying I had no obligation to do so, mainly because of the two beautiful young women that were waiting for me there, one doing her best to seduce me to annoy the other, and the other forced to play my girlfriend to avoid losing face after a ridiculous lie. </p><p>I would’ve liked to meet with Katie at the house, the drive would no doubt be fun as I tried to convince her for a more believable double act, but they had apparently decided to go to the movie theater directly after the school. Still, it wasn’t a critical loss, not with the dark environment of the cinema offering a range of interesting opportunities. </p><p>I parked my car and walked inside, a glance enough to catch two girls, one curly red, the other brunette, at one corner of the lobby, examining the movie posters. I walked towards them, and while I wasn’t trying to be sneaky I knew they missed my approach, distracted by the posters. I wrapped my arms around Katie’s waist and whispered into her hear. “Hello, honey.” </p><p>Startled under my touch, she tried to turn back in panic, but my arms were tight around her. Her head turned, the panic draining off her face, replaced by recognition. “Hi, Ste-,” she started before coming to a sudden stop, clever enough to realize it wouldn’t be convincing to call me by my name. “Sweetheart,” she replaced instead. I smirked, leaning forward despite her sudden panic, and pressed my lips to hers for a second. She stilled, and I had pulled back before a reaction could cut through her shock. </p><p>“Hi Madison,” I said instead as I took a step around Katie. </p><p>“Hello,” she said, her tone oozing with sexuality in a huge contrast to Katie, but I was more interested in the spark behind her eyes, like she was challenging me to a duel. In a way she was, especially after the defeat she had experienced yesterday. The interesting thing was the defeat, instead of making her cautious, seemed to arouse her fighting spirit. A challenge I welcomed with enthusiasm, wanting to see how far she was willing to go. I tried to shake her hand, but she ignored in favor of an enthusiastic, lingering hug that would be very inconvenient if Katie had been my real girlfriend. </p><p>She kept her arms tight around me until Katie coughed pointedly, warning her that her closeness was a bit too much. “So, girls,” I interjected. “Any ideas about the film about the film you want to see?” </p><p>“Ohh, let’s go see this one,” Madison exclaimed, pointing the poster of a recent movie. I quirked my eyebrows while Katie suddenly blushed, as it was a movie that had created a lot of buzz, mostly because it had pushed what could be seen in an R rated movie to its limits. </p><p>I just shrugged in response before turning to Katie, ignoring her eyes, promising future retribution. I wasn’t going to fight her battles, if she didn’t want to see the movie, she had to give its battle herself. “Umm, maybe we should watch something different. I heard that a couple of the latest action movies are quite good.” </p><p>“Aww, is little Katie feeling shy all of a sudden with her boyfriend.” She smirked. “It’s not like we haven’t watched those movies in our slumber parties, after all.” </p><p>“Of course not,” Katie stammered, her rapidly expanding blush telling that Madison managed to hit the bullseye with her accusation. Madison said nothing, just smirked before dashing towards the teller. </p><p>“Very firm stance,” I said with an amused glance, watching Katie blush. </p><p>“Oh shut up,” she said, underlining her statement with a soft slap to my arm. “It’s not a big deal.” </p><p>I chose not to say anything, my mind already on how to leverage the opportunities that were afforded by the moment. It would be a pity if I failed to benefit from Madison’s bold move. When she came back with three tickets in hand, it was too late for Katie to object, even though her dissatisfaction the chosen movie was obvious. </p><p>“Movie is about to start, let’s go,” I said as I wrapped my hand around Katie’s. I could feel her out of control pulse on my skin, another sign of just how excited she was. I walked silently as the girls gossiped about the latest scandal in the school. Another surprise was waiting for us in the movie theater, it was completely empty. Convenient, I decided, though I wasn’t the only one that thought like that if I was able to decipher Madison’s expression correctly. </p><p>I was a step ahead as I walked towards the back of the theater, and took a seat towards the middle. Katie sat to my right, then sent a pointed glare to Madison as she patted the seat next to her. Madison thoroughly ignored her gesture and sat to my left. Katie looked at her pointedly, but chose not to say anything.  Katie turned her glance at me, but I just shrugged, as I was far from unhappy about current seating order. Her lips parted as she about to say something. I had a feeling that I wasn’t going to like those words, so I leaned forward for a quick peck before she could utter them. A shocked expression was on her face as I pulled back, her words forgotten. This time, her shock passed much quicker, but the movie started before I could push her new limits. </p><p>The movie proved that it was deserving of the controversy it brought by opening with a steamy sex scene. I could feel Katie stiffening in shock, but I took a hold of her hand, caressing softly. This time, I hadn't even had to gesture towards Madison for her to relax under my touch. I carefully led our tangled hands on the upper part of her thigh, then settling back to watch the movie. </p><p>I was a bit surprised when Madison leaned over my arm, carefully so that the side of her breast was pushing to my arm. I had to admit, I was a bit surprised, as I wasn’t expecting Madison to start pushing the barriers that quickly. I looked at her with the corner of my eye, only to see one of her hands slowly climbing over her own leg, something that could be ignored easily if it didn’t push her skirt away, revealing more and more of her legs, toned to perfection thanks to endless cheerleading training. It was a struggle to pull my gaze away from them despite seeing them -and much more of her- before. </p><p>Thankfully, I had a few good reasons to play hard to get. The first was the beautiful brunette on my right, who would doubtlessly get extremely annoyed with my easy capitulation. Even more, I had no illusion about Madison’s attention. It was conditional to Katie’s perceived ownership over me and would wither as soon as Katie ‘dumped’ me, my earlier victory over her all but ensured that. I still didn’t know about the reason for that ridiculous rivalry, not that I would lose any sleep if I failed to learn the reason. The results were all that I cared for. </p><p>So, I ignored Madison’s display in favor of throwing my arm around Katie’s shoulder. I could feel her freezing the moment she felt my arm around herself, but I ignored it. After all, the whole point was for her to get used to physical contact, which would lead to further intimacy. </p><p>Or maybe not the whole point, I corrected myself a few minutes later, when I reflexively turned to the side after catching a movement at the edge of my vision, only to see Madison sitting at the same position I left her except one rather important detail. Her panties, previously hidden under her skirt, had been pushed midway to her thighs. I looked at her questioningly but got only a smirk in response. </p><p>I was tempted to ask her the reason for her aggressiveness, curious what drove her, her rivalry with Katie, or her defeat in our latest encounter. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the best topic of conversation while Katie was there, so my attention moved to the next topic, namely defusing the situation without alerting Katie. </p><p>I turned towards her to briefly catch her eyes, though even before seeing her cheerful defiance I knew that convincing herself to wear them back was a lost cause. The mischievousness that shone in the depths of her eyes was all the confirmation I needed. After a shrug, I let my left-hand sneak towards Madison’s legs even as I turned my head towards Katie, trying to distract her in the form of a kiss to her neck. “Stephen!” she moaned, not expecting the sudden moan. </p><p>“What?” I said before pressing my lips to her neck once more, earning another shocked gasp. I could feel Madison giggling silently as my free hand sneaked over her legs, feeling the tremors as it searched for the offending fabric. Still, I was glad her for not making any noise. Even if Katie was a fake-girlfriend, I wasn’t stupid enough to assume she wouldn’t get offended if she caught me fondling her rival while kissing her. </p><p>“It tickles,” Katie managed to whisper a few seconds later. “Stop it,” she added, but considering the following giggles, I couldn’t help but feel that it was an opening shot of a negotiation rather than a demand. Which was why instead of stopping, I let my kisses trail down until I was tracing a trail along her collarbone, while my other hand pushed Madison’s panties down towards her feet. Thankfully, Madison decided to be cooperative and raised her feet, allowing me to pull her panties free easily without Katie noticing. </p><p>Still, I only pulled back after covering Katie’s collarbone in kisses. Katie said nothing, not that it was surprising. She was blushing red under the effects of the unexpected intimacy. “Are you okay, honey?” I whispered, glad that Katie wasn’t looking at me, and missing the smug smirk that invaded my face. It might have been hard to explain the reason for it. </p><p>“Yes,” she managed to whisper as she sank to the seat, failing to keep herself upright under the rush of emotions. I smiled in satisfaction as I relaxed on my seat, focusing on the movie for a while. It was tempting to continue messing with Katie, but I already pushed deep into her comfort zone. There was no point taking pointless risks. </p><p>All three of us focused on the movie during the relative inactivity, watching as a thrilling tale of intrigue, betrayal, and sex unfolded before our eyes. Though, the silence had a different reason for each one of us. For Katie, it was an opportunity to get a bearing of her nerves. For Madison, it was an opportunity to tease me in an attempt to take revenge for our earlier encounter, where I played her like an upright bass. And I waited with the patience of a winemaker, aware that the situation needed a bit of time before it reached a perfect consistency. Patience was an underrated virtue when it came to seduction. </p><p>The opportunity I was waiting revealed itself at the break. Overwhelmed by the situation, Katie jumped to her feet as soon as the screen darkened, mumbling something incomprehensible before dashing away. I watched her disappear with an amused smile. Then, I turned to my left as soon as the door closed, only to see Madison had pushed the envelope even further. She somehow managed to unbutton her shirt midway without me or Katie noticing, enough to tell me that she was lacking a bra. Her legs were parted open as if trying to remind me about the absence of her panties, like I could forget that particular detail while I could feel their distinct presence in my pocket. </p><p>Still, neither was as interesting as her eyes, filled with a shining challenge, daring me to finish her before Katie could return from the bathroom. Even if Katie stayed away for the entire direction of the break, it meant that I had less than ten minutes to bring her to a climax.</p><p>“Challenge accepted,” I whispered even as I leaned forward, pressing my lips to her neck in a heated assault. A gasp barely escaped her mouth before she shrugged the effect of the surprise, returning back to silence. I pulled back for a lingering second, enough to catch a satisfied expression on her face. I couldn’t help but smirk, she was in denial if her resistance to my opening moves meant anything. Still, such arrogance needed to be punished, lest it festered and stained her soul. </p><p>I was a true saint, I thought with a smirk, one that was enough to damage her confidence. Already cracked, her confidence didn’t last for long, shattering as soon as she felt my hands over her body, one slid inside her blouse through the generous opening left by her cleavage, the other traversing her toned legs before it slid into the promising depths of her skirt. She opened her mouth, but the time for words was over. I pressed my lips to hers, my tongue invading her mouth without a warning, blocking her ability to form words. </p><p>Not that she hadn’t tried to speak. Ineffectually, she tried to murmur something, going as far as trying to push me away when my fingers found her entrance, sliding inside her tunnel without a warning. But my fingers went in and out repeatedly, draining the power behind her pushes. They stopped completely when I imprisoned her nipple between my fingers, squeezing and twisting, forcibly extracting beautiful gasps off her. I pushed my fingers deeper, all the digits disappearing from the view, making her moan despite all the barriers she tried to put. </p><p>Since I already had practical knowledge about the sensitive points of her body, it was trivial for me to push her towards the first stage of arousal. I pushed my fingers deeper, my thumb circling around her clit rapidly. All the while, my other hand was busy unlocking the last of her buttons. </p><p>Beset with pleasure, she failed to notice the front of her shirt lay open, revealing her shapely breasts. Or she had, until I pulled away from the kiss and wrapped my lips around one of her nipples instead. “That feels amazing-” she started moaning, but her statement was cut halfway as my teeth joined the fray, replacing her words with an indescribable cry. </p><p>Under my fingers, she was like a toy that was begging to be played, her inexperience showing its head. It wasn’t the inexperience of a sheltered virgin, as it was obvious it was far from her first sexual encounter. But usually, teenage boys were notoriously bad in pleasuring the opposite sex, overwhelmed with a desire to satisfy their own desires instead. </p><p>It was ironic that currently, I had the opposite problem, forced to bring her to an explosive climax with a complete abandon of my own needs. Unfortunately, every second that passed meant another opportunity for Katie to return, demolishing the surprisingly impressive house of cards I had managed to build, constructed from lies, reinforced by deception. Ironic, considering the photography was the art of the truth. Or at least, supposed to be, I amended as I remembered the impressive range of manipulation, digital or otherwise, that went into each photo. </p><p>Realizing that her cries quieted, I focused back on my task. It wasn’t the time for philosophical ramblings. My attention back on my fingers that was exploring her insides, it didn’t take long for her to shudder under a rush of pleasure. </p><p>At that point, the safe choice was to leave her there and get out, meeting with Katie halfway. But it was hard to be rational when the tightness of my pants reached the point of torture. I stood up and whipped my shaft free. I was intending to cover her tits with my shaft, but her lips, parting open invitingly, gave me a different idea. </p><p>I pushed close, and her lips parted open even more, her expression still drunken. I wasn’t able to prevent a moan of my own as her lips wrapped around the crown. Another followed as I pushed deeper, ignoring the sudden gag that escaped her mouth. Back of her head supported by the chair, allowing me to push deeper into her throat, enjoying the heat of her furnace. She wheezed around my shaft, trying to breathe, but I didn’t give her the opportunity, fucking her throat mercilessly. </p><p>“Come on honey, try a bit,” I murmured as she struggled in her attempts to swallow my shaft. It was amusing to watch her bristle at the insinuation that she was lacking in ability. Truly, pride was a dangerous sin. I kept my pace until I felt a wave of pleasure building inside, then pulled out at the last second, covering her face and her tits with my seed. “Good attempt, sweetie,” I said with a smirk as I pulled my pants on. “Almost passable,” I added, chuckling at the flare of outrage on her face. Still, she said nothing as I walked away in quick steps, aware of the risk of Katie entering. </p><p>Luck was on my side, as I managed to catch her a dozen steps away from the entrance. “Hi Katie, do you want some popcorn,” I said even as I slid my arm around hers, pulling her alongside before she could answer. </p><p>It was a close call that left my heart beating crazily, but it was definitely worth it…  </p>",

    "title": "Mafia in College - 1",
    "content": "It was a weird feeling, watching the students trickle out of the classroom after an hour of pointless discussion about insights in a poem of which the writer long turned dust underground. If I spoke my thoughts out loud, people would've pointed out that it was a weird perspective to have for an instructor of sociology to have, and I couldn't be able to explain them.<p>Or more accurately, I wouldn’t. After all, it would run contrary to my aims if I explained that I was a high-ranked mafia that joined as an instructor under a fake identity. It had been almost a year since I disappeared, but I was sure that they were still looking for me. Trying to disappear with ten million unmarked cash had ruffled the feathers of the top guys, and the humiliating message I had left probably, certain of my success, didn't help any. It was a pity that a number of unfortunate events saw to that I was only able to get a small fraction of it, but I doubted the bosses cared much about that. For them, it was always about reputation first, and I damaged theirs badly. </p><p>Of course, just getting a new job at the university wasn't the limit of my actions. I had established a fake trail of tickets that implied I had long gone to another continent, and was enjoying the sun and expensive cocktails as the money lasted. Also, I had ensured that I couldn't be recognized thanks to an extensive number of plastic surgeries, which cost me the majority of the money I took, and incidentally left me significantly more handsome than I was before.</p><p>And I couldn't say it was an unwelcome benefit. In the past, I wasn't someone that could be said to be classically handsome. Dark, tall, and mysterious, definitely, and the several deep wounds I had acquired in my career as an enforcer made a good opening for the woman that liked the danger enough to hang around lawless places, enough to overlook my big nose and pointy chin, but the same wounds would be nothing but revolting for the residents of the ivory tower named university. But thankfully, I had a much more proportioned face after all those operations, leaving me with a face that could be called classically handsome, which worked much better in the casual bars I tend to hang around. </p><p>Distracted by remembrance, I didn't notice one of the students had stayed behind until it was only two of us that remained in the classroom. “Hello, Megan,” I said in an exasperated tone. “Is there anything I can do to help you?”</p><p>“Yes, professor,” she said in a raspy tone. “I'm having some trouble with the material, but can we discuss it in a more private setting.” </p><p>I sighed at her obvious display. It wasn’t that she was ugly. On the contrary, she was one of the most beautiful women I had the pleasure of seeing. Tall, thin, and appropriately curved, she was a redheaded bombshell. Her beautiful face and her sexy demeanor only made her sexier. Normally, it would be mad to reject her proposition. </p><p>But one thing kept me behind. She had a reputation of messing with men, implying attraction, only to torture psychologically without allowing a touch. Normally, I wouldn’t let it bother me, as I knew how to handle girls with an overinflated sense of their abilities, but she was a drama queen. Her position as the head of the sorority only enhanced her ability to create drama, and her parent’s money was always there to save her from the consequences if her own connections couldn’t. I could handle them still, of course, a spineless dean and a father with more money than sense weren’t insurmountable barriers for my particular skill set, but it wasn’t worth the hassle it would bring. Not to mention that more attention I had over myself, riskier it became for me. </p><p>“I’m sad to hear that you're having trouble with the material, Miss Dawson, but I'm afraid I don't have much time to discuss it today. But I hold open office on Wednesday's. We can discuss that there if you want.”</p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured, trying to act casual, but I could see her displeasure quite easily even if she tried to hide it. She might be good in manipulation in schoolyard terms, but I spent a decade of my life reading people, where a mistake could leave me cold in a ditch with a piece of lead lodged in my brain. Deciphering her petulant power plays was a child's play. </p><p>“Is that all,” I said as I turned my back, but I continued to watch her from her faint, barely decipherable reflection on the window. She pulled her phone, too deliberate to be just a random check as she pressed on the screen a few times, and then she placed it on the desk. </p><p>Then, her fingers reached her blouse, opening two more buttons, enhancing her cleavage even further. “That's good, professor. But I don't think I can pass this class even with the assistance in there. Maybe we can come to an alternate agreement.” </p><p>I was struggling to hold back a sigh as I turned to face her once more. Her ploy was so obvious that it hurt. She would record the scene as she came to me with a script from a second-rate porn, then act like she had been harassed. A careful editing would make it look like I was at fault. Of course, she probably assumed that I was going to turn into an idiot the moment I saw a glimpse of her tits -which was frankly spectacular- making her job to ruin me even easier. For the management, it would be enough evidence to fire me, especially since the accuser was the daughter of a major donor and accused was just a poor instructor with no personal connections in the faculty. All because I rejected her advances a couple of times. Uppity bitch. “Unfortunately, there is no special arrangement in my class, Miss Dawson. You would have to study just like everyone.”</p><p>With that, I started walking towards the door. I knew I should have gone away without anything extra, but I couldn't help but leave her a parting shot. Not just because I annoyed by her dismissive attitude, but also the sudden expression of outrage was too cute to ignore. She was like a well-groomed kitten trying her claws for the first time. I pointed at the phone, followed by a ridiculing smirk, pointing out her ‘genius’ plan had been deciphered.</p><p>Her expression of outrage and petulance rose unbidden when she realized her ‘genius’ plan had been deciphered, with the added effect of turning her previously cute expression into something sharper. Frankly, it didn’t look any more intimidating, but added a deeper allure, a striking sexiness that was previously missing. Sexy enough to tempt me for an action that would no doubt result in even more headache. </p><p>I leaned forward and pressed my lips against her. She was frozen stiff under my touch as my lips danced over hers, enjoying the taste of strawberries that filled my mouth. “See you in the next class, miss Dawson, and try better,” I said with a cheerful voice, leaving the dumbfounded beauty behind. I knew that I shouldn’t have changed my mind about messing with her, that it would blow up one way or another, but I couldn't summon the energy to care. </p><p>I didn’t double-cross the mafia just to become a toy for uppity socialites, no matter how sexy.  </p><p><strong>    *****     *****     *****     *****     *****</strong></p><p>My hopes for a silent hour between the lessons dashed as soon as I stepped to the corridor that led to my office. “James, could you come here for a minute, please.” </p><p>“Sure,” I answered, doing my best to hide my annoyance as I stepped the room of my supervisor professor, Amelia. Under normal circumstances, I would have no problems spending time with her considering she was a beautiful woman that was yet to clear her twenties, with a significant margin, even. She was an assistant professor because she was an overachiever that finished college in nineteen, and completed her doctorate in twenty-three. Unfortunately, she had an annoying character trait, she belonged to the unpleasant group that went off the rails given a scrap of power. Even more, she was my direct supervisor so ignoring her was not an option, not with the thousand petty grievances she could raise which would take an eternity to handle. </p><p>“Have you completed grading the papers I have you,” she said, her voice burning with glee. I couldn't help but sigh against her tone. I had hoped that after I left my previous life, I wouldn't have to deal with self-important people with a petty understanding of power, but not all hopes came true. At least, she couldn't order a swim at the river, ever helpful concrete weights around victim’s feet.</p><p>“Mostly,” I answered, well-aware that she wasn't going to be satisfied with it. But not all was bad, because when she leaned forward in anger, I was presented with a good view of her cleavage, not because she was wearing anything revealing, but thanks to my superior vantage point. Being tall was always convenient, except in the corner of flying hell they call economy class. Her short stature, and contrasting impressively sized breasts made the effect even more pronounced. The tightness of her blouse didn’t detract from the effect as well. </p><p>“What do you mean by mostly,” she cut me off in a tone she no doubt thought as menacing. “A quarter, half, three quarters?” </p><p>“More than half,” I answered, trying to hide my sudden amusement at the imagery that popped to my mind, a chihuahua barking against a wolfhound. She was just as cute, unaware of what she was facing against. And lucky as well, because I found her endearingly annoying rather than plain hateful, which would have resulted in me taking a few select actions against her, which would probably see her career wrecked.</p><p>“Since you already had enough time to complete half of them, why didn't you finish all,” she said, conveniently ignoring the fact that I still had a week to finish them.</p><p>However, I knew arguing over that point would make her even more annoying, something I have no need of. “I'll finish them tomorrow,” I said resignedly, not wanting to escalate the situation. For all the difference between the world of academia and mafia, one annoying thing was constant, the superiors’ vast ability and willingness to screw up your life. </p><p>Thankfully, her phone rang, cutting off another five-minute tirade that she was building up. “Sweetie,” I heard of her speaking as I closed the door, leaving her alone to speak with her boyfriend. </p><p>Her boyfriend was another source of annoyance for me, but this one was bad enough to tempt me to act. He was a biker that thought himself ‘edgy’ and ‘dangerous’ just because he had a Harley and belonged to a group that called themselves a biker gang. I would admit that I had met with truly dangerous biker gangs that gave the mafia a pause, but a bunch of trust fund kid with brand new bikes they used to break from the ‘stress’ of running their family businesses didn't qualify for the same category. Occasionally, I saw him walking towards the corridors, trying to impress undergrads in his ridiculous outfit, puffing his chest in a manner he thought intimidating whenever he saw me. I longed to pull him to the side and explain how the world worked, but once again, my cover prevented me from doing so. He was yet to annoy me enough, but I doubted that day was too far away. </p><p>I shrugged, shifting my mind from the topic. I had papers to grade.</p><p><strong>    *****     *****     *****     *****     *****</strong></p><p>I was halfway through the garden towards the library when I felt a familiar tingle on my sixth sense, as my subconscious registered the fact that I was being followed before my conscious mind did. An unusual sensation to happen in my new life, so when I looked around, afraid that mafia finally found me, my hand had already slid towards my bag, hovering over a compartment that cleverly hidden in a way that wouldn't be detected by a casual examiner. Normally, a delay from reaching the compartment would be a huge drawback, even if it was just a second, but it came handy this time, giving me time to recognize my followers. Two guys from the football team that I had flunked the last semester. Not because I had any respect for the post I was holding though. I would have passed them if they just said they needed it to keep the scholarship, and maintain a respectful demeanor that was passably human. But no, they had chosen to swagger into my office without even knocking, then subtly threatening me to pass them, or they would arrange something unfortunate. </p><p>Needless to say, I flunked them. They were lucky that I had a role to play, because I have broken kneecaps for lesser disrespect. I didn't know whether they tried to talk with their coach or not, but they never failed to pose like peacocks whenever we met in the corridor like their blown up muscles supposed to scare me. However, this time, there was something different in their walk, which meant they might have different in mind than just useless posturing. </p><p>I was curious why their modus operandi changed, but it was a low-priority thought at the back of my head, my mind busy analyzing their approach, strengths, and openings. I wasn't surprised when I noticed they were coming to a standstill a couple of feet away from me, throwing the limited advantage the ambush provided for useless grandstanding. Ridiculous, in a fight, no matter how unfair, one should never discard an advantage without a good reason. I could have dashed and surprised them of course, but letting people brag from a position they assumed strength was usually a good way of interrogation. One could never overestimate how easy for a man with more brawn than brain to babble vital secrets when drunk with power. </p><p>“What's up guys,” I said, acting like an ivory tower academician supposed to do and missing the immediate promise of violence in the air no matter how much it grated my nerves. </p><p>“Your funeral is up, teach,” the larger one said even as he pushed his fist into his palm in a gesture he clearly thought of threatening, but would have found ridiculous by a streetwise child.</p><p>“Yes, you had already pushed your luck by not giving us the grade we deserved,” the dumber one said, conveniently ignoring the fact that a three hundred word scrap in lieu of term paper didn't deserve anything other than an F. “But then, you made the mess by saddening a lady,” he added, though a look from the larger one made it perfectly clear that they weren't supposed to mention it. </p><p>“Lady?” I questioned, despite having a perfectly good idea whom that title belonged to. It seemed she needed a lesson in scheming, to learn the importance of letting the anger cool down before making plans. Not to mention finding better help than a couple football player, easier than lemmings to lead to a trap.</p><p>“Megan,” the dumb one said, failing to notice the attempts to silence him. I couldn’t help but let out a sigh. People like him was the reason why everyone was prejudiced against the football players. Of near hundred boys playing football, most were decent boys that realize the precarious position of their life and did their best to focus their training, but then there were idiots like dumb and dumber, singlehandedly reinforcing the stereotype the others trying to erase in vain. </p><p>“Idiot,” the other one murmured in resignation, mirroring my resentment before turning towards me, showing that he was nominally smarter. “Anyway, teach. You had already pushed your luck during the last semester, but we decided to be merciful. But you proved that you’re unable to learn you’re not supposed to mess with your betters.”</p><p>I might have egged them in any other circumstance, but that would’ve been useless in their case. I had already learned all I needed. I broke into action without a warning, throwing my bag at the face of the dumb one. Not expecting me to start the action before them, he wasn’t able to react before my bag, filled with several thick books, collided with his face. </p><p>But I was only able to confirm the collision from the sound, already dashing towards the other guy. He reacted faster than I expected, throwing a right hook strong enough to whistle through the air, displaying his vast strength. But he also had put no effort to hide his tells, allowing me to slip under his punch before grabbing his overextended arm. I pulled and twisted, forcing him into a submission hold. He struggled, trying to get away, only to stop when I tightened my grip even more. I was tempted to start with breaking his arm before reshaping their faces, but that would bring too much attention on me. The attention that was best avoided. </p><p>“Don’t take a step, or I break his arm,” I warned the stupid one. He stopped, and I started explaining what was going to happen, using my ‘business voice’ to make it stick. “Good boy. Now, let me quickly outline what will happen. You’re going to walk away, and from now on, you’re going to ignore me. I don’t even want to catch you looking at me in the corridors. If you try to take revenge, you will have an ‘accident’ that would leave you unable to play football. Understood.” </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when both of them nodded hurriedly. After a decade spent intimidating little shits that thought themselves important just because they had been initiated and received a gun, teaching two football players with an overinflated sense of personal ability was a trivial achievement. “Good,” I murmured as I pushed the larger one on the ground, then walked to pick my bag, appearing uncaring the threat they presented as I walked towards the bag I had thrown earlier, my back turned. I could hear them scuttling away quickly, their courage failed against the threat of a real violence. </p><p>My mind was already on the ways of paying back the princess for her daring gift, my desire to avoid attention unable to balance against my pride anymore. </p><p>I never liked being in debt. </p><p><strong>     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****</strong></p><p>I wanted to teach Megan a lesson about messing with her betters, but I needed something to prevent her from escalating, which was why I was walking around the sorority house that was her residence, identifying the angles of the security cameras. Surprisingly, there wasn’t any gap in the initial layout of the cameras. But lucky for me, the maintenance had been less professional. Three of the cameras I could see were broken badly, leaving me an easy access route from the first floor after a short climb.</p><p>I was even dressed to avoid being recognized, but in a divergence from my usual colorless and unmemorable drab I preferred when I sneaked in, I chose to dress in jeans and t-shirt, complete with a ridiculous ski mask, careful to look like frat boy in his initiation test, allowing me to escape without raising the alarm if, by any chance, I got caught. Frat boys did stupid stuff all the time, uncaring about the consequences, aware that they could hide behind their father's money if things went awry. Donations were surprisingly effective in covering felonies, especially if the offender was a white boy from 'good stock'.</p><p>I pulled my attention from the relative unfairness of the American college system and focused back on the environment. The fact that I had a solid plan to cover my track was not a reason to be sloppy and got caught in the first place. I walked through the garden, careful not to let my clothes get caught in the shrubs. When I arrived in front of the wall, it took a few seconds to plot a safe route to climb, darkness, while useful to keep my indiscretion hidden, making it more difficult to finish it without an injury.</p><p>Still, it was an old, ornate building with more than enough options to guide an experienced hand. Soon, I was safely at the first-floor balcony of a room with no lights. \"Jackpot,\" I whispered when I checked the door, only to find it unlocked. It wouldn't have taken long to unlock the old-fashioned lock that was supposed to bar my way from entering, but I preferred not to deal with it in any case. I was careful as I pressed the door handle, just in case there was someone inside, but my caution turned out unwarranted when I found myself in an empty room with garish pink walls, annoyingly bright even with the lack of light. The furniture was equally tasteless, and old movie posters on the wall -selected in a failed attempt to look intellectual- failed to remedy any of the flaws.</p><p>Still, I had more important things to think about the decorative taste of a sorority house, so I walked past the room and pressed my ear to the door, checking whether the corridor was clear. Earlier the day, I had managed to learn where Megan's room was by talking with one of the sorority members without making her suspicious. It wasn't a difficult achievement, a certain deficiency in intelligence, combined with her adoration towards the sound of her own voice made her a prime target for information gathering. I just needed to probe her offhandedly about the living conditions in the sorority house, a careless dropping of my target's name, and she told me all I needed and more, like most of the sorority would be away for an out-of-campus party.</p><p>I listened for more than a minute, in which the corridor stayed blissfully silent. The fact that they were supposed to be away didn't necessitate carelessness on my part. Only after making sure the corridor was empty, I walked out to the corridor, looking for the stairs. Luckily there were empty as well, so I climbed the stairs as fast as I could without making a discernible noise.</p><p>Finding Megan's room hadn't been difficult since it was supposed to be at the end of the corridor. I listened through the door, making sure it was empty before trying to open. I tried to turn the handle, but the door was locked. My hand slid to my pocket, coming with a small set of lock-pick. I was a bit rusty as I didn't have the occasion to pick a lock since my disappearance, but thankfully the lock was not difficult, yielding to my efforts after a minute of uninterrupted attention.</p><p>\"Nice,\" I murmured as I stepped inside the room. Seeing the room, I could better understand the jealousy of the other sorority girl. The room was better than what I got as a member of the faculty. It was a fairly large, decorated with furniture that was old, but well-maintained and expensive. However, I didn't waste time gawking in her room, walking towards her laptop instead. I wasn't surprised when I met with a password screen when I turned her computer on, but it would have been a lie to say that I wasn't disappointed. I was expecting her to ignore it.</p><p>Still, it wasn't an insurmountable problem since she was using the default password. I plugged a USB stick with another operating system already installed, then rebooted her computer with it. This time, it turned on without an issue, showing it was never a good idea to rely on the default security options. I quickly installed a small program that would give remote access to her computer as well as allowing me to use her computer as a conveniently-located camera and listening device. Since I wasn't willing to risk staying for an hour browsing her computer, I copied all of her personal files to the storage I brought just for that purpose.</p><p>I decided to check her room while the computer was busy with copying. First, I went through her drawers. Several of them contained nothing interesting, while the others, like her lingerie drawer, was interesting but not compromising. I was about to move on when I realized the table was much thicker than it supposed to, and a few knocks revealed a hollow compartment inside. Naturally, I started searching for a way to open it.</p><p>It took me almost fifteen minutes to figure out how to open the secret compartment. I focused on it despite the risk of being caught, because I knew that with their ridiculous traditions, a secret compartment would be the place to store something compromising.  \"Jackpot,\" I murmured when I heard a click that filled me with satisfaction, and a secret compartment, filled with CD's, slid open. I was struck with indecision. If I had the time and equipment, I would've copied them, but that was not an option. I considered leaving them there, wanting to keep Megan unaware of the intrusion, but a more interesting idea appeared in my mind.</p><p>I went to her table and quickly scribbled a note saying that she needed to reach to this number if she wanted to see those disks ever again, together with the number of one of my burner phones. I put the note in, took the material, and closed the compartment. Kirsten was into an interesting shock the next time she needed those items, whatever they contained.</p><p>For a moment, I wished that it was the good old days where I could wait for her to come back, then explain to her in a choice of words that why it was a bad idea to mess with me. Nothing unsettled someone as bad as finding someone in their bedroom, a place that was supposed to be their safe haven. Unfortunately, I didn’t have any friends in the police anymore to make sure the following complaint about the break-in was conveniently ‘lost’ in a pile of old paperwork on the way of recycling, never to be filed. </p><p>I moved to the first floor, about to leave the house when I heard a very distinctive noise. I felt alarmed, and aroused as well, a normal reaction to a loud, feminine moan that left no doubt about its source. It was easy to identify its location as downstairs, which is why I hadn’t gone into hiding in a panicked rush. </p><p>Tonight’s objectives were already complete, and I even managed to find some unexpected but very promising treasures. The sensible thing would be to leave the house rather than risking to get caught. However, letting a sorority girl have her petty victory instead of breaking and entering to a communal house was equally sensible. Sensible, but not as fun… </p><p>So I carefully sneaked to the ground floor, going down the stairs as silently as possible, following the sound of wordless female moans, one that sounded surprisingly familiar, which was why I hadn’t been too surprised to see a familiar redhead sitting on the couch, her legs parted wide, her eyes closed in ecstasy. She was wearing a bra, and only a bra, her skirt and panties were thrown haphazardly on the floor. Another head was positioned between her legs, preventing me from getting a full sight of the scene. Still, I couldn’t say that I was bummed about it, as watching two girls together, one doing her best to service the other while the other moaned in an unbroken string of ecstasy was clearly superior to casual nudity. Still, it was an interesting surprise. I didn’t peg Megan as interested in girls, she was clearly interested in men, although she expressed it in an utterly broken manner. But apparently, she was bisexual. </p><p>I had no intention of missing such a poetically incriminating moment, so I pulled the phone, and started recording the scene, glad that I had recently upgraded my phone, its camera up to immortalize the moment with all its clarity. </p><p>They continued their twisted embrace for a while, and I continued recording, barely suppressing a desire to pull my shaft and start masturbating. “Megan-” said the girl who was busy servicing, but before she could complete her sentence, Megan grabbed her hair tugged it hard. Hard enough to hurt significantly if the following cry was any indicator. I quirked an eyebrow, recognizing the voice. It belonged to one of the first years, and if I remembered correctly, she was a scholarship student, an ambitiously nerdy girl with an extra-milky-chocolate complexion, intent to prove the emptiness of the racist remarks against her. I remember the first papers she did was exemplary, though, during the last few, the quality started to suffer. I had a feeling that I managed to find the reason. </p><p>“What did I tell you about calling me when we’re alone,” Megan said in a voice that wasn’t too loud, but nevertheless managed to cut the air commandingly. I was impressed. I didn’t expect her to have such a commanding presence. </p><p>“Sorry, mistress,” the other girl answered meekly. “But we need to stop, the others could come back any minute.” But before she could say anything else, Megan tightened her grip around her hair and pushed her towards her task once more, but nevertheless, she opened her eyes and started to watch the entrance, showing she was also quite concerned about getting caught. Even better for me, as it increased the value of the material I had. More she was afraid of getting caught, easier it would be for her to fold against the threats. </p><p>I stayed at the corner, watching and recording, until Megan’s eyes closed in an obvious rush of pleasure, the cries filling the room, all safely recorded in my phone. I was tempted to stay and watch, curious about the dynamic between them, but unfortunately, it was too risky even for me. They weren’t distracted anymore, and all it would take was an errant glance, and I would be caught. I would have managed to escape, of course, but they would know that someone had their recording, which would reduce the impact when I eventually tried to cash it. </p><p>I escaped from the same route I had entered, satisfied with what the incursion brought. My phone was comfortingly heavy in my pocket, and I couldn’t wait to check the material I had just acquired… </p>",

    "content": "I was murmuring a cheerful melody as I pulled to the driveway, unable to contain my upbeat mood. An understandable challenge considering the interesting day I had. It was just the second day of my new tenancy, but I had some interesting interactions with three different beautiful woman, all with almost no effort, not to mention netting an amazing model that worked well-below the market rate for her beauty and raw skill. It left only Nancy outside my growing web. I took a note to have a talk her, curious about the angles I could push her. Considering the ease I was progressing with the other two occupants, it wasn’t wrong to be hopeful about that as well. <p>Still, I needed to solidify my hold on Katie first, I decided as I entered the house. I looked around, hoping to see Katie in the living room, but she was absent. “Maybe she is in her room,” I murmured, considering whether to take the risk of going upstairs. It was a risk because it would be hard to explain my presence if I came across to Nancy. Coming across Nicole, on the other hand, would be interesting. </p><p>Without risk, there was no gain, I decided after a moment’s consideration, and climbed the stairs for the second floor for the first time. Admittedly, it wasn’t an exciting floor architecture. A short corridor, littered by four doors, one cracked to reveal a smallish bathroom. The one next to it likely belonged to Nicole since it was the largest room. It left me two doors on the right side, both identical. I decided to knock the first one, because I could hear the sound of music coming behind the door. </p><p>Seeing no benefit of stretching the situation, I knocked. “What!” said the voice I easily identified as Katie, signaling she wasn’t in the best of moods. </p><p>“Is it a bad time?” I asked. </p><p>She yelped in panic. “Stephen, is that you?! Sorry, I thought it was Mom,” she said, her voice coming strangled. I wasn’t surprised, considering the closeness I had forced on her minutes ago, leaving her to process it.  </p><p>“No worries, I just wanted to check to see if everything was okay. Do you mind if I come in?” </p><p>“All is well, but I’m not exactly available. Can we talk later?” </p><p>“Sure, you know where to find me,” I said, chuckling as I walked down the stairs. I would’ve preferred to have some private time with her, to strike the iron while it was hot, but I decided it wasn’t a big loss. It was good that I did, because before I could even walk to the basement, the door opened, revealing Nancy. “Hi there,” I said. “You look stressed.”</p><p>“It's nothing,” she murmured as she walked inside, bypassing me and directly walking to the kitchen, only to pull a beer from the fridge. </p><p>“Yes, it's obvious it's nothing,” I answered, gesturing towards her arms, shaking in a nervous excitement. “Why don't you tell me what's bringing your mood down? Maybe there's something I can help.”</p><p>“Not likely,” she answered, stopping to take a swig, causing her face to twist in dislike. Clearly, she was unused to taste of beer, which made me even more curious about the root of her stress. </p><p>She plopped herself on the couch, and I sat on the seat across her. “Come on, spill,” I said.</p><p>She stayed silent a few more seconds, enough to make me worry that maybe I pushed her too much. Then, she started speaking. “I went to a publisher, to drop my manuscript for review.” I nodded, prodding her to continue. “It's already the third iteration, and if they don't like it again, they're going to cancel the contract.” </p><p> “It doesn't seem like enough to make you worry this much,” I said. “Yes, getting rejected is no fun, but it's a part of the creative journey.” </p><p>She sighed hopelessly. “It wouldn’t be that bad if I hadn’t taken an advance, or was smart enough not to spend it all… What I’m going to tell mom,” she moaned, pressing her hands on her face in an attempt to hide from the realization. </p><p>I patted her shoulder. “Don’t worry, I’m sure that you’re going to nail it. And in case they have horrible taste and still reject your work, why don’t you talk to me before going to Nicole. Maybe I would have a job fit for you that could help you get the money.” </p><p>“Really, would a job be enough to cover an advance of a thousand?” she asked. </p><p>“That’s a difficult amount,” I said. “Still, you never know, sometimes I got interesting jobs. I can’t guarantee that you can get in a couple of shots, but with a bit of luck, it should be doable.” </p><p>A smile bloomed on her face, even though it was a small, flickering thing. I let my lips curl in a smirk as well, hoping for her manuscript to be rejected. I didn’t want to lose such a convenient hook. I had some costumes in mind that would fit her perfectly. </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>Rest of my day went without a notable event. I swung by the shops to buy some essentials, and also passed by the delivery company’s branch to pick up the next set of clothing. I might have tried to convince Nicole for the next session, but unfortunately, she wasn’t around when I came back. I shrugged and went downstairs, intending to rest a bit. But thoughts of her dressed in some of the nightwear that was in the package prevented me from catching my sleep. </p><p>I got up from the bed despite the temptation to stay under the warm blanket. First, I opened the package to cycle through the next event’s clothing. Then, a few minutes were spent going through the box of clothes that left from the previous shootings, until I came across a red thong that was little more than a floss. It didn’t have a matching bra, not that it was an issue, of course. An equal time went to set up the lights, hoping that the physical exertion would be enough to make me sleepy. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t. I decided to go upstairs to make myself some warm milk, hoping that it was going to do the trick. “Jackpot,” I murmured to myself. I wasn’t alone. Nicole was in the kitchen, washing something in the sink, unaware of my presence. I smirked as I sneaked closer. Her clothing was disappointing though, a bulky set of pajama, likely cotton. “Evening, Nicole,” I said, but only when I was just a step behind her. Startled, she turned towards me, and I chose that particular moment to close the remaining distance. </p><p>The resulting position was quite interesting, our faces close enough for our noses to touch, her lips parted open for a cry that rejected to appear. I smirked but said nothing, just calmly reached to pick a cup. Then, like it was nothing out of ordinary, I pulled back and walked to the fridge instead. “So, how are you in this beautiful night?” I asked, filling the glass with milk. </p><p>“Good,” she managed to stammer, her face red enough to melt chocolate. Her mouth opened like she was about to say something else as well, but changed her mind at the last second, turning her attention back to the dishes instead. I put no effort to break the silence, enjoying the uncomfortable tension at the room, broken only the running water. </p><p>I was finished with my drink just as she was about to finish with the dishes. “So, do you have anything to do after the dishes?” I asked as I stood up, walked towards the sink. </p><p>“No, why,” she stammered, drying her hands with the towel. </p><p>I put my hand over her wrist gently, my fingers loosely around. “A perfect opportunity for a photo shoot then,” I said, and started walking with her in tow, not waiting for an answer. She followed silently, no words of protest coloring her beautiful lips, showing the distance I had came for just a few days. How such a treasure had escaped the male attention for such a long time, I had no idea. But spending any time to find out didn’t sound attractive when I could feel her pulse under my fingers, beating in a frenzied pace. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I could see the emotions passing through her face, determination leaving itself to resignation as she tried to resist, only to be betrayed by her own body. It was an amusing sight, like a walk around the beach before the main course. Nothing compared to the amazing main course that was waiting for us, but appetizing and enjoyable at the same time. </p><p>Another interesting thing came to my attention as we went down the stairs. Nicole’s breasts, not inconsiderable on size, was jumping up and down in a freedom that suggested the absence of a bra. It was a bit funny, to be aroused from that after all the compromising situations I had seen in, but still, I couldn’t pull myself away from their attractive sway. </p><p>“I-” she tried to start speaking, only to cut down by my finger pressing on her lips. </p><p>“We don’t want to lose any time with discussions, right?” I said, keeping my fingers on her lips despite the blush creeping her neck. “Why don’t you just walk behind the screen and remove those ugly pajamas while I pass you the first costume. </p><p>With a flicker of indignation trying to flare into life before giving it up as a hopeless task, she was adorable. She turned, walking towards the crude changing room with slow steps. “Quicker,” I said, a soft pat to her bottom underlining the message. She yelped in surprise but didn’t turn back, her steps quickening instead. </p><p>I picked the most conservative of the nightwear she was supposed to model, a dark green, opaque nightie with a small cleavage, long enough to almost reach her knees. It even had a longer, more conservative robe. I heard the ruffling of the fabric, tempting me to took a step towards the confines of the screen. Patience, I thought, trying to resist the temptation. For all her apparent docility, she was yet to descend to a level where I could use her free to my heart. “Soon,” I whispered, walking back to my camera. </p><p>A minute later, she stepped out, her figure showing itself even through the thick fabric. I looked at her, the camera pointing downward in my hand. This time, I wanted her to be aware of my smoldering gaze. From her gaze trying to find a location to escape, I decided that she indeed noticed it. She said nothing as she walked to the small make-up table, putting on her wig and some make-up. Meanwhile, I walked behind the screen and moved her pajamas and her panties away. I wanted her not to have an option to change. Though, I was happy to note her changing tastes. Yesterday, I had no doubt that she would’ve kept her panties on unless I prompted otherwise. </p><p>As usual, the shoot started mild, and I ordered her to cycle through a set of professional poses, all clinical. “Why don’t you slid your robe a bit so you could display your beautiful shoulders,” I said. There was no hesitation as the silky fabric slid until the spotlights were shining from her shoulder, naked discounting the spaghetti strap of the nightwear. “Perfect,” I said after a few more shots. “Now turn your back, and let the robe fall on the ground.” She followed it, leaving her robe for the mercy of the gravity until it met with the ground. </p><p>“Now, bend down a bit while keeping your back turned at me.” Her hands reached towards the skirt of her nightie even as she followed my direction, trying to prevent an accident. “Keep your hands away from the dress,” I ordered, allowing her dress to ride her thighs up freely until they stopped at midway, not revealing anything interesting. But I wasn’t trying to do that. The objective was to damage her sense of restraint even further. “Perfect,” I said as I took a few more photos in rapid succession. </p><p>“Now, turn your face at me, one leg forward, your left hand resting on the dress.” She did so immediately. “Drag the skirt up slowly until I say stop,” I added. She followed that command as well, but not as quickly, each flare of flash documenting it in a higher location, her fingers trembling stronger with each inch they climbed. Still, I didn’t call her to stop for a while, and she continued to pull it up resolutely. I had to admit, I was tempted to see how far she was willing to forward, but didn’t want to disrupt the spell. “That’s enough for this costume,” I said, calling the time to make her change. </p><p>She delayed for a second, picking the robe up from the ground, walking towards the screen. I took a step, cutting her way, my arms open for a hug. “Is it over already,” she asked. I was happy to notice the tinge of disappointment in her tone. </p><p>“Definitely not, we have quite a few more that needs to be documented, but you deserve congratulations after that flawless shot,” I explained. I took a step forward, dwindling the distance to nothing before she could say anything else. Her arms wrapped around my torso just as quick, which surprised me positively. I was expecting her to stiffen in shock. Her acceptance of my touch without reservation this early in the session was a nice development. Still, I kept the hug short and my hands away from unsafe locations. </p><p>She walked behind the screen without saying anything after I let her go. I walked towards the screen, and passed the next lingerie she was going to pose in, an opaque teddy with a nominally deeper cleavage. “Could you pass me to previous ones, dear,” I said. “They need to be kept crease-free.” It wasn’t a good excuse, but she made no attempt to examine it, just passed them to me over the screen. Another part of my plan had been cleared. </p><p>Next few shots passed without a notable event. All conservative pieces with little chance of malfunction. The only interesting thing was our congratulatory hugs, which I initiated after the completion of each dress, lingering longer with every repeat. However, I could feel my heart quickening in anticipation as she walked behind the screen, afraid that she was about to reject the dress I was about to pass her. We exchanged the clothes over the screen, and I heard the fabric unfolding before it came to a sudden stop. “Stephen,” she called with a trembling voice, but I didn’t bother to answer, just walked back to my camera. </p><p>“Come on, Nicole,” I called her. “We don’t have all night.” We did, of course, but I had some activities even more interesting than modeling in mind. The only answer I received was a whimper, almost too low to be heard. A few seconds later, she stepped out in the open. </p><p>Damn, I thought. She looked absolutely amazing, wearing a flowing loose negligee, similar to the first piece she wore at the start of the evening, but with two great differences. The first was the area it covered. It ended quite a bit above the middle of her thighs, displaying her beautiful legs alluringly. The deep cleavage and its loose cut weren’t exactly helpful in that front as well. The second issue was its fabric. Rather than the thick, opaque fabric of her earlier costumes, this one was made of a thin layer, too weak the prevent the light from escaping, leaving the ghost of her most private areas to my attention. It was supposed to be worn with underwear, something I managed to miss when I passed the dress to her. She had her panties, but no bra.</p><p>“You look exquisite, my dear,” I said. “There is no need for you to feel self-conscious.” Other than being practically naked, but it was life. Sometimes, you found yourself naked when you least expected it. “Now, turn forty degrees to the side, then look at me,” I ordered her, initiating the next chapter of our session. First few minutes, I focused exclusively on the shots from the profile, hiding her treasures from the camera. It helped her to relax considerably, but it wasn’t my aim on that. I wanted to have a few poses where I could share with the client. I don’t think I could share anything I took from the front even after a heavy digital editing session, not when each flash highlighted her contours perfectly. </p><p>“Now, look at me seductively,” I ordered her with a sensual whisper, a sudden change from my usual style. She looked at me, her eyes growing in a sudden rush of emotion as her arms wrapped around her body in a sudden realization. I smiled even as I took the camera from the tripod and walked closer. The change in tone worked just as good as I hoped, breaking the barrier of professionalism between us. I walked closer, the camera flashing repeatedly. “Come on Nicole. Give me a sultry smile, one that would drive a man crazy like the song of a siren would.” </p><p>She opened her mouth to say something, but it was too late. Just a step away from her, I lay my finger on her lips, preventing her from saying anything. “A sultry smile,” I repeated. “One that was tempting enough to break a saint’s wow of celibacy.” I let my finger drag to the side, caressing her cheek, drinking her shock like a wine. “Come on, Nicole, show me just how good of a model you are.” </p><p>The last call worked even better than I had hoped. A challenging flare appeared in her gaze, and her lips twisted into a fragile smile. One that reminded me of an angel that was lost in a dangerous neighborhood, trying to brave its perils. But I was like a devil following her, the purity of her smile making it even more attractive. </p><p>I let my hand fell on her shoulder, pushing one of the straps to the side before pulling back, taking a few pictures of her face close. “Now, I want an expression of arousal. The expression you have after a lover teased you for hours, leaving you yearning for release,” I continued, my voice barely above a whisper, worming themselves into a primal part of her brain, bypassing the baggage caused by the civilization. </p><p>“Still not enough,” I whispered. “I need an expression of denied ecstasy.” I stopped, breaking the explanation with a wide smirk. “Maybe I should help a bit.” With that, my hand was on her body once more, caressing her sides over her clothing, but the thin fabric was almost nonexistent under my touch. I brought my hand from the side to her stomach, feeling her diaphragm stilling in shock. I rapidly took a few more pictures, then pulled back. “That was amazing,” I said. “Now, there is only one set left.” </p><p>That last word acted like a signal, breaking her hypnotism. A sudden blush invaded her face, panic blooming on her face. Uncaring, I wrapped my arms around her, my hands much more adventurous, teasing the border of her plump bottom. “Go change,” I said, pulling back. She turned, but before she could take a step, I spanked her bottom, earning a shocked yelp off her. “Hurry up,” I ordered, and her steps quickened, whether uncaring or unaware of the display she was providing as her negligee moved up with each hurried step. But through all, she didn’t utter a word of protest. </p><p>Once again, I took her dress first before passing the new one, this time, only a small thong. Her hand appeared up once more, but this time, it was destined to stay empty. I walked towards my computer and set a second camera to record the session. Then, I walked to my main camera and called her. “What are you waiting for Nicole. Come here.” </p><p>“I think you forgot to pass the rest of the costume,” she said, her voice trembling. </p><p>“Nope,” I said. “That’s all of it. Now get out, we need to finish the shoot.” </p><p>“But…” she said, her voice dwindling in shock. “I can’t step out wearing only this.” </p><p>“Of course you are going to,” I answered. “You don’t want to ruin the whole shoot, don’t you?” I waited for a second, then continued with a sharp tone that demanded obedience. “Get out now!” </p><p>Power was all in the perception, the scene in front of me was a proof of it. She was my landlady. From an objective standpoint, I had no power over her. But that was meaningless when she stood in front of me almost naked just because I ordered her to, her arms wrapped around her chest in a poor attempt to hide her ample breasts from my gaze. It was only partially successful, because, in panic, she was pressing on them too hard, causing them to pop from the sides, making the scene even more heated. </p><p>“Walk to the podium,” I ordered, and she did so, her lips sealed shut, her body trembling with each step. I didn’t lose time tripod even for a second, walking next to her. The time for games was over. It was the time to get my reward. “Sit,” I said. A shocked expression appeared on her face surprised with her own obedience, but nevertheless, she followed my order like clockwork. </p><p>“Now, give me an aroused expression,” I ordered. “I want your eyes to promise me the best night of my life, lush and erotic.” She was frozen in shock, and it didn’t help when I took the knee next to her, getting even closer. “Come on, Nicole,” I whispered promisingly. “Don’t disappoint me now.” </p><p>To her credit, she managed to recover enough to put a trembling smile on her face. It wasn’t a smile of a woman in control, subtle and alluring. Instead, it wavered in indecision, highlighting the storm that was wrecking her emotions. </p><p>It was the time to break her, I decided. “Maybe you need some help, Nicole,” I whispered, and put my hand on her stomach once more. A gasp escaped her mouth, leaving her frozen, removing the last scraps of her ability to speak. “Now, I want you to stay silent and focus on the sensation. You wouldn’t waste my efforts to help you, right?” </p><p> A panicked nod, followed by silence told me that I was on the right track. I raised my hand until my fingers were barely touching her skin. I moved upwards until I was about to caress the bottom of her breasts. Her arm moved down a bit to create a barrier, ignoring the line of flesh that was revealed by the motion. Still, even with the unexpected benefit, her move was unacceptable. I peered into her eyes, and she wilted under my warning, her arm pulling back, leaving me free to caress the edge of her breasts. She trembled deliciously. </p><p>I leaned closer until my lips were separated from her ear by nothingness, the smell of her shampoo tickling my nose. “Are you ready for the pose?” I whispered sensually before pulling back, my breath tickling her neck. Overwhelmed, she wasn’t able to react. “Maybe you need a more intensive help,” I added. </p><p>It was time to quicken the things a bit. I moved my hand down, quick enough that my hand was already above her clit when she realized what was going on, separated by the nonexistent fabric of her panties. Her eyes popped open with shock, her mouth following the suit a second later. What she was going to say, however, I was unable to learn, her statement replaced by a moan with a twist of my fingers. It was a tempting thought, to slow down my pace and allow her time to gather herself, only to destroy her balance once more. However, she wasn’t the only one that was under strain. Playing with her for the last few days, watching her in different dresses each more revealing than the last, I could feel my willpower getting damaged under the strain, something that my encounter with Katie’s friend earlier today didn’t help at all. </p><p>It was enough playing, I decided. It was the time to trigger the main event. I pushed her panties to the side, revealing her glistening slit to my bare attention. “What-” she tried to say, this time managing to utter a word. It was a pity that her sentence was aborted an out of control moan as I slid my fingers inside her. I pushed my digits inside her repeatedly, and received a jumble of cries in response, destroying her half-formed words whenever she tried to say anything. </p><p>One of her arms pulled away from her breasts, revealing a portion of her small pink areolas for my gaze before her other arm shifted to compensate. Her free arm landed to my shoulder, trying to push me away. But it was a soft, trembling push, lacking power or conviction behind, nor she had enough to whisper an order, asking me to stop. Even that attempt died a second later, when a sudden shock rocked her body, and she was forced to put her arm on the floor in an attempt to keep herself upright. The climax hit her hard and merciless, her eyes closed, her cries free, loud enough to make me thankful for the sound insulation of the basement. </p><p>Even with the support from her arm, she was unable to keep herself upright for more than a few seconds. Her arm gave out without a warning. Her other arm tried to press on the ground, to compensate for the loss of support but leaving her tits naked for the first time for my gaze. But her move was too late, and only my reflexes kept her away from a painful collision with the floor. </p><p>When her eyes opened once more, our faces were close enough to press our noses together. An intimate pose, and the fact that her naked breasts were pressing to my chest wasn’t exactly something against the grain. Nor the fact that my fingers, still inside her, being squeezed by her wet tunnel. I smirked before letting my fingers cut free once more, sliding in and out in a frantic pace. Her eyes grew in shock, realizing that her delicious torture was just beginning. </p><p>“Give me an expression of arousal,” I ordered to her once more, repeating my earlier question. A defiant expression tried to flicker into life, trying to rise against my invasion, only to die a second later. It wasn’t a surprise with her submissiveness. After all, if she had been able to resist, I wouldn’t have her on the floor of her own house, naked for all practical purposes, mewling helplessly with each push of my fingers. </p><p>Then, I turned up the intensity several notches, a third finger joining the fray, followed by a sudden jump in intensity. Her eyes found mine, nothing behind them but a total surrender, drowned in pleasure. She was mine. </p><p>I decided to reward her. My thumb found her clit, adding another dimension to her delicious torture, my breath caressing her lips, which were opened in acceptance, waiting for my kiss. A kiss that I denied even was my own hovered just an inch above hers, enjoying the wind of her out of control breathing. </p><p>Her body under the effects of a combined assault, it wasn’t exactly a surprise when she started to rock under the control of another earthquake, strong enough to make the previous one jealous. I smirked in satisfaction as I felt every tremor on my body, pulling her tighter against me. Then, I lay her listless body on the ground, a half-drunk euphoria on her face. I picked up my camera and took a few rapid poses of her, wearing nothing but a thong pulled to the side, soaked with her own juices. Then, I placed the camera on the ground, thinking about what to do next. </p><p>Possibilities were endless, each more delicious than the last. </p>",
