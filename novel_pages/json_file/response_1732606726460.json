    "content": "<p>As I settled into a small ditch behind thick shrubbery, I found myself glad for the lack of discipline that had been plaguing the guards since my grandfather’s illness turned serious, and my uncle took over the estate for all practical purposes. </p><p>My grandfather had never allowed such a mistake that might allow infiltrators easy access to our compound until he turned completely bedridden. He might be a difficult — impossible — person to deal with, but his effectiveness was never in doubt. </p><p>Watching the alertness and the efficiency of the guards slip further and further while my uncle spent most of his time in the provincial capital had been difficult, but right now, I was happy about that particular slip. </p><p>I took a deep breath, focusing on my chest. To be more exact, I focused on the four little orbs that were rotating around my heart, each representing one type of elemental mana, clamping over them to to prevent detection. Spurius might be a detestable, lazy mage who could barely use a couple of spells of his chosen element that didn’t deserve the rank of Guard Captain…</p><p>But, he was still a mage, and it came with some advantages that no skill could cover directly. The inarguably greatest advantage in that small list was to channel his mana outside his body. His chosen element — air — made him particularly good in noticing the presence of the others. </p><p>I had no chance of staying hidden if he noticed my presence. I disappeared into the bush, ignoring the discomfort as the smaller branches dug into my skin. </p><p>They passed near me, unaware of my presence, but some of their words reached my ear. “… find him, or I’m going to teach you all what it means to fail your master at such a critical juncture …” Those words were enough to send my thoughts careening in an unpleasant direction.  </p><p>I refused to go in that direction. </p><p>The reasonable thing was to assume that whatever the guards had been talking about had nothing to do with me, reveal myself, and try to enter the compound. A slightly more cautious, but almost as comfortable choice was to go to my cave and stay there until the morning. </p><p>Even as I thought about them, I could hear my grandfather’s voice admonishing me for daring to ignore the importance of proper intelligence on the battlefield. Calling what was supposed to be my home a battlefield hurt — though not as much as the possibility I refused to even consider — but it was the truth. </p><p>I had never been particularly happy or welcome in the Scipio compound, but it was nothing to the treatment I received after my grandfather’s chronic illness took a turn for the worse. Warmth had never been a common part of my childhood, but casual dismissal was still better than outright hostility. </p><p>“Focus,” I muttered softly, imagining what my grandfather would say for daring to speak to me while sneaking around. “I will hear that complaint again,” I spoke even as I carefully approached the compound, thinking that it would be just a bout of pointless paranoia because of my grandfather’s unhinged teachings.  </p><p>I was already preparing my complaints about his style of raising me. Complaints that I would be able to use soon. </p><p>Definitely. </p><p>I carefully circled around the compound, far away from the main gate, and started digging. After passing a layer of small dirt, the rest of the tunnel was filled with branches to keep it from collapsing. I removed them as well, and used the tunnel I had prepared three years ago. </p><p>The clear dislike I  had experienced in the compound led me to create a hidden tunnel leading out for emergencies. Though, while I was creating it, I certainly wasn’t planning to use it the other way. </p><p>I ignored the irony of my situation as I snuck inside using the tunnel, doing my best to stay unnoticed. Not a great challenge thanks to the lack of discipline that defined the Scipio compound during the last year, but tonight, it looked even easier. </p><p>Dinner time was never the calmest time of the compound … well, at least whenever my uncle stayed at the compound rather than the house at Londinium. He liked to hold feasts for his friends, ignoring how badly it buckled the already limited coffers of House Scipio. </p><p>I never cared about my uncle’s spendthrift ways. Ultimately, I was a bastard. I stuck around due to a complicated relationship with my grandfather, who was the current Patriarch of the family, but there was nothing between deep dislike between me and my uncle. He claimed that he hated me because I took his precious sister during my birth. Knowing him, the only thing that he had valued about my late mother was a chance to build a marriage alliance. </p><p>Ironically, tonight, I didn’t feel any dislike toward the preparations of the fancy feast. It meant that the worst hadn’t happened. </p><p>Even my cold-blooded uncle wouldn’t have held a feast on the night of his father’s death. </p><p>I looked back to the tunnel, preparing to leave the compound silently. Spending the night in my cave while guards searched me was a good way to take revenge. As for why they had been searching for me,  I didn’t care much. Occasionally, my uncle dragged me to those feasts … but always as the entertainment. </p><p>Often, I had to duel with the sons of his friends or business partners. Those fights, I expected to lose, often in a humiliating fashion, which was a good way to stroke the ego of his business partners. Losing those duels was inevitable. My opponents were often actual mages. Poor and unskilled ones, were raised to that rank through spending a considerable fortune than actual skill, but that didn’t matter. </p><p>An apprentice mage couldn’t win a duel against an actual mage. </p><p>A fight to the death, on the other hand… </p><p>I shrugged dismissively. Ultimately, that was a pointless discussion. I wouldn’t kill someone during a duel, and more importantly, I wouldn’t reveal all my tricks in front of my uncle. It was better for him to underestimate me. </p><p>It would make my eventual departure easier. </p><p>I looked at the tunnel, but then the opposite side, my grandfather resided, away from the commotion.  As in, a full mile away. </p><p>There were a lot of disadvantages to living in Britannia, but there was one big advantage. Land was cheap, which allowed the nobles to build pointlessly large compounds in an effort to show off against their visitors. In the past, my grandfather lived at the house at the center, but he chose to move to a house at the edge of the compound once his sickness got worse. </p><p>Servants stayed away from the there, as even at the best of times, he hadn’t been a jovial person, let alone in his frustrated state. </p><p>I decided to bring Lion’s Bane to his residence before leaving the compound again. I didn’t want to damage it as I dragged it along. Fragile and poisonous was a frustrating combination. </p><p>However, before starting to move forward, I turned inward, testing to see if I could hold on despite the tightness in my chest.  </p><p>Suppressing the four elemental cores was a very useful trick to hide my presence, but it came with a big drawback. It caused an uncomfortable strain, not unlike trying to hang onto a rock on the side of a cliff. Easy at first, getting more and more difficult with every minute. I was lucky that I still had a long way to go before they completed their development, as the stronger they got, the harder to keep them suppressed. </p><p>When my grandfather first taught me that trick, I could keep them suppressed for a full day. Now, I was lucky to keep them suppressed for more than an hour before strain turned into pain. </p><p>I decided that I hold without a problem for several minutes, which should be enough to visit my grandfather and leave. I had snuck around the compound enough times to have a route in mind. It would be even easier with the servants busy with the feast. </p><p>One big disadvantage of a large compound. It required a small army of servants and slaves to keep it operating properly … a small army that a near-bankrupt noble family in exile couldn’t afford. Meaning, that while the servants were busy preparing the feast, the other parts of the compound were conveniently empty. </p><p>I moved forward without being accosted, the relative darkness making it even easier to move forward. It would be even easier, I decided as I moved forward.</p><p>Then, I noticed something unsettling.  </p><p>I couldn’t feel the presence of my grandfather. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Good afternoon, madam,” I said as I watched Aisnam climb down the stairs, my tone serious and respectful. She was in a good mood, confirming that her recovery went without a hitch. I was glad that I had managed to hide my return from her family. </p><p>I had a feeling that things wouldn’t have gone that smoothly if her family members were around, trying to impede her recovery. </p><p>“Good afternoon,” she answered as she approached, but I could see her expression slip a bit. She was surprised by my sudden attitude change. “What’s wrong?” </p><p>I made a point of looking toward the stairs. “Her Highness wouldn’t be joining us?” I asked, which made her look even more surprised. </p><p>“No —” she started, which was all she was able to say before I closed in the distance, and kissed her. </p><p>Vehemently. </p><p>“W-what was that?” she asked. </p><p>I gave her a shy smile. “Well, I missed you,” I explained. </p><p>She gave me a pointed glare. “No, the attitude you had before.” </p><p>“Well, that…” I started, giving her an even more hesitant smile. “That was just in case the Queen decided to come downstairs now that her illness is cured, and you haven’t informed her about … the full details. I don’t want to put you into a difficult position.” </p><p>I interrupted her with another kiss, and pulled back a while later. “Come, I already cooked lunch,” I said, and dragged her to the kitchen, leaving the little interlude unanswered as I brought her to share the small feast I cooked for her. I even opened a wine — the Spring Palace might be a prison, but it was for royalty, with a beautiful wine cellar. </p><p>As for my earlier little show, it had a subtle objective. I wanted her to show that I had no problem hiding our relationship for her sake. After all, not only she was already married to the king, but she was also from a cultivation family that actually treated the king as a lower-class citizen. Together, a homeless martial artist, no matter how skilled, was a terrible match for her. </p><p>I couldn’t discuss those reasons with her because I wasn’t supposed to know about her identity. However, I could still put on a little play, showing that I was willing to stay hidden to protect her reputation. </p><p>With that, I hoped to convince her to keep me around. </p><p>The lunch was fun, even when it was interrupted by some fun activities … the kind that triggered the rewards from the System once more. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - 129 Qi Strands]</p><p>Even though I was sweaty and exhausted, I couldn’t help but smile when I saw the results. A part of it was the size of the reward, in my inventory, I barely had a hundred and twenty strands, collected during several weeks of rigorous activity, doubling my storage immediately. </p><p>I wasn’t averse to that particular kind of hard work, but still, Qi strands from the System were vitally important. My lack of an Immortal Root meant that the best I could do without these rewards was to use my meditation technique to use the environmental Qi. It worked well to craft talismans, but sooner or later, I would need to improve my cultivation. </p><p>At that point, I would require hundreds … maybe even thousands of those strands to improve my cultivation, and even more to deal with the threats, welcoming the improvement. </p><p>The other part was the increase of the multiplier. Now that she was stronger, I didn’t dare to use my essence to test her cultivation, so the System confirming that she had recovered enough to confirm the System reward was good news. </p><p>The stronger she was, the less I had to work to keep her safe, and the more rewards I received. </p><p>“Now, how about some training,” she asked once she was dressed. </p><p>If it was another day, I might have tried to sweet-talk her for another ‘session’ of fun, but that seemed like a poor idea. She had just recovered her cultivation, and she seemed enthusiastic about stretching her capabilities. </p><p>Knowing when to play cute and when to play obedient was an important part of living the fun way. </p><p>“Whatever you wish, madam,” I whispered throatily, keeping my tone flirty even as I hooked my arm to hers and walked toward the training room. She leaned against me as we walked, showing a surprising amount of clinginess. </p><p>Interesting. I would have assumed it was the isolation, but that didn’t tell the full story. She didn’t seek physical comfort that much before sending me away, and she had been living in isolation even longer before we met. </p><p>Then, I shrugged. Her growing clinginess had the chance of being problematic, but ultimately, she had much bigger concerns. </p><p>“How about some no-contact sparring?” she asked. </p><p>“Your wishes, my command,” I said as I took the stance of the Forest Dance, ready to show off my martial capabilities more now that my injury excuse was gone. Luckily, she recovered as well, meaning, that no matter how much skill I showed during the process, it would be still inferior to her renewed power. </p><p>Which was good, as my System depended on it. </p><p>I started with a slow, brisk pace, letting her pick the pace. She started equally slow, but barely a few seconds later, I found myself dodging a sharp palm that would have taken off my head if it wasn’t for my enhanced reflexes. </p><p>It was sharp and dangerous even though she hadn’t used her Qi or her essence. The passive improvement from her cultivation alone was enough to make a huge difference. </p><p>She stopped immediately. “S-sorry about that,” she whispered, looking surprised at her own improvement. </p><p>“Breakthrough?” I asked. </p><p>She nodded, blushing at her own slip. “Yeah, the last month had been productive,” she explained rapidly, clearly hoping to mislead me about the timing of her improvement to maintain her fake identity. </p><p>I chuckled, as I had no problem playing along with that. “Don’t worry about it. It’s hard to get used to the improvement without some sparring. And, with the Queen injured, you didn’t have a candidate,” I said, accepting her apology while trying to convince her that her fake identity was still solid. </p><p>She attacked again, I defended, and soon, we fell into a rhythm where I had been pushing Forest Dance to the limit while she attacked again and again, putting its defensive nature to the best use. Though, I did my best not to read her attacks too much. </p><p>Ultimately, she was using Verdant Palm as her primary technique. She was not bad, comfortably displaying her ability at Minor Accomplishment. The two disciples they had sent to track me were barely at the Minor Familiarity, showing that, even for a family cultivator, her achievement was impressive. </p><p>Of course, for me, her attacks were open books, easily allowing me to read them easily. Acting unaware of my foreknowledge and trying to limit myself to my eyes was the bigger challenge. Still, I managed to play along until we took a break. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[85x Return - Palm of Verdant Cleansing - Minor Immersion]</p><p>“Tell me. Anything interesting outside?” she asked while I breathed hard, exaggerating my exhaustion somewhat. </p><p>I shrugged. “I didn’t have a chance to check the place, so I don’t know much,” I offered. “However, the foreign martial artist army I had seen at the outside, preparing to march to Markas was hard to miss.” </p><p>I didn’t expect her to suddenly gain a sharper look. “Really, to Markas? Are you sure?” she asked, showing too much interest in that offhanded comment. </p><p>“Well, based on the idle talk of a few scouts from Tiger Fist school that passed near me,” I told, creating an excuse for my knowledge before I repackaged my knowledge into a believable discussion between bored scouts, still giving her all relevant information. </p><p>It was easy to discover her with her renewed knowledge. And, I certainly didn’t want to lie to her. </p><p>Still, it was interesting that she wasn’t alarmed until the mention of Markas. I decided to test her slightly. “Well, not surprising. There had been a lot of gossip about that city since their civil war,” I said. She tried to keep her reaction hidden, but I saw her surprise. “Particularly since two flying cultivators fought during that war, according to the gossip,” I added. </p><p>An even bigger surprise. </p><p>Interesting. It implied that she had no idea about the most recent developments in the city. </p><p>“Any idea about which family the cultivators belonged.” </p><p>“According to the gossip, they were from the sects. Kartpa Valley and Entsa Pavilion,” I said. </p><p>Her expression tightened even more, leading me to believe that not only did she likely know about their sudden interest in Markas, but also she wasn’t happy about it. But, I didn’t mention those observations as I gave her a very brief explanation of events at the Markas, like I was telling her about some half-remembered gossip rather than retelling the events in which I had played a primary role. </p><p>“Let’s continue,” I said, interrupting her thoughts like I didn’t understand her sudden concern. She nodded, and we started practicing once more. </p><p>I was interested in her knowledge, but not to the point of revealing anything more. </p><p>After all, she was both the Queen and a cultivator. I was just a boy toy. </p><p>It was her mess to deal with. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I retreated from the stone doors, I found myself facing the same problem. </p><p>I was bored. </p><p>Using the tunnel to visit the capital was tempting, as I wanted to see the public reaction to the sudden increase of the savage beasts blocking the trade, maybe even pay a visit to Pearyin, but I didn’t want to get too far away from Aisnam just in case. </p><p>I didn’t want anyone to distract her. Cultivation was a dangerous business. </p><p>Luckily, there was a happy medium. The garden. </p><p>After my most recent breakthroughs, I was confident to keep myself hidden from the palace guards, at least the ones that were assigned to guard the garden, especially since the number and the quality of the guards declared since I had first threatened them. </p><p>At first, I assumed that they were complacent, but as I passed through their defensive cordon and started walking around the palace grounds, once again disguised as a servant, that impression changed. </p><p>There were a lot of new guards. It was noticeable, because they were less skilled, enough to be noticed by the way they walked. There was a mixture of Muscle Reinforcement and Skin Refinement artists in the new guards, but that meant very little. Their essence flow was problematic, their balance was poor, and their attitude was lackluster. </p><p>Not only they were elevated by apothecary assistance, but the apothecary that helped them wasn’t particularly impressive. I wondered why the royal family was dealing with amateurs. Though, admittedly, my perception about what counted as a skilled apothecary might be warped. </p><p>Slightly. </p><p>I ignored that thought as I found a nice concealed roof, and jumped it to get a better vantage point. I needed to understand why the guard quality had suddenly dropped. And, hopefully, if there was a problem, help them stave it. </p><p>Not because I suddenly wanted to defend the royal family, but because I wanted things to stay calm for the next few weeks while Aisnam got used to her increased cultivation. With that in mind, I started jumping between roofs. </p><p>One benefit of living in the palace as a servant, I knew the best paths to move around without being noticed, particularly with my ability to move far faster than any Connote Realm martial artist with ease. Moving faster meant that I could use the gaps between patrols far more efficiently. </p><p>Of course, any cultivator with a movement technique — something I still lacked — could replicate that feat, but the mortal kingdoms looked like they had long accepted that limitation. The cultivators were superior to them, to the point that a threat from an unknown one was treated as a royal decree when I was confronted by them. </p><p>I couldn’t help but contrast that with the poor and wild state of the cultivators I faced at the market. Some of them were strong enough to kill their way through the capital single-handedly, yet they lived like barbarian hunters, risking their lives every day. Why didn’t they come here and take over one of the kingdoms? </p><p>“Probably the cultivation families and sects,” I muttered as I continued moving deeper into the palace. After all, I had already watched as the strongest sects in the region fought over a mortal city. They probably had no chance to </p><p>That crazy swordsman might have a chance if he determined to stay, but he didn’t give me the impression of a particularly well-balanced individual in the first place. </p><p>I soon abandoned the thoughts about the political balance of itinerant cultivators and mortal kingdoms, and focussed on my exploration, going deeper while still staying in the middle layer. </p><p>The wider palace grounds had three layers. The outer layer was mostly for servants, guests, and lower-ranking nobles living in the capital to work for the royal family. Then, there was the middle layer, where the direct members of the royal family lived. The Spring Palace was technically a part of it, but with the lack of servants, it looked out of place. Moreover, she was the only Queen who lived in the middle layer. </p><p>The other two Queens lived in the inner layer, together with the other concubines, the area defended by the best and the brightest of the royal guard. Unlike the other parts, even the perimeter was defended by Bone Forging Realm artist, led by the occasional Connate Realm one. </p><p>And, another contrast, unlike the rest of the palace, the number of guards around the inner circle had increased. </p><p>Signaling that, whatever the problem was, it was enough to alert the king and make him prioritize his security over his reputation — as any problem in the other two parts of the city would no doubt lead to problems. </p><p>While trying to sneak into the inner layer to poke around the royal secrets was tempting, I ignored that. Instead, I went in the opposite direction, and started checking the outer layer of the palace. </p><p>The first thing I noticed, was a huge banquet being held in one of the gardens. The guests were a horde of martial artists. Almost five hundred of them, the weakest one at the Skin Refinement, with quite a number of Bone Forging ones mixed in. I didn’t see any Connate realm artists, but I had no doubt that they were around, because none of the Bone Forging realm artists looked like they were the leaders. </p><p>They were probably in the building. </p><p>Interesting crowd, particularly since they talked with the lower-ranking nobles with a surprising arrogance, making me wonder why they were. </p><p>Not the ultimate direction, as that was easy to guess. Markas. Maybe they were there for revenge, or maybe they just wanted to use the excuse to follow the orders of the Kartpa Valley. I didn’t know that part, and I wasn’t at a point of exploring that either. </p><p>I wanted to have a better idea of their timeline. Would they just leave the palace and start marching toward Markas, or maybe they would stay around and deal with the King directly. Or maybe, I was completely off-base, and they had a different plan in mind. </p><p>Ultimately, the issue of Markas was the effect of the political battle between two sects, not unlike the Soviet Union and America during the Cold War. It meant that they operated in certain rules and restrictions, instead relying on their proxies to fight and die for them. </p><p>Their involvement meant that I couldn’t interfere with their presence easily. </p><p>But, that didn’t mean that I wouldn’t just stop gathering information. Luckily, I was already dressed as a low-level servant, which allowed me to mix the servants who had been constantly carrying drinks and food to keep them entertained. </p><p>Adding some drugs to loosen their lips was easy. They were too comfortable to pay attention to such things. By listening to their chatter, I was able to get a better understanding of the status. </p><p>The first thing was their numbers. Apparently, they had ten Connate Realm martial artists leading them, and a hundred of them were Bone Forging realm artists. An impressive number, particularly since they looked used to battling. Moreover, they were talking about the presence of more than four thousand Muscle Reinforcement artists as well, increasing their number to five thousand. </p><p>Altogether, a serious force, more of an army than a mercenary force. </p><p>I had no doubt that, any of these Bone Forging realm artists could deal with the Connate Realm bodyguards of the old lady from the Verdant family. </p><p>As I listened, I got a better sense of what was going on. The force has been gathered from several countries. Officially, they were here at the request of the king, and they were hired to deal with the monsters surrounding Markas. </p><p>However, even with the royal invitation, the presence of a foreign army was certainly tense. No wonder the king was holed up in his private grounds, defending it recklessly. </p><p>Naturally, their official mission was nonsense. There were too many mentions of regaining the honor of Tiger Fist and making the heathens of Markas payback for me to believe that they wanted to help Markas. </p><p>What a mess. </p><p>Technically, if I did my best, I could somehow ruin their plans, but I ignored that option. Yes, I wanted to help Marana, but not at the cost of getting involved in another war. Instead, I would go back to Markas and inform her about the incoming threat. I would help her to escape the beasts … and if she still wanted to stay and fight, it was her problem. </p><p>With my mind made up, I returned to Spring Palace, waiting for Aisnam to recover. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was already midnight. As I lay next to Aisnam, hugging her, I once again analyzed my reward, which was higher than before. Her earlier breakthrough was certainly helpful. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 40; Pampering Bonus - 65 (Capped)]</p><p>[105x Return - 7 Qi Strands]</p><p>“Why are you here?” Aisnam asked again, but considering the last time was several hours ago, before I interrupted her with a kiss — and much more — the repeat was understandable. </p><p>“The healer that you sent me not only solved my problem —” I started, which was interrupted by a sudden gasp. She put her hand on my chest, and a sliver of Qi invaded my essence. I kept my true cultivation hidden but let her check my martial one. </p><p>She let her control fade, which paid off nicely. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 40; Pampering Bonus - 65 (Capped)]</p><p>[105x Return - 1 Qi Strand]</p><p>“You’re healed … and you already had your breakthrough,” she gasped, then looked at me angrily. “Why did you come back?” </p><p>“Was I not supposed to?” I asked, deliberately acting obtuse, as she had never mentioned the deadline to me officially. “Remember, I was supposed to return after my treatment was complete all along. The treatment is done, and I returned.” </p><p>“I see,” she muttered, happy with my return, but frustrated that I threw myself into danger once more. “How did you pass through the cursed tunnel?” she added. I reached into my clothes, and showed the protection talisman I had drawn. Her eyes widened. “That’s a good one. Where did you get it?” </p><p>“The same place where I picked my other mission,” I said. </p><p>“What other mission?” she asked. </p><p>I chuckled. I couldn’t help but be amused by the fact that she had already forgotten the excuse she had used to send me away. I was supposed to pick the medicine for the Queen. “Sorry. I forgot in the excitement of seeing you, but that old lady didn’t have the medicine for the Queen, so she sent me somewhere else to pick it up,” I said, and reached to my clothes once more, this time passing her the box. I did so, because I didn’t want her to ask too many questions about the cultivator market. </p><p>The less she knew, the easier I could navigate in the future. </p><p>The box was sealed with a formation, but a sliver of Qi was enough to unlock it, revealing a pill in a jade bottle. </p><p>And, a paper filled with instructions. She quickly skimmed it before gasping. “A … a pill to repair the immortal root,” she stammered in shock, as she had just opened a random box in her basement and found it filled with gold. </p><p>I had a feeling that, she would never consider trading that pill for gold, even enough gold to literally fill the said imaginary basement. I could understand, as the Qi radiating from the pill was thick and strong, and it smelled incredible. Unfortunately, I had no idea about its quality. </p><p>“Do you know what that represents?” she gasped. </p><p>“I have no idea, but I’m guessing it’s something important,” I said, then leaned for a quick kiss. “Why don’t you go and bring that to the Queen?” She nodded, but said nothing, still looking shocked. I could see that she wanted to ask many questions, but failed to find the appropriate one. </p><p>I was glad for my supposed lack of knowledge. After all, I just brought back a box from a dealer, and knew nothing about cultivation. </p><p>She was still shocked, so I took the initiative. “I’m guessing you’re going to stay upstairs and defend the Queen in case something goes wrong?” I asked, carefully leading her to a decision. She nodded. “How long would it take?” </p><p>“A day? Maybe two?” she answered, still looking shocked. “Do you know what it means?” </p><p>“No, but you can explain to me later,” I said as I leaned for another kiss. “Now, why don’t you go and give the Queen the good news, while I stay here and make sure nothing goes wrong?” I kissed her again. “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you,” I promised. </p><p>She looked conflicted, and for a moment, I thought she would admit her real identity, but then, she chose to dress and leave. “We’ll talk again tomorrow,” she said, then went upstairs. I was tempted to offer my help as a cultivator, but decided against it. </p><p>As Pearyin showed, once the mindset of my lover changed, there were no further bonuses. I couldn’t risk that with Aisnam unless it was a life-and-death situation. Not when she was my only source of Qi. </p><p>Thanks to my increased cultivation, I had a better sense of what was going on upstairs. There was already a dense amount of pure Qi there, showing that she had put the purification talismans I had given to her to good use. </p><p>I carefully extended my senses, feeling the movements of the Qi. For a while, it was subtle and unmoving, then, it started to be pulled in. Slowly at first, but soon it picked up speed. Soon, the Qi upstairs turned into a tornado. </p><p>I walked around the house, even added a few protective talismans in certain spots to make sure the sudden circulation wouldn’t damage the protection of the house, and noticed from the outside. And, just to be on the safe side, I put on my cultivator disguise. </p><p>An unnecessary measure, it turned out. The added protective charms worked excellently. Annoyingly, it meant that I had nothing to do. I couldn’t draw any talismans because I left brush outside, not to mention I only had a few papers remaining. I couldn’t go to the city, because I wanted to continue guarding her just in case. </p><p>And, I couldn’t practice martial arts. Well, technically, I could, but I had already worked hard on them during my travels, and the progress I could make on them without finding some new styles was limited. </p><p>“Why not explore the cursed Qi, then,” I muttered to myself as I walked to the secret entrance. It was easy to open from the inside. I left a cleansing and a purification charm at the entrance to make sure cursed Qi didn’t slip inside. </p><p>Then, I walked in until I arrived at the stone gate, examining it during the nighttime for the first time. There were certain differences. For once, there were several symbols, glowing softly, though, a few of them were dimmer. I didn’t recognize them, but considering cursed Qi was flowing from the weakened symbols, it wasn’t very difficult to guess their function. </p><p>Also, examining those weakened symbols, I could see that they were deliberately damaged. Recently too, though I didn’t know whether it was Aisnam or her rivals that was responsible. Either case was possible. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t explain what was hidden in there, and why it was constantly letting out cursed Qi. If I had been more naive, I might have assumed that it wasn’t too dangerous, as cultivators were willing to use it as a tool for their personal battles. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had already seen them using a civil war for their own purposes, showing that their sense of what was appropriate was quite a bit different than mine. </p><p>It was much better to assume that it was risky. Therefore, I didn’t dare to walk in. Instead, I started examining the symbols, trying to decipher them with the help of my talisman knowledge. It didn’t work. </p><p>They belonged to a formation, which completely different from a talisman. </p><p>… maybe I should break the symbols and open the door, I thought. After all, it was an opportunity. Who knew what might be hidden in its depths. Maybe it would give me a chance to rise to the top, make me rise to the top, and make those arrogant monsters pay! All would die in my hands! </p><p>I shuddered as I pulled back and closed the secret entrance. And, for good measure, actually activated a cleansing charm to get rid of the remaining bits. </p><p>Those thoughts were not mine. For one, I didn’t have an enemy. The closest thing that I had to an enemy was the Verdant Family, and even then, it was a distant, indirect connection due to my desire to help Aisnam. They were an inconvenience at best. I certainly wasn’t at a point where I wanted to massacre them. </p><p>Also, I didn’t care about any opportunity. Why should I, when I had my System, which was very enough. Technically, an opportunity might grant me more power — as evidenced by that mad swordsman I had seen — but my System was already doing so steadily. </p><p>Without tempting me for casual genocide in the process. </p><p>No, I had no intention of opening up mysterious stone gates that would fit perfectly in a horror movie just to follow the promises of a mysterious voice whispering directly to my thoughts. </p><p>On the contrary, I decided to find a way to learn formations. </p><p>Repairing those symbols wasn’t a terrible idea. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasted no time as I hugged Aisnam, ripping off her clothes while dragging her to the bedroom, not breaking the kiss in the process. I had never been this aggressive with her before, but after spending all that time helping her, I was feeling rather randy. </p><p>Her desperate tongue, dancing in my mouth, showed that she had absolutely no problems with my initiative. She even forgot to warn me to be silent to as not to disturb ‘the Queen’. I couldn’t help but chuckle even as we moved toward the bedroom, each step bringing us closer to desperation. She soon started ripping my clothes as well, her hips dancing desperately. </p><p>Then, she surprised me by pulling back. If it wasn’t for the intensity of her arousal, I might have been afraid that she wanted to stop. However, under the circumstances, I wasn’t surprised when she leaned against the wall impatiently.</p><p>“Someone is impatient,” I chuckled, which earned a frustrated gaze from her. Only a frustrated gaze. Arguably, she might have followed up with more, but she did not, mostly for one simple reason. </p><p>I had already slipped inside her wetness. </p><p>She clamped around me as the pleasure hit, her pouty lips busy with letting out endless moans. For a fleeting moment, I focused on her cultivation, noticing that she had managed to actually open two of her gates in my absence. Incredible progress … to be examined later. </p><p>For the moment, I growled in pleasure as I drilled her from behind, pounding my beautiful Queen with the considerable might of a Peak Skin Refinement Martial artist. However, she was too distracted by the throbbing presence of my cock to notice that, her walls clenching around me desperately. </p><p>She had the raw strength to reverse the position if she wished, but that meant nothing as the pleasure invaded her. She was helpless under the wave of pleasure, nothing but a toy for my desire. “Did you miss me?” I said. </p><p>She just moaned. </p><p>Admittedly, it was an answer enough, but after our separation, she was just needy enough for me to push my luck. “I need an answer when I ask a question, madam,” I whispered gently, but at the same time, I spanked her ass, not so gently. </p><p>The moan that followed was even more incredible, and so was her tightness. “What are you—” she started, finally managing to speak, but I interrupted her with a searing kiss. </p><p>Just because I was a freeloader didn’t mean I had to be the submissive party in bed … or, under current circumstances, against the wall in a random corridor of the cursed palace. </p><p>“Your punishment, of course. Don’t you think you deserve it after ignoring my question?” She looked shocked. “Now, tell me. Did you miss me?” </p><p>She looked split between following my directions and rebelling. The latter didn’t surprise me, as not only she was the Queen of a mortal kingdom — albeit exiled — but more importantly, she was a proud cultivator from a cultivation family. Hardly a recipe for the creation of a sub. </p><p>Yet, the pleasure worked wonders to change her mind, and her disguise further freed her from her obligation. “Yes, I missed — I missed you,” gasped, interrupted by a beautiful moan in the middle. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I spanked her again, gently, humming in satisfaction as she tightened around me. I was tempted to ask her more questions, but after a moment, I decided against it. It was a fun idea, but I didn’t want to push my luck too much. </p><p>Instead, I played nice … well, as nice as one could be while pressing their partner against the wall and ramming at full strength, while occasionally spanking her tight ass. It must be nice. Otherwise, why would she beg for more? </p><p>Or, tremble under the aggression of a spectacular climax. </p><p>I delivered another harsh spank to her beautiful ass before I grabbed her legs and lifted her. “To the bedroom,” I said as I carried her, though I still stayed inside her, each step driving me deeper into her. </p><p>“I …” she started, but that died quick, the pleasure hitting her even harder after her most recent climax. That was all she was able to say until we arrived at my bedroom. Amusingly, I noticed that the place looked lived in, her smell of arousal subtle but noticeable, showing that she had visited the room more than once to touch … our memories. </p><p>“Naughty,” I said, teasing her. She tensed as she realized exactly what I was talking about. Luckily for her, I was merciful and didn’t push her too much. I just threw her on the bed, prone and helpless, and I took my position above her. </p><p>She barely had the time to bury her face in the pillow before I started impaling her once more, but that wasn’t enough to silence her beautiful moans. “I missed your voice,” I said as I impaled her again and again, driving her closer to the climax. </p><p>She just howled in pleasure, the joy dragging her thoughts away. Not exactly queenly behavior. Unfortunately, I was supposed to be tricked by her maid identity, therefore couldn’t just tease her about it. At least, not directly. </p><p>“Careful,” I whispered. “You’re going to wake your precious Queen up,” I said. </p><p>That was enough to make her pull her head away from the pillow, and pause for a second. I could see indecision dancing on her face, going through many options. “Don’t worry. She’s a heavy sleeper,” she said. </p><p>A good excuse, particularly since her mind was having trouble working with the pleasure blanketing her thoughts. </p><p>”Good news,” I said as I grabbed her hair and pulled back recklessly, enjoying one of the lesser benefits of her cultivation. A punch strong enough to take down a bear and running faster than a car were nice benefits … but the ability to play rough in the bedroom without fearing any lasting damage was certainly convenient. “Then, we can play without fear.” </p><p>I pulled her hair hard enough to make her gasp in pain, lifting her body up. As I continued to invade her, her breasts jiggled ceaselessly. “Yes, fuck me harder,” she moaned. </p><p>It broke my resistance and I exploded inside her, turning the moment into a spectacular climax. I filled her depths, and she climaxed once more… </p><p>Yet, I didn’t even slow down. Another benefit of cultivation. </p><p>Limitless stamina. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had made sure to change my clothes completely, and hid everything except the box, several emergency talismans, and the door token in a secret spot in the misty mountains, before I approached the cultivator market once again. </p><p>Of course, once again, the real disguise came from the thick layer of essence covering my Qi, hiding it from all but the most careful observer. With that, my disguise was convincing enough. With that, I approached the cultivator market from the opposite direction, making sure to carry the token out to prevent a cultivator from attacking me because of my disrespect. </p><p>After all, from their perspective, I was just a martial artist, and wasn’t a part of the protection. However, the token of the Treasure Pavilion changed it. </p><p>When I arrived at the market, people watched me curiously, but I ignored all of them. The less time I gave them to react, the lower the chances of an ambush. Then, I glanced at the corner, where two Verdant Disciples looking at me with sharp eyes. </p><p>Well, a second ambush, I corrected myself. </p><p>With that, I went to the door and pressed the token, which opened like it did for Cultivator Aom. However, unlike it did against him, the token melted. Why, I didn’t know, but since the same woman greeted me, I didn’t bother to question and entered the room. </p><p>“The box,” she said. I passed it to her. She put the box into some kind of jade talisman. It glowed. After checking that, she passed through a door, and brought back a bottle. The process was weird enough that, I didn’t even dare to ask a question. I just took the bottle, and walked out. </p><p>The less I interacted with such a weird place, the better. </p><p>The moment I stepped out, I started walking fast. Several groups followed me at a distance, but, ironically, their numbers made the situation easier, as they were more careful about each other rather than a mere martial artist that they could catch any moment. </p><p>Their reaction showed that, the Treasure Pavilion didn’t bother protecting their customers. I shrugged. Ultimately, it didn’t matter since I wasn’t planning to use them much. </p><p>I had alternative channels for various items. </p><p>Cultivators maintained the distance, even the disciples of Verdant Family, and I arrived at the valley without a problem. It looked like my latest breakthrough was a tad unnecessary, but then I shrugged. Better safe than sorry. </p><p>When I arrived at the valley, I alighted the smoke bombs, the chain explosion suddenly filling the whole valley with foul-smelling smoke, cutting all the methods of detection the cultivators had except Qi. Through that, they were able to follow, but the distance was too wide. </p><p>I had to dodge a couple of ranged attacks, but they weren’t a threat from such a great distance. Then, without revealing my speed or using a talisman, I found myself in the mist, which blocked their biggest advantage. </p><p>Interestingly, even as I disappeared into the mists, the disciples of the Verdant family didn’t say anything or make a move, choosing to stay away. Maybe I misunderstood their objective slightly. They wanted to take the pill, but not as much as they wanted to deprive Aisnam of it. Otherwise, they would have moved farther. </p><p>I used five of my precious Qi Strands to move faster, as the essence didn’t work properly in the mist. I dashed as fast as I could go, and before they could even catch up with me, I was gone. It had been easy, because the cultivators had been looking for a helpless martial artist, and not a cultivator of Third Stage who was willing to waste a lot of energy just to move faster. </p><p>Of course, Misty Mountains' blocking worked against me as well, so I didn’t know exactly what was going on behind me. My best guess, they were trying to block each other from capturing me first. </p><p>I didn’t care. Instead, I rushed to my hiding spot, picked everything I had left there, and moved even further away before I burned my clothes, changed into the cultivator identity I had been using to visit the place, and left the mountains from a different location, the bottle wrapped by a protection talisman and hidden away just in case. </p><p>Good that I did, because at a distance, I could see almost twenty cultivators fighting intensely. But, they were mostly Second and Third realm, and their combat techniques were simple enough not to be a threat against me. </p><p>At a greater distance, I could see the disciples from the Verdant family having a discussion with a few cultivators, no doubt trying to deal with me. Altogether, a smooth escape. </p><p>Especially since, I wasn’t the only one that was moving toward the cultivation market. A few people looked at me suspiciously, but at this point, I had a reputation as a reckless cultivator, so they ignored me. Still, as I looked at what was going on, I couldn’t help but imagine what would have happened. First, I would have fought against several weak itinerant cultivators, and then a few stronger greedy ones would have attacked me, forcing me to spend more of my stored Qi. </p><p>Then, the two disciples would have attacked, probably together with several others, forcing me to spend more and more Qi and talismans, until it became clear that I was much stronger than anyone at my level was supposed to be… The verdant family would have started paying more attention to me, and maybe even that Foundation Establishment cultivator would return and see the source of my power. And, even if I got away somewhat, Verdant family would have hounded me on the way back, turning it into a desperate wild chase… </p><p>I couldn’t help but shudder. It sounded like hell. </p><p>No, instead, I disappeared just like many other cultivators, my presence unnoticed. Another quick change, and I started running in the wilderness, my most recent breakthrough to the Peak of the Skin Refinement Realm allowing me to push Rabbit Dash even faster. Therefore, even when avoiding the mess, I returned to the kingdom of Zaim in less than a week, which was fortunate, as it meant there were only three weeks to that arbitrary deadline I had given when they attacked. </p><p>However, as I approached, I realized a problem. There were a lot of savage beasts around. Not as much as Markas, but enough to slow down the trade between different cities. It looked like the game between the two sects was starting to have immediate consequences. </p><p>I wanted to rush to the Spring Palace immediately, but I ignored that temptation and chose to enter the capital for a quick visit first. I met with a surprising view. Out of the two cultivator mansions outside the city, one of them had been destroyed … apparently, by an unnamed swordsman, who then went out to destroy the sect as well. </p><p>That sect was supposed to be smaller than Entsa Pavilion and Kartpa Valley, but it didn’t make the situation any less shocking. A Golden Core cultivator, just like the one I had seen back in Markas, strong enough to destroy a city, dead. </p><p>That young man — whose name I finally learned, Xantum — was truly a madman, but what fascinated me was the way people talked about him, elevating him as a great warrior because he had answered the disrespect that had been raised against him. </p><p>Proving that mass murder could be treated as a bar punch if the deliverer was strong enough. </p><p>Yet, once I went to the Palace and ascertained that Aisnam was still alive, I moved back. First, I checked Pearyin from a distance. She was in good condition, still practicing while selling the low-level pills as I asked. </p><p>Then, I decided to swing by Markas. After my latest breakthrough, the distance had become even shorter, allowing me to visit the place in less than an hour. I wasn’t planning to talk with her either, but one thing changed my mind. </p><p>The slumps of Markas had developed a gang problem. A gang that was led by foreigners, each suspiciously competent in Tiger Fist. It’s changed my mind. </p><p>Marana was not at home, but I just used the secret entrance and barged in. She still had the apothecary lab in place, and with it, a shockingly large pile of herbs waiting for me. I used them to refine a lot of essence pills, their quality even higher than the previous time. </p><p>I hadn’t improved my apothecary knowledge any further since my last visit, but I had several breakthroughs, which helped greatly. I took some with me, but the majority, I left with Marana. </p><p>Then, I found a cave to bury everything but the pill and a few protective talismans, used the secret entrance. I knocked on the secret entrance door loudly several times. </p><p>It opened a minute later. At the other side of the door, I saw Aisnam, in her usual outfit complete with the veil, holding an unfamiliar but very dangerous-looking talisman in hand. Yet, what caught my attention was her shocked gaze. “W-why are you here?” she asked with a trembling voice. </p><p>I could have answered her. Instead, I took a step forward, tugged down her veil to reveal her beautiful face … and put her beautiful lips to better use than talking. </p><p>She melted in my arms. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I had settled in the valley, I had carefully cut some branches from four dark thistles to not to damage plants … then mutilated the separated branches until they looked like they were harvested by complete amateur that survived only by sheer luck. </p><p>That reduced the value significantly, but it was better than revealing that I was an expert when it came to harvesting. It should be still enough to exchange for some talisman papers. Which was important, because I couldn’t just exchange Profound High-Grade talismans again in the same identity without arousing suspicion. </p><p>The only reason I dared to leave those plants was the protective charms at the entrance. After all, slowly raising a garden of spirit plants to give Qi was too obvious of a strategy. And, the situation of Aisnam’s aunt — or great aunt — showed that it was actually a workable strategy. Yet, no itinerant cultivator tried that.</p><p>The reason wasn’t hard to guess. A spirit plant garden was too easy to rob. The old woman had the Verdant family to take revenge for her, not to mention her cultivation was high enough to make that intimidating. </p><p>The same didn’t apply to my little garden. If it wasn’t for the two protective talismans keeping the Qi locked in, I wouldn’t have dared to set up a garden, even a temporary one. The risk of discovery would have been too high. </p><p>With that little task done, I returned to the cultivation market, and once again visited the same stall. As much as changing my looks to use another identity was tempting, it was clear that the market didn’t have a lot of new visitors, and multiple new visitors, each selling suspiciously expensive talismans would be too suspicious. </p><p>“Did you manage to get more talisman ink and paper?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes. As long as you can pay,” he said. </p><p>“Here,” I said as I showed him the dark thistle needles. </p><p>“One spiritual stone,” he offered, which was a more fair price than the extreme gouging of the talismans. Understandable, as unlike talismans, the common products had more or less standardized products. I made the exchange. “Do you need more talisman paper?” he asked. </p><p>“As much as you have,” I said. “First, give me a bundle for the spirit stone,” I said. He passed me twenty of them, and I checked the paper. The quality was once again horrendous. An ordinary talisman maker could never draw anything </p><p>Worse, he had a sheet of ordinary paper mixed in, modified slightly to look like talisman paper. That one, I pulled off and slid back. Not because I cared about the loss, but if I let him slide that one, I had a feeling the next bundle would be all paper. “This one is too low quality,” I said. </p><p>He replaced it immediately. “Any progress,” he asked. </p><p>“Soon,” I said with an enthusiastic smile like I actually believed that to be possible. “So, give me all the paper you have.” </p><p>“That’s all I have,” he said, and gave me sixty more papers, and I gave him three spirit stones, reducing my reserves into seven of them. </p><p>I walked around the market a while more, trying to find something interesting. I kept my eyes open, particularly to see if there were any seeds or other items, but none of the stall owners were bothering to sell something like that, only buying. Understandable, as they were hardy something an itinerant cultivator would be interested in buying. </p><p>Instead, the real valuable stuff was the weapons and the pills, but considering how I had been fleeced while exchanging for talisman materials, I didn’t dare to touch them. Who knew if they might explode in my hands or poison me. </p><p>At this point, other than talisman paper, purchasing anything wasn’t valuable. I spent some time hanging at the market, watching to see if anyone used the Treasure Pavilion to make an exchange. I had to watch for a long time to see a cultivator go there. </p><p>He was a middle-aged cultivator, and he was alone. Also, from the reaction of the people, he was clearly far stronger than the rest of the market. Just by walking, I could feel the pressure he radiated. People stayed away, but their gazes felt familiar. I had seen the same kind of gaze while looking at celebrities. </p><p>Once he left, the fascinated whispers about the great cultivator Aom revealed the reason. He turned out to be a Foundation Establishment cultivator and to make him even more impressive for the rest, he was also an itinerant one, turning him into a true idol for the rest. </p><p>He revealed an identical token to one I had in my possession, pressed it against the door, and it opened. I barely got a glimpse, and saw a beautiful woman greeting him, a glimpse enough to confirm that she was a Connate realm artist. </p><p>Interestingly, that made the mysterious building even more dangerous. </p><p>After seeing that, I decided that I could make the exchange. However, I still had a week to kill before visiting the store, so I visited the misty mountains again, and managed to find some endless blossoms. </p><p>I uprooted them and brought them back to my cave, which increased the Qi density somewhat, enough for me to use up all sixty talisman papers. However, this time, I had used most of it to create purification talismans. </p><p>Since I couldn’t sell those made of inferior paper, I wanted to turn them into future investments for Aisnam. </p><p>Once that was done, I uprooted the spirit plants from the cave, carried them back to the misty mountains, and replanted them once again in a secluded corner in case I visited this place again. Then, I cut four more branches from the dark thistles, collected some seeds from them, and visited the market again. </p><p>Once I arrived at the market, I met with a sight that proved that my caution was not for nothing. Two young cultivators, wandering at the market without doing anything, each using the Thousand Petals Gate Transformation Technique for their cultivation, which I only recognized at a glance because my proficiency was at Perfection.</p><p>Disciples of Verdant family.</p><p>It looked like my caution was not for nothing. If I made the purchase earlier, I could have got away without getting caught, but it would have also revealed I was moving far faster than a martial artist was supposed to be moving, let alone one that was yet to reach Bone Forging. </p><p>I visited the stall again. “Unfortunately, I don’t have any more talisman paper yet,” he said. I suspected that the rest of the paper I received had come from the stock of the other stalls he collected. </p><p>“Too bad. Maybe you’ll have some for the next time,” I said as I passed the mangled thistle branch and some endless blossom petals, enough for two-spirit stones that had almost no Qi. Still, that was good enough. </p><p>With that, I left the market, thinking of finding myself an escape path. No one would attack me at the market, especially since the disciples they send to apprehend me wasn’t too strong. One advantage of being an expert in their technique, I was able to assess their cultivation level easily. Both of them were at the Third Stage, and I was confident of dealing with them. </p><p>The trick was to do so without escalating. I had no doubt that, if I killed them, it would create a lot of trouble, and even without that, I wasn’t willing to do so. Unfortunately, while I would be more willing to just break their cultivation, I had a feeling that Verdant Family would take that insult in stride. </p><p>One good thing, I expected them to wait until they could ambush me. Clearly, the pill I planned to purchase was valuable enough to make it worth their time, so I expected them to wait until I couldn’t easily destroy it or something. </p><p>After spending more than two weeks here, I had a general idea about the layout of the place. I picked a nice valley for me, close to the misty mountains, and used my apothecary skills to create a ridiculous number of smoke bombs, enough to envelop a couple miles radius once triggered. </p><p>Once that was done, I created a few rock traps and other distractions as well. They wouldn’t have worked against cultivators, even the Third Stage ones, but the bigger the commotion, the better. </p><p>“It should be enough … but will it be,” I muttered, and after some thought, I decided to make another preparation. I took a meditative pose, reached into my Inventory, and pulled a Qi Strand to feed into my second gate. Then another … and another. </p><p>Breaking through and properly reinforcing my cultivation took thirty Qi strands, almost three times the previous breakthrough, which once again proved the annoyingly exponential nature of my cultivation … though, I doubted if another cultivator would have shared my opinion, considering I broke through smoothly, with no hidden injury. </p><p>A lot of cultivators, particularly ones without a family and master to guide them, broke through forcefully, which left them with hidden wounds. The mild cases might just limit their power a bit, and in serious cases, backlash could be deadly. </p><p>I learned a lot from the random discussions at the market. </p><p>With that done, I followed up with another, even easier breakthrough, which brought me to the peak of Skin Refinement. </p><p>Now, I was ready to make the exchange. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Exploring the secrets of the warehouse was not a simple challenge. It represented a secret cooperation between the New Giant Force and the Elite Syndicate, the premier hero guild and a surprisingly strong villainous team. I knew for a fact that the Syndicate would kill to keep it a secret.  </p><p>Worse, I had very little doubt about the Guild following the same path. Of course, they would do their best to hide it either as collateral damage, or by hiding the origin of the assassin, but ultimately, it would end up the same. </p><p>They already wanted to deal with me, but luckily, their concerns held them back. Now, the thing I needed to do was to somehow examine them without raising their alertness. </p><p>Then, inspiration hit. I wondered if the appearance of my redheaded visitor related to why they didn’t deal with me, and not just about my mysterious backing. The warehouse might be more important than I had first assumed, and if other heroes were independently exploring it.</p><p>That gave my nonexistent boss another reason to stick around. Their warehouse was bait for the heroic forces, and we were the spiders waiting for our prey. That realization came with a horrible shiver. I didn’t want to see what would happen if the Lady of Destruction connected the dots the same way. </p><p>She might decide to actually deal with us before moving to her real target. </p><p>“Fuck, like things weren’t complicated enough,” I muttered as I started churning out plans, cursing myself for not placing some kind of tracker on her. </p><p>I decided to go for a shopping trip before I could decide what direction to prioritize. I changed my looks twice more, my Observation once again helping me to put the details perfectly. Luckily, paying cash for dubious security equipment was not something that needed to be bothered. </p><p>I had made several purchases. More cameras, some smaller, some with thermal imaging, the best looking remote-controlled rat toy I could find — thanks to a prank shop — as well as several other smaller gimmick items I hoped to somehow leverage as a part of my unusual defenses. </p><p>However, paying eight hundred dollars for a rat toy was annoying even with my recent boost of income. </p><p>Once I returned to the bar, I went into my office immediately, and started fiddling with the rat toy, trying to put a camera in an unnoticeable way, hoping that its presence would go unnoticed in the shadows of the tunnel. </p><p>Luckily, while the rat toy was absurdly expensive, it also came with some good features, including a motion sensor. I just needed to put a camera under it in a way that would avoid notice, and manually control whenever it triggered an alarm. </p><p>Ideally, it would do automatically, but the default behaviors were too aggressive — not surprising considering it was supposed to be an expensive prank item. Hopefully, Emily’s power could adjust it. She managed to redesign a laser cannon. A toy should be doable. </p><p>Once that was done, I used the entrance I kept mostly closed, and let the rat into the tunnel. My plan was to use the remote to bring it to the farthest direction possible. </p><p>It failed. </p><p>Apparently, they didn’t design those toys with deep underground spy work in mind. </p><p>That meant the tunnel was a bust without Emily’s help. Luckily, I already arranged a visit for the expanded dossier, and I could ask her for help with the rat toy then. Ideally, integrating it with some kind of signal booster as well. </p><p>However, that was for the future. For a while, I walked out, wanting to install a few more cameras in some sensitive locations, ideally without being noticed. </p><p>It was fun to watch the reaction of the gang members and henchmen to my presence now that my disguise was gone. They alternated between panicked scampering and respectful nods. It looked like my reputation was growing. As much as it galled me to admit it — as I never wanted to be a villain, even a fake one — it was satisfying to see their reactions. </p><p>Too bad such respect only came with a very high chance of early death. </p><p>The lazy walk helped. It gave me an excuse to occasionally stop by in random spots, though I only placed a camera or a sensor when I was sure I wasn’t being watched — my power was being extremely helpful in that aspect. After twenty minutes, I planned to return, when a car pulled in front of me, and the window rolled down. </p><p>That old man from the Syndicate. </p><p>“I hope you’re not going to offer candy,” I said with a smirk. A simple joke, but also not. It was also a preemptive way of signaling I had no intention of entering their car, and not extending my trust to them. At the same time, I pushed my power, reading his reaction tightly. I was disappointed. But along with it, I also caught some sense of relaxation. </p><p>I understood where he was coming from. By refusing to enter his car, I was implying that I didn’t trust them not to act against me. On the surface, it made sense, as honor between villains was a vogue thing. However, it also implied that I didn’t have the ability to protect myself once I entered their car … of course, the flip side of the argument was that I didn’t fear their capabilities as long as I was out in the open.</p><p>Implying the possible existence of another, hidden security. His nervous gaze, wandering around the street for a moment before he could consciously fix it confirmed that. </p><p>It wasn’t what I planned, but I wasn’t unhappy to see it on his face, particularly to see if believed. It played well to the illusion of power I tried to create. Strong enough that dealing required quite a bit of effort, yet not strong or threatening enough to prioritize over their other interests. </p><p>“Certainly not,” he said with a chuckle and got out of his car. “I was hoping that you would accompany this old man for a walk.” </p><p>“It would be my pleasure,” I said, just with enough dishonesty to make him underestimate my acting capabilities. </p><p>“So, how’s the business,” he said. </p><p>“Well enough. Managing a bar is as entertaining as I hoped,” I said, reinforcing the idea that the bar aspect was my personal project. </p><p>“I just hope that it doesn’t keep you from your real mission,” he said, probing me. </p><p>I smirked. “I don’t know what you mean.” </p><p>“Of course, my mistake,” he responded with a dismissive hand wave, not bothered by my ignoring. After all, even here, admitting crimes in the middle of the road was not the smartest thing. “How’s your customer variety.” </p><p>“I had some interesting visitors recently,” I said quickly. Clearly, he was aware of my redheaded visitor, and probing me about her. The question was about what he knew. Things would get complicated quickly if he knew about her heroic identity and came to probe me. </p><p>Unfortunately, my observation ability was just that, observation, and not mind reading. </p><p>He was slightly tense at the indirect mention of my visitor, but it wasn’t the intense, visceral reaction I expected him to show if he knew the Lady of Destruction was throwing distance away from his precious warehouse. It was close enough that, even I fought against her in my bar — well, if Tara fought against her — the warehouse might have ended up destroyed as well. </p><p>“Oh, how fascinating,” he commented. “Anyone worthwhile.” </p><p>“Nothing too onerous. Just a rich girl too curious for her own good,” I said. “I’m sure she’ll get bored after a few visits.” </p><p>“And, is there a way to hasten that cycle?” he asked. </p><p>“Not particularly, unless you want to bring more curious visitors,” I said, confirming that she was a spy, implying she was a lower-level agent that could be dealt with easily, while also threatening him with the potentially angering the larger organization behind her by targeting her.  </p><p>“I see. Not exactly a cost-effective method, then,” he said. “What if she starts bringing out her friends. A lot of party girls had the potential t</p><p>“We believe that by properly entertaining such visitors, their numbers could be kept low,” I said. “We found out that ‘sending’ one away only makes the others more curious. It’s best to make them bored.”  </p><p>“Really, is this wise?” he asked. </p><p>I shrugged. “Feel free to deal with them directly … if you want to maintain the integrity of the neighborhood, sir,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, no. I’m just an old man. Dealing with … party girls is a young man’s game. Just make sure it doesn’t disturb the  neighborhood.”  </p><p>“Naturally,,” I said. </p><p>“Changing the topic. What’s your favorite color. Yellow or green?” </p><p> “Neither. I favor transparency … unmarked kind,” I said, finishing the discussion.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>The morning after the undercover visit from Blue Princess — a.k.a The Lady of Destruction — the monumental nature of what had just happened hit me again. I had been just visited by one of the heroes with the worst reputation for collateral damage. </p><p>Yet, rather than ending up in prison, I had received a sexy lap dance. Not bad for a fake villain. </p><p>If only I could believe that it was the end. Unfortunately, I wasn’t naive enough to think so. There was a reason she visited my bar … and, I needed to find out what. There were several likely reasons for her visit. </p><p>First, the ‘unfortunate’ deaths of a hero and two villains. The death of supers had always been treated with more gravitas than their unfortunate normal victims, and it was not outside of the realm of possibility that she discovered my role in their deaths and came to explore. However, considering her reputation, I doubted it would be her approach for that particular investigation. </p><p>It was also possible that she was here because of my entanglement with Emily, as technically, it could be a method of spying on the New Giant Force through her abilities. But, once again, it wasn’t likely. Even if she had joined the New Giant Force secretly, it was hardly the kind of assignment they would give her. </p><p>In the end, there were two believable options for her presence. First, some people started to get spooked about the mysterious — and nonexistent — villain behind me. To get a handle on my background, they were sending spies. At least, that made sense in terms of scale. </p><p>Then, of course, there was the last option. She visited my bar, not because I was the target, but because it was a nice staging ground for her real mission … the warehouse. </p><p>I had already discovered that the warehouse was a complicated issue, some kind of staging ground for an unholy deal between the Syndicate and the New Giant Force as they smuggled something. </p><p>“I really know how to pick a location,” I muttered as I put on my disguise. If only I didn’t accidentally choose the worst possible location to establish a bar. </p><p>Unfortunately, if wishes came true … well, no need to waste time on that. Instead, I finished changing and walked down. Tara was at the bar, cleaning. “Be careful, and don’t forget to check the cameras,” I reminded her, and, after a quick kiss, departed through the tunnel. </p><p>I wanted to visit Emily before she had to leave for work. I wanted to request to put together another detailed dossier for me. Not on Blue Princess, as I was afraid that it might trigger some kind of red flag, but a similar trick to what I had pulled on the supers of the city, only on a greater scale. </p><p>Everything on public about all the heroes and villains she could find, starting from the most important ones. With her power and her new computer, she should be able to gather me another useful source. </p><p>However, I didn’t ask her on the phone. Instead, I made a reservation in a cute little breakfast place, and wanted to meet with her before work. </p><p>“I better not show up empty-handed,” I said as I stopped by two shops. First, a flower shop, buying a small but beautiful bouquet that was surprisingly expensive, and a small cutting-edge modem device that cost five figures. The seller warned me that such a modem was excessive for home use, but I wanted to see how it meshed with her power. </p><p>Depending on the results, it might be worth the expense. </p><p>I managed to catch Emily as she was leaving her apartment. “Good morning,” I said with a big smile, a gift bag and flowers filling my arms. </p><p>“G-good morning,” she stammered, once again shy now that we were face to face. “I … I thought we were supposed to be meeting at the cafe,” she said. </p><p>“We were, but then I realized it would end up you hauling all those stuff to work unnecessarily,” I said, giving her a seductive smile. </p><p>“You didn’t need to,” she said, but after a long sleep, my headache was finally gone, meaning I could read her reaction easily. And, there was not one sign showing that she was actually unhappy with the gifts, the glamour of the expensive flowers doing wonders to elevate her mood even further. </p><p>“Nonsense, your help saved my ass. This is the least I can do,” I answered with a bright smile. The flowers already put a big smile on her face, though once she opened the other gift, her smile got even wider. A modem was hardly a classical gift, but for her, it was more than a nerdy gift. </p><p>And, she showed her appreciation with a long kiss, along with a thoughtful glance at her bedroom door. I had to say, it was tempting, but I didn’t want her to skip work. The last thing I needed was her guild to start looking into her affairs. </p><p>“Let’s go and enjoy our breakfast,” I whispered as I hooked my arm around hers, leaving her gifts behind. She looked disappointed. “I’m sure you can spice things up a bit as well.” </p><p>“W-what kind of spice,” she stammered, but her gaze brightened, showing that she understood exactly what I was talking about. Teasing an exhibitionist, particularly a shy one like her, was fun. The cafe I picked was not far away from her house, so we walked. Of course, it was a deliberate choice, considering it was hard for me to get a vehicle in my disguise.</p><p>And, it helped me to tease her a bit. I raised my phone as we were passing through an empty alley. “Give me a sexy pose,” I ordered her. She blushed, but she was quick to comply after a careful glance, confirming that we were alone. </p><p>It was a beautiful picture that highlighted her beauty despite her boring work outfit. But I felt greedy for more. “How about opening a couple buttons for a more interesting pose,” I teased her. She blushed, but that didn’t stop her from complying. </p><p>Resulting in another sexy pose. </p><p>We took several more photos as we walked to our destination. She was sexy enough to brighten my mood. Unfortunately, I had an ulterior motive for talking those pictures. I wanted her to be in a good mode, which would make it easier to manipulate her. </p><p>I didn’t want her to be suspicious about what I was about to ask. </p><p>“Wow, this place looks expensive,” she muttered as we entered. </p><p>“Nonsense. Nothing is too much for the beautiful heroine that saved my ass against the villains,” I whispered, once again leaning hard into the story I told her about accidentally finding myself against the villains. Though, it was eighty percent true, so it was at most a white lie. </p><p>“So, the last night’s report had been useful,” she said.</p><p>“Certainly, you saved my ass again,” I said. ”It can’t compare to your other gifts,” I added, caressing her leg with mine even as we checked our menus. She chucked as she checked the options, though her eyes widened in shock. “W-what’s wrong with the prices?” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. I’m still benefiting from that incredible dossier on the city,” I said. </p><p>“Really? Was it that helpful,” she said. </p><p>“Are you kidding? It helps a lot,” I said. I noticed her frown at that, and realized my mistake. “I just hope they don’t check the actual information I provide them too deeply,” I added. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, remember, the information you provided is publicly available, and there’s nothing sensitive. I’m just using those details to make the nonsense I feed them believable,” I added. Her face relaxed, and I acted like I hadn’t noticed it. “It’s good to trick criminals.” </p><p>“Try to be careful. It won’t be good if they notice you are playing them,” she said, her worry immediately transforming. </p><p>“I’ll do so. I just hope that they don’t ask me any questions about the other cities. I know nothing,” I baited, looking forlorn. </p><p>“Why don’t I prepare another dossier for you, this time at a national level,” she offered. </p><p>My eyes widened. “You would do that?” I said as I grabbed her hand in appreciation, kissing her palm to make her blush. “For every hero and villain.” </p><p>“Sure, but it will take a while, and I can’t just send it to you. It’ll be too big.” </p><p>“I’ll buy you as many storage devices as you need,” I promised as I kissed her palm again, enjoying her shivers. “But, why don’t you send me the dossier about the top heroes and villains first, just in case they ask me about it…</p><p>A reasonable list to ask. And, if the Lady of Destruction was a part of that list, it must be a complete coincidence, right?</p><p>At least, I hoped so. That was the safest I could be under the circumstances.</p><p>However, as we ordered breakfast, my attention was already on the next step. </p><p>Discovering the secrets of the warehouse… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Taking over the System had been … different than I expected. There had been no grand mental battles with the unfortunate previous owner, no last-minute battles I had to hurry up to join just in time, not even any direct intervention. </p><p>To be fair, looking back, I could see that every single one of them had been a distinct possibility. If things had gone even slightly wrong, during the last stretch, I would have been dealing with a true horror show. It was chilling to realize how badly things have gotten if I tried to fight against the threats directly instead took action while my enemies dealt with each other. </p><p>Admittedly, even under perfect conditions, if I didn’t have the assistance of a set of very helpful goddesses who were willing to work hard defending the material plane against a variety of enemies — the gods from other planes, the recently freed elementals, persistent undead, and even occasional local rebellions — I couldn’t have given the esoteric problems of the System the attention they deserved. </p><p>And, there were many such problems, enough that I actually had trouble believing it worked in the first place. The system was huge. My own System looked like a little sparrow standing next to an ancient dragon when combined, both in terms of scale and in terms of power. </p><p>Or maybe, an ancient tree with messy branches and even messier roots was a better example. It was certainly a better explanation of how the System worked, automatically connecting with the people who were born in its territory, operating under some very limited rules. </p><p>Rules that seemed to be untouched for ages, buried in the depths of the System … covered by some of the most critical aspects of the System, making them unreachable without destroying the System. I was able to bypass those fundamental parts only because my power and the System’s power came from the same roots, allowing me to manipulate the System with an ease the Eternals could never replicate. </p><p>And, through that, I managed to access the core rules of the System … which answered the problem. The rules were not written by one group, but by three different entities. I guessed that the initial set of rules, governing the skills, levels, and achievements were written by the first  Eternals. They were smooth and straightforward … but they also had an incredible number of smart safeguards, additional authorizations for reconfiguration, and tons of other options. </p><p>Those additional rules were cut off by the second set of rules. I suspected that it was the spirit of the System — which I still kept trapped, waiting to take over the System properly first to avoid a nasty surprise — that was responsible for them. There weren’t many such rules, giving the feeling that they were created in a hurry. </p><p>They were focusing on ruining the Eternals’ control over the System. </p><p>Then, there was the third set of rules … a confusing set of mishmash that had been added over the surface of the System to give the Eternals a new set of control. Unfortunately, with the core of the System tightly wrapped, the only thing that the tertiary layer could manipulate was the storage, which included  HP, and mana. </p><p>And, most importantly, Divine Spark. All types of it. </p><p>As I examined the collection speed of the System, I understood why the Eternals never stopped the endless battle that defined the fate of the material plane. It generated a truly shocking amount of Divine Spark every moment. </p><p>More than even my wildest estimations. </p><p>Of course, that raised another question. Where the hell was all that Divine Spark? It wasn’t something consumable, which made their location a mystery. I had initially thought that all of it went to the Eternal City, but if that had been the case, they would have put up a far better fight. </p><p>That created an interesting question. Where the hell all those Divine Sparks that had been collected over centuries had disappeared. A fascinating mystery. </p><p>The third set of rules over the System was the only clue I had. The more I examined them, the more I was convinced that they were not written by the Eternals as well, for two reasons. First, whoever created those magical rules was far more capable than the Eternals when it came to magic. At least, none of their wards had shown similar expertise, not even the extremely vital ones that were keeping the four Primordial Elementals imprisoned. </p><p>That implied that they were written by a third party … and not one that was directly linked to the Eternals. Whether that particular help came with a price tag too high for them to ask for the same service for their city, or they didn’t trust that party for their defenses was not a question I could answer. </p><p>The second reason I didn’t believe those rules were not written by Eternals was the nature of the rules. They had too many little hidden aspects whose only function was to record every storage movement, and send those reports to a beacon that had the correct magical signature. Meaning, that whoever built those rules was interested in keeping track of exactly how much Divine Spark the Eternals were collecting. </p><p>For what purpose, I had absolutely no idea… </p><p>Like the landscape wasn’t confusing enough. </p><p>As much as I hated the idea of destroying evidence that might help me track the destination, I had to destroy those tertiary rules. The risk of missing a part was too high. </p><p>***</p><p>It took months for me to make sure I had cleaned the old rules completely. I went as far as rewriting the fundamental rules from scratch without changing anything, and once those were written, I destroyed the old set completely, making sure there wasn’t a trap hidden in the rules. </p><p>Suffering the same fate with the Eternals was the last thing  I wanted. </p><p>There had been only one exception. Early on, I added a rule, preventing the System from devouring Divine Spark from active Divine Domains as long as they were authorized, which also applied to Divine Avatars.  </p><p>The combination worked excellently, allowing my sexy goddesses to establish their domains. Helga and Oeyne chose to establish their domains near the center. Oeyne chose the capital, which was rapidly turning into the greatest center for artifacts, forged by a growing number of her followers. Helga took the role of Headmistress, choosing to lead Silver Spires into a true center of magic, dedicated to learning and research rather than pointless noble posturing. </p><p>The others stayed nearer to the borders, using a combination of their domains and their avatars to defend the Material Plane against the attacks, their encampments giving them a decisive advantage. Aviada and Cornelia had found themselves locked in an intense rivalry, competing for victories. </p><p>Meanwhile, we managed to use a modified version of the planar moving tool the Eternals had used to attack Seldanna to bring Mariel’s and Seldanna’s planes to the orbit of the Material plane, rotating around safely. However, we were yet to discover a way to merge them properly. </p><p>Titania refused to establish a domain, still working on Elemental Spark, though it hadn’t been as shocking as Marianne, who not only established a Domain and led every single battle against the undead, she also had half a dozen avatars, moved around by my clones, leading a one-woman crusade against the undead. She had already taken over two weaker plains, which we were dragging back to the material plane. </p><p>We didn’t know exactly how we were going to use those planar fragments, but it was better than leaving them with the Undead. </p><p>It wasn’t perfect, but considering the mess we were dealing with, it was far better than I could ever hoped, which was good enough.  </p><p>For months, I continued to tinker over System roles, slowly allowing people a chance to rise to new heights… I had a feeling that, sooner or later, we would need their help. And, if my suspicions about the Eternals and the mysterious party were correct, I was afraid that it would be sooner. </p><p>Then, a fateful day arrived. </p><p>It was the time to speak with the mysterious spirit of the System…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I walked along to shore, searching for Lion’s Curse, a dangerously toxic magical plant that was as hard to collect as it was to process, trying to suppress the unease in my heart. That unease had nothing to do with the plant itself, as I had gone through that routine enough times for the process to be routine; and everything to do with the reason I had been collecting it. </p><p>The illness of my grandfather, Quintus Scipio, vaunted noble of the great and famous Scipio Family, long reduced to a shell of its historical self, defeated and exiled into the poor and underdeveloped hinterland of Britannia, away from anything valuable. However, the sickness was getting worse the last few weeks, and Lion’s Curse was the best plant that was available in our immediate surroundings. </p><p>Britannia wasn’t exactly rife with miraculous medicinal plants. If it had been, our family wouldn’t be the only patrician family living here.  </p><p>I had forgotten how many times I had questioned whether such an exile was a blessing or curse for me. As locked in a godforsaken island with nothing to do, impeded by his injuries, I often found myself in the tender mercies of my grandfather as he trained me. </p><p>He had never been a soft man. He had always been demanding, irritable, and aggressive, which made his training share too many similarities with the official procedures of torture experts than even the toughest drill sergeants. </p><p>Though, it was hard to argue with the results. I was barely twenty years old, and I was already an apprentice mage; a magic user of the second order. Admittedly, it wasn’t as impressive as it sounded. The first order was exclusively for the children and the incompetent, and the second order was incapable of using the power of elements externally, limited to enhancing bodily functions. </p><p>The true power of magic started with the third order, the vaunted rank of mage. A rank that I was still far away despite my ability to touch all four elements. </p><p>All because of the insistence of my grandfather, who had always been a perfectionist along with being a hard-ass trainer. A frustrating combination. </p><p>The mages capable of all four elements were rare, and not by coincidence. Most magic users were happy focusing on one element, more than happy to trade the nebulous benefits of a more comprehensive mastery over faster progress. </p><p>To progress in all four elements, one needed to possess both talent and money. </p><p>I would have liked to think that I possessed the former — certainly more than my useless uncle and even more useless cousins, not that it was a hard bar to clear — but the latter was far away. Not because of the dire straits of the Scipio family, as while poor, we were not poor enough to be unable to support the development of a proper mage. </p><p>It was my status as a bastard that kept me from the necessary resources. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying not to let it get me too much. Being a bastard was unlucky, but far from the worst thing that could happen to a man living in the Roman Republic. </p><p>Being a pleb could be better, but only depending on the region. A citizen of the city of Rome would be incredible even as a plebeian. The rest of the Italia peninsula would have been good as well. Anywhere else, it was no better than being a noble bastard from Mother’s side. And, there were worse fates. I could have been born as a part of one of the tribes without citizenship, as a landless freedman, or worse … a slave. </p><p>The irony of being a neglected bastard of a noble family. One developed a deep understanding of how worse things could have been. As much as I hated to admit it, I was lucky that my mother was still in the compound when she gave birth to me rather than springing me away like she initially intended. </p><p>Roman Republic might rule a nice chunk of the world, but that didn’t make living any easier.  </p><p>Then, I saw a Lion’s Bane, nested under a rock near the shore, its color allowing it to fade against the rest. I would have missed if it wasn’t for the Fire, boosting my perception … in a manner of speaking. </p><p>The empowerment of the elements was never straightforward. Fire didn’t make my gaze sharper, any more than Air allowed me to run faster. The effects were never as straightforward … unless, of course, they were bound to an artifact by a master, but that was another issue. </p><p>I tightened my grip over my spear, and approached the plant. A weapon was not required to deal with Lion’s Bane, but the same wasn’t true for the beasts that might have resting nearby to enjoy the magical presence of the plant. </p><p>Once I was five feet away, I stopped, and stabbed the sandy ground of the shore several times, making sure there was no nasty surprise. I didn’t want to risk my toes against another magical critter. I was wearing leather boots, but there were too many beasts that wouldn’t even slow down by those.  </p><p>During the sixth stab, my spear hit a rock … then, the rock moved slightly under the pressure of the spearartip. </p><p>Not a rock.</p><p>I threw myself back immediately, not willing to take any risk. A good choice, as a shadow followed me. I barely dodged, letting its presence pass me. A snake. An elemental kind, first-order, but not too far from second-order. </p><p>Troubling, but nowhere near the level it would be if the beast actually reached the second order. </p><p>Trying to deal with second-order wouldn’t have been fun. Their lack of intelligence might be an impediment, but their ability to use elemental mana to reinforce any parts of their body was challenging, and venomous beasts were particularly troubling. </p><p>Element-enhanced venom was not something to be shrugged off. </p><p>Even the most experienced hunter avoided beasts of the same order, and these men were kitted with better gear than a disposable spear that even a common guard would turn their nose to. Unfortunately, that was the best I could get with my uncle pulling the strings in the compound. </p><p>The snake rushed forward again, and I deflected again, trying to get a better sense of its movements, trying to see if it had any surprises. A first-order beast shouldn’t have any external expression, but considering just how close it was to the next order, I wasn’t willing to risk it.  </p><p>Five repeats, then it suddenly moved forward, faster than any other attempt. Air, I thought even as I shuffled in place. At the same time, I reached my Earth mana that had rotating in my chest, dormant. A mental touch was all that was needed for it to spread along my limbs, far faster than a second-order apprentice mage should be capable of, and pinned the beast to the ground. </p><p>It paid off to be trained a madman with no mercy who treated broken bones the way other people treated scraps. </p><p>“Victory,” I said as I pulled my knife, and butchered the snake skillfully — another benefit of my torturous training. A first-order beast wasn’t exactly a treasure, but I managed to keep its venom gland safe. An apothecary might pay three or four silver denarii if I was lucky. </p><p>The skin was too ruined to be useful, but the meat would make a nice ration once dried.   </p><p>Altogether, not a treasure that would make people envious. But a bastard couldn’t turn his nose to even a few copper aes, let alone silver denarii. </p><p>Once that was done, I turned my attention to the real loot of my victory. Lion’s Curse, the poisonous plant my monster of a grandfather required to suppress his disease. I approached carefully, but this time, I didn’t bother stabbing the sand. </p><p>Snakes weren’t famous for tolerating other beasts in their immediate vicinity. It took five minutes for me to uproot the plant, and ten minutes to carefully wrap with an oily scrap. </p><p>Mission complete. </p><p>Too bad the sun was already setting, meaning I had to move at a grueling pace if I were to reach the compound before sunset. </p><p>One of the more troubling aspects of living in the untamed wild province of Britannia, was that traveling during the night was very dangerous, particularly when alone. I didn’t even have a mount to make the process easier. </p><p>I quickened my pace as the cover of the darkness thickened. I had been out since the morning, and the last thing I needed was to deal with the guards, particularly my uncle’s lackeys. At this point,, they knew my grandfather would never punish them — he claimed adversity bred character — and they were happy to bully me to keep my uncle happy. </p><p>I had to camp several times near the compound when they used curfew as an excuse to keep me out. I didn’t want to deal with their mess. </p><p>Yet, it looked like I had miscalculated how much time I had, because evening arrived before I could reach the compound. I sighed, thinking whether to try my luck, or go directly to the cave I had prepared for this exact circumstance. </p><p>However, before I could make that decision, I saw a movement in the distance. Several guards, each wearing the familiar armor of our house, led by Guard Captain Spurius, my detestable uncle’s most enthusiastic bootlicker.  </p><p>“Perfect, what I needed —” I started, only to stop when I caught a distinct glint from his helmet. A helmet that he wasn’t supposed to be wearing, one that belonged to the Commander of the Guards. </p><p>I moved into the shrubbery near the road. </p><p>Something was wrong. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“… now, how about if I try to do it like this,” I murmured as I tried to draw a flame talisman once more, only to fail once again. </p><p>Naturally, I was drawing it on the ground. I didn’t want to waste my limited amount of paper. The bundle I had only had twenty papers, which were precious enough. I wanted to use them to draw Flame Talismans once I came up with a way to draw Flame Talismans. </p><p>It wasn’t the most efficient way to spend my time, but everyone was too tense to casually interact with others, let alone pity them. Considering I didn’t have any easy target for my freeloading, testing the limits of my talisman drawing skill seemed like a good idea. </p><p>Particularly since, having some offensive talismans was a good way to deal with the danger. They were threatening enough to deescalate the situation if I came across another itinerant cultivator, and I could use the higher quality ones to bluff my way into convincing people that I was from a rich family. </p><p>“How about if I draw them like this?” I muttered as I tried once again, and realized it might have worked. “Now, to the real practice.” </p><p>I pulled my talisman drawing set, and two spirit stones to fuel my attempt. Roughly a strand of Qi was required to draw a simple flame talisman, and unlike the System drawing plans, I didn’t have many variations I could use to create. </p><p>If someone else had seen me wasting spirit stones drawing talismans, particularly so close to misty mountains, they would have gone crazy. The profitable method was to find a relatively rich environment and use the Qi in the air to draw it. </p><p>For an ordinary talisman master, it would have been a total waste. After all, an ordinary talisman went only for a spirit stone. By spending two spirit stones, it would cause a huge loss, and that was without the risk of failure, paper and ink cost … and most importantly, the subdued Qi a cultivator had to expand. </p><p>None applied to me. After ten minutes of highly focused drawing, I had my first flame talisman in hand. Unfortunately, it was merely Profound Middle Quality due to a combination of lacking a drawing plan, low-quality paper, and poor environment. </p><p>“My poorest work,” I said with a chuckle, wondering what someone else would have said about my definition of failure. Cheating or not, being an expert was certainly fun. </p><p>Of course, since it was limited by the amount of Qi it could hold, it was barely as strong as a hit from an ordinary First Realm cultivator. Still, I rapidly drew three more. </p><p>Four full-powered hits were intimidating enough, particularly since their quality meant that they would hit harder and faster than their low-quality variants. It could easily deal with an unprepared enemy. </p><p>I could draw more, but I didn’t want to waste my already limited storage of spirit stones. I had enough to visit the misty mountains. As for using Qi strands in my Inventory, I was even more reluctant. They were even harder to replenish. </p><p>My plan wasn’t to actually enter the mountains, but I needed to get a glimpse from a distance to get a sense of what was going on. I needed to have a better idea about the situation in the mountains. Ideally, I also wanted to find a pocket of Qi which I could use to create a flame talisman. </p><p>Also, I wanted to put my newly acquired spirit plant tending knowledge to use. </p><p>Ironically, it didn’t come with the knowledge of spirit plants and how to use them, but a veterinarian didn’t need to know how to distinguish a zebra from a donkey to be able to mend a broken bone or heal a cut. Of course, said veterinarian could end up in a kick in the head in the process, if he didn’t know about the unique habits of a zebra, and couldn’t easily treat a snake based on the same knowledge, so there were some limitations. </p><p>Once again, there were limits to my unique style of learning. </p><p>I had made sure to get a distance away from the cultivation market before I approached the mountains, not wanting to be seen, and even pulled another set of clothes from my inventory. Then, I moved forward, doing my best to avoid notice even with the disguise. </p><p>While I was reasonably confident to defend myself against an ordinary cultivator willing to waste their time on the outskirts of the misty mountains, the crazy swordsman I had stumbled across showed me that the cultivation world could hold some nasty surprises. </p><p>Nasty ones, as the Onit family learned. </p><p>Luckily, one thing that I had seen around the market, was that unlike martial artists, cultivators were reluctant to spend their Qi, which meant I had the mobility advantage, particularly with my unique movement martial art. I continued to run, until I stepped into the misty mountains. </p><p>The first thing I noticed. The mist was not natural. The moment I stepped, I felt a sense of suffocation and disquiet. It was already effective on my Qi, but it was even worse when it came to essence. The moment I stepped into the mist, my essence lost most of its effectiveness. </p><p>It was different than the Cursed Qi at the Spring Palace. There, I could feel the Qi infecting my essence. Here, it was more of an effect, like the chill from an ice sculpture. </p><p>Whatever that was going on in the misty mountains, it was something extraordinary. All the more reason not to enter the limits. I stayed at the edge, making very limited incursions for the next few days. Despite my hopes, I failed to find any spirit plants, not even a dried one. Clearly, I wasn’t the first cultivator to have the genius idea of staying at the safe spots. </p><p>Still, not all was bad. On the second day, I had been hit by a Qi wind. It didn’t last long, barely ten minutes, but I was able to use the meditation technique to capture enough Qi for six more talismans, three Profound Middle-Grade flame talismans, and three Profound Peak protection talismans. </p><p>Having the system drawing charts helped to create something spectacular despite the poor paper quality. Those, I planned to keep for my own use for emergencies, as their high quality contrasted with the poor paper too much. </p><p>However, I didn’t waste my time. Since the mist suppressed people’s senses somewhat, it allowed me to get close enough to occasional cultivator groups and eavesdrop on their discussions. They were careful, but that didn’t prevent them from discussing the results of their trip with their friends, in the form of some action report to see what could be done better the next time. </p><p>It gave me a better idea about what could be found in the outer layers. A flower called endless blossom was the most common plant, but apparently, it was also cheap. A few other different plants like dark thistle and blood flower were common and valuable, but they were also poisonous, making their harvest more of a challenge. </p><p>Different types of ores and minerals were also abundant, but identifying them required some knowledge, which I lacked completely. </p><p>Naturally, the most profitable, yet riskiest activity, was to rob people. A lot of discussions went into how to achieve that, and avoid the same, but ultimately, it wasn’t that common. At least, I didn’t see anyone trying something during my observation. </p><p>Whether they did so deeper into the misty mountains where they would be harder to discover, or whether they stopped temporarily after the swordsman had destroyed a whole family in revenge and scared people was not a mystery I was desperate to solve. </p><p>After listening to the people for two more days, I managed to get the directions for a nice valley near the edge of the mist, some dark thistle from a couple cultivators discussing how to find a trustworthy expert to harvest them. </p><p>Too bad when they return, they would find it empty. I followed their tracks and soon found the valley. It was a nice concealed spot with several spirit plants. Likely because the valley was deep enough to capture the Qi winds for some time, which nourished the plants. </p><p>“Let’s take you,” I said as I moved to the first dark thistle, carefully uprooting it, using meditation art to feed the Qi it generated back to it. While every poisonous plant had its own unique method to uproot — which I lacked — with my skill, a general method was still safe. </p><p>Keeping the Qi of the plant calm kept its defense mechanisms from triggering. </p><p>Ten minutes was enough for me to uproot eight dark thistles and four endless blossoms that were protected by them easily, which was different than what others did. Most just pulled and destroyed the plant before cutting the most valuable parts. </p><p>I had a different plan in mind. </p><p>I left the misty mountains, and made sure to take a long path back while carefully carrying twelve small uprooted plants. However, once I returned to the concealed valley, I turned to my temporary camp, I had settled the plants again into a cave that received little sunlight.</p><p>It reduced the effectiveness of the plants, but the fact that I could block the Qi flow outside by putting two protection talismans at the entrance was more important.</p><p>Just like that, I had a nice small garden that constantly radiated Qi. Not much, but enough to draw a few talismans easily without throwing myself into danger. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked into the cultivator market, I couldn’t help but feel tense. And, from the suspicious glares that everyone threw at each other, I doubted that I was the only one. Still, I walked along the streets, carefully listening to the gossip, trying to learn as much as I could. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was only one topic that people were talking about. </p><p>“… I can’t believe that the Onit family had been destroyed by a lone cultivator.” </p><p>“… that’s impossible. They have a Peak Foundation Establishment Ancestor.” </p><p>“… I have seen that kid. He was merely a cripple at the Second Stage. How can he kill a Foundation Establishment Cultivator? It’s nonsense.” </p><p>“… No, I heard that he was already at the Peak of Qi Gathering, not at the Fifth Realm.” </p><p>Those, and many other discussions gave me an idea of what had followed up the move of that crazy show I had seen. I couldn’t help but shiver. The last time I had seen him, the young man was merely at the Fourth Stage, yet he not only rose five steps, but also managed to deal with a cultivator a whole Major Realm above. </p><p>Even with the System, I needed to work harder to keep myself safe. </p><p>It was another reminder of the unusual dangers of the world I found myself in. Not only there were many organizations that could deploy people that could threaten the whole kingdoms alone, kept back only by other cultivators, but also a random person could be strong enough to take down a strong cultivation family. </p><p>A scary world indeed. </p><p>While I was listening to them, I also learned what the Misty Mountains were. A large area with occasional pockets of Qi, where cultivators without a family tried their luck to replenish their Qi and search for spirit plants. </p><p>However, apparently, the danger was equally impressive, both from nature and from the other cultivators. </p><p>Rather than wasting my time listening to gossip that wouldn’t be useful, I ignored those discussions as I watched people make deals and purchases, trying to get a sense of the market. Who purchased what, what were the going rates, the general pricing. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was the currency. No one used gold. Instead, they used some kind of stone that was filled with Qi, called spirit stones. </p><p>Well, filled was rather exaggerated. The stones were not uniform, neither in terms of size, Qi content, or even Qi type. The strongest I had seen had about half a strand of Qi, and most had only a fraction of it. Yet, they were being valued higher than I expected. </p><p>Clearly, their portable nature was the biggest part of their value. Even if there was no Qi in the environment, a cultivator could absorb it to cultivate, or refill their reserves for an extended battle. </p><p>Unfortunately, their value to me wasn’t that high since I couldn’t actually absorb them. I somehow use them through the Meditation Technique like I had done back in the Spring Palace, but that would require several seconds. </p><p>Useful for creating talismans and other crafting activities, but not as useful for battle. </p><p>I wondered how the System would treat them. Would they just turn into subdued Qi, or just give me more of the same low-quality stuff. Albeit, that was a question for the future. The market was too dangerous to try and manipulate people to trigger the System. </p><p>As I walked around, I noticed that, anything that was on sale in the stores and the stalls were low quality. Not only it was rare to see anything new and undamaged, but most of the goods were limited to Profound Low Quality — the lowest quality at which the Qi of the item could be contained — with only occasional Profound Middle Quality mixed in. </p><p>Clearly, my talismans were rare enough. </p><p>I paid attention to the stalls and noticed that a lot of people were being swindled badly. Assessing the quality of the cultivation items wasn’t a simple affair, and whenever people exchanged for talismans, I noticed they were receiving inferior products with some faults. </p><p>It was like trying to buy second-hand electronics, but only worse. Clearly, most of the cultivators here had a spotty cultivation base, which limited their potential. Their knowledge about production was even worse. </p><p>After walking back and forth twice, I went to a stall I identified earlier, which sold and bought various talismans. The owner was efficient, but greedy. “I want to exchange a protective talisman for a flame strike,” I said. </p><p>“Two for one for the exchange, and no bargaining,” he said immediately. “An offensive talisman is more valuable. Especially this close to misty mountains.” </p><p>He didn’t talk too much, which was one of the reasons I chose him to initiate the trade. I didn’t want to talk too much. I much preferred someone to swindle me quickly, but didn’t poke at my identity. </p><p>I quickly passed him two of my lowest quality low-grade protective talismans, and exchanged them with a poorly made flame strike talisman that looked like it might actually crumble in my hands if I tried to use it. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t intend to use it. I was confident that, with my talisman drawing ability, I could reverse engineer it. It wouldn’t be as good as the System-given talisman plans, but still, it was good to have some offensive options. </p><p>Of course, none of those faults were easy to spot. Only thanks to my talisman drawing ability, I was able to see the truth of the matter. He might be an efficient trader, but he was certainly not an honest one. Well, it worked to my benefit. </p><p>Then, I looked around, then slid another talisman under the other two. “I have a middle-grade talisman as well. How much for it?” I asked. </p><p>His eyes widened slightly. The reason, the talisman I had passed to him was a high-grade one, rather than a medium-grade one, but assessing the quality wasn’t as straightforward for an amateur. </p><p>“You look like a nice young man, so four spirit stones,” he said as he pushed them forward, and took the talisman before I could get. They were better than average, each filled nearly half. Of course, considering the difference between the grades, he was paying me horribly. </p><p>Still, I didn’t care. I hardly cared about losing some potential profit when I could replicate them easily. Making the trade without marking myself as a whale was far more efficient. </p><p>“R-really?”I asked. “W-what if I have three more?” I asked, looking shocked. “Would you pay the same price?” I said, and slid three more. Two middle grade, and another high grade, giving the impression that I either stole them, or found them. </p><p>Either way, it was an incentive for him to keep his mouth shut about surprisingly high-quality stuff he had received from me. After all, I clearly gave him everything I had, blinded by the incredible amount of money I received back. Why would he bother try to rob me, when he made such a good profit from me. </p><p>“Yes,” he said and made the exchange. </p><p>“Wow. Talismans are more valuable than I thought,” I muttered. “Maybe I should learn how to draw them?” </p><p>“Why not? If you have the talent, it’s a lucrative career. You might even be invited as a guest elder,” he said. “Of course, you need to find a teacher or a heritage.” </p><p>“Really,” I said as I examined the flame talisman I received from him, acting like an ignorant person insisting that the Earth was ruled by the Illuminati. “It doesn’t look too complicated. I bet that, if I had some paper, I could replicate it.” </p><p>“Well, I can sell you some if you want to test yourself,” he offered immediately, not missing even a beat. He pulled three items. An old brush, a half-filled pot with its ink starting to clump, and a bundle of low-quality talisman paper. “Four spirit stones for all. Two for the brush, two for the ink and the paper,” he said. </p><p>I looked at him, then frowned. “I don’t need the brush, I have some with me already,” I said as I reached the satchel and showed an ordinary calligraphy brush, acting like I didn’t even know talisman making required a special brush to properly channel Qi. “Just give me more talisman paper. Four times should be enough.” </p><p>A few cultivators passing near snickered softly but said nothing. Clearly, being cheated was common enough. </p><p>Interestingly, even the stall owner didn’t bother correcting me, more than happy to abuse my lack of knowledge. “I only have this much,” he said sadly. “But, I’ll make sure to stock some for you the next time you return from misty mountains,” he said. “Make sure to bring anything you get to me. Spirit plants, beasts, even … unfortunate remains. I’ll give you a nice price.” </p><p>“It’s good to find an honest merchant,” I said, somehow managing to say that in an honest tone. </p><p>As for visiting misty mountains, I had no intention of doing so yet. </p><p>Still, I left the marketplace in the direction of the misty mountains. After all, a mysterious place where people could discover many treasures was a good excuse to sell anything I could develop. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I left the mansion from the side gate, I moved quickly to avoid the potential spies … but then, I slowed down, observing the mansion. Half an hour later, a Bone Forging martial artist sneaked out. Even for a second, I didn’t think that he was sent by the old woman. </p><p>She would have used a Connate Realm artist. Also, if she was the one to send him, he wouldn’t have bothered to sneak. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, he went to a random cottage, and before I could close in the distance, a bird flew. Some kind of pigeon, though larger than ordinary. No doubt a savage beast, and it flew far faster than I could take down. </p><p>With a shrug, I let it go. Ultimately, there was no hope for me to catch and suppress the spies in the mansion without getting undue attention from the old woman. And, her continued pity was more important. </p><p>Hopefully, I would be able to visit again for another lesson on spirit plant care. I had excellent excuses like pampering Aisnam, but that only worked as long as she believed me to be a smart yet headstrong martial artist, easily controlled by her niece. I doubted that she would be equally willing to provide the same support if she knew I was sharp enough to catch spies she had missed. </p><p>It was a risk I had to take. </p><p>I tightened my grip on the box, hoping that there was not a mysterious way to track it. I still swung by the hiding spot, picked the talisman brush and the protection talismans I had created, and pulled the map, examining it to chart myself a route. </p><p>The first thing that really caught my attention was the size of the map covered. The map wasn’t even showing the full continent, but I could easily count more than sixty mortal kingdoms, each big enough to be a major country back on Earth, the wilderness gap between them even larger than the countries. </p><p>Just how big was this world?</p><p>To make it even more shocking, while several mortal kingdoms, particularly the nearby ones, had some notes about which cultivation families had their members stationed, the map didn’t show their bases. Also, there was no mention of Kartpa Valley and Entsa Pavilion. Whether they were all outside the area of the map, or no one dared to put them on the map, I didn’t know. </p><p>I didn’t care particularly either, at least not in the short term. Even more interestingly, the cultivation market was at the edge of the map, near a mountain range named Misty Mountains. </p><p>Luckily, while the map revealed a huge area, the cultivation market she had directed to me was close. I just needed to pass through three mortal kingdoms, or take a slightly longer route through the wilderness to avoid it. </p><p>I chose the second option, but with a twist. First, I chose the fastest load that cut through the kingdoms, making sure I was visible enough for several people to notice me. Even if they weren’t spies, people would inevitably question them about my direction. I also made sure that they noticed my sharp turn into the wilderness as I was spooked by something…</p><p>Then, once I was in the wilderness, I found a river to erase my scent, swam upward quite a bit, and doubled back at full speed. That trick wasted a day, and the alternative path extended the journey two more days, but I found it to be an acceptable exchange. </p><p>I might have got stronger, but safety was still paramount. </p><p>What followed was another long, boring travel. Halfway through that journey, I found a deep cave and activated all the rewards I received from the old woman. </p><p>It was a good thing that I did, because the light show from reaching Major Immersion was even more intense. I glowed for almost ten minutes before it faded. However, the knowledge I received was far more effective. </p><p>Creating more Connate Realm artists was a child’s play. Too bad that their usefulness seemed to be limited. </p><p>Then, I continued to run. </p><p>For someone supposed to be a Freeloader, I was running around too much, which was certainly annoying. Luckily, despite everything, I always loved running, and the new running art I devised was even more fun. </p><p>“Let’s call you Rabbit Dash,” I said after I ran alone for another full day, and paused to camp. Once again, I didn’t light any fire, using Volcano Essence to cook instead. </p><p>It reminded me of Elsana and Lannayin. I couldn’t help but wish that they were alright. However, I limited myself to wishing. After all, after concluding their disappearance was related to cultivators, I didn’t dare to follow up. </p><p>I wasn’t strong enough for that. </p><p>Then, once I was merely three days away from the cultivator market, I saw something that had confirmed I shouldn’t get arrogant. “How dare you disrespect me, you pathetic dog!” someone shouted, followed by a slash of a sword. They were far away, easily ten miles away, maybe even farther, but his Qi-enhanced voice was still strong. </p><p>“My ancestor will make you pay! I belong to the Onit family. You don’t dare to kill me!” the defender shouted. But, the bodies of two others at a distance, wearing a similar outfit as the defender, showed that his declaration wasn’t as effective as he might think. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had seen a cultivator show. Previously, the show of the Elder of the Kantpa Valley as he attacked the defensive formation had been intimidating enough. After all, he had displayed power strong enough to destroy the city literally. </p><p>What was going on in front of me was intimidating for a whole different reason. Since both of them had been pushing themselves to the limit, I could see that both of them were at the Qi Gathering stage, but one of them was in the Ninth Stage, while the other was merely at the Fourth. </p><p>Yet, contrary to everything else I had heard, it was the young man at the Fourth Stage that was easily dealing with the one at the Ninth Stage, and doing so with a lazy confidence, letting the defender recover after every hit. </p><p>And, here I was, feeling confident of my untested ability to deal with someone a minor Stage above me. </p><p>I didn’t continue to watch. The young man clearly had a sensitive pride, and I didn’t want to take the risk of insulting him. I moved fast enough, making sure to put a large distance. When I doubled the distance, he finally stopped playing with his opponent and killed him. Then, he started walking away with a deceptive speed. He looked slow, yet with each step, he covered a hundred meters. </p><p>Freaky, even in this new world. </p><p>It was a good reminder not to get too arrogant. </p><p>The only reason I still dared to go the cultivation market — after camping for an extra day — was that the freaky young swordsman had been moving in the opposite direction. And, he looked far too arrogant to bother tricking any observer. </p><p>Still, as I walked toward the cultivation market, I couldn’t help but feel surprised at the thinness of the Qi around. I expected to find a denser Qi environment. Or, at least, a formation similar to the one I had seen at Markas. </p><p>Yet, when I finally climbed over a hill and saw the market, I couldn’t help but feel disappointed. I expected some kind of amazing city, yet, what I found was something slightly better than a village, and only because there were a few fancy buildings among the other, fancier, buildings. </p><p>Qi density was similarly disappointing. It was not even intense enough to match the garden of the old woman, let alone the Spring Palace. Though, maybe I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, if the place was too valuable, they wouldn’t have used it as a marketplace. </p><p>The market wasn’t crowded. Several groups of people wearing robes and masks, throwing suspicious glances at each other, and some shop owners that was watching the streets like hawks. Not exactly the crowd I imagined at the mention of the cultivator market. </p><p>Not that I had the luxury to turn my nose at it. </p><p>I quickly fashioned a similar mask for my face and made some changes to my cultivation. I still kept my essence over my Cultivation, hiding its true scale. Enough to show others that I was a cultivator. A poor one, but also a potentially dangerous one. </p><p>In other words, a bad target for robbery. </p><p>Of course, there was no fight at the market. The old woman mentioned that it was more about an unwritten rule. If someone tried to rob someone at the market, all the other cultivators were supposed to punish the attacker. </p><p>Some kind of collective punishment to allow the market to operate. </p><p>However, as I got closer, I noticed that the largest building, which was simply named the Pavilion, had some kind of subtle shimmer around it. Maybe it wasn’t just the agreement that was keeping things balanced. </p><p>I approached, keeping the token hidden for the moment. The token clearly had the sigil of the Verdant Family, and I didn’t want to take the risk of revealing myself early or even immediately completing the transaction. </p><p>It was the chance to finally collect some information. I didn’t want to waste it. </p>",

While we waited for her to receive an answer from her contact, she reached me about medicine and massage techniques. </p><p>Luckily, she was happy to watch as I applied those techniques to myself. Massaging an old woman pushing to a hundred and fifty — and that had been a shocking revelation — wouldn’t have been fun. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - Essence Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Immersion, Major Immersion]</p><p>[110x Return - Ordinary Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Immersion, Major Immersion]</p><p>[110x Return - Medicine Lesson, Minor Immersion]</p><p>Adding another lesson I didn’t dare to touch, afraid of the commotion. “Should I leave?” I said as I noticed the servant came carrying a letter. </p><p>“No, it’s about you as well, stay,” she said. She read the note a couple times, then looked at me. “You told me that you can move far faster than a caravan in the wilderness,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, great cultivator,” I said, deliberately avoiding to refer her as master, afraid that it would block the System. I wasn’t sure that was the case, but I rather practice with a less valuable source of information. </p><p>“Good,” she said, and paused for a moment. “And, you are willing to risk your life for my little niece?” </p><p>“Without a doubt,” I said, exaggerating my passion as I answered. But, her smile was enough to confirm that. </p><p>“Good, good,” she repeated. “I received the news from the Pavilion. They have the pill required, but someone needs to go and pick it up. But, you need to be careful. The cultivator marketplace is a dangerous place even for the mid-stage Qi Gathering cultivators, let alone a martial artist. If you ever reveal that you are carrying a pill with you, they will kill you instantly. Are you still willing?” </p><p>I nodded with a sharp determination, which, admittedly, was more than I felt, but accessing the cultivation market was not debatable. </p><p>I didn’t ask her why she didn’t go herself, as it was clear that she had long passed the time she could fight. A momentary explosion of power was all she could manage. </p><p>I needed to take the risk alone. </p><p>Of course, considering the threat of the place was more about forcing an early breakthrough than actually risking my life, it wasn’t exactly very important. With my unique abilities and my talismans, I was confident to resist a Third of Fourth Stage cultivator for a while … enough to force a breakthrough of my own. </p><p>“I can send a few Connate Realm artists to help,” she offered. </p><p>“No, they will only slow me down,” I disagreed. During these three days, I showed off some of my martial skills, enough to convince her that I could fight across martial realms if necessary. She had no trouble believing it because she ‘discovered’ my fate as an injured cultivator. And, from her perspective, an injured cultivator was still leagues better than any martial artist. </p><p>It had been an interesting experience. The more I showed my martial talent, the more she pitied me. Perspective was truly important. </p><p>Too bad that it didn’t come freely. Since she had known about my supposed past as a cultivator, she was far more careful about cultivation secrets. She shared martial arts secrets freely, but she didn’t let even the slightest cultivation secret slip out of her mouth. </p><p>It was a pity. I would have loved to have another cultivation combat technique. Currently, I only had a palm technique, which I had no idea how it rated against the others. </p><p>“Good. It’s the courage of the young that will set the future,” she said in approval. </p><p>She pulled out a small box, which had been sealed with Qi. “Give that to pavilion master, and he’ll give you the pill that silly girl needs,” she said. As she passed the box, I could see her reluctance. Clearly, it was precious. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not a gift they had for me, which meant no return. </p><p>“Of course, you need to stop polishing your realm and breakthrough if you want to return on time,” she said. I looked at her questioningly. After all, I wasn’t supposed to know the time limit I mentioned in the fake letter. “Just to be on the safe side. I suspect someone might target her,” she suggested. </p><p>“Then, I’ll make sure to break through while running. If I do that, I’ll get even faster,” I said, giving her an excuse. </p><p>Then, she passed me a map that showed the location of the cultivator market, and a token to give me access, which was apparently required to even enter the Pavilion. They didn’t trigger any return either. I checked the map, and saw that there were three kingdoms between me and the market. Even with my speed, it would take at least two weeks under ideal conditions. </p><p>Meaning, that she expected me to spend four months back and forth based on what I had shown her. No wonder she asked me to increase my martial realm. </p><p>“I’ll ask the guards to allow you to leave at midnight. Leave then, and avoid the notice of the observers,” she ordered. </p><p>I nodded, and made a show of turning, but pausing just a bit, like I wanted to ask for something, but changed my mind at the last minute. I took a few steps before she called from behind. “What do you want?” she asked. Her tone made it clear that she expected something like that. </p><p>I faced her again. “I … I wouldn’t dare,” I said, looking shy. “You have already helped me so much.” </p><p>“Spill boy. I’m already about to die. I don’t have time to waste with such nonsense,” she said, slightly dissatisfied. </p><p>“I … May I ask you to teach me how to care for spirit plants,” I asked shyly. “Aisnam loves flowers, and if I can…” I said, pushing a deep blush on my face, doing my best to look like I was asking her help to look like I was just trying to find a way to court Aisnam rather than asking for a highly strategic logistic tool that would probably prove critical for me. </p><p>Especially since, my experience with Apothecary showed that, while the System was very strict when it came to using the rewards directly on others, as long as there was a process, it didn’t matter. I couldn’t just give my Qi Strands to Aisnam, but as long as I used the same Qi to tend to the spirit plants, it would be different. </p><p>Luckily, with the whole story of my presence, it had been enough. “Come here. I’ll teach you the basics, so at least you’ll know how to keep them alive,” she said. “The first thing you need to find is some remains of spirit beasts, something that could be turned to make compost. The spirit plants require a lot of Qi, especially during their early growth phase, and it needs to be gentle. Of course, the plants that could be raised like that are almost useless other than decoration. Anything worthwhile requires the support of a Qi vein.” She cackled. “I doubt you’ll be able to find one.” </p><p>With that, she launched a detailed lesson on how to grow and maintain spirit plants in an environment with limited Qi to support, how to tend them, and how to grow them. </p><p>I asked several questions, doing my best to look like I understood more than I actually did. “You have a talent for it,” she said, not bothering to hide her pity. After all, with my cultivation broken, having more talent meant wasting more talent. </p><p>However, once I managed to convince her I had some kind of instinctual comprehension of plant raising, her explanations got more detailed, turning completely incomprehensible. I had a feeling that, if I actually tried to understand her words, I would have developed a horrible headache, like the first time I tried to understand the meditation technique from the scrap. </p><p>Luckily, since she had no reason to believe I was faking it, whenever I responded with nonsensical poetry that seemed to be fitting, she chuckled, and her explanation turned even more incomprehensible. </p><p>Several times, she actually used her Qi to actively show what she had been trying to explain, each attempt exhausting her further. I must have really impressed her. That was why, toward the end, I started keeping my mouth shut, not wanting to ruin her good intent. </p><p>It was the cardinal rule of being a freeloader. Always knew where to stop. </p><p>“That’s enough for me, young man. I’m an old lady, and I need my sleep,” she said, finally ending the lesson as the sun was setting. </p><p> [Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - Gardening, Major Accomplishment, Minor Immersion]</p><p>[110x Return - Spirit Plant Care Lesson, Beginner, Perfection]</p><p>I smiled as I saw the result. Just a condensed class and I already reached Perfection. It once again showed that, the knowledge level of the teacher, and the detail level of the lesson played an important role in the final reward. Spirit plant care was no less complicated than the meditation lesson, yet I had reached Perfection in one class. </p><p>An incredible result. </p><p>“Thank you for your help, great cultivator,” I said. “Should I return here once I made the purchase?” </p><p>Her answer was quick, her expression tight. “No, and never reveal it to anyone. A pill to nourish damaged gates is valuable enough to start a mortal war. It’s better not to take any risk. Just use the token to access the market, make the exchange, and leave.” </p><p>I nodded in false acceptance. Naturally, I had many plans for the cultivator market. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Sit down, boy,” she said as she waved a small bell. “Bring me my tea set, and some tea from the blue pot,” she ordered. And, the servant disappeared just as quick. </p><p>I nodded, hiding my distaste even as I sat across her in a traditional style. I wasn’t as unfamiliar with the tea as when I first arrived, but that didn’t mean I suddenly started to enjoy it. It was still a bitter swill for my tastes, especially the cultural preference that valued sharp and complicated tastes over a smooth drinking experience. </p><p>I much rather deal with her pressure attack than drink tea. </p><p>Still, I sat down as I tried to decide how to play it forward. Her attitude implied that she was close to Aisnam, more than what I had felt from reading Aisnam’s letter. But maybe Aisnam deliberately framed her request for help as a favor to not risk the old woman. </p><p>Technically, they were the same family, but it was obvious that, when it came to conflict between branches, that didn’t mean much. </p><p>Not that I actually understood how family functioned here. I didn’t even know how big was the Verdant family. It was supposed to be a small one, but I had no idea what small meant in terms of cultivation families. It might be a dozen members, or a few thousand. </p><p>“Now, tell me, boy. How’s the little Aisnam,” she said, her tone surprisingly fond, suggesting that the two were close. </p><p>I might have questioned why she didn’t help Aisnam, but the earlier pressure already answered it. She was barely enough to maintain the pressure of her Qi for a few seconds. If it came to fighting, she would probably be able to deliver a blow or two at most. And, she was working as a healer for a mortal kingdom, meaning her political position in the family wasn’t particularly better. </p><p>“She is still determined to recover,” I said, deliberately conflicting with the letter — both the original and the fake one. The letter implied that she had accepted her circumstances and as a last gesture, she was trying to keep me safe. However, only by acting like I was successfully tricked by Aisnam’s bluff, I could explain my presence here. </p><p>“It’s good that she is still working hard,” the old woman sighed. “Her fate is such a pity. Before the injury, she had the potential to reach the Foundation Establishment.” </p><p>“Heavens are merciless,” I said, once again playing the stoic scholar, but I let it echo that it was something that was relevant to me. I decided to take a risk, and as I said so, I stirred my Dantian slightly without covering it with essence. </p><p>Using my skills to look like I had an injured cultivation base as well. I wanted to associate myself with Aisnam at this moment, hoping that it would translate her pity to me. </p><p>It was risky, as I was betting quite a bit on the whims of an old lady who was practically living in exile — very comfortable exile — but I needed an excuse to ask for her help and a reason to pity me. She didn’t think she would care about the tragedy of a martial artist. </p><p>A young and promising cultivator, on the other hand… </p><p>We didn’t say anything until the servant arrived and served us tea. </p><p>As I took a sip, a notification appeared. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - Yellow Peak Grade, Flickering Thousand Years Tea]</p><p>I was happy to see that. Not because I needed a better tea, particularly since, it was still food without essence, and the incredible quality of it didn’t matter that much. The essence it contained might be incredibly high quality, but it would still be miniscule. </p><p>The notification itself was the true gift. It showed that, my imaginary sob story, closed with my closeness with Aisnam, successfully managed to earn her pity. </p><p>Meaning, she was an excellent target for freeloading. And, while asking questions about cultivation might have been problematic, the same didn’t apply to more ordinary skills. I could ask her for help to improve my general medicine and acupuncture skills. They were high enough, but there was no harm in improving them further. </p><p>Particularly since I could ask questions without hiding my expertise — well, much — without ruining the pity she felt toward me. </p><p>“It looks like there’s a story there, young man,” she said while I took another sip. “Why don’t you entertain an old woman.” </p><p>“There’s not much to tell. I started practicing martial arts late,” I said, deliberately not mentioning the reasons. But, I made sure to push a little pain, implying that I started practicing martial arts once my cultivation had been ruined. “However, once I started, I realized that martial arts had too many limits, and as long as I followed the usual path, there would be no hope,” I said. </p><p>She didn’t say anything, but I could see she was dismissive. Whether she thought it to be impossible, or I was trying to reinvent the wheel, I had no idea. </p><p>“That’s why I decided to learn as many techniques as possible, trying to purify the essence as much as possible. Maybe, if I pushed it hard enough, it might have been possible to elevate the arts further.” </p><p>“Really, that’s all you do?” she said. </p><p>“No, I’m also trying to learn medicine, but I have hit a limit there,” I said. </p><p>“Show me,” she said. </p><p>“I don’t have my acupuncture needles with me,” I said. “A travel accident cost me most of my personal belongings,” I added. “Traveling fast between kingdoms is difficult.” </p><p>“Did you travel alone?” she asked, and I nodded. “How?” she asked. </p><p>“During my research, I was lucky to discover a martial art that allows me to move faster. The travel took less than two weeks,” I said, significantly underselling the full capability of my speed art. Still, it was significantly better than anything else. </p><p>It was another trick. I was hoping that she sent me to purchase the pill she mentioned … and hopefully, I could use it as an opportunity to sell some talismans, and actually buy some cultivation equipment. </p><p>She called her servant again, who, after the order, brought me a set of needles. At a glance, I recognized them as high quality, probably Profound Low Grade. I had something better in my Inventory, but still, they were nothing to scoff at. “A little meeting gift, then,” she said as I took them. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - Yellow High Grade, Purified Silver Acupuncture Needles]</p><p>I nodded in appreciation as I pulled them, but before she could gesture to her servant, I stabbed several needles along my arm even as I channeled my essence aggressively. It looked like I was trying to make a breakthrough, but my essence cycled between different types, while I had used the needless to block it. It looked like I was repeatedly grinding against the channels between the essence at my chest and my skin, but blocking the breakthrough. </p><p>It was not just for show, as it was actually helpful. Not enough to make it worthwhile with my talent, but assuming it wasn’t enhanced by a very expensive pill from a cultivator, it would have been useful. It showed off my medical talent and my acupuncture. Not fully, but enough to show that I was at the peak of Perfection, showing that my comprehension wasn’t weak either. </p><p>As a bonus, it was also very painful, allowing me to show off my determination as well. </p><p>Altogether, it was a perfect tragic sight. I was showing her that, if it wasn’t for the supposed tragedy that ruined my life, I would have made an excellent cultivator. </p><p>It was good, because I didn’t dare to ask her any questions about cultivation techniques in the first place. Unlike Aisnam, she wasn’t a lovesick woman at the peak of her sexuality, and therefore willing to neglect a lot of inconsistencies. </p><p>I wanted to see if I could reach Major Immersion for my medical skills … well, technically, even that was a side benefit. </p><p>My real aim was to find out how to access the marketplace of the cultivators. </p><p>“Be careful about the fifth needle. It blocks the flow too much,” she commented after a while, immediately fixing the biggest mistake I had revealed. “And, the seventh needle, move it slightly higher to balance the acupuncture points better…” </p><p>She added several more comments, and the more she did, the more I realized I wasn’t the only one with medicinal skills at Minor Immersion. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - Essence Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Immersion]</p><p>Success.

    "content": "<p>Tara’s eyes were diluted with desire as she stayed on her knees, obedient and gentle like she wasn’t strong enough to bring down a building. “Open your mouth,” I ordered. </p><p>She did, her beautiful face gaining blush in the process. </p><p>“Now, put those beautiful lips to better use.” </p><p>After a loving gaze, she leaned forward, capturing my shaft between her beautiful lips. I couldn’t help but grin despite the headache. She was truly beautiful. </p><p>“Look at me,” I said, and she did so, her beautiful brown eyes filled with warmth, her earlier depression gone like I had spent weeks coaxing and pampering her rather than ordering her to serve me. </p><p>The day she walked inside my bar was the luckiest day of my life. She looked at me with such warmth that, if it wasn’t for the clear displays showing that she enjoyed her unique situation even more than I did, I might have even felt guilty. </p><p>Instead, I leaned against the cold ceramic wall while she did her best to do her task. I grabbed her hair, but I didn’t push her forward, just pulled slightly. She took the signal, and her movements quickened, following without hesitation. </p><p>Tara took me down her throat with ease despite her gags, once again putting her power to good use. Her eyes stayed open as she moved, treating me as an object of worship, each second pushing me deeper into desire. </p><p>“Slow down. You’re supposed to clean it gently,” I teased her even as I grunted approvingly. I simply didn’t want to explode early and ruin her enjoyment. She was quick to follow that order. She pulled back, instead slowly running her tongue along my length. </p><p>I tightened my grip on her hair, and she moaned. Yet, she continued licking my shaft gently, and steadily, her innocent expression making it a truly wondrous look. </p><p>“Now, the head,” I said. She took the head of my cock into her mouth slowly, sucking with a leisurely pace, like it was a delicious dessert. Her moans of pleasure, on the other hand, were incredible. </p><p>It was amazing. I let her play for a long while, and she continued with enthusiasm. “Now, open your mouth wider,” I asked. Her eyes widened, realizing what was about to arrive. Yet, rather than pulling back, she stabilized in preparation. </p><p>And, I started fucking her throat mercilessly. She squirmed in joy as I reshaped her throat, humming happily. That impacted me incredibly considering my location, and I started to cum. </p><p>“Don’t waste a drop,” I warned as she worked hard. I had to admit, she looked far too fascinating as she completed the task, filling me with desire. </p><p>I said nothing as she cleaned it off. Hardly necessary considering the water was still cascading over us in the shower, but I let her do so. “Now, the towel,” I asked her, and she was happy to slowly dry me off. </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said as I hugged her, gently kissing her temple. </p><p>She smiled happily with my ‘reward’, especially when I dragged her toward the bed. The headache was still a problem, but thankfully, the pleasure worked wonderfully to counter it. Unfortunately, it was not a panacea. As I lay on my back, I was still feeling exhausted. </p><p>Luckily, there were some options that didn’t require me to work too hard. “Ride me,” I asked as I lay on my back. She followed my order, shivering with excitement. </p><p>A simple command was all she needed to take a position over my body, her excitement visible. A moment later, she lowered herself down, impaling herself with my presence, which already regained its life. </p><p>It was hard to do with my beautiful bodyguard naked next to me. She started moving slowly at first, but soon she picked up speed, her beautiful tits bouncing. “Excellent work,” I said as she rode me in the cowgirl position, every move of her incredibly beautiful. </p><p>She managed to keep her moans down, but it was clearly a close call. </p><p>I grabbed her hips, but it was less about helping him, and more about enjoying her beautiful thighs. Her hips stilled for a moment, waiting for an order, but a nod later was enough to make her move faster and faster. </p><p>“So, do you have any questions about what happened downstairs?” I suddenly asked. Though, the moment I asked that, I realized it had been a stupid thing to do. I had a super with enhanced strength on top of me, yet I was questioning her about her opinions about receiving a naked lap dance from another woman. </p><p>“I … I don’t,” she answered before I could take that back. I could see that she had a question but didn’t dare to ask. Luckily, she didn’t seem angry, and continued moving. </p><p>I slapped her ass. “You clearly have a question. Don’t lie to me,” I pushed. </p><p>She blushed as she stopped. “I didn’t mean to—” she started. I interrupted with another spank. </p><p>“I didn’t ask you to stop either,” I added, her blush turning apocalyptic, yet she moved once again. “I didn’t mean to lie, sir. I was just… I wondered what were you trying to do with her?” </p><p>“Why didn’t you ask? Do you think I won’t answer,” I said, rising with a sudden gentleness as I kissed her lips, making her tremble before I lay on my back once again. “What do you think I was doing?” </p><p>She blushed. Without my earlier warning, she might have stopped again, but with that clear in mind, she continued to grind against me. “Since you said she’s a super … I thought you might be trying to recruit her.” </p><p>“And, what would you say if I was trying to recruit her?” I asked, once again pushing her. Again, it didn’t seem like a smart question, but since she displayed no sign of dissatisfaction talking about the sexy redhead who gave me a lap dance I decided to push my luck nonetheless. </p><p>She gave me an earnest look while continuing to jump and down on my lap. “I can only hope that she’s strong, so we can protect you together.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her simple answer, showing no jealousy. She was really a true submissive. She was lucky that she was with me rather than someone even more evil … though, admittedly, I was not the nicest man either. </p><p>“I don’t plan to recruit her, at least not yet. I still don’t know who she’s working for?” </p><p>“So, she’s an enemy?” Tara asked. </p><p>“Not at the moment. She’s not working for the Syndicate. That much, I’m reasonably sure, but anything else is hard to guess. But, if she comes here again, be careful around her, and don’t attack her unless she leaves you no choice.” </p><p>“What if she damages the bar?” Tara asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. A bar can be rebuilt, you’re the only priceless thing here,” I answered, enjoying her blush. After all, just because she was an obsessive submissive didn’t mean that I should neglect the compliments, especially since she wasn’t afraid of being abandoned once more. </p><p>Also, there was a fact that the bar would be destroyed the moment the Lady of Destruction fought near the place. She destroyed city blocks accidentally. I had no idea what she could do purposefully.</p><p>However, there was no point in discussing it anymore. I grabbed her hips and flipped her, putting her under me. She might have super strength, but she still weighed the same as an ordinary girl, which made moves like that possible. </p><p>I started invading her core aggressively. She lost her control over her moans, filling the room with her beautiful voice. </p><p>Soon, she started trembling under me, climaxing beautifully. I sealed her lips as I exploded inside her, then rolled to the side while hugging her, still buried. “Good night,” I whispered as I buried my face in her hair. </p><p>The day had been painful and exhausting … but, ultimately, I was happy about how it ended.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment I realized the identity of the incompetent spy that visited my bar, I walked back to the bar and poured myself a stiff shot that burned my throat. I welcomed the sensation. </p><p>“Why the Lady of Destruction is here?” I muttered to myself. “She’s a famous hero who destroyed hundreds of villains. She’s even not supposed to be in this pathetic city!” </p><p>Though, infamous was a better word. Her nickname wasn’t granted to her out of love. She had dealt with not only hundreds of villains but also hundreds of city blocks. To her credit, there never had been a civilian that died, though that was only because her power allowed her to detect and protect living beings in the area she targeted. </p><p>She protected people … in a very clumsy way, only increasing the destruction wholesale, which left her with a unique infamy. However, that was the extent of my knowledge about her. I never have been a hero groupie, and once I received my powers, all my research had been focused on the supers in the town. </p><p>I thought about asking Emily to compile a dossier, but I decided against it. With her affiliation, it might be risky. Instead, I just checked the news in a more general manner, checking not only her but also all the premier heroes who operated at the national level. </p><p>It showed general levels of activity for her … which started to show a sudden dip about a year ago. She didn’t stop fighting, but the frequency decreased significantly. And, there had been no sighing of her during the last month. </p><p>It had interesting implications, particularly when combined with the many signs of infiltration training she had received. </p><p>I couldn’t rule out that she was working for the Syndicate, but it was a remote possibility. Unfortunately, that wasn’t true for the New Giant Force. She might have joined them and was here as a spy. And considering the New Giant Force had a secret alliance with the Syndicate, it wasn’t exactly a solution. </p><p>Of course, the chances that she was working for another organization were not low either, which meant it was more or less a problem. </p><p>I sighed. It was a big problem, the kind that required me to be in a better condition to even start working on it. And, I had already pushed my power enough for the day. It was time to have a nice sleep. With that in mind, I climbed the stairs and saw Tara. </p><p>Her body language alerted me in an instant. </p><p>I froze. She had been listening while I had fun with my earlier guest. And, her body language suggested that she was unhappy about it. I couldn’t help but question my earlier observations. Everything I had managed to learn about her suggested that she wouldn’t have been jealous when she saw me with other women, leading me to discard that possibility. </p><p>I couldn’t help but tense. If she had an issue with it, it had the potential to be extremely troubling. Even now, I didn’t fear her using her strength against me, as nothing about her body language shouted aggression. </p><p>However, ultimately, she didn’t need to use her strength to hurt me. She didn’t even need to reveal my secrets, including the fact that I was not actually a villain working for an even bigger one. She could just walk away, and everything about my fake identity would fall apart. </p><p>A true disaster. </p><p>I said nothing, and instead, ignored my pain to activate my power. “Tara,” I called her, forcing her to look at me without saying anything. I needed to see the source of her distress to find the best apology. </p><p>However, the moment I caught her gaze, I realized that I had gone in a completely different direction. She was in distress because of what I had done, but I had completely misread the impact. She wasn’t angry at me. </p><p>She was feeling inferior, almost disposable.</p><p>Only due to sudden panic, I ignored that possibility. After all, Tara was submissive with very serious self-worth issues. The moment she saw me with the sexy redhead party girl, she started to feel inferior, and felt like she would be discarded. </p><p>Naturally, it was absurd. Even discounting her incredible power, she still had her lovely face, amazing body, and an incredible willingness to serve my needs. If she was jealous, I would have no problem staying loyal — or, at least, do much better hiding my indiscretions. </p><p>I didn’t feel like laughing, but only because of the stabbing headache. I had already pushed myself too hard earlier, and activating my power wasn’t helpful. Likely, I doubted that I could spend the next half an hour whispering sweet nothings to her with my headache. </p><p>Luckily, helping Tara solve her sudden bout of insecurity didn’t require it. “I’m going to take a shower,” I said sharply, and her expression of despair turned even thicker. “Come wash my back,” I added. </p><p>Just like that, her expression turned hopeful. I didn’t bother maintaining eye contact and walked toward the shower. “Undress me,” I ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered, like I had just bought her a diamond necklace instead of asking her to serve me. </p><p>Not that I had a problem. I was happy. She was happy. Everyone was happy. </p><p>My mood got even better as she disrobed, matching me in her nudity. I waited while she reached for the shower, playing with the knobs until it got hot enough to be steamy. I was tempted to play with hers as well, but my headache was too much. </p><p>Instead, I stepped under the water, the warmth helping me to ignore my distress. Then, she stepped behind me, her fingers gentle and hesitant as she started to slowly soap me up, and trying to ignore the pain got even easier. I closed my eyes, enjoying the flow of the water as her fingers slid down, focusing on my lower back, then on my legs, soaping every inch of my body. </p><p>“Very good. Now, massage my shoulders. It was a rough day,” I said. </p><p>“My pleasure, sir,” she answered, telling the perfect truth. She enjoyed serving me immensely. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for her shy and obedient nature, she would have played with herself to bring herself to completion. </p><p>I was tempted to do that as well, but her slow shower massage helped my headache too much. I wondered if a scalp massage would help more. “Now, come and wash my front,” I said, not even bothering to turn, forcing her to change position instead. </p><p>She was happy to be ordered. As she stood in front of me, slowly soaping my body while giving me another perk. Her sight of her beautiful body glistening under the water. My headache didn’t affect the other parts of my anatomy, which had already turned rock hard once more, especially since the earlier, my reward had been limited to a lap dance. </p><p>Initially, once she walked away, I had been planning to ask for Tara’s help to deal with it. Then, I saw her using powers on the hidden camera. Realizing that my bar had been visited by the Lady of Destruction had worked wonders to deal with that raging boner … temporarily. </p><p>Now, it was back with revenge. Tara’s gaze dipped down, showing that she wanted to deal with it. Admittedly, it was tempting, but I decided to tease her a bit first. </p><p>“Wash my hair,” I ordered. </p><p>She reached for the shampoo and immediately rose to her toes to reach my hair comfortably. I was quite a bit taller than her, after all. Amusingly, only through power, she did it easily, as staying only on her toes was hardly the easiest thing, yet she did so with the elegance of a ballerina. </p><p>Convenient indeed.</p><p>Her fingers danced on my scalp gently, her beautiful face contorted with an intense focus, her eyes shut. I said nothing, as her gentle scalp massage certainly helped with my pain. So, even as her fingers gently danced, occasionally slipping down to rub my neck, I ignored the fact that she could snap me like a twig and focused on the pleasure instead. </p><p>I kept my eyes open, enjoying the massage and her beauty at the same time until my horrible headache started to fade away. “That’s enough, we can’t stay in the shower all night,” I called. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she whispered, trying to hide her disappointment, mistakenly thinking that it was the end of our fun. </p><p>“You still hadn’t finished cleaning me, after all. There’s one last part you need to massage,” I said as I pointed down at my … pointing organ. “On your knees.” </p><p>She followed that order immediately, hitting the floor hard enough to shatter her knees if it wasn’t for her power. However, with her power, it was the ceramic floor that experienced the same fate. </p><p>Luckily, I was planning to renovate the place sooner or later, so it was hardly an issue. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, are you sure you want to do this here?”” I asked Umi even as I leaned back while she opened the door and left the driver’s seat, then sat next to me. </p><p>“I don’t know what are you talking about, sir?” she said with an angry tone. “I’m just making sure you’re properly dressed for your meeting. Right now, it’s inappropriate. Particularly, there,” she said as she pointed at my crotch. </p><p>In a way, she had a point. A raging boner, visible even wearing the casual slacks I had been wearing. But then, she didn’t have any right to complain either, as she was the one who was responsible for it. It was inevitable when the whole drive she had played with the buttons of her blouse, opening them far more than what was advisable even considering mostly empty roads since she was the one that was driving, flashing her legs at the cost of being dangerous. </p><p>And, the fact that her underwear was still absent only helped it further. And, since that absence was born due to the direct intervention of her fiancee, who decided to complain to me about his jealousy issues rather than dealing with her directly — the same fiancee that was in the house while we parked in the driveway — she was still angry as well. </p><p>I would have pitied Charlie, if he hadn’t folded about a bogus claim about paying back little money, or even fought against it in the first place. </p><p>Instead, I watched as Umi joined me in the backseat, already on all fours. And, with her blouse mostly unbuttoned, it gave me an excellent angle to enjoy the sight of her bosom.  </p><p>And, what a bosom it was. </p><p>“Well, since you think it’ll be a problem, be a doll and solve it, please.” </p><p>“Of course, sir,” Umi said throatily, her usual shyness nowhere to be seen as she almost ripped my pants off. That change was the main reason I actually decided to hire her as a secretary rather than keeping to a little punishment. The shift between the two personas was incredible. It was like Mrs. Jeckyll and Mrs. Hyde, only between innocently sexy and aggressively horny. </p><p>It was the best two-in-one package in the world. </p><p>She leaned forward, her lips quick to wrap around my girth. “Try to be quick. I’m sure they heard us. We don’t want them to come out and check us,” I said. That reminder was enough to break through her angry confidence, at least momentarily. </p><p>Luckily, whenever that anger dissipated, it left behind a sexy submissive who defaulted to listening to my directions. I grabbed her raven hair and continued to pump her down, obediently taking my presence deep into her throat. </p><p>Just to be on the safe side, I sent a quick message to Tiffany, asking her to make sure to prevent two buffoons from leaving the house. I didn’t want a scandal, particularly tonight. I needed that presentation. </p><p>Well, needed was a strong term. I could probably put it together in a day or two, but I certainly didn’t want to spend that much time locked in a computer, when I could do more important things. </p><p>Like keeping the morale of their significant other up. I was an excellent boss. </p><p>“You look good without underwear. Maybe I should make that the official uniform,” I teased her, which was enough to remind her that, she was supposed to be angry, not fearful.  It didn’t take long for her to take back control, and I let her. </p><p>Her head bobbed up and down, each second giving me a blast of pleasure. I groaned in pleasure, but I wasn’t so lost to miss the door opening. I put my hand on Umi’s back, ready to hide her in case Tiffany didn’t see my message. </p><p>A moment later, I saw a pretty redhead wearing a scandalously small sundress, walking toward the car with sauntering steps, confirming that she indeed saw it. Lost in pleasure, Umi didn’t notice it until the door opened. </p><p>There, she froze. “Hi, Tiffany. Good evening,” I said, which made Umi relax. After all, it wasn’t the first time we spent some ‘quality’ time together. However, she still reacted then Tiffany slid herself to the backseat. It turned crowded, even when Tiffany let Umi’s legs drape over her thighs. </p><p>Umi said nothing, still continuing with her task.  </p><p>“Good evening to you,” Tiffany said teasingly. “I see that pre-meeting preparations are going well.” </p><p>“What can I say. I have a hardworking secretary,” I said. Umi didn’t react as we teased her. However, she reacted when Tiffany’s hand landed on her thigh. </p><p>“Nice skirt,” she murmured teasingly even as she let her hand move up, riding her already short skirt up with ease. “Too poor to afford underwear?” she added, her tone salacious.</p><p>“H-hey, stop it,” Umi murmured, startled by the sudden lesbian escalation. </p><p>“Not unless you stop what are you doing and let me have a turn. You have him in the office already.” </p><p>“No,” Umi answered, her tone surprisingly decisive as she took my shaft between her lips. </p><p>“Possessive little thing, are you?” Tiffany teased as she leaned forward, and pressed her lips against her wetness, while her fingers slipped inside. </p><p>Umi let out an impressive moan despite her full mouth, which would have ended up getting heard if it wasn’t for my expensive car, with perfect sound isolation. Tiffany chuckled as she fingered Umi rapidly. Umi froze, so I grabbed her head, assisting her with directions. </p><p>“That’s too much,” she gasped when I let her go up to catch her breath, her tone leaving no doubt that a climax was impending. “Please.”  </p><p>“Not unless you finish what you started,” I reminded her even as I pushed down once again. “You don’t want to be punished on your first day, do you?”  </p><p>“No, sir,” she whispered, which was all she was able to say as she took me into her throat. Tiffany decided to help, and used her empty hand to wrap Umi’s hair tightly before pushing down, allowing her to reach depths she couldn’t do unassisted. </p><p>At least, under the current hurried circumstances.</p><p>I said nothing as I fully enjoyed the tightness of her throat, her gags like a song to my ears. </p><p>Even as I challenged the elasticity of her throat, I didn’t neglect to pay attention to Tiffany,  who was ever helpful. It was not smart to make a woman like that feel neglected. I reached forward, and slipped into her dress. </p><p>Just like Umi, she was lacking a bra. I grabbed her nipple, twisting it aggressively in the way she loved, her reaction showing that it was still a novel feeling for her. </p><p>Another incompetence of her little husband. It didn’t take long to slip her dress down so her tits were easily accessible to me, giving her some pleasure while she desperately licked Umi. I moved my hips, invading Umi’s throat even more while Tiffany enjoyed my hands, a chain of orgasms not too far away.</p><p>When Umi started to shudder, Tiffany tried to pull back, but I didn’t allow her. One hand stayed on her naked breasts, squeezing her nipples while the other kept her head down, keeping Umi in a state of total bliss.  </p><p>With everything, an explosion was inevitable. I let Tiffany go as I focused on helping Umi. “Don’t waste a drop,” I ordered. </p><p>Umi did not, though her cheeks were full as she pulled back. It would have looked cute like a squirrel if it wasn’t for her messed up make-up … and the fact that her mouth was filled with my seed.  </p><p>Tiffany intervened before she could swallow it. “Don’t be a bitch, and share,” she said, and without a  warning, captured Umi’s lips. A  beautiful kiss, with a shocking amount of tongue, the content making it even more beautiful. </p><p>Still, as much as watching them was fun, I still had a meeting to go to … and I had all night for more fun. “I’ll be leaving early. I’ll say that you’re helping Umi with a personal problem.”  </p><p>“No,” Tiffany whispered as she looked at panting Umi. “Tell them we went upstairs for a wardrobe change.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said and walked away. Tiffany wasn’t a trustworthy person in general, but walking on the line between slutty and evidence for a divorce trial was a line she walked perfectly, so I trusted her. </p><p>No matter how annoying it was to walk away from them while Tiffany slipped her fingers inside Umi, pumping her aggressively. </p><p>A beautiful sight indeed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching the battle of the Eternal City was an interesting experience. Almost out of body. With three of the elemental lords freed, they were cutting a swathe through the defenses of the Eternals. I stayed in place, afraid that they might prioritize freeing the fire elemental first; therefore risking the girls while they were retreating. </p><p>However, to my surprise, not only did the Elemental Lords ignore the plight of the Fire Elemental, but also they attacked each other whenever they drifted closer. </p><p>They were not exactly friends. </p><p>Unfortunately for Eternals, their enmity didn’t help their defense efforts. The elemental lords, even in their weakened state, were walking embodiments of destruction. They attacked each other, but as their powers clashed, the side effects were enough to eviscerate large parts of the floating city. </p><p>As their elemental attacks clashed, the resulting explosion had been enough to destroy large swaths of the city.  At a distance, I could see many Eternals trying to reach to the ships, only to fail halfway. A tragedy, but considering everything they had done, hardly undeserved.  </p><p>I wanted to avoid the chaos, but the mystery of the System was still at the center of the city. As much as I wanted to stay safe, I didn’t want to risk the system to fall into the hands of the elemental lords. They looked far too determined, and based on the scenes I had seen after the words of the fire elemental, I doubted that they would be merciful after gaining power.</p><p>I might have picked a simpler strategy if we had been able to discover the real location of the System in the material plane, but that was still ongoing. Instead, I took a deep breath, pulled my mana into a tight shield that could handle the aftermath of those great explosions, and rushed forward. </p><p>Some of the Eternals were strong enough to notice me, and I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for their focus on escaping, dealing with them would have been very difficult. </p><p>It was good to see that my enemies had their own troubles. </p><p>Luckily, the elementals didn’t share that concern, allowing me to rush to the center of the city, where there was a central obelisk surrounded by a shocking number of wards. Even though quite a bit of them had been shattered under the attacks of the elementals, there was still enough to create some trouble. </p><p>I connected with Helga and pulled an Avatar of hers. “What’s going on—” she asked. </p><p>“A mess,” I said as I pointed to the collapsing wards. “Help me with them,” I said, not really having enough time to talk. Instead, we started dealing with the chaotic mess of the wards with the assistance of her unique Knowledge Spark. With that, I passed those wards … and entered the room.  </p><p>Only to be teleported into a unique mental space … I could have resisted it, but instead, I chose to use my magic to blind the entity that pulled me to Helga’s presence, which would allow her to track the location of the System core more efficiently. </p><p>“You’re finally here, my champion,” a voice arrived to my ear. A gentle, soft voice, preceding the arrival of a kind, beautiful woman, who also radiated a sexy aura like she wasn’t aware of. </p><p>I might have fallen for it, if I didn’t feel her Divine Spark trying to dive against my System to take control of it. I recognized what she had been doing. She was looking for the traps that I had long removed. </p><p>She was competent, but luckily for me, she was powerless. If I were to measure her raw power, it would be merely five points for each stat, maybe even lower. However, even with the disparity of power, if the traps were still in place, I would have been defeated. </p><p>I created a few clones of those magical traps, but intentionally jumbled them, giving her the impression that the traps just needed to be repaired. After all, the more she focused on me, the longer Helga would have to track the location. </p><p>“Who are you?” I asked, trying to keep her talking. </p><p>“I’m the goddess of creation and the System,” she answered. Lies, on both accounts, but not unreasonable ones. If it wasn’t for that cursed angel forcing me to travel among the planes, I might have even believed it for a time. </p><p>Luckily, delaying the talks worked to my benefit. “How could I believe you?” I asked, acting like I was inclined to believe her in the first place, but kept back. </p><p>“Watch,” she said as she touched my temple, and many scenes flooded my mind. It was similar to what that elemental had shown, but also different. They lacked the vividness of the other scenes, along with an artificial feel. </p><p>They were lies, so I didn’t pay much attention. I still faked it, giving the impression that I was fascinated, while the mysterious goddess still continued to try and activate the traps she had buried in the System. </p><p>At the same time, I was communicating with my girls, who finally arrived at the Material Plane, and currently dealing with an attack from the elementals, whose determination to invade Material Plane increased several times. </p><p>A trouble, or, it would have been a trouble, if it wasn’t for a message from Helga, informing me that she had discovered the core of the System. </p><p>She teleported with a clone of me, which I used to tap into the stores. Considering everything, it had been an easy victory, but I was happy with it. It was much preferable to a merciless,  endless battle that cost us our lives. </p><p>There were a lot of reserves in the system, enough to be counted in hundreds of millions … yet, in a way, I felt the amount was too low. After all, it was supposed to represent the reserves collected across hundreds of years. </p><p>Eternals must have been using them more than I expected … either that, or their connection with the other universes was stronger than I expected. </p><p>A troubling matter, but it was for the future. Right now, I have a simpler challenge. First, I turned off the System’s constant absorption of Divine Spark. I might activate it in the future, but for the moment, it allowed the girls to defend against the Elementals much more easily as they established their domains.  </p><p>Then, the next problem. What I would do with the Spark in storage. I could devour them to strengthen myself, which would increase my stats several times. Tempting, but still not enough to defend the material plane against the sudden elemental attack. </p><p>Luckily, that was not my only option. Instead, I used our connection, and started to channel my power to my girls, using my power to allow them to bond with the excess Divine Spark smoothly. </p><p>With that, their speed to establish their Domain got much faster, and the Material Plane was safe. At least, temporarily. </p><p>The stores of the System were almost completely depleted when the goddess realized that her traps had been removed long ago. “You!” she shouted in anger, attacking me. </p><p>“Me,” I said with a chuckle as I grabbed her hand. “What about it, miss inter-dimensional invader?” I said with a chuckle. Then, while maintaining my grip, I dispelled mental space, and forced her into a physical body. </p><p>It was made of mana, essentially an inferior avatar I could dispel just as easily. “You know,” she said, her voice resigned. “Kill me,” she added, opening her arms. </p><p>I chuckled. “No hurry,” I said with a chuckle as I grabbed her, and finally teleported away from the Eternal City, leaving the place for the battle between the Elementals and the Eternals, ignoring the temptation of trying to deal with the Elementals when they were weak. </p><p>I doubted that it could be achieved easily. </p><p>“What are you going to do with me —” she started, but before she could complete it, I sealed her again. No need to complicate things further. </p><p>Instead, I teleported to the System core, leaving my girls to deal with the Invasion. </p><p>I had a System to assimilate … and then. </p><p>The future was limitless. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Four days later, I was looking at another capital, this time belonging to Xanhum kingdom … which looked quite similar to Zaim kingdom for all intents and purposes. The general fashion and the architectural style were mostly the same, and so was the language. </p><p>It felt weird, especially since both kingdoms were supposed to be separated for hundreds of years after some kind of empire had collapsed. I wasn’t a sociologist, but I still remembered some snippets from the Sociology classes I had attended, enough to know that some kind of cultural drift was to be expected. </p><p>It was suspiciously absent. </p><p>I wondered if it was the impact of the long-lived cultivators, or if something else was going on. However, as I approached the huge marble building, holding the token, I abandoned those thoughts and focused on the large signboard with only one name carved. </p><p>Verdant. </p><p>Aisnam’s family. </p><p>It was an interesting choice for her to send me here considering her status with the family, but things were clearly even more complicated than I expected. Still, I had been watching the place, and everything I had seen showed me that there was only one cultivator, which gave me the courage to risk interacting with them. For that reason, I had hidden all the talismans and the brush before visiting the mansion. </p><p>Particularly since I had an introductory letter, giving me an excuse to talk with whomever owed a favor to her. A token and a letter. </p><p>Well, a modified letter. </p><p>Forging a letter from a cultivator wasn’t easy when every brush was infused with a passive sensation of their own writing. Even with my calligraphy, I couldn’t do it casually for any cultivator. Ironically, the cultivators of the Verdant family were the only exception, as I knew several of their techniques to enable such a thing. </p><p>Therefore, I made some subtle changes, modifying the request for healing to provide a safe house and keep me away from danger for a few months while giving the excuse that the medicine took a while to be prepared, while she dealt with the troubles she was facing. </p><p>As for why she was trying to keep me safe, there was no mention of it, but the underlying tone was clear. A romantic entanglement. Was that risky? Yes, particularly since it might have some implications on her already complicated family situation … but it was the best I could come up with. </p><p>It felt like the best option, giving me the ability to play it by the ear. I deliberately didn’t ask for anything else, not wanting to block the path of System returns.  </p><p>All of it, I dared because of the recipient of the letter. Another woman from the Verdant family. According to the gossip, she had served as a healer for fifty years, which meant she was probably in her seventies at a minimum. Maybe even older than a hundred. </p><p>I was betting that, as a cultivator that stuck in the mortal kingdom for years, she would be more inclined to see the story from Aisnam’s perspective than the inappropriate nature of it. </p><p>After all, defining her situation here as serving was a bit of a misnomer, of course. As a cultivator, she lived in a mansion, and even the king couldn’t casually request her services. He could only send a convoy with significant expensive gifts — apparently, enough to strain the budget of the kingdom — every time they required her help. </p><p>I had to admit, such a thing was clearly lucrative. </p><p>As I walked closer, the guards looked at me. Two of them had been guarding the place, each clearly at the peak of the Connate realm. But, to my senses, their essence felt hollow. </p><p>It looked like I wasn’t the only one who was using medicinal skills to hasten the cultivation of the people around me. More importantly, since they were assigned to door duty, it implied that there were several more Connate Realm artists guarding the place. </p><p>“Halt. How dare you approach —” one of them started, only to stop when he noticed the token in my hand. He said nothing else as he took the letter and the token and disappeared inside. I waited at the gate, saying nothing. </p><p>Ten minutes later, the guard returned. “Follow me,” he said. I did so, and stepped into the courtyard, humming in appreciation as I glanced around. A glimpse at the outer garden was enough to redefine the meaning of luxury. It was far more expensive than the palace complex of the Zaim kingdom, even when compared to the residence of the prince. </p><p>However, I wondered if anything was as valuable as the large tree I had passed. Once I passed near, I noticed that it was actually producing Qi. The amount was very small, certainly not enough to cultivate properly, but considering how rare was to find Qi outside — even after my travel, the only place I was able to detect any was the Spring Palace — I had no doubt that it was incredibly valuable. </p><p>As I was led deeper into the garden, I passed an occasional plant that was radiating a minute amount of Qi. However, as I led to a small, private garden, that finally changed. In that small, concealed garden, every single plant, including the grass, was radiating Qi, creating a far denser environment. </p><p>The increased density was barely enough to rival the Spring Palace garden during the day. Even if I had a functioning Immortal Root and was able to capture every mote, it would have taken me weeks to gather a Strand of Qi. </p><p>The guard brought me in front of an old woman, who looked even older than I expected. She looked in her eighties, which meant, she was even older. Considerably so, as even in the Qi Refinement Realm, true cultivation extended people’s lives significantly. </p><p>She said nothing, but as she examined me, I could see a growing disdain on her face. It was an important input, as it implied that her distaste was less about the fact that I was Aisnam’s lover as I strongly implied in the forged letter, but the fact that I was a mere Skin Refinement martial artist. </p><p>Or, a martial artist in general. </p><p>She said nothing as some kind of weight slammed against me. I could feel her Qi pressing against me, invading my body. She was stronger than I expected. Easily the Fifth Realm of Qi Gathering, maybe even the sixth. She was trying to make me kneel. </p><p>I could have probably resisted it with my own Qi cultivation, but instead, I kept my essence flaring to fight against it, using the purest Tiger Essence I could manage, but not relying on Black Tiger Onslaught, even using it to forcibly take a part of her attack. </p><p>I wanted to experiment twofold. The first part of it was to test whether the purity of the essence mattered against Qi. It mattered somewhat, but not enough to actually fight against Qi on anything close to equal terms. </p><p>Leaving me wondering why the System actually valued it that high. </p><p>The second part of it was to see if I could use it to trigger the System. </p><p>She didn’t keep it for long, and not because she was feeling merciful. I could see that, using the pressure had strained her significantly. She tried to hide it, but I caught it nonetheless. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Insult Bonus - 150 (Capped)]</p><p>[200x Return - 23 Qi Strands]</p><p>The experiment was a success. For the second time, I had managed to use the benefit of the Insult feature, and this time, with a far bigger benefit. </p><p>“Not bad,” she grumbled, frustrated, though I could see the disgust in her gaze fading. It looked like, by resisting the pressure of a Seventh Stage Qi Gathering cultivator's pressure, I earned her respect. “So, boy, tell me. Who are you?” </p><p>I wanted to curse. I didn’t want her respect. At least, not that quickly. I was very happy with the Insult I received. </p><p>“Just a lucky traveler wanting to save an unfortunate flower from the stumps of uncaring giants,” I said, delivering that with determination, but also with perfect cadence. It looked like she cared about her garden, so I used a flower metaphor. </p><p>Of course, that also implied that I knew I was tangled with the Queen rather than a servant like she tried to make me think, but since the letter had no details about that failed disguise, I didn’t want to complicate the situation further. </p><p>“Not bad,” she said. “You need to wait for a few weeks, as I’m just a healer, not an alchemist. Purchasing a pill that could help her is not a simple affair,” she said. </p><p>“As you wish, exalted cultivator,” I said, bowing slightly. Reluctant, yet respectful. From what I could read from her body language, it was clear that the insult was a one-time thing. </p><p>Leaving Pity as the next best option. </p><p>After all, I didn’t plan on staying here and enjoying the grass.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as mixing with the army to create some more problems for the palace guard was tempting, ultimately, I had a more important guest. I needed to help Aisnam. </p><p>And, now that I had talisman-making tools, there was actually a way to do so. </p><p>I already had a plan for it. The combination of protection, cleansing, and purification talismans was what I needed. Or, more accurately, it was likely Aisnam had a plan when she decided to accept to be married of to the Zaim Royal Family. </p><p>I believed that because she only knew how to make those three talismans. Technically, it could be a coincidence, but with everything considered, it was not likely. Particularly since, according to my limited information, a purification talisman was not something that was useful except in some rare circumstances. </p><p>Circumstances that included the situation of the Spring Palace. </p><p>I suspected that she had planned to use the combination to cultivate again from the beginning, but she probably planned to visit the cursed spot occasionally rather than live there. </p><p>Then, her brother’s disappearance ruined everything. </p><p>I couldn’t help but connect that with the prince’s idle ramblings, and realize just how merciless cultivators could be even to their own families when power was concerned. The other branch of her family had no problem consigning her to death, as long as they had some kind of plausible deniability on the subject. </p><p>I doubted that they would be any kinder to a random outsider they hired. No, I was happy with my own path. </p><p>“Now, let’s start,” I said as went to the Spring Palace. With all the guards trying to respond to the sudden fire, the defenses had weakened temporarily, allowing me to sneak into the garden. The cursed Qi hit me immediately, which was not a pleasant sensation, but rather activating the protection talisman I had in my inventory. </p><p>I had to because I wanted to replicate Aisnam’s trick to draw talismans. After all, either I used the abundance of the cursed Qi in the garden, or I used several dozen strands from my inventory for the number I had been planning to create. </p><p>Not exactly ideal. </p><p>After spending weeks in the Palace, I knew the perfect nook to hide. Once I arrived there, I reached into my Inventory, and pulled a strand of Qi, using it to draw the first purification talisman, jumpstarting the process. </p><p>“It’s a fascinating feeling,” I found myself murmuring even as my brush danced on the paper, every measured touch adding another perfect line of ink infused with Qi. My hand danced, adding layer after layer without stopping … and, fifteen minutes later, I had my first purification talisman. </p><p>The resulting talisman was incredible. Yellow Low-Grade. Which, considering the difficult environment, was even more of an achievement. </p><p>After staying in this world, and particularly after my cursory connection with the cultivation world, I had a better understanding of the qualities. For example, even the weakest cultivation artifact had to be at least a profound quality for it to work, which applied to the talismans. Anything lower, and they would just fail. </p><p>Hence the reason only one out of several attempts would end up succeeding for talisman makers … well, the ones that didn’t have their talents improved by a System that looked a miracle even in a world where people flew casually. </p><p>For me, even Yellow Low Grade was some kind of underachievement, held back by the environment, low material quality, and the speed I was creating. But, they were more than enough to function as another mysterious gift. </p><p>Still, Yellow Low Grade was more than enough for the current purposes, particularly considering I had limited time. I wasn’t planning to be in the garden when the dawn arrived, and while seeing Aisnam was tempting, she had already sent me away, and I couldn’t return without telling some really damning lies. </p><p>Instead, I started to use the purified Qi to draw the next talisman … then the next. </p><p>Since I was splitting my attention between meditation and talisman-making, the quality suffered a bit more, or maybe it was the reduced amount of subdued Qi, but Profound Peak Grade should be still sufficient for her needs. </p><p>My brush danced on the special paper like I had been doing it my whole life, the pile of talismans growing without ruining even one. From a perspective, I was literally printing money … but ironically, finding a store that would sell me what I needed without killing me was a bigger challenge than purchasing. </p><p>An absurd dilemma. </p><p>While I was thinking about the next steps, I completed sixty talismans, fifty for Aisnam, and ten for me.  </p><p>For Aisnam, fifty talismans of Profound Peak Grade, all purification talismans, which was the one she needed the most. </p><p>For myself, I created ten protective talismans, the weakest at the Profound Low Grade, barely able to work, while the strongest at Yellow Middle Grade, which consumed another precious strand. </p><p>I would have created more, but I ran out of talisman paper. </p><p>I had to create both weak and strong variants, because I didn’t know what I would be facing next. However, unlike cleansing and purification talismans, protection talisman was a more common tool, which could actually defend against physical attacks once it was activated. </p><p>Hopefully, once I made contact with other cultivators, I would be able to sell them for a more applicable currency. </p><p>Once I finished them, I carefully sneaked into the Spring Palace, and left the stack of purification talismans on the desk, with a note that warned her to cultivate well, that she didn’t have much time left. </p><p>Another note from the same old apothecary who seemed determined to help her. </p><p>Unfortunately, my growing number of fake identities didn’t allow me to talk with her directly, which was a true tragedy. Instead, I got out of the same tunnel, and left the capital behind. </p><p>My next destination, was the healer she had directed to me, the one that was six months away. I wasn’t ready to stay away that long … but luckily, I didn’t have to. The distance between the capital and Markas was supposed to be almost a month, and yet, with my new speed, I was able to cover that distance in half a day. By the same equation, I should be able to go there in three days. </p><p>Assuming, of course, I didn’t meet with a threat I couldn’t handle. </p><p>Hopefully, I wouldn’t meet one, considering I had firepower enough to match with most Connate Realm martial artists, several cultivation tricks, and enough speed to get away from all but the fastest threats. </p><p>I wanted to go. It was risky, but even with the System, it was impossible to be completely safe. And, I had already given enough pills to Marana to be enough until my next visit, and Pearyin was busy practicing her martial arts. </p><p>It was the best time to leave. </p><p>With that, I started running, the lack of extra weight helping me to move unencumbered. I just had the talismans, the brush set, some pills, and some money with me. The rest of the equipment I might need was safely in my inventory, including a lot of emergency food. </p><p>My bastardized running-only martial art that had been inspired by the rabbits proved useful, increasing my speed to a point that couldn’t be easily matched by anyone else. </p><p>I ran. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Two thousand,” I called without blinking. The talisman brush was useless for my purposes, but the whole point of my fake approach was to signal I valued cultivator items related to calligraphy. A complete set of talisman-making materials wasn’t something that I could buy without raising all kinds of red flags, but things would be different if I could convince them to come to me directly. </p><p>“Two thousand five hundred,” someone called. </p><p>“Five thousand,” I immediately followed, deliberately letting my tone come out angrily. </p><p>“Five thousand five hundred,” someone else called, but his voice was already tense, showing that he was at the limit. It was good acting, but ultimately, acting. They were trying to test me. </p><p>I used the bell that called an attendant. “How much for these?” I said carelessly as I threw him five more bottles of Skin Refinement Realm pills of Profound Peak Grade. </p><p>“Our auction house is willing to pay two thousand for each in advance, master,” he said immediately. “We can auction them tomorrow, and even if they don’t fetch that price, we’re willing to take the loss,” he said.  </p><p>“Good,” I said like I didn’t know the brush had been deliberately put by them.  </p><p>“Fifteen thousand,” I said, and the crowd gasped. It was not exactly an incomprehensible amount of money for the others. There had been a few weapons that we had been sold for a much higher price, but that didn’t make my purchase any less shocking. </p><p>There was a difference between spending a hundred thousand for a luxury car and for a decorative vase. A high-quality weapon improved combat potential, yet a broken brush did nothing. </p><p>After that commotion died, they added a couple other cultivation-related items to the mix, including some kind of burnt book, showing that, while intact cultivation items might have been too rare, the same didn’t apply to the ones damaged to the point of uselessness. </p><p>I didn’t show any interest in anything that wasn’t related to calligraphy and talisman making, but bought another ruined brush for four thousand as well, throwing another two bottles of high-quality Skin Refinement Realm pills like they were worth nothing. </p><p>All to give them the impression that I was obsessed with Calligraphy. Combined with the elevated market for higher-grade pills — likely due to what was happening in Markas — I was hoping that someone would soon arrive to make a deal. </p><p>Of course, all that trouble could have been avoided if I had known where to go to purchase some talisman-making items, but the lack of information and contacts prevented that from working. </p><p>No one accosted me when I returned to the room that was arranged, but when I arrived at the room, there were several letters waiting for me, along with gifts out in the open. One of them was a calligraphy written by someone skilled enough to reach Perfection, a few valuable brush sets. In total, they could be sold more than what I spent at the auction, showing that scamming was a lucrative path of living. </p><p>I didn’t close the door, but kicked all of it into the fire, acting like their presence in the room was an affront to me. “Don’t let people litter my room, understood,” I reminded to a servant, playing hard to get. By doing so, I made several enemies, but since I didn’t want to stay long, I didn’t care. </p><p>The more aloof I looked, the better it was for me. Ideally, I had two objectives. To receive proper talisman-making tools, and to be invited into the palace…</p><p>Of course, my sudden appearance and my generosity were suspicious, but what I was looking for was ultimately not prohibitively expensive. If it was, they would have taken Aisnam’s talisman creation tools as well when stealing her other things. Combined with the ticking time clock I added to the situation by claiming I would leave in the morning, I was betting that someone would invite me to the palace. </p><p>They had too much inner conflict to dare to miss such an opportunity. </p><p>As for forcing me to help them … they might have done that if I had acted like an expert in any other profession. But an apothecary was not the best target for it. </p><p> Unsurprisingly, barely after an hour, there was a knock on the door. “We are under the orders of the second Prince, great master. May we come in,” a voice said. </p><p>“Come in,” I said, more reluctant than enthusiastic. One of the black-robed servants walked in, followed by four guards. “Our prince believes that such a place is not fitting for an exalted master such as yourself, and invites you to join him in his palace,” he said. </p><p>I grunted noncommittally, showing my impatience, which cut off the extended explanation that he no doubt prepared. “He is an admirer of the true art of calligraphy, and he would love to have an opportunity to discuss to most recent piece he had acquired, written by a cultivator…” he said. </p><p>I pushed a manic expression to my face, like nothing else mattered. “Lead me there,” I said. </p><p>Once I left, accompanied by a high-ranking royal servant and four royal guards, people paid even more attention to me. Most just wanted to gossip, while some were too determined while watching me to be onlookers. </p><p>They were likely spies. </p><p>I was soon led to another palace, which was the residence of the second prince. He was a young man, barely in his twenties, even younger than me. He greeted me directly, and led to me a private feast … which followed was one of the most boring nights of my life. </p><p>The calligraphy he brought was made by a cultivator, and he was quite decent, but spending the whole night about the exquisite lines and ink thickness was not my ideal way of spending time. But, in the process, we drank a lot. I purified all but acted like I was drunk, lamenting on just how pitiful that I wasn’t able to find a complete set of high-quality talisman-making equipment, which I could use as a gift to a talisman master I knew, hoping to get some calligraphy lessons from him. </p><p>The prince, already drunk, shared with me how much he needed high-grade Bone Forging pills, and I immediately gave him a bottle, and several Skin Refinement tools. Exalted by it, the prince ordered a servant to bring me the best talisman-making kit they had.  </p><p>“I’m impressed. I didn’t know you have some connections with the cultivation world,” I said. </p><p>“Nothing impressive,” the prince humbly bragged. “I’m just lucky to receive the grace of a fallen cultivator family. Luckily, we managed to get the support of another branch when one that supported us had lost their power.”   </p><p>I believed that he wouldn’t be sharing the last part with me if he wasn’t very drunk, but that didn’t matter. After a few more questions, I managed to finally learn more about the predicament of Aisnam, the third Queen. </p><p>Apparently, she was supposed to be a strong cultivator with great potential, but after an injury ruined her potential, she was sent here for a marriage alliance instead. But, as her branch continued to lose more power, particularly after the disappearance of her brother. </p><p>Once I gave him the appropriate signals that I enjoyed listening to the story of how a cultivator had fallen from grace, he gleefully came and explained how the other branch came and essentially robbed the Queen before giving their approval to imprison her in a location that was supposed to kill her slowly. </p><p>But, he wasn’t drunk enough to mention the ‘mysterious cultivator’ that protected her. </p><p>He was annoying to listen to, and it was even more annoying that there was no reward for listening to his drawling for the whole night. Annoyingly, using a fake identity and fake implicit promises didn’t trigger the System. </p><p>I expected it, but it didn’t make the experience any less annoying.  </p><p>But I kept a pleasant smile on my face as I goaded him to talk more about the politics while we discussed calligraphy, until one of the servants came up and brought me the talisman brush and other materials I needed.  </p><p>They were of higher quality than I expected, but I didn’t miss the small leaves that were on the handle of the brush, the pattern recognizable from Aisnam’s clothes. There was a high likelihood that they previously belonged to Aisnam before, and I doubted it was the other branch that gave it to them. </p><p>Well, it made me feel even less guilty about swindling them. </p><p>I even decided to create some trouble for them. Once I was led to a guest room, I set up several fire bombs, then changed into a servant outfit and left the palace. “Attackers. Everyone, to arms,” I shouted before I disappeared, and a few seconds later, the flames went off. </p><p>Giving the royal family a bigger problem to deal with in the process. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I left Markas after helping Marana. As much as I wanted to spend more time with her, acting like an old, grumpy man was not for me. </p><p>Still, the trip was not wasted. I had helped Marana as much as I could afford without risking myself too much in the process, arranged a reliable source of herbs and materials, and made sure Elsana and Lannayin were still alive … and presumably safe. Otherwise, why would the city lord work hard to protect their residence? </p><p>I didn’t know where they were. I suspected Marana knew, but I couldn’t ask her without making her suspicious. </p><p>Considering the timing, and the excessive respect from the city lord toward their empty residences, I suspected that it had something to do with the cultivators, so I didn’t dare to ask too many questions. </p><p>Instead, I returned to the capital and started my apothecary business properly, but not through a store … which I didn’t want to mix with the small workshop I had with Pearyin. She might have reached to Connate Realm with my help, but she lacked the business acumen to handle the real movers and shakers. Or, the combat experience to necessarily fight against the other Connate realm artists. </p><p>No, I was more than happy to have a small and concealed store on the outskirts of the capital to be used for emergencies. It was why, most of the pills I sold in her shop were the Peak Mortal Grade. </p><p>This time, I entered the capital as someone other than Bartna, the old apothecary. While that identity had been established already, I had already used it back in Markas during the siege, meaning it had enemies. Enemies that were likely very prevalent in the capital.  </p><p>Unlike the last time, when I prepared my makeup in a hurry, I had spent quite a bit of time preparing and applying it, so I was confident that no one would discover my true identity unless they touched my face. </p><p>After some playing, I had a nice, dignified look. I deliberately wore an old, coarse robe, but my gray hair and long gray beard were impeccable. More importantly, as I walked, I kept my essence hidden, making people impossible to guess my martial cultivation … but I made sure to collide with someone like it was an accident, only for them to bounce away helplessly while I didn’t even flinch, flaring my essence just a moment before containing it once again. </p><p>I looked like an expert.    </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t the only one who had the genius idea of disguising myself with makeup. But, most experts recognized people from their techniques and the nature of their essence just as much. For anyone else, transforming their essence required years to properly master a new martial art and comprehend its nature. Hardly worth the effort. </p><p>For me, it was trivial.  </p><p>My destination was the Royal Auction House. </p><p>It was one of the most popular attractions of the Capital, with various events. It was a good way to make a name for myself without meeting too many challenges. The apothecary business was cutthroat, but none of them would dare to attack me there. </p><p>Of course, they might have tried to assassinate me afterward, but that part wasn’t intimidating anymore. I was confident in avoiding anyone but a cultivator, and I doubted that a few essence pills would be enough to tempt a cultivator.</p><p>Even if it did, I wasn’t helpless against them anymore. Not to the point of seeking confrontation with them, of course, but at least, their presence enough wouldn’t send me running in fear.  </p><p>Acting out openly irked me somewhat, but to find out how to cure Aisnam, I needed to get in contact with other cultivators, preferably some with medical knowledge … but, to do that, my apothecary knowledge was unnecessary. Cultivators didn’t care much about the martial artists. Even Aisnam didn’t respect martial arts more than curiosity, and she had already lost her cultivation. </p><p>No, to access cultivator resources, I had two options. I could either reveal my cultivation directly, which would have too many implications. Or, I could use talismans to bargain. I had the ability and the designs. </p><p>What I lacked was the materials to make talismans. It required a special brush, ink, and paper, each made from Qi-rich plants. </p><p>I wasn’t sure that the auction house had any … but once I made a reputation for myself, I should be able to get some. With that in mind, I arrived at the auction house and went toward one of the desks. “Ticket or item admission —” he asked and stopped when I put the bottle on the desk. “We don’t accept pills unless they are at least Profound High Grade,” he started dismissively, only for his eyes to widen when I opened the bottle. </p><p>“Profound Peak  Grade, Muscle Reinforcement Realm Essence Pill,” I said. “Do you accept them?” </p><p>“Twenty of them, not bad. We can —” he started, but I interrupted by adding four more bottles. Then, I followed up with a bottle of Skin Refinement Grade ones. “Yes, we can definitely put them on the auction as long as they pass the muster,” he said. </p><p>“See that it does,” I said dismissively as I threw him a bottle of Profound Peak Grade pills for Initiate Realm. A clear bribe, both to make sure things went smoothly, and to imply that it was just a start. </p><p>“May I ask if you are the one that refined them?” he said respectfully. </p><p>I didn’t even acknowledge the question. “Arrange a room for me,” I said arrogantly, copying the way the experts acted … which was, ironically, very similar to how the spoiled rich brats acted back in my world. </p><p>He escorted me to an inn, but not before giving a signal, and before we could arrive at the destination, a dozen people started to observe my movement, which was another reason I hadn’t approached in such a manner in the first place.  </p><p>I would receive an intense scrutiny. Hopefully, it would be enough. “Do you have any requests, master,” he said with a deep bow. “Food, drink … entertainment.” </p><p>“Arrange for a brush and paper,” I said as I settled on the room, aware that, once I left, they would be examining every inch of the room. He left for a moment and returned with an expensive brush set. </p><p>I stayed in the room until the evening, and I created several calligraphy pieces using some popular poems. I didn’t exactly know the market, but considering they were actually better than the pieces that were being displayed around the palace — at least, in the sections I was able to enter — I had no doubt that a thousand gold coins for each wouldn’t be out of the question. </p><p>And, that was without me showing my full capabilities. I kept myself limited to the peak of Major Accomplishment just in case. </p><p>There was a knock on the door. “Come in,” I said as I put the brush down. </p><p>The same attendant arrived, and the moment he saw the writings on the desk, his eyes widened. “Excellent work, master,” he said, his shock genuine, showing that he was aware of just how valuable they were. I had written four pieces, and while they weren’t as expensive as the pills, considering they cost nothing, they were certainly far more profitable. “Do you want me to add those to the auction as well?” </p><p>I looked at him in anger. “You dare mock me,” I growled, flaring in anger as I took a step forward. </p><p>His face lost all his color as he kowtowed in panic. “I’m sorry master,” he said, not even trying to defend himself. “I don’t dare to covet your masterpieces.” </p><p>I snorted in disappointment. “What masterpieces? Those are garbage,” I answered calmly I walked back to the desk, and threw all four calligraphy into the fire as well as the brush … though I made sure one of them only burned halfway, leaving enough physical evidence of its quality. “Still, maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised that a backwater kingdom like that treats them as valuable. Lead me to the auction.” </p><p>“Yes, master,” he said, and carefully escorted me, his face still white with fear. Watching me burn those very valuable Calligraphy pieces didn’t help him either, as it further confirmed that I was temperamental enough to actually kill him, and probably strong enough to get away with it. </p><p>Still, despite his fear, when he led me to a private room to watch the auction, he still dared to ask a question. “Master, are you planning to add anything else to the auction? I think I can arrange it.” </p><p>“No. It’s a bother to carry too much money while traveling,” I said dismissively. “I’ll be leaving as soon as the auction is over,” I said. “Now, leave me alone.”  </p><p>I stayed in the room. The auction itself passed without any kind of event, leaving me five thousand, six hundred gold pieces richer, more than two-thirds coming from the Skin Refinement Pills. </p><p>They sold for even more than I expected. During the auction, I planned to bid on nothing, but that changed when I noticed they put four different calligraphy brushes on display, items that weren’t a part of the schedule in the morning. </p><p>Three of them, I ignored, as while they were exquisite, ultimately, they were either ordinary, or created by martial artists. But, the last brush finally caught my attention. It was a damaged, broken piece, yet, its auction still started from a thousand gold pieces. </p><p>A talisman brush. Too bad it was unusable.</p>",

    "content": "<p>There were a lot of guards on the walls, but none of them had any higher cultivation than an Initiate, which meant that bypassing them had been a simple endeavor in the dark of the night. Though, it was also enough to show that they were struggling.  </p><p>Unlike the slums, there was a strict curfew, but the streets were filled with patrols. The city was tense, but the number of burnt buildings and other issues suggested that the worry was for nothing. The enemy spies were clearly working hard. </p><p>I didn’t interact with them, but I moved around the city, taking note of the changes. Some of those changes, like the burnt remains of the three schools that fought against the city lord, were expected. Some, like the lack of movement in Snow Blossom Apothecary and Volcano Forge, not so much. </p><p>Especially since, Volcano Forge had been rebuilt, and both places were protected by a full squad of city guards. Interesting question, but since I didn’t have the option to question anyone, I went to see Marana. </p><p>But, not before spending some time putting on some makeup to look like the same mysterious old apothecary that engaged with Marana in the past. </p><p>Then, I sneaked into the Crane school. The security was tight, but the secret entrance was still free. However, rather than barging in, I knocked on the secret door twice, loudly, then took a few steps back. The door opened a while later, revealing Marana in her uniform, her beautiful face contorted with anger. “You,” she said, doing her best to look calm, but I didn’t miss both fear and anger on her face. </p><p>“Yes, it’s me,” I said with an ominous, cracking voice. “I came to collect my debt.” Angering her was not the safest thing to do, but to sell the role, I needed to act more aggressively. Now that I could use Qi to defend myself, I was far more confident in acting that way. </p><p>“Come in,” she said, frustrated, but also a challenge. As if, she was challenging me to dare to walk in. I chuckled as I followed her, and soon, we were in a familiar room. </p><p>I decided not to waste time and torture Marana pointlessly. “You remember our deal,” I said.</p><p>“Yes, but first. How’s Arthanum?” she asked, once again showing her softhearted nature. </p><p>“Don’t worry. His situation is better than yours,” I said, then, after a momentary thought, I decided to add something that would excuse my future appearances. “I had made him an offer of employment, and he found it more palatable than going back to his family,” I said. </p><p>“Did you force him?” she said. </p><p>“No. He’s very happy to make that deal,” I said. “After all, not everyone could help him reach the Skin Refinement realm quickly,” I added, adding just enough to give some flexibility for the future. “But, that’s enough chitchat. Do you have the manuscripts?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she said.  </p><p>“Interesting. I wonder if you even mentioned the deal to them, or decided to handle the consequences yourself?” I said, unable to help but tease her. After spending time together, I had a better sense of how she thought. </p><p>Luckily, they were not needed in the first place. </p><p>“Does it matter?” she said icily. “We had a deal, and I’m willing to fulfill my part,” she said. “I just need to make sure the crisis is over, then I’ll follow you as my honor demands—” she started, her tone like she was accepting a death sentence. </p><p>I interrupted her with a gesture. “It looks like there’s a misunderstanding. When I said you’ll follow me, I was being more metaphorical. You don’t need to leave,” I said. She looked surprised, and I chuckled. “I wanted you to follow me, because I needed someone to collect herbs and other materials for my new apothecary business,” I said. “And, looking outside, you can easily handle that from here,” I said. “I doubt there are many villagers that dare to forage. The herb harvest should be abundant as long as a team went deep enough.” </p><p>She looked conflicted. “I can’t risk the lives of my students. The deal is for me only,” she said. </p><p>I sighed. “What risk. A team of Bone Forging martial artists should be able to handle going in and out easily,” I commented. </p><p>She had no Bone Forging martial artists in her school, but the widening of her eyes suggested that she understood what I was driving at. “That’s…” she started, then paused. “Why?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Loyalty is a rare coin, as I learned from the past.” </p><p>“And, you trust me, despite everything?” she said. </p><p>I chuckled, acting like I had seen everything. “And, what happened. I helped you against your enemies, and now, I’m offering you enough pills to revitalize your school. In turn, I just need to collect herbs for me. I don’t even need you to give them for free. I’ll pay for them with essence pills and other medicine. Truly, what a horrible hatred we have?” </p><p>“Then, why…” she started, clearly suspicious. </p><p>“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask!” I added, suddenly looking angry, even going as far as flaring my essence chaotically. “I’m offering you a deal. If you’re truly that reluctant, you can reject it.” I chuckled darkly as I made a symbolic gesture to reflect the city outside. “I’m sure you can protect your students easily with the mess.” </p><p>I was deliberately being meaner than necessary, but since excessive niceness would be too suspicious. Hopefully, it would be enough. </p><p>“I accept,” she admitted after a long pause.  </p><p>“Good. Never reveal the deal to anyone even to your students,” I added. “There’s a lot of people that’s  invested in seeing this city fall, and it won’t be nice to stick your head out too much.” She nodded, and I didn’t bother talking too much. Ultimately, she might be softhearted, but she was also competent enough to build an independent martial arts school from nothing. </p><p>She could handle herself. </p><p>“Now, go out and bring out everything you have in storage. Also, find me a few decent cauldrons. I couldn’t sneak one into this blasted city. You’ll need some pills if you’re to be helpful,” I said. </p><p>As she walked out of the room, she was frowning at my attitude, but I didn’t mind it too much. Instead, I looked around, taking note of the room I lived for a week. That time, Marana could have taken me down easily. Now, even in a fair fight, I could take her down. </p><p>What an interesting reversal. </p><p>When she returned, she led me to her private kitchen, which was the most appropriate room to turn into a temporary apothecary. I said nothing as I set up multiple cauldrons. “Wait outside and stand guard,” I ordered, which she followed readily. </p><p>It was hardly an unusual request considering most experts valued their secrets. </p><p>With my new cultivation, refining a pile of pills hadn’t been hard. With my advanced recipes, I was able to refine a lot of high-grade pills, both to replenish essence and to assist breakthroughs. In four hours, I  refined a lot of pills. Half of it, I put into a bag, wanting to bring them to the capital. </p><p>Once I opened the door,  Marana looked at the pile I created, her eyes wide. Understandable, as that achievement was even better than what I had revealed before. “Keep it a secret,” I reminded her. </p><p>She didn’t say a moment, trying to believe what was in front of her eyes. “All those … in four hours, they are all Profound Peak-Grade,” she stammered.  </p><p>I revealed my success deliberately. Someone greedier might have been tempted to act out, but I expected that it would make her more cooperative. </p><p>“Yes,” I said. “It was tiring, but I don’t want to stay here any longer than necessary. I still have a lot of work to do.” </p><p>She paused, then asked another question. “Can you heal my students?” she asked. </p><p>“As long as they are unconscious,” I said. “I don’t want to be seen by anyone but you. Understood?” I said. Marana just nodded rather than arguing pointlessly. She went out for a bit more, then she returned to lead me to a private room. </p><p>I examined the patients. Some had visible wounds, while the others were merely unconscious, but every single one of them had serious damage to their cultivation. One by one, not only I treated their problems, but also I modified their bodies so that their cultivation would progress more easily. </p><p>Her eyes widened as I explained that to her.  “Just like that,” she said, looking shocked. </p><p>“That’s nothing compared to raising Connate Realm artists. Speaking of it … you can lay down as well,” I said. </p><p>“Me too?”  she asked, surprised.  </p><p>“Sure. How else you reach the Peak of Connate Realm,” I said, treating it like the most trivial achievement. “I might have ended up in this godforsaken corner of the world, but I need proper employees.” </p><p>She paused. “But, if you can help someone, why did you cripple Arthanum’s future?” she asked, her anger leaking despite her attempt to keep it concealed. </p><p>I chuckled, amused that even now, she was worrying about me. I didn’t choose wrongly. I decided to give her a better answer to prevent future resentment. “Simple, how else I could test his determination,” I said. </p><p>“You’re saying that what you did is …  reversible,” she added. </p><p>“Easily,” I said. “Now, lay down. I don’t have all day…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was glad that I felt no warning signs from her as she pulled my hands to her smooth stomach, because rejecting the invitation would have been very difficult. Instead, I let my hands dance over her belly, enjoying her warmth while she continued to rub against my lap with her beautiful ass. </p><p>I shifted my hands to the side slightly as she bent forward, showing her incredible flexibility — which was not from her superpower, but her dance training, I noted — while challenging her panties’ already deficient capability to keep her ass hidden. </p><p>I decided to have some fun as I pulled a stack of money from my pocket, and hooked a hundred to her panties. Her eyes widened as she received it … and I noticed her excitement. “Wow, a generous patron,” she whispered throatily. </p><p>“Only fit for a generous dancer,” I whispered. “Impress me, and there’s far more.” However, my excited tone was fake, because I was distressed with her response. She was too excited about the money, which didn’t make sense. </p><p>It was enough that I overdrove my power once again despite the stabbing pain, and slipped another hundred to her panties … once again checking every little observation. She was actually excited about receiving the money, which contrasted with her villain identity and her upbringing.</p><p>Then, I realized her excitement was a little different. It wasn’t a desperate, intense reaction like Tara had shown about the sudden richness she enjoyed, but something more measured. Still, she appreciated the money. </p><p>Which was interesting. It wasn’t surprising to see that she was rich in the past, but fell poor. But, how could a villainess could be excited by earning a couple hundred dollars… The best explanation, she had a controlling boss, and she appreciated some extra spending money. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the pain, I would have kept my power active to dig deeper, maybe even ask a few probing questions, but I let it slide. It was not immediately urgent, so I decided to focus on keeping her happy, especially since it had the very welcome side effect of maintaining my happiness. </p><p>I slipped another bill into her panties, but this time, let my hand linger there, caressing her ass. There were no warnings about not touching, so I took the clue and let my other hand climb up, caressing the underside of her breast. </p><p>She leaned back until her back was against my chest, her dance heating up. A beautiful gasp escaped her mouth as my fingers danced around her tits, pushing her already high arousal even further. The music continued, and the sexy redhead whose real name I was yet to learn continued her intimate dance. </p><p>Meanwhile, I pulled another bill from the small stack added to her g-string. </p><p>This time, I didn’t linger around her ass, but moved to her inner thigh, caressing a location that was dangerously close to a no-touch zone even for private clubs. Yet, other than a momentary stiffening, she said nothing, allowing me to access her soft skin while I further fueled her arousal. </p><p>Too bad getting too close to her wetness earned a subconscious rejection, showing that she wasn’t ready to go that far. </p><p>Instead, I brought my hand up, grabbing her nipple with a sudden aggression, squeezing just hard enough to make her moan. Her body might as well be a puzzle with a cheat sheet for me. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she warned, but her voice was filled with desire. </p><p>“Honey, you need to work hard to earn your tips,” I answered, keeping my tone light to give the impression that I was joking. “And, consider that me helping you.” </p><p>“I guess you’re right,” she answered, the huskiness in her tone driving me mad as she stood up. “I need to work harder.” </p><p>When she sat down again, she was facing me. Her hands landed on my neck, her nipples pressing against my chest, hard enough to be felt through my thin shirt. She whipped her head again, while I decided to break another cardinal rule of stripping. </p><p>I leaned forward and started kissing her neck. </p><p>She moaned. </p><p>Her hands tightened around my neck as she started moving back and forth with a renewed desire, each second driving us to a new high. Once I pulled back, she stared directly into my eyes as she danced, like daring me to go further. </p><p>I had a feeling that, at this moment, she had forgotten that she was an undercover super. Too bad that I didn’t dare to push too much without the assistance of my power. She already surprised me a couple times, enough to keep my greed under control for the moment. </p><p>Of course, just because I didn’t dare to escalate things too much didn’t mean I wasn’t willing to escalate at all. I leaned forward to capture her nipple between my lips. “How dare you—“ she tried to exclaim, but as I bit her erect nipple gently, her complaint turned into a moan. </p><p>That unexpected moan worked wonders to destroy her earlier statement, and I used the opportunity to enjoy her breasts. I stayed there until she was dangerously close to climax, then pulled back, leaving her on the edge and desperate. </p><p>Therefore, baiting her to use her unique position to the limit. She rocked on my lap even more desperately as I stopped touching her, the lap dance effectively turning into simulated sex. The best part was it was an insidious move that she barely noticed. Her desire and arousal drove her crazy, all the while she was under the impression that she was the one making the moves.  </p><p>Under the shadow of her arousal, she didn’t say anything as she rocked again and again. </p><p>When she suddenly stood up, for a fleeting moment, I thought that I had pushed too much. Yet, before I could make any move, she pushed her panties down,  leaving herself completely naked before taking the exact same pose. </p><p>As she danced, I forced her legs part even more, which meant she was feeling the pressure of my hardness completely. </p><p>She just moaned again and again … until she was finally interrupted by a desperate climax. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if I let her recover, she would have regained clarity and realized the absurdity of her moves. However, I chose that moment to lean forward, finally making a reckless move that she would have reacted very badly. </p><p>I kissed her. </p><p>The intimacy hit her as much as the pleasure, but with my hands landing on her naked ass, forcing her to dance while my tongue invaded her mouth kept her obedient. There was no complaint about boundaries, just muffled moans. </p><p>I kept it going until she was at the edge of another climax, then pulled back from the kiss. “W-what,” she stammered, shocked and dazed. </p><p>“Play with yourself,” I ordered. It was reckless, but rather than getting angry, she just followed that clue, her fingers disappearing in her depths. “Keep your eyes open,” I added, catching her gaze. </p><p>Her blush contrasted with her desperate fingers, but the view was incredible. It took mere seconds as she brought herself to a climax just in seconds, her breathing chaotic. This time, I let her recover. I could push her … but I was afraid of her organization checking if she stayed out of contact for too long. </p><p>The situation was complicated enough. </p><p>“I … I think that’s my loss,” she whispered throaty manner as she realized just how close she came to surrendering completely, her panic as delicious as the earlier pleasure. </p><p>“There’s no shame trying again. You’re welcome any time,” I answered as I leaned back, watching as she slowly dressed, her earlier confidence replaced by shyness. Once everything was in place, she looked at the door. </p><p>“Come here,” I said, still in my seat. She followed my order and stood in front of me. I grabbed her beautiful red hair, pulled her for another kiss, and used the chance to slip a couple thousand to the side of her panties, giving her another reward. When I pulled back, she was gasping softly. “I’ll see you around,” I said. </p><p>She nodded softly, and stumbled out in a daze. I continued checking her from the camera. Not that I was worried about her safety. She was clearly strong enough. I wanted to see her reaction more. </p><p>So, I watched her as she took a blind alley two streets over, leaning against a wall to catch her breath. But, my elation died when her feet got snagged by a random debris. She cursed, waved her hand …</p><p>And a blue forcefield destroyed it. </p><p>Just like that, I recognized her. A super of national renown, one with a reputation of destruction, who stopped appearing in the news a month ago after causing hundreds of millions of property damage. And, not for the first time, enough to earn the nickname, Lady of Destruction. </p><p>Or, officially known as Blue Princess.  </p><p>A hero.  </p><p>Like my life wasn’t complicated enough… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Silence stretched for a while as I looked at her beautiful green eyes while she considered what to do. At first, I wasn’t planning to pay much attention to her sudden silence, expecting her to work based on a script. </p><p>She looked like she would follow that, especially once her phone buzzed and she received a message. I wasn’t able to read it, but her big smile suggested that it was either from a significant other, or a crush. It was hard to replicate that enjoyment. </p><p>However, considering her excitement turned into anger the moment she read the message, it wasn’t hard to guess that whoever wrote the message chose to say the wrong thing. She growled before turning off her phone. </p><p>It had all the telltale signs of a poorly designed bait, so I risked pain to overcharge my power … which confirmed that her reaction was genuine. Once she raised her gaze, I noticed a hint of hesitancy in her eyes, one that was mixed with desire, making me question whether she was planning to go rogue.</p><p>Anger was a beautiful motivator.  </p><p>A question left my mouth before I could even properly think about it. “So, what’s next. Another challenge, or are you … surrendering?” I asked, putting the slightest tone of dismissal to the last word. </p><p>If I hadn’t realized that she was a super, with little experience in undercover work, her reaction would have surprised me. Instead, as I watched her pull down her skirt with one free move, a beautiful black g-string, completing the image of a trashy party girl. “I’m not a quitter,” she declared, but as she leaned against the counter, I could see her hesitancy. </p><p>She wasn’t entirely sure of her move. So, I turned my back, and poured her another drink — this time a bitter whiskey cocktail that was much more to her taste — which had the added benefit of giving her a few seconds to recover. </p><p>Well, I watched her from the bar mirror, but she was too distracted by her problems to remember that little detail. </p><p>Her confidence was back when I next met her gaze. She took a sip. “Much better,” she said, likely forgetting the role she was supposed to be playing. </p><p>“Good, are you ready for another question,” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she said, surprising me as she climbed the bar. “Now, let’s play a new game. How long you will be able to keep from blowing?” </p><p>I was tempted to tease her, but while her tone was confident and daring, I didn’t miss the manic quality there. Revenge might be a strong motivator, but it was also a fragile one. </p><p>So, as she climbed on top of my bar, wearing only her heeled shoes and her underwear, I chose to watch silently. Even then, a hint of panic soon appeared in her gaze, showing that she realized she was pushing it too much, but her hips ignored that as they started swaying alluringly. </p><p>Sexy. Combined with her true identity, even sexier. </p><p>As she turned her back, giving me a view of her excellent ass, I was glad she was looking the other way, so smiling widely wouldn’t hurt me. Yet, even as I turned on a sexy yet upbeat song … which, thanks to my powers, was perfect to goad her further. </p><p>She trembled as the familiar beat hit, confirming my guess about her preference. Her hips quickened, but I could see a blush spreading along her neck as well. </p><p>I let my gaze dip down her body, making sure that, when she turned toward me, she found exactly what she had been hoping for. A man who was enthralled by her beauty. I even kept my mouth slightly parted to look even more addled. </p><p>That put a smile on her face, making her feel like she was the one in control. Excellent progress.</p><p>She danced while letting out occasional gasps and moans to enhance her seductive appeal. Admittedly, she was exaggerating a bit, enough to ruin the effect if I was actually enchanted by her, but it was hardly a problem right now. </p><p>I turned down the lights, making so that only the bar lights were shining on her, which enhanced her sexiness even more. The relative darkness emboldened her even more. </p><p>Toward the end of the song, she fell on her knees, her back toward me, and I reached and flipped open her bra. That shocked her enough to make her freeze. “How about another dance?” I asked. “As long as you can handle it, of course.” </p><p>She tensed, but her answer came instantly. “Of course I can handle it,” she declared proudly as she let the bra go, letting me enjoy her naked back. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I walked out of the bar area and went toward one of the open booths, which was farther away from the bar, meaning it was even darker. “Now, why don’t you come here and meet that challenge. You said that it would be impossible for me not to explode.” </p><p>The low-light condition helped her to feel more confident, yet it didn’t impede my enjoyment any. She walked forward with beautiful confidence, her arms on her sides, each step making her breasts jump alluringly. </p><p>She arrived in front of me, her hands touching my leg, making me shiver. She was tense, but it was not the tenseness of an undercover officer, ready to lash out at the slightest danger, but the tenseness of a jilted girlfriend, having trouble believing what she was about to commit. </p><p>It only made things more interesting. </p><p>She leaned forward, putting her weight on my leg. “So…” she murmured as she closed in the distance, her lips inches away from me. </p><p>“The ball is in your court, baby,” I responded as I reached and caressed her cheek gently. As much as grabbing her naked breasts was tempting, I refrained, not wanting to push her too much. She needed to feel that she was in control, or the whole thing was ruined. </p><p>She smiled, the intensity of her desire a nice surprise. I leaned back, giving her all the space she needed. </p><p>She said nothing, but her jaw tightened as she struggled with the weight of the move she was about to commit. A half-naked lap dance was rather exaggerated as revenge, after all, and she was hesitating. </p><p>“It’s fine if you can’t handle it,” I whispered softly, just the right amount of teasing and understanding, knowing exactly how it would affect her. </p><p>She was rather easy to manipulate for a villainess, even an unknown one, but I would take what I could get. </p><p>After a growl of anger, she spun, only to sit on my lap faster than necessary, and started rubbing. A little exaggerated, but still fun. I let out a growl of frustration, like I had been just defeated, which earned a giggle from her. “You were saying…” she whispered. </p><p>“Don’t get cocky,” I warned her. </p><p>“Oh,” she giggled. “What if I want to get … cocky.” </p><p>It was a horrible pun, there was no doubt about it, but there were not a lot of things that wouldn’t have turned palatable thanks to the presence of a half-naked redhead giving me a lap dance … and a bad pun was not one of those. </p><p>I stayed silent as she rocked back and forth a few times before she stood once more, raising one of her legs to put on my seat, giving me a glimpse of her wetness, justifying my mesmerized gaze. Then, she turned her back once more, then leaned forward, tensing both her toned legs and her tight ass, putting them in excellent view while her tits dangled.</p><p>It was an interesting move, not the kind a stripper would do. It felt more like a classical move, like a ballerina … suggesting that she had classical dance training, suggesting a rich upbringing. </p><p>An interesting addition to the confusing picture she was creating. What an interesting villainess. </p><p> Her strikingly red hair lashed as she rose back, turning her naked back into a beautiful show. And, since she was wearing just a g-string, which was woefully inadequate to cover her ass, the view was incredible. </p><p>If it wasn’t for her powers, I would have grabbed and pulled her down. Instead, I watched as her body continued to sway. </p><p>“Amazing,” I whispered, unable to keep myself from cheering. </p><p>She twisted her neck just enough to glance at me, her expression smug as she received many signs of her victory. She might not be familiar with the moves of strippers, but I had to admit, that was not a negative. She was very sexy as she moved … yet she didn’t know where to stop to keep things from escalating. </p><p>And, certainly unequipped to handle her own arousal. Soon, she landed on my lap once more … and this time, she grabbed my hand to bring it against her stomach, giving me permission to touch her. </p><p>A permission I wanted to leverage to the limit. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I had left Natalie’s office, I called Mark and Charlie to my office. It wasn’t ideal, as I rather call Umi to deal with the problem of my erection, but I promised Natalie. To solve her problem, I needed to meet with Dorothy. </p><p>To meet with Dorothy, I needed to have an excuse. While I could call her for dinner after her … aggressive approach during our last meeting, it wasn’t the best idea. After all, inviting her, only to ask for help for another woman was very risky. </p><p>I needed to bait her, so that she was the one to invite me. Luckily, that wasn’t particularly difficult. I just needed to give her a business purpose. </p><p>“Your invitees are here, sir,” Umi said as she knocked on the door. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I waved Mark and Charlie in. “By the way, do you have enough outfits for a business trip?” I asked, right in front of her fiancee. He said nothing. </p><p>Another bad move on his part.  </p><p>“No, sir,” she said. </p><p>“Go for a shopping trip, and use the company card,” I said as I waved her away. Charlie said nothing again, but his expression was tense.  </p><p>“How can  we help you, sir?” Mark said. </p><p>“We have an emergency project, a new business plan. It has a very high visibility, but it needs to be ready for tomorrow morning. Can you two handle it?” </p><p>“Is the director going to participate?” Mark asked, trying to understand whether I was trying to deliver a coup. He probably heard about her problems. </p><p>“No, she has bigger problems,” I said, implicitly agreeing with his statement. He smiled smugly, like he already got a promotion. “Now, about the business plan…” I said, then outlined the model I wanted, including the general outline and the results. </p><p>“Sir, how do we get the results without running the model —” Charlie started, but Mark poked him. </p><p>“I’ll handle it, don’t worry, sir,” Mark said, silencing Charlie. “When should we revise, sir?”</p><p>“Maybe around eleven,” I offered. “We can have a call?” </p><p>“How about a late dinner, sir,” Mark said, never to miss such an opportunity. “You know the cooking of my wife.” </p><p>“A good idea,” I said. “My last trip was indeed delicious.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I sent them away. Mark was an annoying brown-nosed prick, but there was no reason to send him away. Not when he was willing to waste a lot of his time just to rise up. Classic middle-manager type, thinking that his childish strategies would bring him to the top, never realizing the game had different rules on different levels.  </p><p>As for Charlie, I pitied him. Unfortunately for him, his fiancee was more beautiful than he was pitiful, and I was not a nice man in the first place. </p><p>For the rest of the day, I dealt with some miscellaneous stuff. A few quick internal calls, and a couple remote client meetings, all to seed the arrival of Natalie’s ‘genius’ plan. Then, just as I was preparing to leave, there was a knock on the door.  </p><p>“Come in,” I called. </p><p>It was Charlie, with a stormy, almost rebellious expression on his face. At first, I thought it was about the presentation I asked for, but then I realized there was a certain vulnerability in his expression. “Sir, I must protest. It’s inappropriate,” he started.</p><p>“What’s inappropriate?” I asked. </p><p>“Buying my fiancee lingerie from the company budget,” he answered. </p><p>“I see,” I said, unable to believe that it was his complaint. Not that he was wrong, but choosing to confront me like that was absurd. He should have thought of that before he agreed to send his fiancee as a honeypot. </p><p>Of course, at that time, he didn’t understand exactly how far I would go — nor he seemed to understand it even now — but that was not an excuse.  </p><p>I decided to teach him a lesson. </p><p>I called Umi on my phone. “Come to my office in an instant,” I said. Then, I looked at Charlie, who seemed shocked at my anger. Of course, I also sent her a message, warning her about Charlie’s presence, and asking her to play along. </p><p>“Should I leave?” he asked, hesitant. </p><p>“No, you stay,” I said. We stayed silent until Umi arrived. </p><p>It was very difficult to maintain my anger when she arrived. The reason was her new outfit. She had been wearing a shorter pencil skirt with new stockings, her heels were higher, which made her legs look far better, and her new jacket wrapped her body beautifully. Altogether, the perfect secretary. </p><p>What surprised me was her cleavage. She had unbuttoned her blouse quite a bit deeper than I had expected, enough to show a glimpse of her lacy bra, which was too small to be work-appropriate. </p><p>“Umi, Charlie here came to me with a very serious accusation. He claims that you have used the shopping budget for your personal expenses,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, really,” she said as she looked at him with a stormy expression. “Did he?” </p><p>Charlie’s expression twisted. “It wasn’t my point—” he started. </p><p>“No, Charlie, don’t apologize. You’re right. Lingerie purchase is certainly outside the business purview, and needs to be punished. And, since you’re in probation period, maybe I should just let you go,” I said. </p><p>Charlie looked excited at the idea, while Umi looked at him angrily. She knew I was playing a game, but it was clearly genuine. I could see that they had already talked about it, and from what I could garner, Umi refused. </p><p>Charlie was a smart boy. Too bad it was already too late. </p><p>“Of course…” I continued, acting like I didn’t understand their silent battle. “Since you can’t return those clothes, you have to pay back all the purchases. How much is it?”</p><p>“What?” Charlie said, surprised. </p><p>“Of course, it needs to be paid back. Do you think it’s a problem?” I said. </p><p>“No, sir,” Charlie said immediately. I could see Umi’s already depleted respect draining even further.  </p><p>“Fifteen thousand, sir,” Umi said. Once again, I barely held back my chuckle. I had already received the notifications, and her purchases barely cleared three thousand. She was deliberately exaggerating to attack Charlie. </p><p>“What!” Charlie gasped as he looked at Umi, unable to believe what he had just heard. “How can you—” </p><p>“Enough, no shouting in my office,” I said. “The punishment is clear,” I said, then, looked at Umi. “You can visit accounting and deal with it.” </p><p>Umi looked at Charlie with disdain, but also with expectation. She was not aware of it, but her gaze told me that, if Charlie accepted the punishment, there was a chance to recover the situation. After all, that way, he would show her that he cared more about her than their financial situation. </p><p>Too bad Charlie didn’t recognize the opportunity, too overwhelmed by the prospect of her fiancee’s debt. “Sir, maybe you could give her another chance,” Charlie offered, likely destroying his last hope of regaining his fiancee’s loyalty. </p><p>Too bad.   </p><p>“Alright, but only if she removes the illegitimate purchases,” I said. Charlie seemed relaxed, while Umi looked confused. “Immediately, of course.” </p><p>“Sure, she can just go to the bathroom and —” Charlie started, but I interrupted. </p><p>“Here,” I interrupted.  </p><p>Charlie’s eyes widened. “I don’t believe that it’s appropriate,” Charlie started. </p><p>“Well, either that, or she can go to the accounting and start her exit process,” I dictated. </p><p>His face turned purple as he realized what I was asking, and he turned to Umi, only to see her with a mocking smile. “Well, Charlie, what would it be,” she challenged. </p><p>He said nothing, but he walked toward the door. “No, stay,” I ordered, which surprised both. “After all, you need to stay here to make sure there’s nothing problematic going on.” </p><p>“I …” he said but he still stopped, which ruined the last remains of his respect. Umi reached under her skirt and pushed her panties down, sliding off her legs. Then, she turned her back to Charlie, and faced me while she unbuttoned her blouse more before she pulled off her black bra, giving me a glimpse of her bra in the process. </p><p>The silence was broken by her heel as she walked toward my desk, and put them on my desk. “Anything else, sir,” she whispered throatily.</p><p>Keeping her here was a fun idea, but I had a better plan.  </p><p>“No, you can leave,” I said with a smile. “But, make sure to come to join the meeting tonight. I need you to take meeting minutes.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said, her hips dancing as she walked out. </p><p>Charlie followed, his expression desolate. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I swung by the palace grounds before leaving the capital. The Spring Palace was under tight guard, but these security measures didn’t apply to the rest of the palace, allowing me to sneak in. After making sure Aisnam was not in immediate danger, I left the capital and started to run toward Markas. </p><p>The trip from Markas to the capital required three days of intense effort from me. </p><p>I expected the return trip to last about a full day. It was partially about my cultivation. Now that I was at the Second Realm of Qi Gathering, my body improved significantly. Also, I had broken through the Mid-Level Skin Refinement, which increased the efficiency of my Martial Arts significantly, including the movement art I had developed for myself. </p><p>The only problem, no matter how much I practiced, I was never able to push through the Perfection. Clearly, there was some kind of component missing to allow that to reach the next stage, still lacking a matching essence. That much was clear with my experience with Forest Dance, which broke through the limits the moment I copied the feeling on the board of the Spring Palace. </p><p>I needed an essence for my sprinting art as well. </p><p>Technically, as I waded through a horde of savage beasts — and they were certainly crowded, though I was able to avoid them with my speed — I had a lot of options. The other arts I learned like Tiger Fist and the others had been copied based on savage beasts as well. As for the Black Tiger, I had no idea exactly what kind of beast it was, but I suspected it was something greater than a savage beast. </p><p>It was tempting to find such a beast, but since I didn’t have the luxury of going on a lengthy sabbatical, I started searching for an appropriate savage beast. </p><p>For another martial artist, such a move would have likely required a lifetime of dedication. Creating a new set of martial arts was not easy. However, with my talent and the extensive martial knowledge I managed to accumulate through my unorthodox means, it was much easier for me. </p><p>Too bad martial cultivation had its limits. Not only it was clearly weaker than the same level of true cultivation, but also it had a clear peak, which even the System counted as the equivalent of the Seventh Realm of Qi Gathering. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t plan to stop working on it. Martial techniques were still valuable for me. Not only did I use the Essence to keep my true cultivation hidden, but also it gave me many tricks that I couldn’t replicate by using Qi. </p><p>Not to mention, I didn’t have the ability to replenish my Qi without an Immortal Root to facilitate it, meaning, I couldn’t use those techniques easily. </p><p>Altogether, neglecting my martial capabilities was not a luxury I had. So, at the risk of delaying my arrival a little more, I started observing the various savage beasts, trying to find an appropriate target. The first target that tempted me was a wild wolf, larger than a bear as it chased after some kind of deer. It was fast and elegant, and it would have allowed me to break into Minor Immersion. </p><p>Yet, it didn’t feel right. It was too strong, too aggressive, which would mean the essence would be tainted by its nature. Not exactly ideal for an endless run. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my experience with the Black Tiger Onslaught, I might have ignored that detail. But, since practicing that had impacted my mind to such an intense degree, it made me question whether the other martial arts had the same problem. </p><p>Maybe not immediately, but what about after weeks of nonstop usage. It wasn’t too big of a problem for the other styles, as those were used rarely. Unfortunately, with the way things stood, I had to use the movement techniques for weeks and months, and the closer the mentality of a beast, the better.</p><p>For once, it wasn’t supposed to be a predator, with pesky killing instincts. A great deer with impressive antlers was tempting, but they were too territorial and aggressive. </p><p>Then, I saw several wolves chasing a little, brown-furred animal. A savage beast rabbit, took sharp turns as he avoided the chase before he jumped into a borrow, and while the wolves were desperately trying to dig him out, he jumped out of another one. </p><p>Fast, crafty, and cunning, surrounded by far more dangerous entities yet creating a living space for himself … it was truly the perfect choice. I spent the next hour observing him and the other rabbits I came across, a unique essence taking shape, my movement getting faster and faster…</p><p>Then, a familiar glow surrounded me, marking my arrival at Minor Immersion. </p><p>“Excellent,” I gleefully declared as I started running, each step consuming less essence yet bringing me to a greater distance. My speed almost doubled, reducing the travel time between the two locations even more. </p><p>A very important benefit for my larger plans. With the savage beasts crowding the road, they didn’t have a lot of trade channels. The local forces didn’t have enough to consume all that Markas was producing. Elsana was a good apothecary, but unlike my cheating self, she had to work hard to contain and prevent the side effects of her cold essence, meaning the amount she could refine every day was limited. </p><p>And, she was by far the best apothecary in the city. Unless they managed to recruit some new apothecaries — unlikely considering the political situation — they would have an excess of materials, and they would be willing to trade for pills. </p><p>While the System also provided me superior materials, it was surprisingly difficult to get people to gift me with a lot of materials without any expectation. With the right role, I could get enough to support myself and a few Connate Realm fighters, but more would have been troubling. The garden of the Spring Palace had been helpful in bridging the gap, but it had been a temporary measure for me. </p><p>I needed a reliable channel, and Markas provided me one. </p><p>Seeing Elsana again was a nice bonus as well. </p><p>However, once I passed the wilderness and reached the city, I realized the situation was even worse than I expected. The outer border had many outposts that worked as staging grounds for hunter teams and caravans. Some of them had been destroyed, but most of them had been simply abandoned. </p><p>Villages were similarly empty, but the farther away from the border, the more orderly they looked. Clearly, the evacuation had been organized well. However, not for nothing, as there had been quite a few savage beasts in the territory. </p><p>They weren’t enough to threaten soldiers or hunter teams, but they were cunning enough to avoid the armed people and target the weak, therefore, keeping the villagers safe was impossible. So, they abandoned their farms and migrated … probably to the city itself. </p><p>I traveled for a while more, once I was about ten miles away from the city, I started to meet with the hunter teams, most returning from the hunt, carrying savage beast carcasses with them. One benefit of the sudden increase of savage beasts, finding them was much easier. </p><p>The teams were more than usual, usually consisting of twenty people or more, but their cultivation was lower. Mostly Beginner and Intermediate Initiates, with occasional Peak initiates leading the teams. Some teams were mixed, but most of the teams were either Wolf Fang or Crane Kick. </p><p>However, while their cultivation was low, their competency was even lower. They weren’t particularly talented in the first place, and they clearly didn’t have too much time to work. </p><p>I changed to look like a lone hunter who had drifted away from the crowd. Markas had already changed too much, and I didn’t want to take the risk. As I got closer, I finally started to come across military patrols, but their status wasn’t much better. Their cultivation was low, and their weapons were shabby. </p><p>The city itself had changed even more. There had been some small towns around the city, but after the migration of the villagers, those grew large enough to count as a second city, wrapping the first one. “What a mess,” I said as I moved forward, examining the slums. </p><p>Even from a distance, I could see it was a true mess. People fighting, begging, and extorting … there were some city guards patrolling, but considering that the patrolling city guards were all wounded, they were even less effective than they would have been otherwise. </p><p>A true mess. Even though it was not a problem. I didn’t even consider whether I should her or not, because there was a simple thing … I wasn’t strong enough to intervene openly either way. </p><p>The memory of a cultivator, strong enough to destroy the city alone if he wished to was more than enough to teach me that lesson. Whatever that was going on in Markas involved two cultivator sects, it was not something that I could poke my nose thoughtlessly without strength. </p><p>The only reason I even dared to return was the confidence that such strong cultivators wouldn’t be hanging around a mere ordinary city for a long time, meaning, unless I acted too openly, I wouldn’t have been in danger. </p><p>Unlike the newly developed slums, the city proper was still in decent condition, with a lot of guards on the walls. However, unlike in the past, people couldn’t get in just by paying a fee. Only the residents were allowed in. </p><p>Luckily, bypassing the security was not a challenge for me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“ … Incredible training session, madam,” I said as we collapsed as a sweaty mess once again. </p><p>It had truly been an incredible session, as attested by my System, as a flood of familiar writing appeared in my view. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - 2 Qi Strands]</p><p>It had been a month since that fateful day when she had decided to escalate things to a stage that was wholly inappropriate for a Queen, particularly considering the King was still alive, but once she learned about just how fun … physical exercising … could be, she initiated one whenever she had the chance. </p><p> I wasn’t complaining, as even without the details that made the situation spicy, she was a beautiful woman, and sharing her bed — and many other rooms of the Spring Palace — was not exactly a great hardship. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same couldn’t be said about the other benefits. It didn’t take long for me to realize that, her cultivation knowledge had been very limited. It seemed that her cultivation knowledge was limited to the things I had already learned from her. </p><p>The meditation technique, gate-building technique, the palm attack, the talisman drawing technique, and the three talisman designs that I couldn’t draw because I didn’t have the materials. </p><p>She didn’t have a lot of cultivation techniques. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean the System turned useless. First, every single skill had reached Minor Immersion, which enhanced their impact and effectiveness significantly. Also, whenever she had an orgasm, she lost control of her Qi for a moment, which allowed a tiny amount to be absorbed by me. </p><p>It turned into a great benefit when the System multiplied it. My Inventory was currently holding over a hundred strands, and that was after I had used several to reinforce my cultivation.</p><p>It meant that, finally, I had insurance if I faced a dangerous situation. With the gate construction technique at Minor Immersion, and with a lot of ready Qi, I could force a breakthrough in seconds if I needed to. </p><p>Of course, while I wasn’t complaining about my extended stay, that didn’t mean I made a deliberate choice for it. The army was still outside, determined to follow the wishes of the strange cultivator and keep the Queen safe for three months. </p><p>I was certainly hoisted by my own petard there. </p><p>It wasn’t even I wanted to leave her alone to face her distress. As long as she was willing to leave with me, I had no problem helping her. But, lacking the ability to go back and forth was creating some serious problems. </p><p>I could probably escape from them, but getting away without being noticed was a different challenge. </p><p>While I was thinking that, I noticed that she had already dressed, and her expression turned serious, as if she had just come to a decision. “What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“My Queen has a deal for you,” she said as she passed me a token and a letter. “She needs a trusted agent to go to a healer to pick a very important medicine for her,” she explained. “And, if you give them the token, they will also heal your martial arts. They will know what to do when they read the letter.” </p><p>“As long as you want me, I’ll do it,” I said, happy with the opportunity. I had been already thinking about my ‘incurable’ problem. It was helpful back when I was trying to disguise myself as a servant, but at this point, it was more of a hindrance. </p><p>But, my good mood changed when she pulled a map and explained how I could visit that healer. It was in another kingdom, with a great stretch of wilderness in between, making solo travel practically impossible for anyone who was as strong as she believed me to be. </p><p>And, a round trip took almost six months with a caravan. </p><p>She didn’t want my help. She was trying to make sure I didn’t get caught in the crossfire. </p><p>Still, I played along. Ultimately, at this point, I could help her more from the outside. “But, how am I going to leave?” I asked, acting like I didn’t understand what she meant, since I wasn’t supposed to know about the deadline. </p><p>“There’s a tunnel,” she said. “The cursed Qi is dense there, but she prepared another talisman for you. I’m going to activate it, and as long as you run fast, you can avoid the danger before its duration ends.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I stood up, but rather than walking away, I leaned to kiss her. </p><p>*** </p><p>That kiss triggered several other activities, delaying my departure for another day, but ultimately, I found myself walking through a dark tunnel, ignoring the presence of a stone wall an ancient feeling. </p><p>The cursed Qi was much thicker on those walls, showing that it had other purposes than just punishment, but I decided to follow her suggestion and avoid the gates. Instead, I followed a relatively new tunnel that led outside the city, opening to a cave. </p><p>It also made me feel safer about her security. She already had an emergency escape … which, as an added benefit, gave me a way to infiltrate the palace once the intense security measures around the Spring Palace had been lifted. </p><p>I opened the sealed letter she had given to me, reading the contents. It was a lengthy, very formal letter, but it basically asked that, for the favor she had been owed, she asked them to heal the bearer of the letter of his afflictions. There was no mention of any medicine for her, which wasn’t a surprise. </p><p>The biggest benefit, she had signed it with her name. </p><p>Aisnam. </p><p>I chuckled, amused by the irony that, after spending all that time together, I had to open a letter of hers to learn her name. </p><p>As I went back to the capital, I found Pearyin preparing herself dinner. “Is there enough for me as well, I’m famished,” I said, once again scaring her with my entrance. </p><p>This time, rather than jumping in fear, she turned toward me, ready to defend herself rather than flinching in fear. </p><p>She was getting better. </p><p>Yet, the moment she saw me, her expression turned into glee. A little too intense, if I had to admit. If I was still on Earth, I would have done my best to get away, muttering about crazy clingy chicks … but this new world was crazy enough that her craziness didn’t even register. </p><p>Instead, I gestured for her to walk closer, and she dashed, kissing me passionately. “Did you miss me?” I said once she pulled back. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said, blushing thickly. I grabbed her waist … and took a break with her. Then, after a long bath, we were eating. At the same time, she gave me a detailed breakdown of the world outside. </p><p>She started with the troubles in Markas. Apparently, their savage beast problem reached a point where they were practically separated from the rest of the kingdom. Even with the higher profit potential, not many caravans dared to travel there, isolating them. </p><p>But, there was no military response to fix it, making it an interesting situation. </p><p>“The apothecary business is going well. I only sold a limited number of pills as you requested, but still, we’re selling them quickly at that price.” </p><p>“How about purchasing the herbs and other materials?” I asked. </p><p>She blushed. “On that, I failed, master,” she said, her face filled with shame. “Even when I offered more, they weren’t willing to sell anything but the most common ones,” she said. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said. Ultimately, I wasn’t too surprised. Higher-grade pills for martial artists were a huge business, the kind that people would kill for. “Tell me, has anyone dared to attack the place?” </p><p>“Just a few thieves, but they were weaklings. I just killed them,” she said proudly, which made me freeze for a moment. I was still not used to a casual attitude toward killing. </p><p>I wasn’t sure I wanted to. </p><p>“They were probably not just thieves, but also sent to probe you,” I explained. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, surprised. </p><p>“Of course, do you really think that they will allow anyone to do business,” I said. “It’s only your cultivation, combined with the fact that the pills we sell are not above Muscle Reinforcement Realm, that kept you safe,” I explained. She blushed, realizing that she might have made a mistake. “Don’t worry about it, everyone makes mistakes. Just learn from them. You’re going to be very busy once we start selling real pills,” I said. </p><p>I wanted to expand the operation for two reasons. A skilled apothecary had the right to be properly invited to the palace, which would help me to understand the truth behind Aisnam’s plight. Also, I wouldn’t mind the excuse to hire a few potentially loyal martial artists and send them across the cities.</p><p>I couldn’t skulk around gambling dens hoping to come across something useful. That way, sooner or later, I would end up on the wrong side of a cultivator’s blade. </p><p>“But, we don’t have the necessary herbs,” she said. </p><p>“Don’t worry about that. I have a plan for that,” I answered. </p><p>After all, I still had a softhearted Connate realm martial artist who owed me. </p><p>It was time to collect it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t say anything as I let myself enjoy the beauty of the Queen under me. </p><p>“I … I didn’t expect you to be a wild young man, sating your lust on a poor maid,” she whispered throatily as I touched her chin gently. “But … if that’s what I needed to do protect my Queen.” </p><p>“Well, I’m sure she would have appreciated it if she heard it,” I said with a playful smirk. I couldn’t help it, the fact that she was so committed to acting like she was her own maid was too funny … but in a way that didn’t detract even a bit from her beauty. </p><p>And, since she wanted to play the reluctant maid, I decided to oblige. I grabbed her large, conservative robe, and ripped it off aggressively. Yet, the moment I did so, my eyes widened. </p><p>I didn’t expect her to be completely naked underneath. “Naughty maid,” I whispered, enjoying the smug expression on Queen’s face. “Now, let’s start. You have to work hard to keep your precious Queen safe from my naughty hands,” I said. </p><p>“Like you dare to touch her exalted self,” she whispered back. I could see her barely holding back a chuckle. I had to admit, her disguise made the situation rather amusing. But, as much as the discussion was entertaining, it wasn’t as alluring as her beautiful body. Another shuffle, and her body had been freed from the presence of her robe, giving me a better alternative than her amusing anecdotes. </p><p>I leaned forward slowly, still grabbing both hands with one of mine, still maintaining the illusion that I was the one who made the decision and not her. </p><p>It was a soft, gentle kiss, at least at first, giving her a chance to adapt. She was hesitant at first, but I maintained contact as my lips slowly moved, trying to coax her to move. </p><p>I expected a gentle, awkward response, so I was surprised when her aura suddenly changed, and her tongue darted out to invade my mouth. More importantly, her legs wrapped around my waist tightly. Nothing I couldn’t push out, but enough to destroy the game of reluctant maid. </p><p>I used my free hand to push my pants down, and she shuffled a bit … and took me in. Her reaction as she did so led me to believe that it had been very long since she had someone to share her bed … well, dining table. </p><p>With that, I let her hands go, and instead focused on moving steadily, my lips still on hers. I could feel her heartbeat going crazy with excitement as I moved at a steady pace, each push pushing her for a quick climax. </p><p>Too quick, making me suspect that she not only went through a long dry spell, but also didn’t believe in masturbation. Entertaining. </p><p>It was time to push the envelope a bit, I decided as I gently grabbed her face but pulled back from the kiss. “You’re beautiful,” I whispered as I started kissing her neck gently, but with each kiss, my hips quickened. </p><p>She didn’t answer, just moaned as the pleasure overwhelmed her mind, each second pushing her closer to a climax. Until, at one point, she started trembling helplessly, arriving at a quick climax. </p><p>Being deprived of the pleasures of the flesh for such a long time was not a simple issue. </p><p>“W-what’s this,” she whispered, clearly shocked. </p><p>“That, madam, is an orgasm,” I said, though I couldn’t help but look surprised. She was not a young girl, and she was not a virgin either. The fact that a beautiful and fascinating woman like her didn’t even know what an orgasm was was truly a shame. </p><p>The King certainly deserved his horns. </p><p>“That’s —” she started, but I silenced her for a kiss. I could explain what an orgasm was, or I could show her again. </p><p>I didn’t stop even for a moment, for multiple reasons. With her cultivation, she could handle a little climax easily enough. Even as I continued to impale her, I let my lips move lower, capturing her nipples. Her breasts were not particularly huge, but that took nothing from their perfection. </p><p>Especially with her perfect nipples hardening even further between my lips. I couldn’t help but moan as she recovered slightly, only for her legs to tighten around my body and pull me deeper inside. </p><p>She was already beautiful, but she looked spectacular after her climax. I moved back and forth while she moaned in pure ecstasy, putting our isolation to best use. </p><p>I climbed to the table with her, pinning her under me. One advantage of the opulence of the palace, the table was large enough to give us plenty of playing field … for the future. For the moment, I kept her pinned under me, enjoying her submissiveness. </p><p>I had a feeling that, it was a once-in-a-lifetime deal. </p><p>When she received another climax, I pulled back. “Show me your beautiful body,” I ordered, enjoying the benefits. She followed it, and shifted to sitting position, her arms keeping her trembling body in place. I gaped as I enjoyed her beauty, her skin covered with a beautiful sheen of sweat. </p><p>Even with the veil, I had known that she was a beautiful woman, but it was nothing compared to the current sight, with her hair spilling down to her shoulders the only thing blocking her naked skin — and not doing a good job of it. Her chest heaved, pushing her chest up to a more alluring position, her legs trembled as they gathered, hiding her entrance from my view. </p><p>“Open your legs,” I ordered. She followed, but I caught her hesitancy … signaling that, even under these beautiful circumstances, her submissiveness had limits. </p><p>I aborted the other teasing I had been planning as I put my head between her legs, and started licking her beautiful folds. “What are you —” she started, once again surprised, which didn’t surprise me the slightest. After her lack of knowledge about what an orgasm was, it hadn’t been particularly shocking. </p><p>It wasn’t the culture, as Elsana had been very enthusiastic about that. </p><p>I grabbed her ass tighter as I licked her wetness quickly, though I didn’t miss the irony of eating her out on top of a dining table. </p><p>She gasped at the intensity of my naughty kisses and at the abrupt manner in which they started. She tensed for a bit, but then she slackened, letting me do what I wanted while her moans rose higher. I knew exactly what I was doing, and it showed. Her moans filled the room … and she climaxed again. </p><p>“You look tired, madam. Let’s bring you to a bed,” I said. She looked like she was about to argue, but before she could catch her breath enough to say anything, I pushed inside her while I grabbed her waist, carrying her to the bed in a very unusual manner. </p><p>Our tongues battled once more as I carried her to my room. Whenever I pulled back from the kiss, her moans rose higher. And, with every step, her weight pushed down, allowing me to reach even deeper into her. Before we reached the bed, she experienced another orgasm. </p><p>She was gushing with pleasure intense enough to send a lesser woman into comatose, yet she hung on as I buried her in my bed while drilling. </p><p>I had a feeling that she would be even more demanding after she had received a taste …</p><p>But I was ready for the challenge. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I thought about going to the Queen and informing her about what had just happened, but I stayed below. Ultimately, I didn’t know what to say. I wasn’t supposed to go out, and the events happened reasonably away that I shouldn’t have seen anything with my abilities. </p><p>Instead, I stayed in the garden, testing the limits of the Second Realm of Qi Gathering stage. The passive improvement alone had been fascinating enough. I was faster, stronger, with sharper senses. More importantly, in a manner similar to Muscle Reinforcement, I had the ability to push Qi out of my body. The range was limited, and effectiveness even less so. </p><p>The difference between trying to use Essence and Qi was incredible. Using my essence felt like breathing, a momentary meditation all I needed to come up with a new technique or modify an existing one. Unfortunately, the same smoothness didn’t apply to Qi. I could use a palm attack perfectly, but only by the way the technique was described. The underlying mechanics were still a mystery. </p><p>Luckily, reaching Perfection meant it was very strong. </p><p>After some practice, I went back into the palace, afraid of being noticed by the Queen. I didn’t take that risk just to reveal what had happened. </p><p>Instead, I went to my room. After breakfast, we had another maddening training session where she teased me the whole time. Maddening, but I had to play the shy genius. She enjoyed flirting, but she wasn’t ready to move further. </p><p>Since I wasn’t a moron, I didn’t question her about that. </p><p>I had a bigger problem to deal with. The multiplier had once again dropped down further. When she had broken to the Peak of Bone Refinement, the multiplier had risen to forty, and now, it was back to thirty. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pampering Bonus - 45 (Capped)]</p><p>[85x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique Lesson, Minor Immersion]</p><p>[85x Return - Thousand Petals Gate Transformation Technique - Perfection]</p><p>[85x Return - Verdant Brush Talisman Technique Lesson, Perfection]</p><p>[85x Return - Palm of Verdant Cleansing - Perfection]</p><p>Still, it was not all bad. At least, thanks to all my previous experiences, I had a better comparison between different stages. </p><p>Initiate counted as mortal, Peak Muscle Reinforcement was equal to First Realm Qi Gathering, while Peak Skin Refinement counted as Third Realm, and Peak Bone Refinement was Fifth Realm. Beginner Connate Realm counted as six, so I expected the Peak to be somewhere between six and seven. </p><p>And, apparently, every minor realm was counted as ten points in terms of return. </p><p>An interesting equation, because from what I had seen, True cultivation was far stronger than martial cultivation at supposedly equal levels. It was a weird equivalency, but I didn’t waste much time on it. Instead, the moment the Queen went upstairs to cultivate, I broke through in my martial cultivation as well. </p><p>Reaching Intermediate Skin Refinement Realm. </p><p>I doubted that any cultivator — who wasn’t dealing with an illness — would have done the same thing. But, I had several reasons for doing so. First, with my martial talent, the abilities given to me by my martial cultivation weren’t negligible, particularly since I could easily create my own techniques. My sprinting technique alone was an incredible edge. </p><p>Second, unlike the other cultivators, I didn’t easily gather environmental Qi, because I didn’t have an Immortal Root to purify it. That meant, I could fight in Qi-rich environments, especially if I had some time to waste, but without environmental Qi, I had to dip into my valuable storage. </p><p>Then, there were the apothecary abilities. The thing that had been holding me back the most was the weakness of my essence. Now that I was at the Intermediate Skin Refinement Realm, I could refine stronger pills. </p><p>Which, in turn, could be used to push the Queen into the Connate realm, once again increasing the return I collected. </p><p>Once the Queen went upstairs, I took the risk of leaving the Spring Palace. First, I walked around the wider palace grounds, but my decision to leave had to be aborted. Unlike the previous visit, the Spring Palace was surrounded by guards. More importantly, their martial cultivation was much higher. </p><p>At first, I thought that they wanted to take revenge on the mysterious cultivator, but it didn’t take long for me to realize their attention was turned outward. </p><p>It looked like my warning had been even more effective. That meant I couldn’t easily visit Pearyin and use the workshop. Luckily, the garden had all the materials I could use, and I could always use one of the cauldrons in the palace. </p><p>There were several good cauldrons and other equipment in the storage room. Being rich was certainly a privilege. </p><p>I made sure to seal the kitchen as tightly as I manage, and even started by refining a smell eraser. Then, I spent the rest of the night refining. Even with my new cultivation, refining essence pills strong enough for Peak Bone Forging Realm was a time-consuming affair, but when the morning arrived, I was still refined enough to help her break through. </p><p>Now, I just needed to hope that she wouldn’t suspect my trick … which was rather simple. I stayed in my bedroom, not waking up like someone had knocked me out, while I left the pills and the cauldron on the desk. </p><p>And, I used my improved Calligraphy to write a small note that showed my full abilities, writing an elaborate, sarcastic message about delayed pill deliveries. I even infused a minuscule amount of Qi into the writing by bastardizing the Talisman-making technique, creating even more reason for her not to believe that the mysterious party that taught her the cultivation. </p><p>When she knocked on the door, I woke up groggily. “Are you alright?” she asked when she saw me exhausted — mostly exaggerated. </p><p>“Yes. It was just a weird nightmare. I feel tired, madam,” I said. </p><p>“Really, what kind of nightmare,” she asked, unable to hide her panic. It was understandable under the current circumstances of a mysterious visitor. </p><p>“I saw myself waking up in the middle of the night, following a weird smell,” I said. “Then, I walked the same corridor, and found myself in the kitchen … but there was an old man there. He said that it was past my bedtime, waved his hand … and that was it,” I added, acting confused. “That was it, but for some reason, I felt like I was about to die.” </p><p>“I see,” she said, my choppy acting convincing enough combined with the evidence. “Did he say anything else?” </p><p>“No … wait, he did,” I said. “Just as I faded, he said something about protection only lasting three more months, and not to be there when it was over,” I said. It was a good chance to inform the Queen about the deadline. </p><p>She knew it better than me whether her problems could be solved — or even alleviated — by reaching Connate Realm. I didn’t expect her to have any problem reaching that realm, as during our heavy flirting, I had used my Essence Massage subtly to strengthen her cultivation so that she could step into the Connate Realm smoothly. </p><p>Hopefully, that wouldn’t be enough to change her mind about the situation. </p><p>“Since you had a tough night, let’s skip the training for today,” she said. “Come, let’s enjoy our breakfast.” </p><p>“Thank you, madam,” I said as I followed her to the dining room, the servant already delivered the food earlier. Though, I was interested in her reaction, I expected her to start cultivating immediately. Maybe she had a different plan. </p><p>Her hips swayed playfully as always, but since this time she was wearing her robes rather than her exercise clothing, it didn’t look as alluring as usual. So, when she added an extra sway to her steps, I assumed that she was trying to compensate for it. </p><p>Then, when we arrived at the dining room, and when I took my usual seat. Yet, rather than going there, she started rubbing my shoulders. “Madam?” I whispered, not bothering to hide my hopeful tone. </p><p>“You’re still tense after that nightmare, it’ll help,” she said, her tone soft and inviting, her fingers exploratory. She didn’t take that step, but I recognized an invite when I heard one. </p><p>Interestingly, she didn’t push any further. I wondered what was holding her back: her misplaced sense of loyalty to the King, her higher social status as a Queen and a cultivator, or plain shyness…</p><p>Though, ultimately, it didn’t matter. She was giving me all the signs I needed. I grabbed her waist quickly — but not quickly enough that she couldn’t have stopped if she wished — and flipped her against the table, pinning her hands down. A domineering move, but considering she was at the Peak of Bone Forging, hardly forceful. </p><p>“What if I need something stronger to distract me from my woes, madam?” I asked. </p><p>She said nothing then … or when I pulled her veil, finally drinking the sight of her beautiful face. </p><p>Or, when I started kissing her. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I noticed a movement outside the window in the dark of the night, I realized that, once again, my little comfortable bubble was about to be destroyed. </p><p>Again. </p><p>Two more weeks passed since the Queen decided that a little closeness was helpful when it came to training. It was as fun as it was torturous, particularly since the Queen was satisfied with teasing me while receiving my endless massages while faking incompetence.</p><p>Our schedule was settled. We spent most of the day in the training room, and the nights, she spent alone upstairs, resting and cultivating.   </p><p>Spending my whole way caressing her body without moving forward was a special torture of its own, but it was better than working in the garden the whole day. </p><p>Also, there was no arguing about the benefits, especially after she broke through to reach Peak Bone Forging, increasing the multiplier further. It was why, when I managed to trick her into giving me another blast of pure Qi by faking some kind of overflow from the basement, the reward had been incredible. I currently have 35 strands of Qi in my inventory, ready to be used. </p><p>Maybe it was her usual habit, or maybe it was an effect of her isolation, but whenever she got distracted by my message, she focused on her teasing, and started caring less about the questions I asked. </p><p>Well, to her they might be inconsequential, but to me, they were nothing less than a treasure. </p><p>The biggest benefit I received was the Thousand Petals Meditation Technique, finally reaching Minor Immersion, which I only dared to activate after sneaking out of the palace one night, outside the capital. The Major Immersion was still sitting in my inventory. </p><p>I didn’t dare to use it. </p><p>Though, while that was the biggest benefit, it was far from the only one. My talisman technique reached Perfection, while my calligraphy reached Minor Immersion to support it. At this moment, I was far better than her in creating talismans, which was an amusing detail. </p><p>I also managed to learn two more talismans, protection, and purification, in addition to cleansing, increasing the number to three. Unfortunately, I still lacked the materials for it. </p><p>Apparently, it required a lot of special stuff, brushes, ink, paper, and many supporting stuff. I wasn’t able to convince her to give me that. </p><p>Yet, the biggest benefits were the gate transformation technique and the palm technique I received, both already at Perfection. The gate transformation technique was a fundamental way of transforming my gates to hasten the cultivation speed. I wasn’t planning to actually use it, but having that information resolved a lot of questions for me. </p><p>At least, I knew the rough process of transforming and reinforcing the gates. A lot of the techniques focused on how to minimize the subdued Qi that was required to support the gates. </p><p>I was tempted to do the opposite, as my System clearly didn’t care about the impact, and just the realm. </p><p>Palm of Verdant Cleansing was a cultivation attack technique, one that finally taught me why cultivators were that scary. Even at Qi-2, which was the lowest realm required to use that technique, a cultivator could kill a Connate realm artist. </p><p>That cultivator would be wiped out otherwise, requiring several days of rest to refill their dantian, but it was still devastating. And, according to the Queen, that was just a basic technique, the kind that was taught to the disciples with little potential. </p><p>With it finally reaching Perfection, I felt confident.  </p><p>Confident enough to confront the party that had just passed through the gate. A team of six martial artists, each dressed in black. </p><p>The Queen was upstairs, cultivating. I went out, disguising myself with a simple cloak as I approached them. “We have to be fast. Hit fast, destroy the protections, and retreat,” someone reminded from the center of the formation as they moved. </p><p>They were clearly aware of what was going on. </p><p>I decided that the intimidation was the way to go. </p><p>“But first, it’s time to finally let my cultivation rise,” I said. I had been delaying opening my first gate for a while, afraid of losing multipliers, but taking some risk was necessary. I couldn’t face a Connate Realm cultivator without it. Though, even with it, it would be a challenge. </p><p> The Qi Gathering first realm was too restrictive in terms of using power. I pulled another strand from my Inventory, and channeled it to my first closed gate. It devoured. I pulled another strand. It devoured again … only after consuming ten of them, some kind of buildup happened. </p><p>One imaginary slam, and the bottleneck shattered. The gate devoured my Qi greedily, and a link between the gate and dantian built up.  </p><p>My first meridian. </p><p>I pulled two more strands, nourishing both my dantian and my gate to be stronger, allowing them to hold and manipulate Qi easily. Previously, my dantian could barely hold the Qi equivalent of one strand, and after the breakthrough, it almost doubled. Nourishing it further increased its capability some more.  </p><p>Just like that, I was stronger, though it cost quite a bit. Still, it allowed me to manipulate Qi better, so it was a correct tradeoff. </p><p>I appeared on their path … ready to use the Palm of Verdant Cleansing for the first time. Technically, I  shouldn’t be able to use it, as I hadn’t opened my first gate, and therefore couldn’t push my Qi out. </p><p>But, the Thousand Petals Meditation Technique provided an incredible benefit there. It was designed to slowly gather Qi motes to activate the technique, therefore it shouldn’t have any battle application. But, after it reached Minor Immersion, it allowed me to manipulate Qi motes around me very well. </p><p>As long as I was in a Qi-rich environment, I could gather Qi around me, and replicate the technique with a lesser effectiveness. The only drawback, I had to stand still for a while. </p><p>It was perfect for the current circumstances. I still had Qi strands I could use for cultivation for emergencies. </p><p>“Stop,” I said as I appeared on their path, not letting them approach the palace. </p><p>“Who are you—” one started, but I was already prepared to move. I waved my hand, and a palm print appeared in front of me, black and crackling, and slammed against him. “C-cultivator,” he gasped in fear. </p><p>They looked afraid, but the old man at the center of the formation still looked defiant. “Great Immortal. It’s a business of the royal family. Is it appropriate for you to involve yourself with the business of  Kartpa Valley —” he started, name-dropping a familiar one. The same name as that man who attacked the city lord’s manor back in Markas. </p><p>I remembered the rumors of some other cultivators getting involved to force the Queen to give up several protective items before forcing her to the Spring Palace. Apparently, it was not a rumor. </p><p>Did I want to get involved with the other cultivators? Not particularly, but I wanted to lose my only reliable source for cultivation knowledge even less. So, I decided to bluff. </p><p>“I don’t care,” I said as I waved my hand again, and a palm strike flew toward the old martial artist. He dodged, too fast to be anything but a Connate realm one. He didn’t dare to attack, looking shocked. I attacked again, still looking lazy, but this time, I used four attacks at the same time. </p><p>None of them were strong enough to kill someone, but it was still enough to scare them. The density of cursed Qi around me dropped significantly. </p><p>“Great Immortal—” he started.</p><p>“Shut up,” I said even as I decided to take some risk, using her famous lost brother. I didn’t want to declare war against them completely, afraid of stronger cultivator intervention, but delaying tactic should be useful. “I made a promise to her brother. No one could attack her … for three months,” I said, carefully watching his expression.  </p><p>It was a blind bluff. I would have loved to send them away completely, but I was afraid that it would get the cultivators behind them annoyed. I was betting that, by giving a time limit, it would be convincing enough. </p><p>“Three months,” he said, relaxed. “It would be my honor to follow the orders of the Great Immortal. No one would attack here for three months.” </p><p>“Good, but I still need to make sure it sticks,” I said, then used the Qi cyclone around me to raise the dust from the ground, and while the view was blocked, I dashed forward. I used my martial movement art. I couldn’t have won against a connate realm artist, but when I moved, their reaction was to scatter. </p><p>I caught up with the old man and put my hand on his back. Destroying his cultivation with essence would have been hard. </p><p>The abundant cursed Qi, on the other hand, made it instantaneous. I channeled it to his core, damaging his lifetime of effort. I didn’t expect him to attack, but I was still ready to activate a strand of Qi just in case.  </p><p>Destroying his cultivation was not a nice thing. </p><p>But then, neither was trying to assassinate a Queen indirectly through cursed Qi. </p><p>I watched them run away, wondering if my show would be enough. Still, I didn’t return to the palace immediately. First, I walked toward the palace door … before I disappeared under the bushes and crawled back. </p><p>Not a move fitting for an immortal. Hopefully, they would believe that I had just disappeared like the other cultivators I had observed. </p><p>I returned to the palace. The Queen was unaware of the commotion. </p><p>Still, my declaration just put on a clock in our presence. I needed to leave this place in three months. Ideally, after making sure the Queen had the ability to keep her safe. Connate realms was easy … but I had a feeling that it wouldn’t be enough. </p><p>Maybe I should see if I could find a way to heal her. Things would be much easier if she could actually recover her previous cultivation. At Fifth Realm of Qi Gathering, she would have the chance to defend herself … not to mention, the potential higher multipliers. </p><p>But, for that, I needed more information than she could provide. An interesting dilemma. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I’m pretty boring, I’m afraid,” she said with a flirty tone as she threw her hair back, leaning forward to further enhance her cleavage. She took another sip of her drink. </p><p>I made a point of looking into her cleavage. “Oh, I sincerely doubt that,” I answered, and she shivered. It was an exaggerated, obvious move, which was also fake. I had to struggle to hold my chuckle. The irony was beautiful. </p><p>I wished that I still didn’t have a horrible headache and could afford to push my power without delaying my recovery further, but I did not. After confirming that she had no intention of using powers against me tonight, I decided to play it slow. </p><p>After all, she was here with a seduction ploy, which was equally slow-paced. There was no hurry. </p><p>“Really? Then I’ll disappoint you,” she answered. </p><p>“Well, how about if we make it interesting,” I said, letting my tone darken even more, letting it suggest far more than my tone. </p><p>“How so?” she whispered. </p><p>“We can turn it into a game. Two truths and a lie, for example,” I said. “Every victory gives you another precious drink. And, if you lose … you also lose a piece of clothing,” I added.  </p><p>“Interesting,” she whispered, flirting overtly. “When is it my turn to ask questions?”</p><p> I let my smile disappear, and let my face twist into a threatening expression. “Never.” </p><p>She made a show of flinching like she was afraid of my sudden turn of expression, but there was no fear. Whatever her powers were, she was very confident in their effectiveness. “That doesn’t sound fair,” she complained, trying to hide her fear. I had to admit, her seduction play was very interesting. </p><p>“My bar, my rules,” I shrugged. </p><p>“Can I bank victories,” she responded. “I don’t think I can drink anymore tonight. Too much  … and I start making bad decisions.” </p><p>Another obvious seduction line, clearly expecting me to push, would give her the chance to push as much as she wanted before she suddenly came to her mind and cut the seduction short. I had to admit, she was trained well. </p><p>Yet, surprisingly inexperienced at the same time.   </p><p>Meanwhile, I typed on my phone. Asking Emily to give me a social media report, about the identity of my mysterious visitor. I also did it openly, as the game gave me the excuse to do so.</p><p>“Deal, but with one condition,” I said. “Once we stop the game, you dance for me before you’re allowed to put your clothes back on.” </p><p>She looked at me, trying to look hesitant as she sipped her drink, then nodded. “Alright. But, how would we know that I’m telling the truth?” she said, slightly tense. </p><p>I smirked. “Well, I’m sure you have some photos to prove things. And, I could always check social media tomorrow and make sure everything is above board,” I said, deliberately playing to her strengths. “Of course, I need your name for it first.” </p><p> Clearly, faking some photos wouldn’t be too difficult for whoever was behind her. Also, it was an opportunity I’m offering for them, to see if I could penetrate the fake identity of their agent. </p><p>“Later,” she said with smirk. “We don’t want you cheating.” </p><p>All that remained was to see how strong her cover identity would be, which had some interesting implications. Too simple, and they were baiting me to attack her. Too strong, they had other plans. The middle ground, they were trying to test me.  </p><p>Sometimes, it was good to let the enemy play their moves first.    </p><p>Then, I smirked. “Also, I’m sure you have some evidence in your phone,”  I said. “A picture or two should be enough to prove some of the more interesting lies.” </p><p>She looked relaxed at the offer. It was clearly aligned with her mission, but I didn’t let it turn me overconfident. Just because it was what she expected didn’t mean that it was what her superiors expected. Still, in general, revealing my ‘weakness’ to seduction was much better than the alternatives.</p><p>“Well, I’m a student in, the marketing department. Two parents, both workaholics, and I love sweet things,” she said.   </p><p>Ironically, it was actually difficult to detect the prepared lies, because she had no emotional attachment to them. For example, I knew that she didn’t like sweets, but her persona did. However, at this point, Emily had already managed to find her social media accounts, and sent me a detailed report of them. </p><p>“Hmm,” I said as I ‘subtly’ checked my phone, checking her cover identity, which showed that her fake identity was an art student. I had to admit, the cover was rather good if Emily didn’t catch any problems during her first pass. </p><p>Her power gave her quite a bit of an advantage in catching those. If it wasn’t for my headache, I would have delved deeper to understand just how good. Instead, I just checked the basics. Like her cover name, which was Amelia, and her beach pictures, which were spectacular. </p><p>“Easy,” I said, like I just guessed it. The act of checking my phone was obvious, but it was a deliberate mistake. After all, she was supposed to be a rich and spoiled girl. There was no need for me to be too careful when I was checking her information from my phone. </p><p>“You don’t like someone that would study marketing.” </p><p>“How did you know?” she gasped pointedly even as she leaned back, acting like she didn’t connect my careless browsing to my knowledge. </p><p>“You look too elegant and sophisticated to be interested in something boring,” I said, letting her play the role she clearly wanted to display. </p><p>“Clever,” she admitted as she blushed. Then, to my surprise, she removed one of her earrings. </p><p>“Not as clever as you,” I admitted as I looked at the accessory sitting on my bar. It was a good ploy for two reasons. It allowed her to control the pace, which, in turn, relaxed her. </p><p>And, it slightly undersold my capabilities as a villain. </p><p>The second one would have been a bad idea previously,  but things changed after dealing with three supers without leaving any direct evidence. That proved my strength sufficiently. Now,  I  needed to give them a weakness they could target as well.</p><p>Or I became too big of a threat.  </p><p>“Now, the next question,” I asked. </p><p>She smirked. “I have a cat, I don’t like jazz music, and I’m allergic to peanuts.”</p><p>“Hmm, let’s go with the cat thing,” I said, deliberately answering correctly based on her social media posts even though the information on them was more obscure, showing that I had the ability to dig obscure facts quickly. Another little benefit. </p><p>“Clever,” she said as she took a large sip from her drink, finishing it. “But, it looks like I have to ask harder questions to get a drink here,” she said. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said. </p><p>“I love the feeling of fresh morning breeze. I hate modern impressionist art. I never smoked.”  </p><p>I paused a  moment, making a show of thinking. She was deliberately being tricky. There had been no smoking photos in her dossier, but that didn’t mean it was technically correct. The other two were even more complicated. </p><p>Too bad for her I chose to ignore her little trap.  “Let’s go with the morning breeze,” I said with a big smirk. “You deserve a drink.“</p><p>“Thanks,” she said, managing to hide her frustration sufficiently well. I  poured another drink, this time a tequila-based citrus cocktail with slightly less sweetness, just enough that she would enjoy it. </p><p>Her eyes widened as she tasted the cocktail. “Not too bitter, right?” I asked. “I can change it.” </p><p>“No, it’s surprisingly good,” she answered quickly, compromising her persona slightly for her enjoyment. “It’s not my usual taste, but it works well.” </p><p>“Good,” I said proudly, though I was more interested in her vigilance, quick to loosen at the slightest hint of success, further confirming that, while she had been clearly trained, she lacked practical experience; and her arrogance worked against her.</p><p>We continued back and forth. She won four strong drinks, all she consumed directly, acting progressively drunker. Acting only, as for some reason —  either her power or some kind of medicine — the alcohol didn’t affect her. </p><p>However, her victories came with a cost. Her accessories made a small pile, and her top lay next to them, leaving the task of protecting her chest with a sexy lacy bra. And, she just lost again. “Hmm,” she muttered as she stood up.</p><p> She had only five pieces remaining on her. Her bra, her panties, her skirt, and her shoes, each counted as one.  “Maybe I should just remove a shoe and call it an end.” </p><p>“If you want to dance barefooted,” I warned her.</p><p>“You wouldn’t let me put the back on,” she gasped seductively. </p><p>“Of course not. Make your choice.”  </p>",

    "content": "<p>That night, the bar was crowded. </p><p>It was not the usual bar crowd, not even by the usual standards of it. My customers were silent as they consumed their fare, paid, and left. Their tips were generous, usually in the range of ten thousand. However, even with the bar suddenly raking in more money than I could imagine earning through a legitimate business, I wanted nothing more than to close it early and deal with my horrible headache. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was not an option. It looked like people had already concluded that I was behind what had happened earlier, and the last thing I needed was to give them any evidence that I was involved with it directly. </p><p>The ‘tragic’ passing of two villains and a hero during their battle was already on the news. Unsurprising, as during the super battles, death wasn’t a common outcome, which had been enough to spook the other parties for some time.  </p><p>Hopefully, it would be enough to spook both parties. Not just by my apparent ability to ‘order’ the deaths of three supers, but also by my information gathering, enough to catch the ploy against me in a timely manner and counter it on time. </p><p>I  was glad for Emily for that report.  Without it, I would have been in incredible danger.  Even assuming I managed to deal with the attack by using the laser cannon, avoiding the damage to the bar was inevitable. That way, it was almost certain that it would have revealed my current powerlessness. Also, it would have also revealed the tunnel, removing my way of going back to the city without being noticed. </p><p>Her help also proved useful in giving me the background check on the visitors. The more information I had, the easier for me to discover their drink preferences to follow the threatening gimmick of the bar, which meant my headache didn’t have to get worse. </p><p>All that remained was to see whether my trick had worked well enough to intimidate them. </p><p>Just as I was preparing to close the bar, the cameras picked up another visitor. A redheaded woman, in her mid-twenties, her confidence enough to mark her either as a moron, or someone truly dangerous. </p><p>My power suggested the latter, so I took two actions. First, I sent her picture to Emily, asking her to help me to research as much as she could find. School records, misdemeanors, holiday pictures … anything. </p><p>Her confident gait helped me, as the dossier arrived before she could, allowing me to go through everything. To my surprise, there wasn’t much information available publicly, but Emily still managed to find some, particularly when she was just a student. </p><p>A lot of misdemeanors, some arrest records that went nowhere, and several photos where she had been traveling a few years ago before she fell off the grid completely. Altogether, she looked like a classic problem child who disappeared once she received powers, only to return as a villain. </p><p>As for matching her identity to a super, it was not as easy. Emily’s powers didn’t help her to analyze people’s disguises and match them with their hero identities, especially since most outfits had included some basic measures of concealment like changing hair colors and other simple techniques. </p><p>I could, but it required far more time than I had under the circumstances, and at least a reasonable subset of convincing targets. </p><p>Luckily, the clues I was picking from her suggested she had no perception abilities, and her confidence showed that she was not afraid of being hurt. I turned to Tara. “Go upstairs, make no noise, and be ready to intervene if I give you a signal. We have a super visitor.” She was still wearing her helmet, but I didn’t need to see her face to feel her tensing. “Don’t worry about it, it’s just a precaution,” I added. </p><p>The last thing I needed was for her to act prematurely. </p><p>With a sigh, I leaned forward, for once feeling the discomfort of dealing with yet another dangerous encounter. Still, I stood being the bar, which gave me the best chance to exert my authority as the mysterious villain. </p><p>Soon, the door opened, and my gaze met with a bombshell of a redhead, stumbling inside, alone. “N-nice place,” she muttered as she glanced around, doing a convincing drunk impression. I relaxed slightly, as if she was bothering to fake drunkenness, it would mean that she wasn’t ready to act. </p><p>While she stumbled toward the bar, I took note of her beauty. Her red hair was mussed, and her leather skirt — already tiny — had slid up carelessly to reveal even more of her milky white legs, the fishnets she was wearing hardly an impediment. The boots she was wearing covered anything below the knee level, but that could be hardly counted as coverage. </p><p>Her top, a black crop top that looked crooked enough to fall at the slightest touch, was hardly an improvement, especially since it was thin enough to show she had no bra. </p><p>Altogether, she gave an excellent impression of a party girl. Without my powers — and the fact that her eyes lingered on the spot where Tara was supposed to be sitting — I might have actually bought her drunken impression. But, small details, like the steadiness of her steps even as she stumbled, the way her back straightened, and the immediate tensing she displayed when I reached under the counter betrayed her state. </p><p>As she got closer, I could smell alcohol on her breath, showing that she had prepared well for the visit. Not a professional, but not an amateur either. It was not her first undercover assignment. “H-Hey, I found a surprise bar,” she slurred, her drunk accent near perfect. </p><p>“Good for you,” I answered with a big smile as I peeked into her cleavage, reacting in a way she expected of me. The seduction attempt was rather obvious, but either I played along, or she moved to plan B. </p><p>And when it came to villains, plan B often included a lot of violence. </p><p>While I was enjoying the view, I also made sure to check for a recorder. They were good enough, but my power was even better at picking them. </p><p>She was clean. </p><p>“So, what a girl needs to do here to get a drink,” she said. </p><p>I smirked, picking on her seductive attitude. “Why don’t you tell me how did you end up in this little neighborhood first,” I said, making sure to sound slightly suspicious. “Not exactly your kind of place, right?” </p><p>She shrugged, which had the effect of enhancing her cleavage even more. “Nothing much,” she said. “I come here with my girls for a party …” she said, then sniffed reflexively, trying to imply drugs. “Then, her boyfriend decided to get a little too randy, and I decided to leave. Then, I found a bar,” she said while I mixed her a drink. A nice gin-based cocktail with mint and sugar, something like a variant of mojito. </p><p>She took a sip … and she hated it. “D-delicious,” she muttered. </p><p>“Happy to hear,” I said smugly, like I didn’t notice her flinch. I had seen enough holiday photos of her to get a general sense of her palette, and she much preferred more bitter tastes. However, it was the kind of drink a party girl like her would enjoy. </p><p>A deliberate mistake on my part. Since the first day, I had made sure to convince the others that the reason I was able to guess their favorite drinks was more about the information-gathering capabilities of my organization, mixed with some bragging. </p><p>After all, I wouldn’t be the first Villain to ruin his life because of a desire to brag. </p><p>Since she was not a known figure, guessing her drink correctly would imply something else. And, as an added benefit, it signaled her that I had believed her party girl attire. Admittedly, it wasn’t too unbelievable. She wouldn’t be the first girl who visited the neighborhood to hang with the gangsters to get a sense of danger … and a lot of hard drugs. </p><p>Since she went through all that trouble, I decided to play along. “So, tell me about yourself,” she said as she leaned forward, giving me another glimpse of her cleavage. A little suspicious, but not completely unexpected for a drunk rich girl. </p><p>“Not a lot to tell,” I answered with a smug, confident smile. “Just a handsome bartender killing some time. How about you?” I responded, revealing my confidence while also probing her for information, keeping my tone deliberately dark and mysterious. </p><p>I noticed her eyes dilating slightly as I delivered my words, showing signs of attraction as I played dark and mysterious. But, that was the extent of her reaction, and it wasn’t accompanied by any other clear signs. </p><p>She was attracted to dark and mysterious bad boys, but she wasn’t aware of it. </p><p>It gave me an interesting idea. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Since we agreed about my help, why  don’t we start talking about how you’ll pay for my great assistance?” I offered, enjoying the way she shivered with anticipation. Comfort turned into something else.  </p><p>“Well, it’s not good business practice to pay before goods are delivered.” </p><p>I smirked at her coy attitude. “How about a little advance, then?” I offered. </p><p>“Well, it’s tempting—” she started, but at that moment, her phone pinged. “It’s the HQ,” she whispered, suddenly tense again. “They are asking me for an emergency meeting.” </p><p>“Private, or company-wide?” </p><p>“It’s for the directors of the local plants. It already started,” she said as she stood up and walked to her desk rapidly, though she looked rather stressed. </p><p>She needed some help. </p><p>“Well, that doesn’t mean you can’t pay for your advance at the same time,” I said as I followed her. </p><p>“What do you mean? Are you going to join the meeting?” she asked. </p><p>“I have something different in mind,” I said even as I slid under her desk. Her eyes widened. </p><p>“But —” she started, only to freeze when I made a sharp gesture, signaling her to stop arguing. It was one of the bedroom signals we started to use, but it proved useful here as well. She shut up immediately, her beautiful eyes wide. I snuggled under her desk. She made a move to sit down. </p><p>“Get rid of anything below the waist, except the heels,” I ordered, and she followed that obediently, blushing even as she did so. Then, she called Brenda. “I’m in an important meeting with the HQ. Allow no one in,” she ordered. </p><p>“Yes, boss,” Brenda said, but there was no hiding her amusement. </p><p>“Be careful,” I said with a smirk even as I put my hands on her legs, parting them slightly to reveal her wetness. “Now, your peers want to talk to you.” </p><p>“If you insist,” she whispered as she clicked. </p><p>“You’re late,” an unwelcome voice reached my ear the moment Natalie joined the call. The CEO, who tried to ruin my very excellent acquisition deal. I would have loved to say that it was an annoying, nasal voice, but that would be a lie. It was a  calm, soft voice, almost maternal, like a mother gently admonishing a child. </p><p>The truth couldn’t be further from the truth. Behind her gentle visage lay a monster. She was the business equivalent of Napoleon. Her so-called gentle admonishment was one such trick. With the reorganization going on, she was too smart not to realize Natalie would be panicking already. </p><p>Yet, she deliberately invited her to the meeting at the last minute, and even started by admonishing her. Which informed everyone that </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Natalie said. “I have just —” she started, but I gestured to her again, signaling her not to tell that she had just received an invite. That would be a mistake. The CEO couldn’t say that, not without coming across as pity, but Natalie using that as an excuse would tell everyone that she was on the chopping block. </p><p>A simple yet effective trap. </p><p>“Tell me that your previous client meeting ran longer than expected. Big deal,” I quickly clued Natalie. </p><p>“The meeting with one of our major clients ran longer than expected, so I’m a bit late,” Natalie said, quick to catch on that. “It took a while for me to extract myself from it.” And, luckily, the performance of our IT services was on her side. It didn’t have the smoothest flow, so a momentary break while speaking was nothing out of the ordinary. </p><p>“I see,” the CEO said, her tone normal on the surface, like it wasn’t a problem for her subtle execution notice to be ignored. I smirked even as I tightened my grip. “It’s good that you’re working hard to bring your department to our targets. Should I assume that we will  have no problems hitting them if you’re meeting with the new targets?” </p><p>I kissed her inner thigh, and when she looked down, I nodded again. The new targets were nearly impossible to hit … honestly. But, a little creative accounting, and a few fake deals that allowed the clients to cancel at the last minute with limited penalties should be enough to give us a few months, which would me a chance to work on Dorothy. </p><p>… Or, if that failed, giving Natalie the time she would need to find a new job, making her departure look like poaching from a rival company rather than an ungraceful firing by recognizing some of the revenue early.</p><p>It would ruin whoever was promoted to director, but that would hardly be our problem.  </p><p>“Certainly. We’re on track to hit our new targets,” she said. The CEO followed up with details, but this time, Natalie didn’t need any suggestion from me to continue weaving a web of believable nonsense. </p><p>Which was good, as it allowed me to focus on what was really important. I started going forward, leaving a trail of kisses along her naked thigh, approaching her wetness while she spoke. I avoided the final destination. Teasing her more was tempting, but not when she was the main focus of the meeting.  </p><p>Even with the choppy video, it wasn’t the best idea.  </p><p>Natalie continued to speak steadily as I kissed and caressed her thighs, which lasted for five minutes. “We will see if you can fulfill that ambitious plan, Natalie,” the CEO said. Even without seeing her, I could feel that she was smirking. “Now, since Natalie promises me that those targets are achievable, does anyone have any complaints about them?” she followed, immediately turning Natalie’s assurances into an attack on the others.  </p><p>A dangerous woman indeed. </p><p>I could see Natalie’s smug smile, which meant, she wasn’t entirely aware of how many enemies she had made in the process. She still needed to learn more about higher-ranking policies, but educating her about those would require a long time. </p><p>Meanwhile, I caressed her core for a fleeting moment, alerting her of what was about to follow. Her eyes widened, suggesting that she wasn’t ready for it. She even looked down with a begging gaze. </p><p>I just chuckled softly before I leaned forward and pressed my lips against her core. </p><p>She shivered. </p><p>The meeting continued while I gave her a  little fun service, and her breathing started to quicken. Ordinarily, it wouldn’t have been a huge problem in a large remote meeting, but Natalie had managed to turn herself into a target. Any director that wanted to argue against the target attacked her first. </p><p>Luckily, without receiving a detailed report beforehand, their attacks were pretty much baseless posturing, meaning, I didn’t have to suppress my enjoyment just to allow Natalie to answer. She was easily able to deflect those problems. </p><p>She struggled to keep her tone even, ending in a chippy tone while my tongue danced against her wetness. Ironically, it helped her case, as made her sound dismissive and uncaring … which was a horrible attitude for a meeting under different circumstances. </p><p>But, now, under baseless attacks from several other directors, it was far better than looking angry or stressed. It made her look more confident. </p><p>While she took her breath to answer another question, I let my tongue dance in her core, making her shiver helplessly. She managed out suppress a gasp, but it was a close call. </p><p>I smirked as I continued to lick her core, making her shiver subtly while I enjoyed her taste, each second driving the pleasure further. There were many questions about the schedule of the deals, possible delivery dates, and other details. </p><p>As my tongue pushed deep, her explanation suddenly stopped, and a desperate mouse click arrived before she exploded with a moan. “Stop it,” she whispered, which I ignored. Another mouse click. “Sorry about it, I accidentally muted myself,” she said, and continued with the explanation.  </p><p>I caressed her legs, while my tongue continued to dance against her wetness, occasionally adding one or two soft bite marks to her inner thighs to keep her alert. </p><p>A long, languid torture that lasted for twenty minutes before it got too much. She reached for a glass and acted like she took a sip before she started coughing. </p><p>It was a good excuse to mute herself once more while she shivered desperately as the orgasm hit. A beautiful dance, and an even more beautiful surrender. “Please,” she whispered as she shuddered. </p><p>If it was in the past, her sexy plea would have only made me tease her more, but this time, I decided to be more merciful. I crawled under her desk without being caught by the camera. “You’re lucky it’s just advance payment,” I said with a chuckle and walked away while she continued to fake a cough. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” she said to the team before she continued to meet, still half naked. I left the office and saw Brenda. </p><p>“Interesting meeting?” she asked with a seductive smile. </p><p>“Too bad we had to cut short,” I responded with a matching smirk. I was tempted to bring her away to continue, but considering the state I left Natalie, I decided against it. “Don’t go anywhere,” I warned. “She’s not in a state to greet any visitor.” </p><p>Brenda smiled, and I walked away. </p><p>Luckily, I had my own secretary to ask for help. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The battle raged outside as I walked toward Cornelia, still trying to decide what to do. The decision would have been easy if the thing that was invading her soul was anything but Elemental Spark. My experience with Titania showed just how difficult it was to handle. </p><p>And, that was just a sliver of energy instead of the flood Cornelia was dealing with. A flood that was being consciously driven by intelligence. The flames that surrounded her didn’t burn her, but I had a feeling that it could be changed at any moment. </p><p>The smart thing to do was to turn back and leave Cornelia to her fate. Instead, I cast a spell against the flames. Nothing impressive, just a mere bolt of flame, mixed with Tantric magic. “I come to parley,” I said. </p><p>HOW DARE YOU! </p><p>It didn’t make a sound, yet the intent was clear. It wasn’t like the message from the System, which was overwhelming but featureless, barely enough to be discerned as female. It felt like the sky had been covered with burning letters instead. </p><p>“I dare because I represent the biggest hope of your freedom,” I answered, feeling the greatness of the sealed entity. This time, a flame attack rushed toward me, covering me as well. I was ready to create a barrier made of several Divine Sparks, enough to isolate the flame, but it didn’t burn.  </p><p>The silhouette of a bird, made entirely of flames, appeared in my mind. “I am a primordial being of flames. Look at my form and despair!” </p><p>She sounded furious, but somehow, I felt a hint of desperation as well. Not shocking. If I was guessing correctly, she had been captured and used to fuel the protections of a city, likely being experimented in the process. Hardly the most comfortable life. </p><p>I could extract herself from my grip, that much I was sure. Tantric might not have broken down Elemental Spark immediately, but it still worked wonders to isolate and protect my soul. Even better, by reaching me like that, I was able to pass through the outer defenses and was able to reach Cornelia’s soul. </p><p>Just like her body, her soul was surrounded by flames, slowly being infused by Flames. I was glad that I intervened. A few more minutes, and she would have turned into a vessel. </p><p>I reestablished the connection between us, reaching to her soul while keeping the angry bird unaware. Instead, I decided to distract her by speaking. “You can show off, or we can make a deal,” I offered, immediately changing the topic. </p><p>I was hoping that it would surprise her enough to pay less attention to my magical presence. </p><p>“How dare you! I had been born with this universe, far before your disgusting, parasitic ilk invaded the realm to steal and pollute!” </p><p>The interesting thing about commuting with a divine being, the conveyed information was not limited to words. As she spoke, images followed. Images that showed a wave of Primordial Aether appearing from nothingness, covering everything. </p><p>Or, maybe, creating everything. That emptiness wasn’t normal emptiness. It was a true Void, dark, chilling, threatening to devour and destroy everything. </p><p>A problem for another time. The images continued, where many elements filled the void, slowly developing a plane, led by four beings. A bird made of flames, a tree made of earth and metal, a turtle made of water, and a cloud, representing air. </p><p>Four elements. </p><p>Their harmony was broken down by the sudden appearance of a ship cutting through the void at the edge, filled with elves, and bursting into the Primordial Aether. On the ship, there were many Demigods. What followed by fragmented visions of many battles, where humans, elves, angels, and many other beings, each on their own ships while they invaded Primordial Aether. </p><p>Some raiding for energy, some invading the Material Plane to turn into gods. The latter faction was led by a Goddess, whose voice was surprisingly familiar. </p><p>The System. </p><p>“Look, I’m not going to talk about how much of a barbarian my ancestors had been. We have more important things to work on,” I countered. “You’re clearly struggling, and either I help you in your troubling state, or I do my best to stop you.” </p><p>Of course, I was not the one to suddenly extend my trust into an unfamiliar being, particularly when it was some kind of Primordial Being with a grudge. An understandable, fair grudge, but a grudge nonetheless. </p><p>The moment the connection with Cornelia was reestablished, I sent a flood of Divine Energy into her soul … and I was glad for it. The situation was even worse than I expected. She was resisting the invasion of Elemental Spark of Flame, but only because of her own Divine Spark of Flames. </p><p>The edges were frayed by the Elemental Spark, but that was the least of her problems. </p><p>Her soul had been turned into a trap. There was something that was eerily similar to flames, which would have been almost impossible to detect if it was wrapped by Elemental Spark. But, in its core, there was a seed made of Divine Spark. </p><p>That Divine Spark wasn’t exactly Purified Spark, but close enough. Cornelia was just bait, a delivery mechanism for a corrupting influence. I had no idea what it would have done once it was taken in by that bird, but my guess; it was nothing good. </p><p>I strengthened Cornelia’s soul as much as possible, helping her to bond with her own Spark better. Ironically, that worked better than what Titania had been dealing with. Titania had to deal with much less Elemental Spark, but after months, it filled her soul completely. </p><p>Here, Elemental Spark was just an invader, and could be pushed out. </p><p>While I slowly reinforced her soul, I also unlocked the seed, and started examining it. It was an insidious weapon, one that would spread into the Elemental’s soul and turn her into a slave. It was very complicated, and even with my Intelligence, I would have had a lot of trouble deciphering it if it wasn’t based on the working principles of the System. </p><p>And, that was a topic I had great expertise. </p><p>“How dare, you pathetic mortal!” she shouted when I ignored her initial answer, and instead attacked me with a similar soul attack, trying to absorb my soul to turn me into another slave. </p><p>Big mistake on her part, as it not only slowed Cornelia’s corruption, but also distracted her, allowing me to counter-attack. </p><p>By using the seed as a weapon. First, I cut its connection with the System, linking to my own unique  System. Then, I started to fuel it with millions of mana. It was designed to work slowly, but that was not a drawback. I used my connection with the others to pull mana, and the Seed grew rapidly …  before that being could realize, she was completely infected.</p><p>Or, at least, her consciousness that was out of the seal. It cut her connection with her power. </p><p>Another chain of changes followed. I felt the city tremble, and at a distance, three towers crumbled … and three elementals, in their full power, started to wreak havoc in the city. A pity, as I would have loved to capture them as well. Unfortunately, whatever was keeping them in control had crumbled the moment the balance between the four was gone.  </p><p>They would soon destroy the city. </p><p>The flame bird, the one that was closest to escaping, was the only one that stayed imprisoned, but she was split into two. Her consciousness stayed captured by my System, while her power stayed, powering the city. </p><p>The flames were gone, and Cornelia collapsed on the floor. “Caesar,” she gasped as she looked at me, shocked yet smiling. </p><p>“I’m here,” I said as I took one step, and kissed her. “I missed you,” I added even as I repaired and enhanced her control over her Divine Spark far better. “Now, follow my clone, and retreat back to the material plane,” I said.  </p><p>With three of the elementals free, there was no need to leave them. Worse, I could feel the three freed elementals devouring Primordial Aether with a shocking speed, suggesting that they were yet to recover to their full strength.  </p><p>I didn’t want to be there when they returned. </p><p>“What about Marianne?” she asked. </p><p>“I already sent clones for her and Aviada as well,” I said. With that, I teleported them back to the Material plane. </p><p>“How about you?” she asked. </p><p>I smirked. “I have one last thing.” </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 190    Charisma: 190</p><p>Precision: 190    Perception: 204</p><p>Agility: 190     Manipulation: 201</p><p>Speed: 190       Intelligence: 254</p><p>Endurance: 268      Wisdom: 230}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 913,221}</p><p>{Divine Air Spark: 32,193}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge</p><p>Goddess of Healing</p><p>Goddess of Flames}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Y-you want me to teach you Forest Dance,” I asked, blushing hard. </p><p>“Yes, is there a problem,” she asked, not bothering to hide her amusement. In that moment, I finally felt like I was dealing with another bored housewife, teasing her young personal trainer, rather than the impassive and proud Queen. </p><p>I didn’t answer immediately and avoided her gaze. “F-forest dance requires me to see your movements clearly…” I said, exaggerating my shyness. </p><p>“So?” she asked, deliberately acting obtuse like she didn’t understand what I was driving at. Of course, that was her plan all along in disguising her talent. As, the weaker the talent, the more direct help they would need … meaning far more physical closeness. </p><p>“Y-you need to wear something other than your robes. Something … something with less fabric.” </p><p>“I see,” she said loudly, like she had just realized that. “But for the safety of my Queen, it’s acceptable.” Then, her gaze tightened. “As long as you keep that a secret, of course.” </p><p>I nodded seriously. “I promise on my honor and my life,” I declared, this time completely honest. I was never one to kiss and tell … not to mention, with her identity, it wouldn’t end well for me. </p><p>“Good, follow me,” she said, leading me to a large room on the first floor. It was completely empty and had a wooden floor, likely designed as a training room originally as well. Also, it was fleshly cleaned, showing that she had planned it. </p><p>“Wait here, while I go and change,” she said. </p><p>I suspected the lack of windows was one of the reasons she picked it. The only thing that was lacking was a mirror to control the form, but I decided not to fix it for the moment and waited for her return. And, once it became apparent that she would take a while to arrive, I started practicing. </p><p>I wanted to look my best. </p><p>And, practicing slowly as I did so, alternating between Forest Dance and Black Tiger Onslaught, the latter just enough to speed up my blood. She clearly liked seeing me with a wild edge, and its clear wild impact would give me an excuse to be more forward. </p><p>Though, there was also a strategic reason for it. I didn’t like its emotional effect, but there was no arguing about its potential. Getting used to it was the best choice. </p><p>I practiced for an hour as I waited for the Queen to arrive. Then, she arrived, the view enough to make the wait worth it. </p><p>Her veil was still on, but she had applied a fresh set of makeup, her beautiful blue eyes turning even more striking. More, importantly, the veil was the only thing that stayed the same. </p><p>Her robe was gone, replaced by a soft, flowing shirt that went low enough to cover her hips, yet thin enough to show her body underneath. And, what a body it was. She was curvy, even soft, the kind that could be dismissed easily as not a threat, something that even Elsana didn’t have. </p><p>Her cultivation was like a hidden blade, dangerous, but not visible. </p><p>But, I ignored the battle implications of that as I let my gaze dip down, taking note of what she wore underneath. A thin, stretchy fabric, not entirely unlike yoga pants, except for the plastic vision. I didn’t know the name of the material, nor did I care. I was more interested in how it would feel for my touch. </p><p>The fact that the whole outfit was pure white somehow made it even more alluring.  </p><p>She was beautiful, and if it wasn’t for my casual familiarity with the female form, I would have lost myself in her allure. However, I still froze, giving her that exact impression. Her face was covered, but there was no hiding her satisfaction. </p><p>Of course, technically, she was married. To the King, even, but I felt absolutely no twinge of guilt. He should have thought about that before exiling her wife. </p><p>“Is this a part of the training? Trying to understand the shape of my muscles?” she teased. </p><p>“I … sorry. I was just …” I said before shaking my head, though it was hardly an exaggeration. She truly looked spectacular. “We can start if you’re ready. Walk into the middle of the room,” I said. “Let’s start with teaching the form first.” </p><p>“I hope I won’t disappoint you. I never practiced martial arts before,” she said with a throaty voice. An absurd statement, considering she was already in the Advanced Bone Forging realm. I might have helped, but she was still the one who broke through multiple minor realms on her own. </p><p>“Let’s start with something simple. The stance,” I said, showing it several times, only for her to get wrong every single time. “No, not like that,” I corrected again, then paused, forcing a blush once again. “I … I think I need to show it differently.” </p><p>“Oh, what do you have in mind,” she asked. </p><p>“Umm, actually … it’s a bit forward, but it might help if … you touch my back muscles while I take the stance. It’s where you are making the mistake,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, is this the best way?” she said, teasing. What she was talking about was that it was better for me to show directly. I blushed but didn’t answer, once again playing the shy victim, aware that the only way it worked was to make sure she always had the lead. “Very well,” she said as she smiled, and closed in the distance. “Show me.” </p><p>“A-alright,” I said as I started showing the basic stance, immediately starting to do a poor job the moment her hands touched my back. I didn’t need to fake my quickening heartbeat. Her presence was exciting enough already. </p><p>Her hand danced along my spine gently, her nails sharp enough to make me shiver. For me, the biggest challenge was to keep playing rather than turning back and teaching her a different way. She said nothing for several minutes, caressing my back again and again, while I blushed more and more. </p><p>“I … I think it should be enough,” I whispered throatily. “Why … why don’t you show me exactly what you learned?” </p><p>“Already,” she said with a smirk. “Maybe I should stretch some first,” she said as she raised her arms up for the first time, which rode her shirt up, giving me a glimpse of her hips clad in tight slacks … she was a Queen indeed.</p><p>“I think I’m warm enough — I mean, you have warmed up already,” I said, rapidly correcting my words. She was amused by the slip. </p><p>Predictably, she failed her stance … very creatively. There was actually no way for me to explain her mistake without ten minutes of explaining, or touching her directly. She was baiting to touch me. </p><p>Well, or showing directly. </p><p>It was time to escalate the game a bit. “I think it’ll be challenging to explain it directly. I know it’s inappropriate, but may I touch your back. It’ll be easier to explain,” I said. </p><p>She said nothing but just nodded. I couldn’t help but wonder about just how beautiful her seductive smile was under that veil. I approached her from behind and put only a gentle, hesitant finger on her back. A little disappointing … at first, before my finger started moving, applying the full benefits of my incredible massage skill. </p><p>The shocked moan she let out was beautiful. She must have been deprived of a touch even longer than I expected. “I’m sorry, did I hurt you?” I asked, acting concerned to give her an excuse. </p><p>“A … a bit,” she said, for once, actually shy, but she recovered quickly. “But don’t worry. I’m a cultivator. A little pain is nothing to me.” </p><p>“Good. Because I could finally see the reason for the problem. It’s two-fold. Your back muscles are tense, preventing you from taking the stance you want … and also you’re focusing on the moves too much.” </p><p>“Oh, what do you have in mind?” she said. </p><p>“For a start, this,” I said as I moved to her back, and started massaging. I didn’t use any essence, but my ordinary massage abilities were even more effective, considering it was less about solving problems and more about keeping her … happy. As I worked on her shoulders, she let out a beautiful gasp. “It doesn’t hurt, does it?” I asked. </p><p>“I can handle a little pain,” she said quickly. Far too quickly. “So, what’s the second part?” she added. </p><p>“We’re going to keep your mind occupied while I work on your back to prevent you from getting too conscious about what was going on. “What do you say about combining our lessons. You can continue teaching me more about cultivation while I teach you about martial arts,” I suggested. </p><p>“Yes,” she accepted immediately, which wasn’t a surprise. After all, from her perspective, it would only result in an inferior class. </p><p>For me, it represented the hope of delving deeper into the mysteries of the cultivation, supported by higher multipliers. </p><p>Not to mention, subtle but aggressive flirting with a very sexy woman.  </p><p>What was there not to like. </p><p>Our mixed class lasted four hours, and when she finally called an end, I looked at the results with glee. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pampering Bonus - 55 (Capped)]</p><p>[85x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique Lesson, Perfection - Minor Immersion]</p><p>[85x Return - Thousand Petals Gate Transformation Technique - Beginner]</p><p>[85x Return - Verdant Brush Talisman Technique Lesson, Minor Familiarity - Major Familiarity]</p><p>[85x Return - Cleansing Talisman Schematic, Profound Peak-Grade]</p><p>[85x Return - Palm of Verdant Cleansing - Beginner]</p>",
