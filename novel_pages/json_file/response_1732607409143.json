    "content": "<p>Based on my initial plans, I was supposed to stop pushing Fernhand, to prevent her from reacting adversely while getting used to her new political position after her ambitions were destroyed, with all the unpleasantness of a rug being pulled under her feet just as she was about to step into the most important ball of the year, only to be teased by the hope of a smaller reward. </p><p>It was a shift of mentality not many people could adapt. Most would get too invested in what they had lost, spending a wasteful amount of time and energy to reacquire their lost fortunes or political assets, ultimately causing them to lose even more. It was yet another thing I had used to great effect in my own rise of power. </p><p>However, the speed Fernhand was showing in adapting her modified role surprised me, though, it might imply two opposite things. Either she accepted her modified position with surprising mental agility, or she was completely unaffected by the changes, waiting for the opportunity to upend the table again. </p><p>Just like what I had done with my imprisonment.</p><p>Despite being diametrically opposite, however, those two possibilities had one shared implication. It meant that I could push her further without fearing an adverse reaction from her side. Either way, she accepted my power over her —though whether permanently or temporarily was an issue for another time.  </p><p>“Damn, girl, you’re tighter than Sapphire, she would have been broken up if she knew that,” I murmured in a way that could be easily taken as an absentminded slip, the kind that could be done by an overconfident dark lord. After all, just because I was enjoying her tight asshole with an ever-increasing speed didn’t mean that I couldn’t use the opportunity to carefully manipulate her understanding of the relationship between me and Sapphire, especially if that could be built through a delicious mixture of truth and lies. </p><p>“Really?” she asked in a flirtatious yet elated tone, enthusiasm painting her tone bright. Too bad that it was completely fake. </p><p>“Yeah,” I said even as I slapped her ass before picking up speed, enjoying the way her tightness stretched to open a slippery pathway for me. “Hers is much more beautiful, of course, but yours is tighter,” I added in the same absentminded tone. </p><p>“I see,” she answered, but different from her previous words, her jealousy felt much more genuine, suggesting that I managed to hit a soft spot. The fact that she was jealous of Sapphire was not surprising, considering she was spending a significant chunk of her time to get the things that belonged to Sapphire, such as political power. Under that circumstances, jealousy was not a weird emotion to develop, and that was only if her jealousy wasn’t the driving factor that started everything in the first place. </p><p>Something that I was happy to notice, giving me another lever to push along physical discomfort to make her slip. “Of course,” I said in an insensitive manner. “Don’t get me wrong, sweetie, you’re a beautiful woman, but you lack her curves, which is a great assistance in bed,” I continued, before punctuating it with another slap on her tight ass. </p><p>A grunt escaped her mouth, more of an annoyance than pain even as I started ramming into her hard enough for our hips to create a loud symphony. </p><p>“Don’t worry, you’re beautiful in your own way,” I said, driving the dagger even further. I always liked that sentence, because it worked even better than an offhand insult, accepting her inferiority as a given, then adding a dose of pity to make it even more painful. Fernhand shuddered in anger, the sharpest jab of emotion I had ever managed to extract from her, making me wonder about the source of Fernhand’s enmity toward Sapphire. </p><p>The most significant driver of her action was getting more power for herself, of course. Her actions were too calculated and too conservative to be just a revenge drive, but still, it wouldn’t be surprising if it started from a purer negative place. With her beautiful body and her hidden tantric magic, Sapphire was uniquely equipped to drive her fellow women into irrevocable fits of jealousy. I had no idea, who was the male in question, whether the late Emperor, or another noble who didn’t a young and idealistic Fernhand the attention she deserved in lieu of trying to seduce a newly-widowed Queen, enamored with both her beauty and the power of her successful seduction represented. </p><p>Regardless, her intensifying reaction suggested that I had the perfect lever to unbalance her. “Sweetie, why did you stop, you were talking about the recent changes in the tax collection regulations,” I said, once again using a spank as a punishment. </p><p>Fernhand continued to explain, though getting frustrated by the dwindling attention I was paying on her. I grabbed some of the papers from her desk and started reading just to push her more. And just to add insult to injury, I spread those papers over her back, using her body as another desk. </p><p>The growl of frustration she let out in response was just spectacular. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t just my dismissal that was affecting her. Even as I subtly mocked her for being less beautiful than Sapphire, I continued to enjoy her tight hole with an increasing speed, hitting her with an unexpected rush of pleasure. </p><p>Things got even more intense when I reached down to slip a finger into her wetness, the movement of my fingers skillful yet mechanical, selling the idea of being disinterested despite the great pleasure that was triggering in her. </p><p>The paradox of my actions started to work wonders, as grudging yet intense moans started to interject themselves between her words, breaking up her explanation even further. </p><p>And, the more distracted she got, the looser her lips become, having some interesting slips about her supporters and her aims. I was willing to treat them as truth, because whenever she had one such slip, a sharp realization hit her, temporarily chilling her fury. </p><p>I couldn’t ignore the chance that she was even better in manipulation than I was giving her credit for, and actually using that to trick me, of course, but luckily, none of the information was absolutely necessary, giving me enough time to validate through alternative channels. </p><p>As I pushed inside her, I was getting closer to a climax of my own. I could have just exploded in her bowels, of course, but why should I, when there were so many better options. </p><p>I pulled out without a warning. “W-what happened?” she asked, murmuring dazedly at the sudden absence of pleasure. Clearly, I wasn’t the only one getting closer to an explosion, and she clearly didn’t appreciate the sudden stop. </p><p>“Well, the explanation I had received is more than enough for today,” I said even as I started walking, amused by the way she closed her eyes as she tried to suppress a biting reply about stopping halfway, smart enough to realize I wouldn’t treat such a move nicely. </p><p>However, her reaction to close her eyes allowed me to move to the other side of her table without her noticing. She might have amazing political instincts and manipulative capabilities, but her spatial awareness was horrible, a perfect fit for a little noble politician that never faced mortal danger without hordes of guards to protect her. </p><p>When she opened her eyes, only to find myself standing in front of her, her mouth opened in shock, a perfect opportunity for me to push my throbbing girth through her lips, hard enough to cut her breathing. The outrage on her face was one of the most delicious sights I enjoyed, intensifying further even as my shaft touched the entrance of her throat. </p><p>Ignoring her outraged gags, I pushed even further, enjoying the tightness of her throat. As I pulled her hair, her outrage quickly melted, leaving its place to an accepting resignation, the combined weight of her secrets and her pleasure enough to earn her passive obedience. </p><p>As I read her expression, it was getting pretty clear that I was reaching the edge of her resistant obedience, meaning that unless I wanted her to react explosively, I needed to stop surprising her, at least for the rest of the day. But, since the avoidance was the only rational strategy for the rest of the day, I decided to enjoy her throat as much as possible. </p><p>I grabbed her hair even tighter, using it as leverage to impale her throat thoroughly, her gasps and gags rising to create an enticing melody. I even used my grip to pull her torso up a bit, enough to slip my hand between her and the desk, squeezing her tits mercilessly. </p><p>Despite the roughness of the treatment —or maybe because of it— she was enjoying it immensely, any little breath she was able to take escaping back as moans, followed by another string of gagging. The shock in her eyes told me that it was the first time she was being treated like that, and the level of enjoyment she was driving from it was completely shocking.  </p><p>I continued enjoying her body without the slightest hint of restraint, even when her hands found my thighs, resting on them lazily like she was having trouble deciding whether to push me away or achieve the impossible by pulling me even deeper… </p><p>And since she was already primed by the earlier anal treatment, it barely took a couple of minutes for her to achieve a spectacular climax, her body invaded by endless trembling. The tightening of her throat also helped me to close in the remaining distance. I didn’t resist the pull, but I didn’t fill her throat either. </p><p>No, I had one last nice surprise for her. </p><p>I pulled out at the last possible second, and started sprouting my thick lines of seed on her beautiful face, just to underline the perks and responsibilities of her new station in life. Her expression, dancing between shame, outrage, and a guilty pleasure, was beautiful, especially when it failed to land on just one expression even as I slowly fixed my pants and started walking away. </p><p>I stopped just as I was about to open the door. “It was a useful meeting, certainly enough to keep me from mentioning it to Sapphire, unless you have a sudden change of mind and not happy with the trade we’re conducting, of course.” </p><p>“No, no problem,” she uttered, her tone carrying the same mixture with her expression, suggesting that she couldn’t decide whether to like or hate the treatment she had just received, unlocking the doors of a completely new universe for her. </p><p>She just needed to decide whether to take that step, or turn back. </p><p>“See you around, then,” I said with a chuckle before leaving her, my mind already on the next step… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The sight of the curvy beauty collapsed next to her husband flicked a switch for the other women that filled the room, breaking a mental barrier for them. As I played with Cera, they were content in watching me, but after the short yet impactful adventure that the busty beauty had just experienced, every single one of them looked at me like naughty kittens examining a particularly tasty piece of liver. </p><p>Surprisingly, before I could even react, a blonde dashed toward me, her eyes glowing with excitement as she fell on her knees. I would have taken her as a drunk, but her movements were perfectly smooth as she took half of my cock in her mouth. She was just aroused. </p><p>Though, as much as I enjoyed her initiative, it wasn’t exactly evidence of her bravery. What was happening in the room was certainly a scandal, not to a degree of ruining their lives, but enough to be a headache for a few months, maybe even some permanent damage to their social standing. But there was one condition for it to be a scandal, for them to talk. </p><p>And that was unlikely after things came to that point. They might be spoiled, but they were smart enough to realize that after things came to this point, none of them would spill the beans, not if they didn’t want other people to assume that they were a part of it even if they decided to avoid. After all, my friends had an orgy with a gladiator but I didn’t join despite staying there wasn’t particularly convincing as far as claims of innocence went. </p><p>They could have left early, of course, but that would have earned the displeasure of their hostess Olivia, which was worse than suffering through a scandal. And Olivia was still on her seat, watching the situation with a hungry gaze in her face, clearly enjoying the liberties I was talking with the rest of the Roman nobility. </p><p>She was such a nice fan of my gladiatorial work. </p><p>The blonde between my legs, devouring my shaft with an aggressiveness seemed to be another fan of the enthusiasm she displayed as she tried to stuff my whole cock in her mouth, and as a performer, it was my job to take care of my fans. So, I grabbed a hold of her hair and started pulling her even tighter, helping her to swallow my full length. It was a tough job for her, but that didn’t blunt her enthusiasm.  </p><p>Gasps filled the room, too loud to be a genuine shock. I let my gaze drag across the room, enjoying the sight of mostly-naked beauties while they all watched me in rapt attention, constructing a circle around me, enjoying the sight of their noble peer being treated as a street whore - and loving it intensely, her enthusiasm compensating for her lacking experience. </p><p>I pointed to one of the other women, this time a lithe-bodied, olive-skinned beauty. “Bring me wine,” I ordered, like I was a Consul and she was one of my servants. The speed she jumped up to her feet, dashing toward the table as her naked ass swayed enthusiastically was a nice sight, especially as she accidentally stepped on a few fingers, making sure their drunk partners wouldn’t just have a headache to worry about the next day. </p><p>“Such a careless servant,” I said even as I grabbed the goblet she passed to me, only wrap an arm around her waist, while pouring some of the wine on her tits, big enough to fill my palm despite her lithe frame, and started licking it off my skin. “Luckily, you provide good service.” </p><p>She started wiggling like she was trying to get out of my grasp, though it would have been at least slightly convincing when she put her hands on my chest, she had spent more than a second trying to push before letting her fingers explore my muscles. “Naughty whore,” I muttered, which made her look scandalized for a fleeting moment before I stole her lips, kissing aggressively enough to constitute an invasion. </p><p>There was no time wasted before she declared her surrender, however, accepting my annexation with open arms. I let my hand around her waist slip lower, squeezing her ass hard enough to leave a mark. She moaned beautifully and I pulled back. I resumed the kiss after giving her a sip of the wine, adding a delicious aroma to the battle of our tongues. </p><p>With both of my hands occupied with the dark-skinned beauty, the blonde kneeling in front of me was free to pull back. She actually did pull back from the aggressive deepthroat I was making her deliver, but considering she repositioned herself slight to be more visible to her peers before she started licking, sucking, and kissing my entire length, with moans to show just how much she was enjoying the moment, I was willing to let it slide. She was really making a spectacle of herself as she sold her enjoyment successfully. </p><p>So successfully that, while I was lost in a kiss with the beauty in my arms I felt a tongue on my balls. Not too remarkable, unless counting the fact that I could still feel a pair of lips around my girth. When my gaze slipped down, I noticed a second blonde head, responsible for the lips around my girth while the first one moved down to lick my balls. The second one looked up even as she pushed her lips forward, looking like a deer ambushed by a hunter, but still pushing forward. </p><p>It was a memorable spectacle, their licks and moans mixing together to create an accompanying song. </p><p>Everyone else just watched in rapt silence, enjoying as a barbarian working on three noble ladies at the same time. Though, despite their silence, more than one was currently caressing their cores, some dazed enough to suggest that they were not even aware of it. </p><p>I turned to face Olivia, with a mocking smile on my lips, who was sitting alone as Cera served Atia enthusiastically, no doubt happy to make herself valuable to their friends. I had no idea which family Atia belonged to, but the fact she was a friend of Olivia and not just a follower, in addition to Cera’s enthusiasm to make her happy, suggested a high-ranking person. Likely the daughter of a senator, maybe even the daughter of an Ex-Praetor or a Quaestor. Regardless of her position and her earlier reluctance, however, she was clearly enjoying the service she was receiving. </p><p>“So, enjoying the show?” I asked Olivia even as I pushed my chest forward, giving the olive-skinned beauty a chance to breathe. </p><p>“More than I expected,” Olivia answered calmly as she took a sip of her wine, savoring the liquid as she savored the wine. Despite her clear signs of arousal —not to mention her being a fan— she was keeping herself back in a deliberate manner. I didn’t know whether she had no intention of partaking in the fun, or just waiting for the others to finish with their entertainment first before she joined. Regardless, I let her continue to enjoy the show. She was the only one I couldn’t push carelessly.  </p><p>Luckily, waiting for her to get into the mood wasn’t exactly a chore. A room full of beautiful noble ladies that were ready to be properly dominated was not exactly subpar entertainment. </p><p>One of the other girls, this time a brown-haired, doe-eyed cutie, finally gathered her courage and moved forward to join the fun, carrying a plate of grape with her. I opened my mouth, enjoying the bite she fed to me, my smirk widening greatly as I chewed the grape that was chilled to perfection, before leaning down to steal a kiss from her pouty lips, making her doe eyes even bigger. </p><p>She didn’t pull back, however, more than happy to share the taste of the grape with me, while the other three played around with various parts of my body. Then, I noticed yet another beauty walking across the room, this one with assets large enough to almost rival the previous busty beauty I had fucked into unconsciousness, her tits jiggling, her hips swaying hypnotically with each step, radiating arousal. </p><p>She tapped the shoulders of the blondes who were busy worshipping my cock. “Give others a bit of chance as well, ladies,” she whispered. From the speed the other two pulled back, I guessed that she ranked higher in the totem pole of nobility, but that part wasn’t as interesting as the way her tits wrapped around my girth, moving up and down with a spectacular passion. </p><p>The second blonde pulled back, but the first one decided to stick around, rising up enough to start licking my chest muscles line by line even as her hands squeezed my arms, enjoying my muscular frame. I let one of my hands slip down to reward my latest visitor, groping her fabulous tits that were busy wrapping around my shaft. When the blonde decided to move down again, this time-bending down to capture the head between her lips. </p><p>It was a good time to properly cut loose, I thought even as I grabbed the hair of the curly beauty that was busy using her tits, pushing her down, and throwing the blonde one on top of her. “Kiss her,” I ordered even as I slipped into the blonde, pushing mercilessly. The resulting moan was spectacular, echoing in the room beautifully. Meanwhile, my hands landed on the generous hips of the one under her, slapping and squeezing, trusting the blonde to properly silence her. </p><p>Though, the blonde’s ability to keep her silent turned out to be faulty, because the moment I pulled out of her and slipped inside the wetness of the busty one, her cries rose unbidden. “Careful on your task,” I said even as I slapped the blonde’s ass, making her cry in pain, mixing it with the unobstructed moans of her temporary companions. </p><p>I started impaling both of them recklessly, shifting after every few pumps, but if their moans were any indicator, they didn’t exactly care about the intermittent service, the depth of my pushes clearly more than enough to compensate for shorter cycles. Seeing that they were sufficiently happy, I turned my gaze to the cuties who decided to take the role of a servant, one still carrying the wine, the other grapes. </p><p>I grabbed their hands simultaneously and pulled them closer, one on my right, the other on my left. “Wine,” I ordered. She immediately leaned down, allowing me to take a sip from the goblet, only to spill it badly when I surprised her by slipping my fingers into her naked wetness without a warning. She moaned as I turned to the doe-eyed beauty, only to find her already reaching down with a grape, her face alight with anticipation. </p><p>Luckily, I still had one unoccupied hand, rewarding her with another ruthless finger treatment, while the room filled with extreme moans. Meanwhile, the other women continued to watch in anticipation, creating a threat more likely to kill me from exhaustion if it wasn’t for my transformation. </p><p>I never have imagined a bunch of noblewomen could be more threatening than a chimera… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching Tiffany and Umi walk away was a unique treat, the confidence of the redhead contrasting greatly with the shyness of the brunette as they slowly disappeared into the restaurant, while I seared the sight of their swaying lips into my mind. </p><p>I was resigned to boredom until their return, assessing the relative merits of flirting with the waitress versus playing with my phone, when my phone rang from a call from Tiffany. Curious, I answered, only to hear Umi speaking from a distance. </p><p>“Wasn’t that a bit … much,” she murmured. Even without seeing her face, I could imagine her expression, her black eyes wide, and her pouty lips trembling. </p><p>“Oh, honey, don’t be naive,” Tiffany answered, her voice similarly distant. Her ploy was clear. She had called me so that I could get a sneak peek of their discussion. Such a thoughtful little kitten, maybe even to a point of deserving a second pair of shoes in our promised shopping trip.</p><p>“But weren’t we just going to flirt with him slightly, nothing more,” Umi pushed, well what counted pushing in her land of minimal assertiveness. Coming from anyone else, that tone could only be classified as a kind remark. </p><p>“Sweetheart, don’t be naive,” Tiffany said. “He’s a rich and powerful businessman, not a teenager at high school. Do you really think that you could make him sign tens of thousand dollars in bonus just by fluttering your pretty eyelashes? We need to impress him. Really impress him.” </p><p>“But your husband said-” Umi countered, her voice getting higher. It was a pity that I wasn’t with them, seeing her expression blossoming into doubt and shock. I had no doubt that it would have been an amazing expression. </p><p>“My husband said what he thinks as the truth,” Tiffany cut her off. </p><p>“But, that’s…” Umi tried to answer, only to fail halfway. I was willing to bet that she was about to accuse Tiffany of cheating on her husband but lacked the courage to do so. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie. Being a housewife is more complicated than you think. You need to make some sacrifices occasionally, unless you want your husband to work late every single night while others get the credit. But you need to keep your husband away from the more gritter aspect. It’s what being a good housewife means in this century.” </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed as I listened to the pure drivel Tiffany was spewing, only to sound halfway believable coming from her beautiful lips. </p><p>The silence stretched for a while Umi considered her words. With her decision-making impaired by the fancy hotel that she was clearly not too used to combined with the natural trust she had toward Tiffany —a natural consequence of her mentality of them against me, unaware that the game was rigged from the start— Umi was finding hard to put an effective defense. “How far?” she finally asked after a minute of silence. </p><p>“How far, what, sweetheart?” Tiffany said, not hiding her small but mocking giggle. </p><p>“How far we need to go?” she asked. “I don’t want to betray my soon-to-be husband. I can’t,” she repeated. </p><p>“Decisive, I like it,” Tiffany said before pausing for a moment. “It depends on you, sweetie. The more you give, the more your husband benefits. There’s a lot of things we could do without betraying your husband. Do you have a swimsuit with you, for example?” </p><p>“I do,” she said. </p><p>“No you don’t, not if they are anything like your other horrible clothing,” Tiffany said sharply. Umi gasped. “Don’t be offended, honey, I’m just trying to help you. You have two options. Either get physical or impress him from a distance. And since you don’t want to do the first one, you need to do the second.” </p><p>Umi spoke only after another lengthy pause. “I don’t know, maybe I should just abort it. It’s not for me.” </p><p>I wasn’t worried at her words, trusting Tiffany to handle her flickering panic efficiently. “It’s your call, as long as you think he wouldn’t take it personally, feel free to do it,” Tiffany countered. </p><p>“Personal!” Umi gasped, shocked. “But we just had a dinner.” </p><p>“A dinner that you didn’t even bother to put something decent, before abandoning him halfway,” Tiffany corrected. “If you don’t give him at least something to remember you nicely, he might think you’re teasing him. And a powerful man like that doesn’t react being jerked around well.” </p><p>“But…” Umi whispered, her tone trembling. “It wasn’t what I thought…” </p><p>“I know, sweetheart. I know,” Tiffany repeated, acting like she was consoling her. “But it’s just for a night if you don’t want a repeat. I’ll do everything. You just need to stay until the end, and look pretty. Can you do that for me?” </p><p>Umi said nothing, but it wasn’t hard to imagine her nodding obediently, her resistance easily broken down, especially at the whispers of someone she marked as a friend, her trusting nature pushing her toward a different path. </p><p>“So, let’s make you more presentable, so that you can at least salvage the rest of the dinner before we go to the hot tub.” </p><p>“Hot tub, at this hour?” </p><p>“Of course, honey. Why else do you think I asked whether you have a swimsuit?” </p><p>“I thought it was for tomorrow,” Umi commented, earning yet another condescending giggle from Tiffany, who was clearly enjoying the role she was playing. But rather than Tiffany saying something, Umi gasped again. “W-what are you doing!” </p><p>“Making you more presentable, of course,” Tiffany said in a matter-of-fact tone. “But if you’re unsatisfied with impressing him from the distance and want to get closer, be my guest,” she said, before adding another giggle. “He’s certainly not bad on the eyes. I would understand it.” </p><p>“It’s not that,” Umi cried. “But do you really go as far as to remove-” she started, but I was unable to hear the rest of her sentence. This time, not because Tiffany cut her off, but because she turned off the call, no doubt not wanting me to listen to the details of their fashion choices. </p><p>It was a good call, as my mind was already churning possible adjustments she could make on Umi’s clothing. Unfortunately, there weren’t a lot of options since she was wearing jeans, which, unlike a skirt, couldn’t be adjusted conveniently. </p><p>When they appeared in my sight again, however, I was very happy with the results. Since her jean was not something Tiffany could resolve in a few minutes, she decided to focus on Umi’s white blouse. Since it was an already tight fit, even a little change had the potential to look amazing, especially with Umi’s sizable bosom. </p><p>However, what Tiffany had managed to apply was far more than a little change. I had no idea how, but after closing the phone, she had managed to convince Umi to take off her bra, which created a spectacular view as her hard nipples pushed against the tight fabric. </p><p>Her lack of a bra was already obvious, but Tiffany went all the way to make sure it was noticed, strategically unlocking three buttons from the top, turning Umi’s basic shirt into a delicious accessory fit for a nighttime club visit. </p><p>I shared a smirk with Tiffany while Umi kept her gaze on the floor, her shame preventing her from actually doing something. She looked at me, gesturing toward Umi, followed by a rather suggestive sign, and I just nodded, giving her permission to push forward. </p><p>Umi wasn’t the first submissive woman that found herself in my tender mercies, and wouldn’t be the last. Ultimately, seducing her was nothing too interesting. </p><p>Watching Tiffany as she seduced her, however, promised to be much more interesting. Umi was too distracted to notice the slight shuffle I had conveyed, making sure when Tiffany sat next to me, Umi would sit on the most concealed spot on the booth, giving Tiffany a full range to pull her tricks. </p><p>“So, where did you girls disappear, leaving me alone for such a long time,” I said, intentionally not commenting on Umi’s enhanced cleavage, though I made sure to throw an extended glance, enjoying the way she shivered under my gaze. </p><p>“Hey, you’re lucky enough to get the attention of two sexy ladies, waiting a few minutes is the least you can do,” Tiffany said as she slapped my arm playfully, never one to miss the opportunity for some casual physical contact. After the slap, her hand stayed around my arm, squeezing gently. </p><p>I just grinned, trying to maintain a friendly and welcoming attitude, though not bothering to hide the undertones of arousal. At this point, it was not about hiding my intentions, but not scaring off Umi while Tiffany worked her supposed magic that would teach Umi about the benefits of deviancy. </p><p>“You’re right. I’m lucky enough to get the company of two unbelievably beautiful women. I shouldn’t be complaining,\" I said, putting my hand on her thigh even as I said so, directly under her short dress. </p><p>Umi threw a shocked glance down where my hand disappeared, shocked by the sudden intensity of our closeness. And as Tiffany skid closer, her thigh touching mine, there was no doubt about her enjoyment of the situation. </p><p>“So, what else you have planned for the evening,” Tiffany asked even as her legs parted open, allowing my fingers to tease her wetness over her panties, which was small enough not to exist from a practical perspective. </p><p>“I was thinking of a comfortable soak, maybe some champagne even if you ladies are interested to get some fresh air,” I said, following Tiffany’s direction. It was an interesting move on Tiffany’s part, pulling Umi’s focus on the rest of the evening right after their discussion. I would have avoided that, focusing on the moment instead. </p><p>Though, it didn’t take long for me to understand Tiffany’s strategy. As I continued to molest her even more obviously —following her directions— she started sharing glances with Umi, ones that were designed to elicit sympathy. </p><p>Smart, I thought, trying to jerk Umi’s emotions through letting her friend suffer, especially after her declaration of making a sacrifice to protect Umi’s purity. As my touches intensified, she was slowly developing the image of a good friend that was throwing herself to indignity to protect her bestie. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly a strong narrative considering both of them were here at my table to get some illegal kickback for their husbands under their husbands’ request —though the poor bastards were definitely not aware of the true nature of the sacrifice. </p><p>However, Umi wasn’t the most discerning audience either. </p><p>At first, I continued speaking, sharing anecdotes and jokes in a suave tone that wouldn’t be remiss in a formal dinner, completely opposite of what was going on with my fingers, getting more and more aggressive, even as I was starting to get curious about what Tiffany was planning to do. Because, Tiffany’s climax wasn’t too distant, which would twist the nature of the evening completely. </p><p>Then, Tiffany slid away just as she was about to climax. “Do you mind if I catch my breath a bit,” Tiffany said, trying to sound distressed, but as she danced on the edge, her labored breaths radiated a desire for sex. </p><p>Luckily for her, Umi’s panicked expression reflected that she believed the role Tiffany was trying to sell, missing the significance of her bodily reaction. </p><p>Tiffany’s plan was not complex, and I decided to help her a bit. “I don’t know,” I said with sudden sternness. “The night is already half as fun as I expected,” I added as I glanced toward Umi, blaming her for my poor mood, intensifying the guilt she was feeling. “So, unless she helps you to put a show while you recover…” I murmured before letting it fade. At my position, I didn’t actually need to use a threat to pressure them. </p><p>“You would help me, would you, Umi?” Tiffany asked as she turned toward her, catching her gaze. The poor little girl was far too inexperienced and trusting to do anything else but not obediently, unaware of what she had just signed up for. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I let my hand slip down to Tiffany’s ass as we entered the bar, which, considering her short dress, was rather obscene. I didn’t care about being seen because of the special design of the place, which was geared for absolute privacy, even at the entrance. The hotel didn’t explicitly say it, but it was clear that the place was designed for people having extramarital affairs, allowing them to enjoy a semi-public space without fearing to be seen. Each group had their own booth, with absolutely no visibility between them. </p><p>Perfect place to seduce a shy half-Asian beauty. </p><p>A beautiful waitress greeted us, not even blinking at our closeness. We followed her, while I slipped my hand under Tiffany’s summer dress, enjoying her curves. “I missed you,” she whispered. “It has been a while.” </p><p>“Occasionally, even I have to work,” I answered with a chuckle. “Luckily, we have several hours to ourselves.” </p><p>Tiffany chuckled as the waitress finally brought us to our booth and took our drink orders. “Don’t make promises you’re not intending to keep. I can see that you’re besotted with Umi. You’re going to neglect me again, aren’t you?” she said playfully. </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I answered even as I placed a small kiss on her neck. “Who says we can’t work on her together?” I suggested. </p><p>“Why do you think I would be interested in such a thing,” Tiffany countered, trying to provoke me, but with limited success. </p><p>“It’s a wild guess,” I murmured even as I let my hand trail down from her waist to her thigh before I took a sudden turn, climbing up her leg, underneath her skirt, until my fingers touched her panties, feeling her wetness. “And it seems that your body agrees.” </p><p>“You’re an evil old man,” she said as she giggled, while I continued to caress her thigh. She sighed. “But yes, I’m not against the idea of sharing that tasty geisha between us,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, interrupting myself as I leaned down and stole a kiss from her elegant neck. “Actually, why don’t you text her and make sure she wears something more appropriate for the occasion. I’m sure her fiancee would be happy for your help.” </p><p>“Why not?” she said as she pulled off her phone, and sent a quick message to her. Meanwhile, I continued caressing her inner thigh to push her arousal further, but not pushing for more. I wanted her to panting and ready to go when Umi arrived, as it would make the situation even more interesting, with one trying to slow things down while the other trying to push things even more. </p><p>Even as I teased her, I watched her screen as she started a rapid digital conversation with Umi, starting soft at first to increase the sense of familiarity with the idea. Umi’s reluctance was obvious. Clearly, she was only doing that because her fiancee agreed, and her fiancee only agreed because he was too spineless to actually reject a ‘sensible’ recommendation from his direct boss Mike. </p><p>After five minutes of chatting, Umi finally mentioned that her fiancee left the room for a night of drinking along with Mike. Tiffany chose that moment to open the more important part of the discussion, namely, what she should wear for our little dinner. At Tiffany’s insistence, she started sharing pictures of her evening wear, unfortunately by laying the clothes on her bed rather than trying them on. A true pity. </p><p>“Damn, is she a nun?” Tiffany murmured after she shared three conservative dresses with ankle-length skirts consecutively, finally writing a reply that asked her to dress more revealing. </p><p>“Don’t be so shocked. She was clearly raised in a conservative household,” I said. “But I’m sure you can convince her to be a bit more adventurous.” </p><p>“Is there a reward for doing so?” she asked, her ruby lips curling suggestively. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” I asked. </p><p>“I remember seeing a magnificent pair of shoes recently, and they have a franchise here. Unfortunately, they’re a bit expensive for my dear husband’s budget, even with the recent bonuses.” </p><p>“How much?” I asked. My eyebrows quirked when she whispered the price into my ear. “Not bad, at least not expensive as a car,” I said with a chuckle. I asked, because I had learned my lesson after offhandedly making the same promise to Elena about a dress after she helped me to convince the wife of a business partner, only to set me back mid-five-figures. “I agree, but I have a condition of my own,” I added. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she gasped even as she wrote another quick reply to Umi, trying to convince her to wear a white sleeveless blouse. It was not exactly revealing, but I could see what she had in mind. The buttons on the front meant that we could bargain her about her cleavage the whole night. Important, since I wanted to taste those spectacular breasts. </p><p>“I want to come with you to the store, so you can model for me in them, and maybe only them,” I answered, catching her lips in a searing kiss as she parted them. </p><p>“Naughty,” she answered. “I might do so if the store is empty. And worst case, we will have the dressing cabin.” </p><p>“Excellent idea,” I murmured as I focused on her neck once more, creating a trail of kisses while she tried to convince Umi to wear a short skirt, but failed in that effort. Still, she managed to convince her to wear a pair of skinny jeans, a nice consolation price under the circumstances. I pulled back when Umi sent a message telling that she would arrive in a few minutes, giving Tiffany enough time to fix her attire, not wanting to scare our guest immediately. </p><p>We were sipping our drinks when Umi walked in, accompanied by a waitress. Since I was a part of the decision-making process — through Umi was unaware of that particular fact — I wasn’t surprised by what she was wearing, but I was surprised by the way she filled the chosen clothes. Her white blouse was tight enough to strain the buttons in front of it, looking like it was about to collapse in one wrong movement. However, the generous size of her breasts was not a surprise, since even with the conservative dress earlier, they were apparent. </p><p>Her smooth legs, easily slipping into her tight jeans was a nice surprise, especially since her ass was still wide enough to rival her breasts. I couldn’t help to dig my fingers into their wide expanse. </p><p>“Good evening, sir,” Umi murmured. I was about to correct her, but then the idea of a shy half-Asian woman constantly calling me sir was too tempting to pass. </p><p>“Good evening, sweetie,” I answered. “Any preference for a drink? Maybe a cute cosmopolitan?” </p><p>“White wine, please,” she murmured as she moved to sit next to Tiffany, only for Tiffany to gesture her to sit on my left. I acted unaware of that little exchange, looking occupied with the menu, and ordered a few starters as well to fill our stomach. I was hungry after spending all that energy with Jenny, and needed some refreshment if I were to satisfy my other redheaded acquaintance as well as my surprise brunette friend. </p><p>“So, Umi. Tell me, how do you like being a part of our corporate family,” I asked directly, before she could ever have time to get over the fact that she needed to sit next to me while she flirted with me. </p><p>“It’s - wonderful,” she managed to say after a small pause. “The hours are good, and the pay is satisfactory. My husband loves his job a lot.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I answered even as I brought my gaze to her face, making sure our eyes connected before letting it trail down her neck, getting the glimpse of her modest cleavage before climbing up. “I’m happy to see the happiness of my team. Some people would complain about their partners constantly traveling. I’m happy to see that you’re not one of those.” </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she murmured, unable to prevent her blush against my explicit attempt of enjoying her sight. </p><p>“So, how do you fill your long nights when your fiancee is away. Any hobbies?” I asked, once again pushing forward rather explicitly. Since Mike had sold me as an old-fashioned powerful boss, I had no problems playing that particular role, curious how she would react against my authority. She was giving major submissive vibes, and I was curious about the extent of it. </p><p>She murmured a response, so low that I was unable to hear. “Speak louder, sweetie,” I said, my sharp tone compensating for the softness of my words. “The rest of the class needs to hear you.” </p><p>“Sorry, sir,” she murmured, her eyes pointing at the ground, not unlike a student who just received an admonishment from her favorite teacher. Maybe it would be even easier than I first thought. Her answer was cut short when the waitress came with her drink and the food. While the waitress placed the orders, Tiffany typed a quick message to Umi, while tipping the screen low enough that I could read it from the corner of my eye. She told her to use the opportunity to flirt a bit to get a better bonus for her fiancee, that it was the whole point of their presence. </p><p>Umi’s reaction to the message was frustration. Rather than saying anything, she reached for the glass and drank most of her wine in one long sip, seeking courage in the bottom of the glass. “Hmm…” she murmured, giving her some time to put together a response. “Nothing much,” she answered in the end. “I don’t have a lot of friends, so I usually stay inside, mostly relaxing in a bath,” she answered, her blush intensifying with each word. The fact that she was referring to her naked state, even indirectly, seemed to hit her limit.  </p><p>“That’s a nice image to remember when I’m back in my room,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>Tiffany joined in the discussion while Umi dipped her head down even lower, trying to process the implication that I would be imagining her naked. “Come on, Nathan,” she said as she gripped my bicep. “Aren’t you going to ask me the same question? I’m beginning to feel neglected.” </p><p>“My bad, sweetheart. Tell me, what do you do when you’re alone.” </p><p>“Umm…” she suddenly murmured, something that was very much against her personality, making me wonder what she had in mind. “Do you mind if I run my answer through Umi first? I’m not sure if it’s appropriate,” she added, and I smiled knowingly. Even as she left the booth, I noticed her subtly pulling her dress higher, displaying more of her beautiful legs, her hips dancing erotically with each exaggerated step, something Umi also noticed if her shocked gaze was any indicator. </p><p>When Tiffany sat next to Umi and started whispering, I was afraid that Umi was about to faint in shock. She was definitely showing the signs of it, her blush thickening as Tiffany continued to whisper, and when she finally pulled back, Umi glowed as bright as a lamp. “What do you think?” Tiffany asked. “Can I share that?” </p><p>“I … don’t think so,” Umi murmured shyly. </p><p>“Really,” Tiffany said with a crystal laugh, making a point of putting her hand on Umi’s thigh as she chuckled, but didn’t pull her hand away when she stopped laughing, squeezing tight instead. “Sorry Nathan, my story had been vetoed.” </p><p>“It’s a pity,” I answered with an exaggerated sigh while I turned my gaze back to Umi, enjoying the way she squirmed under my gaze. “So, do you mind summarizing the story in a PG manner?” </p><p>“I rather not, sir,” she murmured, but her determination folded quickly under my sharp gaze. She turned to Tiffany, only to receive another encouraging squeeze while Tiffany’s hand climbed higher on her thigh. “She mentioned that… She spent a lot of time taking baths as well, but also with a massage wand.” </p><p>“Interesting, but I don’t see why it’s an appropriate story,” I said, acting dense. </p><p>Umi looked frustrated, unable to answer, while Tiffany laughed and cut it. “That’s because you have never seen me getting a massage. I can be … expressive when receiving a massage.” </p><p>“How interesting,” I said. “I’m not a bad masseuse myself, why don’t you come here and show me just how expressive you can be while getting a massage,” I said. Meanwhile, the waitress came with another round of drinks, and once again Umi grabbed her white wine, using it to drown her shyness. A very bad strategy under the circumstances, I noted. </p><p>“Why not,” Tiffany said and stood up, once again walking with a slow, deliberate eroticism. I was interested to note Amy’s eyes getting stuck on Tiffany’s beautiful legs, enjoying the sight. When she arrived back at my side, she sat inappropriately close, our legs brushing together, something that managed to shock Umi in the process. But her surprise was nothing compared to when Tiffany leaned down and removed her heeled shoe rather than turning her back. After removing her shoe, she slid back and put her foot on my lap, not particularly bothered by the way her dress climbed higher while she did so. </p><p>I put my fingers on the bottom of her feet, gently rubbing. It wasn’t the first foot massage I had given to her, so it was easy to identify her moan as exaggerated, though it was convincing enough to make Umi blush even more. I looked down, enjoying the sight of her beautiful leg while Tiffany continued to moan, the guttural sound enough to make my heart tingle. As a curvy redhead, she was the epitome of sexiness even discounting her impressive skills of acting. </p><p>I slowly worked my way up to her calves, then her thighs, each moan making Umi more uncomfortable, and she continued to rely on her wine to process that feeling, slowly getting tipsy. She didn’t seem to have a lot of resistance to alcohol, so when the waitress moved to refill our drinks, I gestured her to stop. Tipsy was nice, but drunk was not, especially for the first time. </p><p>“How was it,” I said as I pulled my hands away rather than continuing to her thighs. Not because I didn’t want to, or felt shy doing it, but because I was afraid of Umi running away. The last few moans had already pushed her to the limit. As Tiffany leaned to put on her shoe once more, I managed to whisper, asking her to have a private talk with Umi. </p><p>“That was nice,” Tiffany said relaxedly. “But I definitely need to refresh my makeup after this. Umi, would you like to accompany me to the bathroom?” </p><p>“S-sure,” Umi stammered as she jumped up to her feet, more than happy to take the opportunity to get away from the situation, and from her inquiring gaze, she intended to talk Tiffany about the limits of their ploy. </p><p>I leaned back, curious about the outcome… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Another elemental conjuration later, I was freely flying on the sky, ready to visit Titania to test the limits of the Divine Spark injection. The repair of my soul space was already completed thanks to the latest stat increase from the —likely misleading— an achievement I had received earlier, which increased my capabilities significantly. Even in my current extreme stat spread, five points of stats across the board was not something to snuff at. Most people failed to gather that much in their whole life. </p><p>Since I didn’t want to waste the traveling time, I decided to experiment with the divine light node resting in my fake soul space. Integrating it into my own soul space was out of the question, naturally. Even if my System wouldn’t have devoured it immediately, it still didn’t remove the requirement of tricking the headmistress. </p><p>Instead, I decided to use it as a focus, similar to an external magical item. A simple push of featureless mana later, created a bright explosion of light, even sharper than I expected. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured as I repeated it a couple of times, to understand the effect. Essentially, it worked as a static converter, adding an overwhelming light element to mana, though devouring some of the mana in the process. It took a while to get a better understanding of how to arrange the portions. </p><p>Then, I focused on testing natured mana. The elemental mana resulted in some rather volatile results, forcing me to stop that track rather early. It wasn’t impossible, but it required a more suitable location —and maybe a few wards to prevent dangerous accidents. Still, I wanted to experiment on that, excited about just how much damage a light-infused fireball could inflict on a pack of bone dragons. </p><p>Arcana worked better. It didn’t create any synergy in terms of damage like infusing it with other elements, but it allowed me to use the light element in a more nimble way. It wasn’t as cost-effective as casting it directly, of course, but if there was one thing I wasn’t currently lacking, that was mana. </p><p>Things started to get interesting when I started to use it in conjunction with Biomancy. It didn’t work with healing magic, on the contrary, turning it into an unstable mess, too sharp to heal, but too soft to hurt anyone. The energy I termed as life energy, the kind I used to detect and destroy undead, however, mashed with the light magic perfectly. </p><p>To lack of a better term, the life energy was as soft as healing energy, making it difficult to deliver it in range, both in terms of detection and damaging undead. I had circumvented the first part by dumping an ungodly amount of mana to it, and the second application was viable because of the excessive weakness of the undead. Still, life energy wasn’t the most viable energy for weaponizing. </p><p>Mixing it with light mana worked perfectly. The light worked as a delivery mechanism, carrying the light energy to the distance without losing its shape and energy, increasing its ranged viability several times, both in terms of damage delivery and detection. </p><p>Enough to make me tempted to find Zokras the Eternal and his death knights, to see whether I could turn his title to an obsolete piece of history. </p><p>As I continued to play with the life magic and light magic, trying to find the best mixture for different purposes, I suddenly felt a muffled reaction, barely noticeable even to my sharp senses. With a frown, I repeated the detection magic, but this time as an actual spell rather than idle experimentation. </p><p>[-641 Mana] </p><p>With the increase of power, several dark presences popped into my detection range, making my eyes widen in surprise by the sheer amount. None of the groups I had detected was particularly strong, but the sheer number of small pockets I had detected in the range surprised me. Their presence was muffled, indicating that they were behind some innovative wards to hide their presence. Not to mention, they were quite deep in the ground, likely reached their position from an underground tunnel. </p><p>I would have been surprised, but considering the huge underground roads that connected the necromancer base with the various access points, established without anyone being aware of, establishing some small undead pockets wasn’t too challenging. </p><p>After quickly destroying the detected ones, I started circling the school, creating huge circles, destroying every detected one immediately. As I destroyed them, I started cataloging the result. </p><p>The first important detail was their strength, or more accurately, a lack of it. None of them were particularly strong. Most of the pockets had an average of Class Five power or lower, with the occasional stronger one barely reaching Class 8. Still, considering there were hundreds of those little pockets, they were still a dangerous threat. </p><p>There were far too many to be placed around during the last month, not without being detected even with the assistance of their spies in the faculty. Most likely, even a year wasn’t enough, proving that the plan to take down the school had been going on for a long time. </p><p>I continued to destroy those pockets, despite the fact that I wasn’t expecting them to attack the school immediately. </p><p>Their strategy clearly changed from an overwhelming ambush to an extended siege, forcing Silver Spires to either lose the surrounding towns to weaken it permanently —both in terms of logistics and reputation— before they launched a final attack from all directions, using the undead packets they had created. </p><p>Still, destroying them was the better idea. Since my latest assault on their base, they were aware of my presence, so enhancing my reputation wouldn’t hurt, even though destroying them wasn’t particularly difficult. And that was only the case if the necromancers had detected their destruction. There was a good chance that they wouldn’t be aware of their disappearance until they tried to summon them.</p><p>Their concealment wards were that good, and there was no warning flare occurring after their distraction —no doubt to prevent their detection when the underground monsters discovered their presence and destroyed them. </p><p>I had a calm smile on my face as I destroyed the dormant zombies and other abominations, using earth magic to grind them into pieces with a leisure pace before injecting a dash of life energy to purify the remains. </p><p>As I continued my search to clean up a wide area around the school, I couldn’t help but pity Zokras, or whoever was behind the complicated plan to take down Silver Spires. They went all that effort and came up with an amazing strategy. Even the last part was an amazing stroke of genius. </p><p>With disposable monsters hidden under an area that was assumed to be safe, they could have waited until the reinforcements that were sent to the surrounding towns started to return, attacking them with their main forces to threaten those forces to retreat faster, before suddenly launching the attacks of hundreds of small undead groups from the rear, utterly shredding the defenders in a deadly ambush. </p><p>Pity that my unique combination of skills destroyed yet another deadly plan. From an intellectual perspective, I couldn’t help but pity them. After years of planning and effort, their contingencies were being destroyed by me one by one. </p><p>And to make things worse, it wasn’t the first time I had ruined one of their plans. Even before my latest achievement, three of their dangerous strategic ploys —surprise undead assault before the school could establish defenses, artificial beast hordes, and fake hordes with exploding gems— had been ruined through my involvement, a count that didn’t even include many smaller tactical operations I had prevented, from saving the Dragon they had been trying to corrupt to saving Titania from two deadly ambushes, as well as finding their plans to break the defensive wards of the school and repairing them… </p><p>I was the sole reason for the current stalemate wasn’t a devastating defeat. </p><p>At the first glance, a stalemate looked to their benefit. After all, due to their nature, necromancers could reinforce their armies endlessly while we could only lose ours in battle, but that didn’t factor in the overwhelming advantage of our current defensive position.</p><p>As the many citizens, as well as some of the weaker students, took the walls to defend the towns against the endless monster assaults, a significant number of them would level up in the process. Hunting in the wilderness was significantly harder than shooting arrows from the walls, and a lucky hit to an already dying Class Ten beast could give enough experience to level up a peasant a couple of levels immediately, maybe even an achievement or two for overwhelming power difference if they were lucky. As a result, the more the cities survived against the monster hordes, the stronger the defenses would get. And if they dared to attack one with enough strength to raze the towns, they would open themselves to counterattack. </p><p>I doubted Zokras was enthusiastic about taking the field after losing five precious death knights in his own base, along with an impressive number of liches a huge chunk of the army. Combined with my mysterious identity, I was literally a weapon of mass destruction tailored to take down the undead, and to make things even worse, I could sneak attack. They still didn’t know who I was, no one really did. Even if they identified me correctly, my previous reputation was so horrible that it looked like a badly arranged cover job. </p><p>I wondered how the headmistress would have reacted if she knew that a horny midnight adventure of two salacious students was the only thing that saved Silver Spires from a certain doom… </p><p>With a sigh, I continued to destroy all the undead pockets I could discover. It was a boring, grueling task despite my recently enhanced abilities, making me waste several hours in the process. It would have been faster if I could have burned mana freely to detect them, but that would have alerted others to my presence. Light-infused life energy wasn’t exactly the subtlest magic one could cast, after all.

    "content": "<p>The sensation of absorbing the divine spark was an interesting feeling, somehow a mixture of taking a soft, lingering sip from an excellent wine, and drinking a sip of water desperately after a week’s journey through a desert, displaying both the soft comfort of the first and the desperation of the second simultaneously. </p><p>Still, it was an amazing sensation, overwhelming even without the fact that I would be able to level up again, and even progress the Companion Process as an excellent bonus. It was slowly absorbed being into my soul space. The system probably would have liked to absorb it immediately, but that part failed due to the interference of her wards, the same wards that prevented the proficiency increase for the skills and gaining experience… Still, as long as the amount of Divine Spark became too overwhelming in my soul space, it was not a big problem.  </p><p>The process to steal some of the Divine Spark from her was complicated, but once established, it was mostly self-reinforcing, allowing me to focus on other things. I turned my attention on the headmistress, her beautiful face strained with the weight of the action she was doing, her focus impeccable. </p><p>It was the perfect time to examine her status. I carefully constructed a mana probe, weak yet stable, before pushing it into her body. Her own body was chaotic enough with her throbbing mana, making it impossible for her to detect my little trick. </p><p>It also made it difficult for my mana probe to survive, forcing me to recreate probe after probe to search for her soul space, only to fail repeatedly despite my intensive effort. She might be hiding her soul space, of course, but she was clearly straining her own ability to the limit to channel the divine spark. Why should she bother to hide her soul space so thoroughly? Even if she suspected tricks from me, reinforcing its defenses was much easier than hiding it completely. </p><p>I created another probe, this time much stronger, taking the risk of getting caught, pushing even deeper into her body to find the connection point with the system. Then, I plunged that probe into her mana flow, tracing it toward the source, the only location I hadn’t checked. </p><p>Initially, I wasn’t expecting to find anything, because I had assumed the flow was coming from the crystal platform rather than her, because I assumed the platform was holding the divine spark, and she was just channeling it. It certainly made sense when considering the ability of the platform. As the mana probe traveled deeper into the mana flow, deeper into her body rather than the platform, however, I was forced to rethink that assumption. </p><p>When I finally found a metaphorical space, reinforced by layers and layers of mana, my eyes widened in surprise for two reasons. First, it was clearly not a soul space, and combined with my fruitless search that checked every other possible location, it wasn’t hard to conclude that she lacked a soul space altogether. </p><p>Shocking, but not as shocking as it would have been before listening to her story about the root of the system. Knowing that it was an artificial construct of relatively recent origins, developed by the enemies of her faction, her lack of a system was interesting, but not exactly enough to shake my worldview. Combined with her ability to block the system in her tower, it was something I should have guessed. </p><p>The second discovery was much more interesting. Inside her reinforced containment unit, I had found an energy source that was getting more familiar with each passing minute. She was holding the Divine Spark inside her body. Which was an interesting choice, considering she had a perfectly viable container in the form of the platform. I was yet to decipher the platform’s full range of functions, but based on my work on the broken remains of the spear, I was absolutely sure that it could contain the divine spark inside her infinitely with no side effect. </p><p>Which left the question, why she was carrying it inside her despite the obvious disadvantages. </p><p>Unfortunately, before I could deepen my probe, the strain on her face started to strengthen, and her mana flow started to decrease. I dispersed my mana probe hurriedly before she could notice it. </p><p>Once the mana flow slowed down, she stopped mixing Divine Spark, and instead focused on absorbing her mana. The moment it stopped, however, her mana rushed inside me once more, no less intense, but with much better control. If she maintained that intensity while examining my body, I had no chance of hiding my real soul space if she used that to search for it, but luckily, she was panting in exhaustion already. </p><p>Not the best mood to do something that was completely unnecessary —from her perspective— just to be on the safe side. </p><p>Instead, she focused that mana on my fake soul space, examining the small core of transformed divine spark, much smaller than what Titania had been carrying. It was a difference that couldn’t be explained by the small amount of Divine Spark I managed to steal. </p><p>“You’ll visit me for the rest of the week, just before the dawn every time,” she said, trying to sound impervious to hide her exhausted state. Since my own Companion node also required repeated attempts to fully form, I wasn’t too surprised by her words.  </p><p>“As you wish, headmistress,” I said as I stood up, trying to ignore the way her sweaty robe stuck to her body. The robe was too thick to make it an erotic sight, but the hints of curves were just enough to trigger the memories of her beautiful nakedness, making my mouth water. </p><p>Even then, I wasn’t particularly broken as I left the headmistress behind, too interested in the amount of divine spark that filled my real soul space, still moving, unlike the Node that was created in my soul space. I could have still destroyed that node to recover the divine spark it went to its construction, but since it would make the headmistress very suspicious, I didn’t follow up with that. </p><p>Luckily, it was too weak to affect me even if it hadn’t been housed in a fake soul space. </p><p>With that done, I turned my attention back to the flowing Divine Spark, still waiting for the connection with the system to occur, relatively calm as it stayed mixed with my mana. </p><p>However, the moment I stepped out of the tower —and out of the concealment of the tower— I lost all hints of control over the Divine Spark, which was devoured by the system in an instant. Not expecting such a reaction, I was barely able to maintain my own soul space as the pain hit, forcing me to grit my teeth. It was a pain that transcended physical, hurting my whole existence as it shredded an escape route through my soul space. </p><p>“Okay, no letting it absorb all of it immediately,” I murmured to myself even as I struggled to stand up, trembling badly. There was no HP loss warning, but that didn’t change the fact that I had never been that close to death, not even I had been in the necromancer base, dashing away from the scary lich and his death knights. </p><p>Luckily, repairing my soul space was something I had significant expertise on. After spending all the time using tantric to reinforce the soul space of the girls to increase their level cap, repairing my own was a simple activity. </p><p>[-5491 Mana]</p><p>A simple, yet costly activity, I corrected in my mind as I dumped more and more mana into my soul space. Not that it annoyed me much. After all, if was one thing I didn’t lack, it was mana. </p><p>I could have waited around in my room, and linger until my mana was completely recovered, reinforcing my soul space even further before the next ritual, allowing me to safely store more Divine Spark, but I received a notification that eased the process of recovery significantly. </p><p>The kind that I had been missing for a whole. </p><p>[Achievement: Devouring Divinity. Take the first step into recovering your divine power. +5 to all stats. +20000 Experience]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Grandmaster Tantric, Expert Craft, Master Speech] </p><p>Despite the significant increase in power it represented, I couldn’t help but frown as I read the notifications. Still, before pondering on the implications, I first focused on the simpler part, namely, skill selection. </p><p>Selecting Tantric was tempting. Tantric was the only reason I was able to devour Divine Spark successfully, thanks to the extraordinary flexibility it granted while synchronizing with others, not to mention, stronger my Tantric abilities, easier I could level up my companions, and likely to a higher level. Extra firepower was never something negative. </p><p>The problem, it would block my skill selection for the next five levels, a loss of flexibility I couldn’t afford, especially not before I could ascertain how much experience the Divine Spark would generate. So, I turned to the other options. </p><p>Speech was an inferior option, even with all the advantages it would grant me against the headmistress and the princess. Craft was the vital thing I needed before I repaired the spear properly. After selecting, I started thinking about the complicated structure of the spear even as I pulled a spare dagger, using my mana to reshape it. </p><p>[+9 Craft]</p><p>[-341]</p><p>A smile appeared on my lips as I saw the result. The current complexity I was dealing with was far above the skill accounted for, easily allowing me to gain more points —or more accurately, assimilating the skill node I had received from the system. </p><p>The significant improvement in the ease I was handling my mana was another beneficial perk, but even that wasn’t enough to suppress the frown that appeared on my face as I read my latest achievement again and again, my gloom deepening. </p><p>If my assumptions were correct, the System had just told me a lie, a big one. </p><p>My information about the Divine, both in terms of the gods and their lesser counterparts were extremely limited, but even my limited interaction with the Divine Spark suggested that leveling up had little to do with becoming a divine. Ultimately, the System was an external source of power that could be cut off, manipulated, or destroyed. </p><p>More importantly, I started examining the remaining scraps of power in my body, the ones that were yet to be absorbed into my body. My soul space, rather than allowing them to settle and empower my body, started to devour them as well, running contrary to the claims of resurrecting my divinity. </p><p>It was even trying to devour the node that was created in my fake soul space, forcing me to reinforce its walls to prevent the System from succeeding. Explaining its disappearance to the headmistress wouldn’t have been fun. </p><p>Also, the direct claim in the achievement, about being the resurrection of a god was another suspicious point. It wasn’t the first time the System implied something in that direction, but it was the first time it confirmed it in such a direct manner. I had no idea whether it was true or not. The existence of the gods was something I had just learned just a couple of days ago, with absolutely no idea about their nature and their life cycle. </p><p>Technically, there was a possibility that it was the truth, that I was the resurrection of a god, and my System was something I had created before my temporary destruction to enable my rise to power. </p><p>The problem, it sounded too good to be true, especially in conjunction with the existence of the widespread System, designed to devour the Divine Spark of the gods. And suddenly, my own system was asking me to do the same, baiting me with more power, and the possibility of becoming a Divine being. </p><p>It sounded too good to be true… </p><p>Funny enough, the sudden burst of suspicion didn’t change anything in my immediate plans. Whether the outlandish claim of my System was actually the truth, or it was just an excuse to force me to gather more Divine Spark, I would still visit Titania to push my level even more. </p><p>I needed more strength to survive the looming disaster first… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 467193 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 1321  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [59/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was uniquely thrilling to spank the haughty councilwoman who thought herself superior to everyone else, responsible for spinning a dangerous web of ploys and tricks from her hidden spot like a spider, trying to take control of the Empire. I was impressed with her ambition, of course, but not with her methods despite the initial success she generated, forcing Sapphire to act. </p><p>I was not impressed, not because their complicated ploys had resulted in my defeat, making me lose the fiefdom I had created after great struggle. It was the part and parcel of the struggle for power. It wasn’t the first setback I had faced, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last. I didn’t even take that personally. </p><p>No, I was not impressed, because she wasn’t the first schemer I had faced. And if there was something I had learned from my own rise of power, that schemers never won in the end. That didn’t mean that they didn’t win skirmishes. They did, especially against the target they put on their sight, in this case, the Queen. But somehow, they always forgot that such complicated conflicts forced them into a weird, static stalemate that created opportunities for others, the kind that cared little for their carefully crafted web of favors, tricks, and consequences. </p><p>Someone like a deposed dark lord, for example. </p><p>I was never impressed with the schemers was their reliance on their own plots. Too used to the comfort of their competitors reacting in the same manner, the speed they folded once their carefully crafted web was pierced by an unexpected slash of a sword by an unknown player was patently boring. </p><p>Luckily, at least, in our current delicious situation, with her laying on her desk with ripped robes that revealed her revealing thong, and my spanks exploding against her skin to turn the already pink coloring of her ass cheeks into a bright, stinging red, it was far from boring. </p><p>“Don’t stop your explanation, sweetheart,” I said softly even as another spank exploded on her bottom. “And don’t forget, due to my previous work experience, I’m really sensitive against people trying to manipulate me. I don’t react well to such little tricks.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured. </p><p>“No, you don’t, not really. Because I have a tendency to take that personally, and you don’t want to be on the other side when I take something personally.” She shivered. “Of course, you don’t have to suffer through my whims. You just need to ask, and I’ll pull back, and as long as you promise to go back to being a little councilwoman dealing with paperwork, I will even stop Sapphire pursuing you.” </p><p>“W-what?” she stammered, caught flatfooted by the sudden offer, the sudden absence of my touch surprising her even further. </p><p>She was about to stand up, when I ordered. “Did I told you to stand up?” </p><p>“S-sorry, sir,” she stammered as she continued to lay on her desk. </p><p>“To answer your rudely phrased question,” I continued with a calm tone, like she was the one acting absurd. “I don’t like to force people to work with me, so I’m offering you an option, a good option even. I’ll not only never bother you again, but I’ll even protect you from the charges of treason. I won’t even tell so many high-ranking nobles that their minds had subtly manipulated with your forbidden mind-control magic. All you need to do is to abandon your ambition and go back and play being a little politician.” </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when her answer came immediately. “No, sir, I prefer our current deal.” After all, if she were to be dissuaded from her path that easily, she wouldn’t have bothered in the first place. But my aim was still achieved. After all, I had given her an option, a very attractive option, even, meaning what was about to follow would have to be reframed in her mind. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said with a cheeky tone even as I put my hand on her thong, ripping it off her body with one aggressive pull. “Just keep in mind that you can call this off anytime if our deal is not in your taste, and I’ll let you go,” I offered, well aware that under those circumstances, such an option would be the weight that to pull her deeper rather than relief to let her float. </p><p>One didn’t become Dark Lord without learning to offer choices more effective than the strongest chain. It wasn’t my preferred way of working, I preferred to manipulate the situation until the request came from them, but against Fernhand, it was poetically fitting. </p><p>“Continue with your delicious tale of political intrigue,” I whispered even as I put my hand on her naked bottom, caressing her red cheeks, making her flinch despite the gentleness of the touch, conditioned by the earlier spanks. More surprising, however, was the utter lack of reaction as I removed my own pants, as if she was already prepared. Curious, I caressed her wet lips, only for her not to react. Well, she did tremble deliciously under the touch, but there was a distinct absence of tenseness that she felt whenever I spanked her bottom. </p><p>A moment of consideration later, I decided that was to be expected. After all, having sex to get a hint of control of the situation was her opening gambit once I revealed my identity. Why would she be bothered by when I decided to resort to that, especially if it meant that it would stop the spanking that she clearly hated, painful and demeaning in a patronizing matter simultaneously. </p><p>Luckily, the regular way wasn’t the only way to have some fun, I decided. I brought my fingers just an inch further, touching at the forbidden spot between her cheeks. Her body flinched even as my index finger brushed her puckered hole, enough to stall her explanation for a heartbeat, which might as well be shouting considering her ability to keep down her bodily reaction. I flared my mana, and a quick spell later, her entrance was properly cleaned. It was lubricated as well, but not enough to actually classify as proper, barely enough to prevent an injury, but not enough to make a comfortable experience for her. </p><p>Before she could react to my spell, I had already slipped a finger into her, earning a gasp. It wasn’t just pain that I was hearing though, there was also a sheer surprise. “Don’t tell me that no one had ever touched here,” I asked, unable to resist the temptation </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered, her tone filled with shock, but also fury. “Of course not! That’s horrible.” </p><p>“Oh, honey,” I said with a chuckle, even as I added a second finger, earning another strained cry. “You know that you can make me stop anytime, as long as you’re willing to live a life in obscurity.” </p><p>“Bastard,” she groaned angrily, which made me smile even wider. After all, it was the first honest expression I had gained from her, and it was quite a fun reaction. </p><p>“Do you want me to stop?” I asked even as I pulled out my fingers. </p><p>“No,” she answered immediately, her voice filled with panic. Clearly, while she didn’t enjoy the feeling of being penetrated aggressively in her virgin hole, she clearly appreciated the opportunity to give up her illegal gains even less. </p><p>“What do you want me, then?” I asked, not touching her. </p><p>“Whatever you want,” her answer came quickly even as she raised her bottom, far too willing to sacrifice her distaste for her benefit. I was tempted to tease her a bit more, but then, decided otherwise. I had already played with her enough. </p><p>I pressed the crown of my shaft against her puckered hole, enjoying the way she tensed before starting to push forward. Slowly, of course, to give her more than enough time to actually getaway. But she never did, just gasping as my shaft moved in inch by inch, stretching her virgin hole. </p><p>“Did I tell you to stop talking, sweetie?” I said even as another spank landed on her ass, adding another layer of pleasure to her struggle. “And don’t think that I didn’t notice the little lies you’re trying to slip, I’m keeping a tally for future punishments,” I added. It was a mostly empty threat, relying on the ambiguous nature of the statement. It was a juvenile tactic as well, one that I wouldn’t normally try against an excellent manipulator like Fernhand, but I was betting on her distracted state thanks to losing her anal virginity. </p><p>It was amusing to notice the change of pace in her tone, just enough to make me believe that she was panicking, but it was too quick, giving me a calculated feeling, suggesting that it was a fake. Still, I gave no indication that I had caught her little ruse, allowing her to think that she succeeded. After all, from the start, my aim never was the knowledge she would bother speaking. I just needed the mundane knowledge about the palace politics and the relationship between the nobles in the Light Faction, the kind I never bothered to collect before, as well as the latest developments since my capture… </p><p>Enjoying the tightness of her ass as I did so was simply a bonus. A delicious bonus. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as patted her ass gently like I was consoling a misbehaving servant, smug and understanding at the same time. My shaft continued to invade her puckered hole deeper in the process, of course, enjoying the way she stretched around me for the first time in her life, with all the humiliation it implied. </p><p>She gritted her teeth and continued to explain with a single-minded focus that frankly scared me a little. It seemed that her advantageous position against Sapphire was not a coincidence. </p><p>I started to wonder whether her reach was long enough to create the crisis in the North in the first place. </p><p>Sapphire clearly hadn’t thought so, considering the way she bet everything on the fact that Fernhand was yet to be aware of that problem—if her explanation to Aria was true, of course. Pity that even if Fernhand knew anything about it, she wouldn’t have mentioned it unless I asked explicitly, and doing so would reveal the problem to her if she didn’t already know about it. </p><p>Fernhand was dangerous enough without having me as an unintentional informant, no need to strengthen her hand even further. </p><p>Still, trying to piece the things together from a number of unreliable sources where I couldn’t even ask questions without revealing much more than I was willing to give was getting frustrating. Luckily, I had the perfect way to resolve those frustrations. I grabbed her soft, flowing hair, harshly enough to add another layer to her little punishment even before I used it as leverage to push even deeper. </p><p>Her resulting moans were simply delicious, interrupting her explanation repeatedly. This time, however, I let her get away with it those interruptions. She earned that much leniency, at least…  </p>",

It was not love; he was sure of it, at least not the way people described it, with roses and butterflies. </p><p>No, it was a different thing, something between a desire to protect her, and turn her into his own possession. He felt like a dragon looking at a nubile princess, struck with a desire to lock her into his tower, to declare possession forever. So, while it was not fairy tale love, but it didn’t come second in terms of intensity. </p><p>“Are you ready, princess?” he said as he sneaked his hands behind her back, his palm enjoying the silky feeling of her back while the back of his hand rubbed against his smooth, expensive sheets. The combination it created was amazing, but it quickly lost its significance as he unhooked her bra with a smooth, practiced flick, revealing her perfect globes to his sight. </p><p>Laura didn’t answer with her words, but the slight shuffling of her lower body, giving a glimpse of her core, explained her mood better than any word could. </p><p>How could people treat such a fairy-like she was ugly just because she was slightly nerdy —well, very nerdy if he’s being honest— he wondered even as he leaned, leaving a lingering trail of kisses around her nipple, following the route created by her rosy nipple, but the furious beating of her heart excited him even more than the delicious aroma of her skin. </p><p>His lips stayed focused on her breasts even as Laura lay on her back limply, giving him full access to her beautiful body. A part of him —the burning, primal part that was begging him to lock her in a room and never let out— was begging him to ignore the foreplay and plunge into her wet depths furiously, locking her tiny body with his enormous muscular frame. </p><p>He suppressed that desire. He would have liked to claim that he did so because he had promised her to teach about the pleasures of the flesh, which required a gradual effort, but he was honest with himself to admit that he was afraid of scaring her. </p><p>The possibility of her asking him to stop and leave scared him more intensely than he thought to be possible. </p><p>Luckily, slowly caressing her body while covering her bosom with kisses wasn’t a horrible alternative. Far from it. Especially when she started letting out a string of moans, showing her appreciation to his diligent attention, the last hints of her reticence slowly melting under his diligent care. </p><p>However, rejecting the temptation to take her was getting harder and harder to deny…  </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>Laura was forced to admit that things were developing in a way she hadn’t expected, much more intense, not that she had solid expectations about how the things would develop in the first place owing to her inexperience when it came to the matters of the flesh. She was lying on Mark’s bed, naked —worse than naked, even, no underwear but stockings and garter belt— enjoying as he tenderly worshipped her body. </p><p>Not that she was unhappy about the gap between her expectations and the reality, considering her expectations were an uncaring quickie at best —which would still be her best sexual experience by far— and him laughing at her childishness before sending her away at worst. Enjoying the smoothness of his decadent bed while he slowly explored the sensitive spots of her body, discovering locations that even she didn’t know in the process, was more than even her wildest dreams. </p><p>She had one problem, though, her core was burning with an urgent need, with an intensity she had never tasted before. As much as she enjoyed his treatment, she wanted to shout him to move faster. Pity that she lacked the confidence to do so, limiting herself to passive enjoyment of his control. </p><p>Her lips parted open, letting out a string of moans as he slowly traveled down, painting her stomach with his kisses, their rubbing against each other. She closed her eyes, focusing on his lips, but doing so, she had missed something important. When he started traveling up once more, she felt their legs rubbing together, but this time, only her stockings were on the way. </p><p>She opened her eyes and looked down, only to see a certain object, its size enough to doubt whether her body could even accommodate something as thick and long. Then, his lips pressed against hers, his tongue invading with a renewed intensity, depriving her mind of any rational thought. The only thing she could focus on was the warmth of his tongue and the texture of his muscular body rubbing against hers… </p><p>Then, a certain object started pressing against her entrance, earning a place in her thoughts. He didn’t plunge in immediately, clearly giving her a chance to back out. </p><p>She doubted that she could do something like that even if there was an earthquake, threatening to bury them. She answered the simplest way possible, wrapping her legs around his waist, and pulled him… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>Mark was feeling proud of himself for successfully suppressing the desire to dominate her so thoroughly that she could not walk for a week as he enjoyed the smoothness of her body, when he felt her legs wrapping around his waist, trying to pull inside her… </p><p>And just like that, his ability to suppress his desire disappeared. </p><p>He was barely able to prevent himself from plunging completely in one move, and only because it would injure her. Still, he pushed steadily inch by inch, invading her core aggressively as he forcibly stretched her tunnel, forcing her to cry in a mixture of pain and pleasure, overcoming the ability of his lips to suppress her voice. </p><p>Though, if the tightness of her legs around his waist was any indicator, she wasn’t exactly unhappy with his aggressiveness. </p><p>He pressed his body lower, turning their innocent missionary position to prison for her where the escape was impossible, his hips slowly picking up speed, moving back and forth, steadily exploring her new depths. As the exploration continued, however, he pulled away from the kiss, unable to resist the desire to grunt victoriously. </p><p>His grunts mixed perfectly with her moans. </p><p>His chest still pressed to hers, and his arms found her wrists, forcibly pulling her arms to the side, completing her imprisonment. As he looked down her beautiful blue eyes, wide with desire, her ruby lips parted with an endless string of moans, he had so many flirtatious comments to make, but somehow, the only thing that he could manage to let out was a desperate grunt as he enjoyed her body, tiny in comparison to his, but still perfect like it was made to be loved. </p><p>He started to feel drunk despite not drinking a drop of alcohol, and slowly, the time started to lose its meaning as well, seconds and minutes melding with her cries of pleasure and the rhythmic movement of his drilling, turning into a surreal portrait. He lost the track of the duration, whether it was a second, or a year… </p><p>The only time their cries stopped was when their lips met in a frenzied kiss, his self-control loosening further whenever their lips connected. </p><p>For a beginner, she was showing amazing adaptability, easily ignoring the discomfort to focus on the pleasure as he cut loose, impaling her mercilessly as if to test her limits. She cried, she moaned, she begged… But her legs stayed around his hips, continuing to pull him closer. </p><p>She tried to whisper something whenever their lips parted, but the meaning of the words lost their importance in the delirium of moans. Not that he needed to understand, her body was telling everything he needed to hear. He pushed, she tightened, and the room slowly filled with the sound of flesh hitting flesh mercilessly… </p><p>The time lost its meaning, but the urgency of his bodily needs didn’t. He could feel a volcano burning in his loins, filling with an urgent need to explode. Only then he remembered one really important detail, one that managed to appear even in the depths of his pleasure. He hadn’t asked whether she was using birth control —and he suspected the answer was no— and he certainly wasn’t wearing a condom. </p><p>He needed to pull out, he decided, but despite his decision, his body continued to slam into her repeatedly, rebelling against his orders. He still had some hopes of turning things over until she let out a spectacular moan as she tightened around him, signaling an orgasm of her own, her legs still tight around his waist, her moans echoing in his ear. </p><p>With a grunt, the volcano exploded, filling her insides to the brim. He wanted to focus on the risks of such a ridiculous move, but as his shaft throbbed inside her, spurting load after load, it was impossible to focus on anything but the pleasure of the moment. </p><p>That was a problem for later, he decided as he shifted a bit, laying next to her, hugging her into a tender spoon, his shaft still inside her. </p>",

    "content": "<p>My discussion with Oeyne about the spear consumed the rest of the day, as well as the majority of the night —though we did take several fun breaks that left us pleasantly exhausted in the process of studying. </p><p>All work and no play would make me a dull boy, after all. Not a particularly fun outcome. </p><p>Ultimately, our extensive study left us with even more questions than we had started with. Or, at least, in terms of the exact way to repair the spear in a way that would function its original function, storage, which sounded rather lame considering the weight assigned by the Royal Family. </p><p>Naturally, it was more complicated than that.  </p><p>After that much studying, we were certain that the spear was designed to capture and contain some kind of energy source, and not let it out until certain stringent conditions were met. The requirements to contain the mysterious energy source left Oeyne scratching her head, as it was many times more intense than even the strongest theoretical mana construct. </p><p>I had my own suspicions about the storage target. Divine Spark seemed to be a perfect fit for it. </p><p>Though, the fact that I started to find much evidence of the existence of the Divine Spark the moment I started looking for it suggested something very important. They were clearly much more available than I had first assumed. The headmistress, the mysterious organization, and now, the royal family… </p><p>Still, the relative availability of it, along with the seemingly widespread knowledge, made sense under the light of the story told by the headmistress. </p><p>Since the Eternals were not currently ruling the world with an adamantium fist, there must be others possessing Divine Sparks as well —though, hopefully, not controlling them fully. Otherwise, even with their control over the system lost, the Eternals would have been able to dominate the other powers. And I certainly hoped that the control the Headmistress was displaying as a mythical angel was on the upper range of the scale of competence. </p><p>Of course, that raised even more questions about the princess’ ultimate aim to be there, especially with the combination of the visit of her thief, whether she was aware of the identity of the headmistress and the fact that she was possessing two Divine Sparks, or that she was just trying to do conduct and opportunistic fact-finding mission in a time it would be blamed to other enemies. Hopefully, after I establish my new research laboratory, I would get a better idea of the situation.  </p><p>Still, almost every information I had was assumptions and suppositions, strung together from my limited experiences and a few scraps of information I unearthed from the stories. I needed more evidence before I could make a conclusion. </p><p>Conveniently, I was going to the Headmistress’s tower once more, to finally receive the mark to turn me one of those Divine-Touched of the Light, not that I had any intention of turning into an emotionless, logic-driven little knight for her. Even if the worst happened and she established an overwhelmingly strong node that eclipsed the one Titania possessed, I just could suppress the emotional aspect of it, and that was only an issue if I couldn’t trick her to establish the node in my fake soul space, with no connection to my real power. </p><p>I was enthusiastic about the opportunity, with the control she had displayed during the earlier ritual, my conversion wouldn’t be a simple affair, certainly more complicated than my technique.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was likely not going to be as fun as mine as well.  </p><p>When I arrived at her tower, a minute before the prearranged time, I found the door firmly closed. I waited silently, waiting for the door to open at the exact moment she promised. It did so, unlocking with a dramatic effect. I sighed at her subtle show of power and started walking. </p><p>The moment I stepped inside her tower, inside the protective wrap of darkness wards, pure, calming light filled my being, getting stronger as I climbed up the stairs. The walls, normally unadorned with any kind of mark, were filled with silver runes, visually supporting the holy feeling. </p><p>Then, a soft melody, one that reminded me of a choir, reached my ears, confirming my suspicions. I barely hid a smirk. She was clearly putting a show to impress me about the significance of the moment. Though the show might have some utilitarian purpose behind it just like my own Companion Process progressing only when a certain amount of trust and reliance developed between me and my beautiful friends, it still didn’t change its nature. It was a show to impress.  </p><p>So, I acted suitably awed, displaying proper amazement on my face. However, when I finally arrived at her room, I hadn’t had to fake that expression, though not for the reasons she was hoping. </p><p>Both the room and the headmistress had transformed completely from their usual understated manner. I was clearly more interested in the second part. Rather than her usual black robe, she was wearing white and gold armor that encased her torso. Even though the flatness of her plate armor hid the amazing lines of her body, it wasn’t too much a deal-breaker, not when I had the perfect memory of her naked body in my memories to refer to. The fact that her armor was limited to a chest plate, but unfortunately she also wore a pristine white robe, hiding her arms and legs from the hungry gaze. </p><p>Her wings were fully raised, wide enough to almost touch the walls, shining softly with a silver light, the same color of her beautiful silver hair and eyes. Unlike their previous bare appearance, they had something resembling a weird mixture of armor and weapon loosely wrapped around, gold and silver, adding a sense of danger without hurting their holy appearance. Someone else might have fallen onto their knees and declared their undying worship at the amazing sight. </p><p>I imagined the magnificent sight it would create as I grabbed her wings from behind as I bent her over on top of the tallest tower of the school, her hands chained behind, being impaled repeatedly, her pure voice strained to shout as loud as she could manage. What a magnificent sight it would have been… </p><p>Compared to her striking appearance, the changes in the room took the backseat. Everything else in the room except the crystal runic platform was gone, replaced by more items made from the same crystal, covered in runes. Still, despite the wondrous sight they created, glowing with an inner light and reflecting the glow of the others at the same time, they faded against the awe of the angelic beauty that stood in the middle of the room, exuding an even brighter glow. </p><p>Though, the crystal platform grabbed my attention. Realizing that she was more focused on controlling her own mana, I decided to take the risk of touching the platform once more with a mana probe. However, after the previous time, I didn’t let the platform connect with my mana completely, just examining its outer structure instead. </p><p>A cursory examination revealed that its nature was not too different from the spear. It was a very complicated artifact that would require days of effort to understand its proper functioning principles of course, but ascertaining its basic nature was simple after studying the spear in much detail. </p><p>It was like identifying a sword easily after getting familiar with a dinner knife. Not only was the strength and usage potential of the platform eclipsed the spear, but also its principles of design were much tighter. But ultimately, they were the equipment of the same nature, designed to contain and channel the Divine Spark. </p><p>As she looked at me, I expected her to launch an extensive, complicated ritual to sell the overwhelming holy expression further, but she chose a different part. “Kneel before the platform,” she simply said as she stepped on the platform, the glow filling her body. </p><p>[Divine Spark Identified! Please absorb it to continue to support the operations of the System]</p><p>The familiar notification popped again asking me to devour the source. Too bad that my earlier attempt almost resulted in my destruction, preventing me from acting hastily. After examining the design of the broken spear for a while, I had realized that I had underestimated the complexity of the process far too much. Divine Spark was far too volatile just to be controlled like mana. </p><p>“Are you ready?” the headmistress asked as she put her hand on my head. </p><p>I tensed my body, grabbing my mana tightly, my muscles tensed, ready to lash out in case she noticed my deception and decided to react violently. “I’m ready,” I said, not exactly needing to fake a worshipful expression, though she probably wouldn’t have appreciated knowing that it was not directed to the holy ritual she was conducting but to her beauty. Her serious expression hid the cuteness she otherwise would have displayed, but that just tempted me to make her moan cutely. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t the time for that. </p><p>Yet. </p><p>Then, her power slammed against my body, forcing me to focus on the moment to prevent a crisis. Her power outlined my body first, furious as a flood, threatening to drown me. If it wasn’t for my overwhelming strength, the power would have eviscerated me in less than a second, not even leaving a sliver of ash. </p><p>The nature of the power was interesting. It wasn’t pure Divine Spark like I had been expecting, but instead it was mostly her own mana, mixed with a dash of Divine Spark, though that sliver was enough to turn her calm mana into a furious river threatening to destroy everything in its path. More interestingly, she wasn’t actually spending the mana, but pushing out of her body to rotate in my body, only to pull back again, making it a repeated activity, grueling to resist. </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t weak, so that I could grit my teeth and ignore the painful sensation as her power invaded my body mercilessly, as if t was cleansing my body by fires, painfully sharp. Every inch of my skin burned as the fire slowly infused deeper, pain intensifying. </p><p>But it wasn’t without its benefit. My sharp senses, working in conjunction with my Biomancy and Tantric abilities, gave me the ability to monitor my own physical condition unfailingly, and I could feel that despite the pain, my body was getting stronger. It was a subtle thing, but also it wasn’t something that could be just copied by Biomancy. Mana was not something that could be used as that trick. The improvement was subtle, but permanent. </p><p>And, it was completely unrelated to my stats. </p><p>Then, before I could consider the extent and the implications of that transformation, the power finally reached the fake soul space. The power of her mana mixed with a sliver of Divine Spark, effective despite its small amount, filled my fake soul space to the brim almost instantly, cracking its borders dangerously before she could exert enough control to gather it into one glowing vortex, forcing me to spent a lot of mana to repair my fake soul space. </p><p>[-2186 Mana]</p><p>The intensity of her power was wilder I had expected, making it more destructive, but paradoxically, it made me feel safer. After all, I had more than enough mana to maintain the soul space and repair it continuously, and even if the worst had happened, its destruction would mean nothing more than a temporary inconvenience. </p><p>The implication of the aggressive power flow was much more interesting. The uncontrolled flow of power revealed just how little control she had over Divine Spark, so much that even the small portion she was trying to control rebelled against her touch. The best she could do was to act like a riverbed, allowing the power to flood into my body, and gather it into a self-contained entity once it arrived at its direction. </p><p>It was important, because it meant that she couldn’t notice the tricks I might pull on it. I carefully extended a line of mana, creating an alternate route for the power to flow in, and several other mana constructs to separate her mana from the Divine Spark, and infusing the same spark into mine before rerouting her mana back into the main flow. </p><p>It was a complicated mana structure, inspired by the design of the spear I was tasked to repair, refined further by the way she manipulated the Divine Spark to tame it by her own mana, but it worked. It even worked more successfully than I expected, not getting the slightest reaction from her. </p><p>[-316 Mana]</p><p>I started to feel my true soul space filling with the Divine Spark… </p><p>[Divine Spark Absorption Started! Please absorb it completely to continue to support the operations of the System]</p><p>My lips quirked with anticipation as I read the notification.

    "content": "<p>I was planning to start discussing the details of the spear and the best approach to repair it after Oeyne recovered from her most recent orgasm, expecting her recovery to be rather quick after freeing her from her stat restrictions, her impressive Endurance working again. </p><p>Unfortunately, I miscalculated. As she recovered, she shifted in her seat, ready for a second round. Who could have imagined continuously caressing her breasts as she recovered —or keeping my fully-erect cock in her ass, pumping lazily to stretch her ass even further— could make her aroused. </p><p>She grabbed my wrists, her hold once again strong enough to crack stone now that she was free of both the physical and magical restraints. “Fuck me,” she growled, drunk arousal dancing in the depths of her beautiful brown eyes. </p><p>“Such a needy whore,” I murmured, trying to sound playfully dissatisfied, which was harder than the entirety of the acting I had pulled against Delia. Sounding negative was particularly difficult with a sexy caramel beauty in my lap, grinding repeatedly to take my cock even deeper into her ass, pressing hard enough to shatter the pelvis of a weaker man. </p><p>“I’ll show you needy,” she grunted, feeling the need to show dominance after her earlier humiliation —a state that she clearly enjoyed immensely, but humiliation nonetheless. </p><p>I had no intention of catering to her particular wish to switch roles. Twisting my wrists, I freed myself from her grip, only to latch around her arms to mirror the earlier situation. With a grab established, it was trivial to stand up and dash toward the nearest wall, trusting her legs to wrap around my waist reflexively to maintain the balance. Not to avoid the fall — as something like that would even register to her as painful— but because she didn’t want to lose my presence in her bowels. </p><p>With my speed, it took only a moment for me to slam her against the smooth surface of the wall —which didn’t crack only because of the extensive magic that went to reinforce it during its construction, designed to contain magical explosions—  using one hand to keep her both hands together despite her earnest struggle to free them. My strength, combined with the leverage of the position, allowed me to occupy both of her hands with just one, highlighting that despite all my magical talent, I was stronger than her. </p><p>She reacted beautifully to her new imprisonment, my flesh replacing the chains. </p><p>Her reaction wasn’t shocking. After all, due to her political position, she was living under a metaphorical siege for the last several years, one woman against a horde of guilds that maintained a stranglehold on the economy. Yes, she was incomparably stronger than any single one of them maybe except some guild leaders and other high levels —or maybe not even them, as it was very rare for someone with a high-level cap to actually follow the path of crafting rather than combat— but with their numbers came to the political weight, so much that she was only able to hide away as she worked in her works. </p><p>At first, my presence was nothing more than an easy source of money for her to fulfill her material needs for experimentation —and to pay the sizable debt she accumulated through gambling. Even when I first revealed some magical talent, it barely enhanced my utility without changing the nature of the relationship, just adding mana to the things she wanted to extract from me. </p><p>But as slowly revealed the extent of my power —both physical and magical— her perception started to shift, starting to see me as an equal at first, then even more. However, even then, she didn’t truly surrender until today, where I truly displayed everything she needed. </p><p>I had displayed my strength before by dominating her directly, but the ability to take her abilities to a point of turning her into a weakling —though she assumed the enchantments on the chain was responsible— was on a different level in terms of power differentiation, proving that not only I could defeat, but completely destroy her. </p><p>After effectively living under political siege for a decade, that fact was clearly a comfort for her. After all, if I could destroy her easily, I wouldn’t be trying to seduce her just to sell her out later. I was fucking her, because I wanted to fuck her. Nothing less, nothing more. </p><p>It wasn’t just my direct strength that impressed her, though. My connection with the headmistress —even though it was established quite a bit later than she might have assumed— was another reason for her surrender. Political power was not something she desired, or could manage due to her excessively direct personality, but that didn’t prevent her from suffering under the political weight of the others. With my connections, I represented an umbrella to protect her from all kinds of inconvenient little political machinations that might target her in her comfortable little nest. </p><p>The show I put in with Delia just pushed that point further. Even though she couldn’t truly understand the subtleties of my actions —she lacked the ability to do so even under the best of circumstances, and being locked in a cabinet while suffering from chain orgasms was certainly not the optimal mental state to appreciate the details of a counter-seduction operation— she appreciated me taking control of a situation she had no chance of successfully managing. </p><p>She appreciated it in a very visceral manner, if the furious rocking of her hips was any indicator. </p><p>As I responded with an enraged slam, she moaned, testing the limits of the sound isolation of her workshop. She was enthusiastic about my roughness, and even if she hadn’t been, she had no one to blame but herself. She was the one to tempted me to restart despite my intention to discuss the technical topics relating to the spear. </p><p>Still, as much as I enjoyed her moans, I enjoyed forcibly cutting them off even more. I slammed my lips against hers, invasion of my tongue cutting her cries. </p><p>With my body on hers, she was pushed against the wall with no hope of escaping, but that didn’t prevent her from trying to reverse the situation, using her recently-restored strength to the limit. Of course, just because she occasionally tried to turn the tables, only to lose, didn’t mean that she was unhappy with the position. After all, losing brought its own rewards. Her hips continued to rock but still maintained the perfect angle for me to invade her ass properly. </p><p>So, when I suddenly yanked her by her luscious dark hair and threw her on the couch, face first —the same one I used to entertain Delia— she barely resisted. I latched her from behind, but this time, I slipped into her wet pussy. </p><p>Neglecting such a wet welcome wouldn’t have been gentlemanly. </p><p>She just moaned as I inserted into her from behind, leveraging the fact that her lips were free once again. With no ability or desire to contain the noise coming out of her throat, her howls and shrieks filled the room as my presence stretched her soft lips to the limit.</p><p>I delivered a relentless assault into her wetness, something she rewarded me with her dazed, pleasure-filled moans. I grabbed her hair once more, this time pulling hard to turn it into a makeshift ponytail, using that to yank her head back with every thrust. </p><p>With the addition of a layer of pain, her enjoyment multiplied, her moans once again without the slightest hint of control, just sheer pleasure. Her eyes were closed, her tongue slipping out of her mouth as the pleasure reached a completely new level, the battle of ecstasy and euphoria clear on her face. </p><p>Then, she cried even louder as she tried to say something, but it turned into an unintelligible mess between her wanton moans. It seemed that, even with her endurance renewed, she was quick to reach her limit. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising considering the significant strain she had gone through, unfortunately for her, I had no intention of showing mercy just because of that reason. I continued to thrust without even skipping a beat, curious whether I could make her climax again before she could recover. </p><p>“Do you think I can make you cum again in less than a minute?” I asked mockingly even as I slapped her ass, watching her bountiful flesh create endless ripples. </p><p>“I-impossible,” she stammered, barely able to speak as she tried to ride her latest climax, which was rather difficult with my continuous slams. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I countered, more than ready to take the challenge. I slipped two fingers into her ass, pumping furiously. </p><p>She opened her mouth, no doubt argue against that in our sudden bet, but before she could say anything, I added another finger, shattering her words into another moan, letting out a savage grunt to match her tone. It took several seconds for her to reassert control over her body, and even then, it was barely enough to utter two words. “That’s cheating!” </p><p>“You should have put the conditions beforehand,” I said mockingly as my fingers quickened their assault to match the furious speed of my hips, both pushing my physical capabilities to the limit. I used my other hand to grab the couch, using the leverage to move even faster. </p><p>Under the strength of my assault, the couch started to crack ominously, warning me to slow down. However, winning the bet was more important than the continued existence of a couch, so I pushed even harder. </p><p>My furious last-minute push paid dividends, as her body started trembling with a fresh wave of overwhelming pleasure before the aftershocks of the previous one could disappear. Unfortunately, as I pushed for the final time before her tightening triggered my climax, I managed to overwhelm the hardness of the couch, and its back shattered with a loud sound, forcing me to cast a spell to prevent its slivers from hurting us. </p><p>[-4 Mana] </p><p>Not that it would have been dangerous in any way, but I didn’t like the idea of Oeyne feeling pain if I wasn’t the one directly responsible for it. </p><p>We lay among the shattered remains of her couch as we caught our breath. “That was a gift,” she murmured petulantly as she recovered enough to string together more than two words. </p><p>“Then they should have given a more robust gift,” I countered mockingly, aware that she was just reflecting her frustration of losing the bet. Though, considering we didn’t actually put a stake for the bet, and she got another amazing climax in the process, it was hard to point out how exactly she had lost. She grumbled a bit, one that immediately disappeared as I started caressing her breasts. </p><p>“So, what is my reward for winning the bet,” I said as I continued to enjoy the softness of her skin. </p><p>“That doesn’t count,” she countered immediately, her tone implying she was far more interested in repeating the process of the bet more than getting the eventual victory, not that I could blame her for it. It had been rather entertaining to cut loose physically to such a degree. </p><p>“Maybe we can repeat the bet later,” I sighed with regret as I raised my hand, creating a complicated pattern of magical formulas floating like stars of the midnight sky. “It’s time to work. We need to talk about the spear…” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite our quick agreement, it took a while for us to start the journey, because Nancy’s rental car, which was probably older than her, decided to choose that moment for a mechanical failure, forcing us to shift everything into my car, filling my trunk, as well as half of the back seat with piles of books. </p><p>“Finally,” I said as I sat on the driver’s seat, while Nancy sat on the back seat with a pen in hand. Since she was going to pose as the thief —sexy thief after my adjustments— she needed to sign the books on the drive, which, luckily, was more than enough to finish all — as long as we stopped on the way to put the signed ones to the trunk and bring the others to the main area. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured even as she grabbed the pen and started signing. “I don’t know how I could have handled things if you weren’t helping me.” </p><p>“Yeah, I’m a regular white knight, too bad that you don’t have an armor for me as well.” </p><p>“Maybe for the next time,” she murmured, dipping her head down to hide her blush, which, combined with her costume, made her look really sexy. It was amusing to see her react like that, contrasting her usual pricklier personality. I was tempted to tease her a bit more, but she had already started signing the books she had brought along, hoping to achieve a big sale. </p><p>Though, the lack of teasing on my side was less about my lack of interest, and more about having a more interesting method of doing so than teasing her with my words while we drove. A method that started working the moment I pulled in front of Penny’s house, and Nancy saw the sexy blonde waiting on the entrance, sexy despite wearing a simple blouse-jeans combo. </p><p>“Is this her?” Nancy said with an absolute distaste, one that was rather undeserved considering Penny was saving her whole business venture, but the jealousy of a woman was a hard concept to understand. </p><p>Though, to her credit, she had a lot to feel jealous about. Nancy was spectacularly beautiful, no argument, with her bold red hair and her perfectly proportioned body, but Penny was everything a generation of media had promoted as the perfect woman, blonde, with an hourglass curvy body, and a beautiful face that was just innocent enough to imply passive participation for many interesting heated situations. </p><p>In other words, a male wet-dream, and a female jealously lightning-rod. </p><p>So, yes, Nancy’s attitude was very much understandable. </p><p>But that didn’t mean I would just let it slide. “Yes, is that a problem?” I asked. “Is she not sexy enough to play the character in your book?”</p><p>Her blush was simply spectacular. “I guess she would do,” Nancy stammered, unable to hide the frustration in her tone. I opened the door as Penny started to walk toward us. “Where are you going?” she asked. </p><p>“Penny needs to wear her costume on before we leave just to prevent struggling in the convention area, of course,” I explained. </p><p>“Maybe I should help her,” she tried to say, but I put my hand on the door, preventing her from leaving the car. “No, you should stay and work on your signatures,” I said. “Unless you want to continue signing in the convention area and reveal that the genius writer of the books is also working as a part-time model. I personally think that it would help the sales-” I said, only to be cut off. </p><p>“No need,” she said hurriedly, the fear of being revealed stronger than her jealousy. I closed the car door with a knowing smirk, just at the time of face Penny, who was walking toward the car. </p><p>“Good morning, beautiful,” I said even as I grabbed her arm and started dragging her back toward the house. </p><p>“M-morning,” she stammered, caught flat-footed by the sudden change of direction. “Where are we going?” she managed to say. </p><p>“You need to put the costume on before we leave,” I explained even as I dragged her toward the living room, the same place we had our first test photoshoot, the one that left in her underwear, fingered into a listless, exhausted pile on the floor. </p><p>She just stammered an affirmative reply while I took a step back, enjoying the sight of her body. “Now, undress,” I told her. </p><p>“Here,” she stammered shyly. </p><p>“Yes, sweetie, is it suddenly a problem,” I said even as I caressed her cheek, making her blush, even when I subtly looked at toward the window when I saw a movement, only to see Nancy there, looking inside in a way she clearly thought to be stealthy, but showed her face clearly.  “It’s not like we have used the living room for our purposes, after all.” </p><p>“No, not a problem,” she whispered shyly even as she reached for her tank top, only for me to stop her with a gesture. She looked at me questioningly.  </p><p>“We’re in a hurry, so let me help,” I said even as I took a step toward her with a hungry grin. Since Nancy had gone the trouble to sneak to catch a glimpse, I wanted to give her a proper show. Me undressing her was impossible to be slower than the alternative, but Penny didn’t look particularly enthusiastic about making that point even as I put my hand on her voluptuous body. </p><p>I pulled off her top aggressively enough to rip the fabric, and her conservative white bra followed it after a flick of my fingers, displaying her amazing breasts. Before she could even react, her jeans followed the same fate, leaving her in just her panties. “Perfection,” I murmured even as I hooked my fingers around her panties. </p><p>“Even them?” she whispered hesitantly. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I pushed them down, but unlike the others, I was pushing them down softly, enjoying the opportunity to caress her beautiful legs, trembling in anticipation. “You can’t expect those ugly monstrosities showing off whenever you bend over, it would be criminal.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to say, only for me to silence her with a searing kiss. </p><p>“Since you’re already naked, why don’t we use that to our benefit before putting the costume on,” I said, not bothering to give her an excuse even as I pushed her on the couch. I thought about putting the costume on first, but it was already going to be a tight fit, and I didn’t want to ruin it accidentally. </p><p>“Aren’t we in a hurry?” she asked. </p><p>“Honey, at this moment, there’s nothing more important than your beautiful body,” I answered, making her blush. After that fateful swimwear photoshoot, she was showing excellent progress. </p><p>I spent a moment enjoying the view, her curvy body lying on the couch, her legs already parted invitingly despite her attempts to look reluctant. Her blonde hair was spilling on her beautiful breasts, proudly rejecting the existence of gravity. </p><p>“You look delicious enough to eat,” I said even as I freed my shaft from its confines, covering the distance between us with one large step. “However, how about you take the lead when it comes to eating?” With that, I pushed my hard shaft toward her beautiful lips —not that it was possible to stay soft as I enjoyed the sight of her amazing body. </p><p>Her lips parted open, swallowing my length even as I let my hands go down and capture her amazing tits, treating myself to her amazing moans, even as I felt surprised by just how meek she had become since our first time. Her submissiveness could easily rival Nicole.</p><p>Her face flushed as I squeezed her tits, though it might be also about the effort she was putting to swallow my girth. “You’re such a nice girl,” I murmured even as I pushed my shaft deeper, forcing myself into her throat, her gagging more beautiful than the best symphony. Her body was tingling with desire as I continued to squeeze her breasts, her lips stretching around my girth. I pushed forward, even more, trying to test her limits, but she just accepted it passively.</p><p>However, as much as I enjoyed the sight of Penny’s delicious body, the real show was happening in the window. Nancy was still there, thinking herself well-hidden as she watched us, her face contorted with a complicated expression. She wasn’t as shocked as I expected, but considering she had caught me having sex with a model in her living room —though, luckily she didn’t discover her identity in the process— the sight of me having some fun with another model wouldn’t be too shocking, especially when I had not bothered to hide my intentions as I dragged Penny back to the house. </p><p>Still, since she was enjoying the show I was proving one way or another, I decided to keep the pressure on Penny. I guided her hands and guided them to my thighs, curious whether she would try to pull me even deeper. Unfortunately, despite her clear enjoyment, she didn’t do that, choosing to stay on the passive side. Luckily, there was more than one way to pull her deeper into the game of pleasure, such as pulling back to leave her lips empty. </p><p>“Lick properly,” I ordered, enjoying her innocent expression, split between guilt and pleasure. But despite what her expression might suggest, she leaned forward to give a proper lick, even as she grabbed the base and started pumping. Her movements were still mechanical, lacking both in skill and experience, but her beauty and enthusiasm were more than enough to compensate for those deficiencies, and her perfect obedience was the cherry on the top. </p><p>“How’s this?” she murmured shyly between licks, making me chuckle in amusement. </p><p>“Excellent, but try alternating between sucking and licking, that would be even better,” I suggested, and she followed that suggestion immediately, her lips clamping around my girth. Admittedly, the sheer impact of her move was not comparable to the earlier deep throat, but the fact that she was learning to treat it better and better made it much more interesting. Not to mention, the vibrations of her moans that massaged my length whenever she took it in her mouth were a nice addition. </p><p>Her movements quickened as she gained more and more experience, helped by my occasional direction, especially after one of her hands landed between her legs, providing a little self-care while I continued the improving service of her mouth, while her other hand still pumped at the base steadily. Soon, I was facing a more important problem. I was about to cum. </p><p>It was a problem, because she was about to put on a new costume, meaning I couldn’t just paint her spectacular breasts as I preferred. Even cumming into her mouth was a risk, because if she spilled, she needed to go to the bathroom to clean up. After a little thought, I decided to give her a chance. “Be ready to swallow,” I warned. “If you waste even a drop, I’ll be disappointed.” </p><p>Her moan of approval was simply too beautiful. It triggered a hearty explosion from me, filling her mouth with my seed. Luckily, our last adventure gave her the ability to actually succeed in the task I assigned to her. After making sure every drop was captured, I pulled back, watching her swallow her gift with enthusiasm. While she lay on her back, trying to catch her breath, I grabbed the first piece of her costume, a skimpy black thong I had added to the costume without confirming with Nancy. </p><p>Luckily, Nancy had disappeared while Penny was trying to prevent spillage, preventing her from seeing that. I didn’t want her arguing against it before we started our trip. </p><p>“Keep your legs together,” I ordered as I slipped the thong on her, which was clearly the sexiest thing she would ever wear in a public place. She blushed even more than when I bombarded her with the suggestions on how to suck me better. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit…” she murmured, unable to finish her sentence, just as I slipped it completely, its front immediately getting damp. </p><p>I said nothing as I grabbed her hand, pulling her on her feet, the move making her tits dangle beautifully. I grabbed her hand and gently led her to turn around, giving a full glimpse of her body. As she stood in front of me, wearing a sexy thong, somehow looking even sexier than her naked state, it was difficult to resist the temptation to blow the next job, especially since it wasn’t a paid job. Ultimately, if it wasn’t doing that favor to a sexy redhead, I doubted I could have resisted the temptation. “No, it’s perfect,” I said. </p><p>She lacked the ability to contradict such a decisive statement, and obediently put the pants I had passed her. Just like I expected, she was unable to button them thanks to her hips being a touch wider than planned. “Leave it unbuttoned, it looks better,” I said even as I adjusted her pants to make sure her thong was peeking out properly. The same thing happened with the armor —essentially a shirt with a boob-plate— but even more visibly. The armor was designed to leave cleavage on a less-gifted lady. On Penny, it looked more like the exaggerated costumes actresses wore in the late-night movies during the first five minutes of the movie, before a ridiculous excuse made them get rid of any hint of clothing. </p><p>Her lack of a bra made things even sexier. </p><p>“I can’t wear this publicly,” she whispered desperately. </p><p>“Don’t worry, there’s a wig, and also, you’ll have complicated makeup that will hide your face, no one will know it’s you unless you put it on your portfolio,” I said, making her relax. Admittedly, such a job wasn’t the best for her career, but considering her already limited prospects due to changing tastes in the industry, it wasn’t a big loss for her in the first place. </p><p>“If you say so,” she murmured trustingly. </p><p>“Shall we go,” I said as I presented my arm, ready to face Nancy with the updated costume… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Letting Fernhand follow her pace, without a doubt, would have been an enjoyable option. The speed she had come to rely upon that particular angle without even the slightest preamble suggested that it was not the first time she had relied on that tactic in her long career —though, luckily the distaste dancing in her dark eyes suggested that while she relied that only on rare occasions, likely on the beginning of her, before she developed her mind arts to the limit. </p><p>Essentially, the same thing I enjoyed from Emma and Aria for more than once. However, there was one little problem with that otherwise delicious option. Unlike Aria and Emma, her experience would mean that she would have the initiative. </p><p>The sense of initiative she would have was not a problem during sex, of course, but everything I had seen about Fernhand suggested that she was an overambitious woman, which allowed her to climb up to lead her faction despite her minor nobility with no real power. </p><p>And, she wasn’t the first overambitious politician I had to face during my infamous career. Give them an inch, and they would immediately start to seek ways to steal a mile.</p><p>The best way to deal with them? Teach their proper place in the hierarchy from the start. </p><p>Luckily, I had the exact skill set to do so. </p><p>It was the time to properly let out my instincts that made me a successful dark lord. “No,” I said with a smile that contained no hint of joy or amusement even as I raised my finger. </p><p>“No?” she repeated, her fingers frozen on the buttons of her shirt as she tried to process my answer. Then, she started buttoning her shirt, misunderstanding the reason for my word. </p><p>“No,” I repeated, my non-smile widening as I enjoyed her confusion. </p><p>“No?” she echoed, which would have been extremely entertaining for a passerby if it wasn’t for the tenseness of the situation. I maintained the same expression while she examined me carefully, trying to understand what I wanted, but her growing frustration showed that she wasn’t making the progress she desired. </p><p>On the surface, what I was doing was pointless, just stretching my newfound control, but actually, it served multiple purposes, from disrupting her mental state further through frustration to make her get used to following my orders. They weren’t enough to suddenly break her, of course, but domination was like painting. Regardless of the ultimate majesty of the final product, everything started with a simple line. </p><p>Of course, as a master of the said art, I had the ability to work much more aggressively. So, after a minute of tense silence, I patted my lap, inviting her to take a seat. Despite an annoyance she failed to suppress, her hips danced beautifully as she walked toward me. Not as impressive as the magical walk of the Queen, of course, but it was an unfair comparison. Sapphire was not only a part-time exotic dancer —which was a rather interesting career choice for the strongest political entity in the continent— but also she had majestic hips. </p><p>Fernhand was a beautiful woman, but her thinner figure ensured such a walk couldn’t be her best move. </p><p>I made sure to shook my head in subtle disapproval, another little stab at her confidence, implying that she needed to work harder, adding another chip to her strong will, leaving a deep mark. She was neither weak nor gullible, but with the implied shadow of everything she had worked for turning into dust due to an unexpected variable hovering above her, it was the perfect time to break her. </p><p>“Better,” I said as she sat on my lap, keeping my tone dry and dismissive. Then, contrasting my earlier laziness, I put my her thigh, hard enough to make a noise. She flinched, but her lips stayed closed, suppressing a yelp. I squeezed her thigh, making the strain got even stronger. </p><p>Good, I thought as I confirmed my assumption. She wasn’t really used to pain, which provided me with a sweet range of options. My hand climbed upwards, my fingers sinking into her toned flesh despite her clothes on the way while she sat on my knee like an obedient servant. After the initial flinch, she didn’t react to my move, but I was adept in reading women enough to know that she was actively suppressing the outward signs of her discomfort. </p><p>Exactly what I wanted.  </p><p>“You seem distracted,” I whispered into her ear, not bothering to hide the mocking edge of my tone. “Is this really the best time to discuss your political concerns. Maybe I should give you a relaxing massage first.” </p><p>“No need,” she said through her gritted teeth, trying to ignore my tight grip on her thigh. </p><p>“You’re tougher than I expected,” I said, giving her an empty compliment. “So, tell me about yourself,” I said. “What do you want, for example?” </p><p>The trick I was employing was a simple one. I was forcing her to speak for a long time without revealing the limits of my own knowledge. But simply didn’t always mean ineffective. Without knowing what I knew, she couldn’t calibrate her lies. If I was a proper member of the Queen’s political sphere, it would have been easier to predict the limits of my knowledge, but my weird positioning made it even more difficult for her to guess the limits of my knowledge. </p><p>Of course, even in her wildest dreams, she probably couldn’t imagine me actually being an escaped prisoner nonetheless hanging around the palace, trying to establish basic information. </p><p>She started giving a detailed explanation even as I grabbed her hips and pulled her on my lap, allowing her to feel my hardness. She managed to ignore that to focus on her explanation. </p><p>I wasn’t idle while she explained, of course. I shifted her beautiful black hair to the side, giving me unrestricted access to her elegant neck, biting hard enough to break her explanation with a yelp. She didn’t complain, and continued her explanation, but that didn’t prevent her from shuddering as I continued to add a string of red marks to mar her otherwise perfect skin. </p><p>She continued even as my hands slipped under her robe, teasing her naked flesh aggressively. I was giving all the signs of being occupied with her body despite memorizing every single word she uttered about the political climate and her objectives. </p><p>I needed to go through them later with a fine-tooth comb to separate truth from lies, and more importantly useful information from the correct yet misleading ones. The latter was always the more dangerous kind.</p><p>Also, I was waiting for an opportunity to start the real show. An opportunity that occurred when she stopped her explanation halfway to ask me a few questions, persisting despite my noncommittal orders to continue. She was trying to use my distraction to test my knowledge. </p><p>“Okay, that’s enough,” I said suddenly even as I pushed her off my lap, directly onto her desk, her chest hitting hard enough to explode with a gasp, her ass pointing upward. </p><p>“W-what?!” she said, shocked, the sudden sharpness of my move enough to destroy her composure. In that aspect, she wasn’t too different from Sapphire. Both were extremely competent and extremely self-possessed, but their unique, specialized paths to power left them limited when it came to the more direct manner of confrontation. </p><p>An approach I mastered perfectly. </p><p>“You’re a smart girl,” I whispered softly even as I put my hand on the small of her back, pinning her in place while the other grabbed her robe, but stayed there. “Why don’t you tell me why I suddenly changed my attitude?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she gasped, trying to play the innocent, her tone shaped perfectly. I admired her acting, but unfortunately for her, that admiration only strengthened my conviction for my strategy. She needed to learn her lesson. </p><p>“Really?” I said, and without giving her any chance to correct her answer, pulled violently, ripping her robes, revealing the surprisingly revealing panties underneath. “A black thong, what a cliche,” I said mockingly even as I put my hand on her bottom. “So, the last chance to tell me what you have done wrong before you get punished,” I said. </p><p>“I tried to manipulate you by asking pointed questions,” she said immediately, quick to recognize her earlier ploy was seen through completely. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said even as I raised my hand, only to spank her ass hard, though hard in an erotic sense, not hard in corporal punishment sense. After all, she was a delicate creature that deserved some tough love to teach her the error of her ways, not actual torture. </p><p>She cried in pain before she could control her reaction. “Didn’t you say you weren’t going to punish me?” </p><p>“I said that.” I spanked her once more. “However, this is not punishment. This is just a gentle reminder to make sure the lesson sticks with you. Believe me, sweetheart, you don’t want to see what a dark lord actually refers to as punishment.” During the explanation, my spanks exploded on her ass thrice more, pushing her discomfort to a new level as her pale ass glowed beautifully. </p><p>She stiffened. “I see.” After that, she stayed silent as I spanked her a couple of times more.  </p><p>“Why did you stop?” I repeated as my spank landed on her ass once more, this time even harder. “Continue your explanation.”  </p><p>She clearly didn’t appreciate the sudden change of pacing, missing her comfortable seat on my lap rather than being forced to lie on the table, being spanked repeatedly as she was forced to explain the political climate of the Empire from her perspective. After the first several spanks, I had reduced the strength of my hand, but through the repetition, it was getting hard to resist the pain, evidenced by her straining expression. </p><p>And while she might not realize yet, it was just a warm up… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Two beauties, a redhead and a blonde, on either side of me, watching me face-fuck a sexy brunette merciless while a number of other women watched us, their self-pleasuring activities getting even more intense under my animalistic magnetism, assisted by my aura. </p><p>However, even with the pleasure, I hadn’t forgotten one important detail. I was still a slave in their eyes. An expensive, attractive slave with more initiative than might have expected, but a slave nonetheless. I could only push the situation because of the perverted shine in Olivia’s eyes, who was the heiress of a Patrician house. </p><p>So, I made sure to keep my gaze mostly on Olivia even when some of the onlookers started to shed their clothes —not that their silk dresses covered a lot in the first place— and started sharing kisses and touches, creating an enticing sight. </p><p>Not to mention, it was her who I needed to entertain to get an opportunity to sneak into the library to get a better idea about what was going on with my body. It was getting more difficult to suppress the scales of my arms with each passing day, and whenever I let it grow, it covered more distance. Luckily, the daily increase wasn’t significant. </p><p>Unless something changed, my remaining time until something irreversible happens wasn’t measured in weeks, but certainly wasn’t measured in years as well —or I wouldn’t have taken the risk of being a slave, which, even with my powers, was a dicey issue. </p><p>Even as I was considering the next steps, my hands still grabbing Cera’s beautiful head, pressing down to violate her throat thoroughly, her gags and gasps mixing with the moans of the onlookers, creating a beautiful musical tapestry. With that combination, I soon exploded into her mouth. </p><p>However, with my endurance, it was not an end, but just a beginning. I was already getting hard once more when I pulled out of her mouth, my shaft was already getting harder once more. I looked directly into Olivia’s eyes, trying to understand what she wanted. </p><p>“This is getting too ridiculous, Olivia, we need to stop it,” her blonde friend started, but she stayed in her seat despite our proximity even when I stopped holding her waist. The sight of a growing lesbian orgy around us meant that leaving her seat wouldn’t significantly improve her situation. </p><p>“She’s a bit of a prude, isn’t she?” I commented mockingly, taking a slight risk, but Olivia’s giggle proved it wasn’t a miss. I decided to push my luck. “Do you want me to solve that?” I asked Olivia even as I put my hand on her thigh, squeezing gently.  </p><p>“You can’t touch me!” exclaimed the blonde immediately, panicked. </p><p>Olivia sighed, clearly unhappy with her friend not joining the fun. “I would have liked to, but if she doesn’t want you touching her…” </p><p>“Not a problem,” I said even as I grabbed Cera’s hair once more and pushed, this time pushing her head under the dress of the blonde. “Lick,” I ordered, making her use her tongue and lips to tease the blonde. </p><p>Lips that were still stained with my cum. </p><p>The blonde’s eyes widened in shock at the sudden change, but Olivia spoke before her. “You can’t complain now, can you, Atia,” Olivia said, followed by gleeful laughter, even reaching over me to grab her shoulder when Atia tried to stand up. </p><p>With her knees still on the other side, it was difficult for Olivia to actually put proper pressure on the shoulder of her friend, so I decided to help her, while also testing her limits. “Let me assist,” I said even as I grabbed her waist, easily lifting her as I pulled her closer to my naked chest, her hips passing close to my lap. </p><p>Unfortunately, under my fingers, I felt her body tense, meaning she wasn’t willing to do that, so without ever stopping her, I continued to move her, and dropped her on Atia’s other side. </p><p>Luckily, even with Olivia unwilling to push more, and with Cera and Atia occupied, I still had a lot of entertainment around the room. </p><p>“You, come here,” I said as I pointed at another brunette that was currently being licked by a blonde, her amazing curves setting her off in a room where most nobles had predominantly lithe bodies. It was a daring move as I distinctly remembered she was married, her husband one of the boys I had drunk under the table earlier. </p><p>“M-me,” she stammered, her eyes wide as the excitement of the proposition hit her, along with the risks. Fidelity was not a particularly hard-defended concept in Rome, but there was a huge distinction between having an illicit affair behind closed doors, away from everyone, and having one with a slave in the middle of a crowded room filled with her noble peers while her husband lay just several feet away, unconscious. </p><p>“Yes, you,” I said, growling intimidatingly to lean even harder on my barbarian disguise, and she jumped up to her feet, her bountiful assets jiggling. It was ironic, I, a temporary slave, could order a gaggle of noble ladies to serve my needs, while a slightly mistimed flirting from their male peers would have caused a feud. </p><p>Seeing that my new target made absolutely no mode, I stood up —after glancing carefully at Olivia to make sure she was not scandalized by the sudden increase of my aggressiveness— and walked toward her, while other onlookers shivered in excitement.  </p><p>“Y-you dare, with my husband here,” the busty brunette gasped even as her blonde friend pulled back, but the way her legs stayed wide open suggested that with her mind addled with pleasure, she might not be as against to the idea as her words suggested. </p><p>“Your husband isn’t as scary as a Chimera,” I said with a dismissive laugh even as I took a step forward, hovering over her as she got a perfect view of my glistening cock. She didn’t answer as I crouched down to occupy the delicious position between her legs. But I didn’t plunge immediately, stretching the moment. Not to give her a chance to pull back, as her expression told me that it was the last thing she wanted, but to let all the other ladies properly appreciate what I was about to do… </p><p>As I put my hands on her waist, the other women watched me with rapt attention, some scandalized, some aroused. The only exceptions were Cera, still buried between Atia’s legs, and Atia, too deep in the unfamiliar waters of pleasure to actually pay attention to everyone else. </p><p>Since the attention was on me, I decided to push the situation even more. “Are you ready for the first proper fucking of your life, you big-titted whore,” I said as I slapped her breast, hard enough to leave a mark as it jiggled. </p><p>She said nothing, but her moan conveyed her feelings perfectly, not to mention her legs, widening even further. I pressed the crown of my cock against her entrance, letting her horny anticipation build up. Meanwhile, I slid my hands down to her hips, squeezing hard enough to leave a mark of my ownership on her plump yet firm flesh. </p><p>The anticipatory silence in her room was intense. Fucking Cera was one thing. She was clearly at the bottom of the totem pole in the political hierarchy, and her unmarried status limited the implications quite a bit. The same clearly didn’t apply to the married whore in front of me. </p><p>I could have played around to exert my dominance a while more as the busty bitch in front of me started to get desperate, but considering the number of sexy ladies around, some clearly receptive to the idea of having their turn after seeing their second peer about to go through the same process. </p><p>After all, it couldn’t be a scandal if everyone participated. </p><p>I tightened my grip around her hips and pushed deeper, until my full length was snugly inside her, ignoring her desperate moans begging for me to go slower. I put my hands on her shoulder as I started moving my hips, the repeated slams exploding beautifully on her skin, the sound cutting through the erotic tension that filled the room, her cries filling the empty space.</p><p>I could have just impaled her in the same position until she turned into a slobbering mess, overwhelmed by the pressure, but there was one important thing. I was giving a show, and such a show deserved proper audience participation. So, I suddenly leaned down enough for our chests to press together, grabbed her ass tightly, and stood up with my shaft still firmly lodged in her entrance. </p><p>She wrapped her legs around my body in shock reflexively even as I started walking around, leading her performance like a taskmaster. I forced her to raise her hips, only to pull her down even harder, making her eyes roll back as the pleasure hit her like a rabid monster while my cock invaded depths that were clearly never touched by her limp-dicked husband. </p><p>As I walked around the room while fucking her, giving every single onlooker an amazing view of what was going on, it was like I was the owner, and they were my slaves. My plump companion didn’t seem to care that fact as her moans continued to explode. Soon, her legs tightened around even further as she used the leverage to add an extra push to her movement, moving higher to slam even harder, possessed by pleasure. </p><p>Since the rest were more than happy with the show, I decided to push things even further. While passing next to a beauty that was currently on her feet, I grabbed her hair without even bothering to ask, and slammed my lips against hers, my tongue ravaging her mouth mercilessly.</p><p>She was dazed at first, but her daze didn’t take long to morph into a moan as I slipped three fingers inside her wet lips, pumping furiously. I didn’t keep that part long, wanting to leave her halfway, curious whether she would show any initiative after I finished with my plump beauty. </p><p>As I started walking once more, she moaned with desperation, forcing her to sink even deeper, my cock knocking at her womb repeatedly like a ram, unaware that this time I had another destination. </p><p>“Look who’s there,” I said even as I let her lay on the floor while continuing to tease her. I was planning to tease her with the unconscious presence of her husband, but unfortunately, all that earned was a disinterested gaze to the side before she turned to face me, her hips dancing with an arousing dance. </p><p>It was the price of success, I thought with amusement. She was too far gone in pleasure to make that teasing have any effect, however minimal. Since it was like that, I decided not to tell back once more, filling her insides with my seed after making sure she wouldn’t get pregnant… </p><p>As much as I was tempted to leave my mark in a high and mighty noble family, I didn’t want to leave bastards around. From experience, I knew just how difficult that life might be. However, rather than focus on such dark thoughts, I focused on the way my cock was throbbing and twitching, filling her insides to the brim. </p><p>I pulled out a while later, leaving the plump brunette collapsed on the floor, next to her husband, cum flowing down her thighs… </p><p>Then, I turned around, looking for my next target in a room full of noble beauties, each more enthusiastic than to last to get a taste of my barbarian cock… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, where were we?” I asked even as I opened the cabinet. The sight that my eyes met was spectacular. Oeyne’s delicious caramel skin was covered with sweat, adding a nice shine to her already impressive beauty, while her chest was heaving helplessly. </p><p>But that was nothing compared to the amazing sight of her face, a mixture of pleasure, joy, desperation, and helplessness, to a level of perfection I had never seen before. She was reacting to her loss of strength after I blocked her connection with the specific nodes in her soul space. </p><p>Admittedly, it had some interesting implications, such as destroying the nodes to permanently depowering someone, but only under certain circumstances. Killing someone was still easier than depowering them, and that was before going into any possible backlash from the system for doing so. </p><p>The more interesting possibility was permanently enhancing someone’s power directly. The disgusting patchwork of power I had observed from the soul space of the assassins that were targeting Titania already suggested it was possible, not that I was interested in it other than possible academic implications. </p><p>I was more than happy with the way I was helping the others level up, thank you very much. </p><p>However, the theoretical applications of soul space manipulations were just a fleeting line of thought that occurred on the back of my head while I pulled Oeyne out of the stuffy cabinet and pushed against the work surface. After repeated orgasms thanks to the vibrator I added to the ensemble —and without the endurance to resist— she had already enjoyed several climaxes, forcing me to lower the suppression of her endurance to prevent her from fainting from overwhelming pleasure as I started caressing her wet lips. </p><p>“So,” I started lazily even as I freed her from her gag, allowing her moans to rose unimpeded while my other hand was still busy caressing her entrance. “Have you found my talk with the princess’s handmaiden useful?” Rather than a proper answer, I received a moan that was roughly positive. “Use your words, master, your apprentice can’t understand you,” I said mockingly even as I slapped her ass softly. </p><p>Even that was enough to trigger another helpless climax in her overcharged state. She tried to give a proper answer, but it failed quickly as her voice was flooded with endless moans. The treatment from my hands, alternating between caresses and spanks, didn’t exactly help her contain her tone as well. It took almost a minute for her to utter a few words. “It was … very good.” </p><p>“Really,” I said with a mocking enthusiasm. “Do you think I deserve a reward for my expert diplomacy,” I said even as I slipped two fingers into her wetness, earning another desperate moan, this time even louder.</p><p>“Yes,” she answered helplessly.  </p><p>“Such a good master,” I said even as I pulled out my fingers, and without a warning, impaled her wetness aggressively. It was a pity that I was temporarily unable to progress the companion process, because Oeyne was at the perfect point to leverage it. And the stat bonus he would have received from that would have come very usefully while repairing the staff. </p><p>It was a pity, but instead of lamenting the loss of opportunity, I focused on the amazing sight in front of me, her arms still handcuffed, her legs wrapped in silver chains, turning her into an amazing gift. A gift that I continued to ram mercilessly while she moaned, not giving her even a moment to recover. </p><p>Still, I occasionally loosened the restrictions on her physical stats to prevent her from collapsing, even occasionally relying on my healing to reduce her exhaustion. Otherwise, it was impossible for her to stay conscious under the flood of pleasure. </p><p>Her moans intensified when I slipped one hand between the work surface and her chest, squeezing her breasts aggressively. Her nipples were so hard that I was surprised they weren’t scratching the work surface as she slid back and forth. </p><p>“So, you have a lot of time to think about the discussion. What’s your opinion?” I asked, well aware anything more than a few simple words were impossible to create for her. </p><p>“What?” was all she could utter, confused at the sudden question, my repeated squeezing of her spectacular breasts not making it any easier. “I-” she tried to add, only to fade into a cry when I spanked her hard once more, making her huge ass jiggle. </p><p>“Try to be more articulate, master. It doesn’t fit your esteemed self,” I mocked her, only to continue to spank her whenever she opened her mouth, trying to answer, drowning her words in another moan. </p><p>Despite the rough treatment, however, when I pulled out of her, the only reaction she let out was a desperate plea. “No, please, don’t stop,” she gasped, impressing me with her articulation. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said with a chuckle as I cast a spell, conjuring another set of chains even as the handcuffs I created were flicked open. An arcana spell allowed the chains to move freely, wrapping her arms, forcing her upright. I walked around her a full circle, enjoying the sight of her voluptuous body that rejected the domain of time. </p><p>[-43 Mana]</p><p>“Such a slutty master,” I said as I spanked her softly, enjoying the way she gushed at the slightest touch. “The guilds were idiots to use threats and financial incentives to censure you. All they needed was a well-crafted dildo for you to fold,” I mocked her as I caressed her body softly, which, despite the great contrast with the earlier rough treatment, still worked wonders. </p><p>“Please,” she gasped desperately, ignoring my mocking remarks as she focused on my touch. It was just one word, but it perfectly conveyed her desperation. </p><p>“Such a desperate master,” I mocked her, which made her gushing even more intense. “You’re lucky that you have a merciful apprentice.”  </p><p>“Thank you-” she tried to start, only for her words to fade when my hand landed on her perfect breast to leave a dark mark, turning into another harsh moan. Her pain tolerance was really impressive even with her limited stats. </p><p>I decided to reward her. “So, which way you want. Throat, pussy, or ass?” I asked. </p><p>Her answer came quicker than lightning. “Fuck me in the ass,” she spat out desperately, like she was afraid I would remove her chance to choose if I delayed even a second. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I added the required spells to clean, but deliberately kept the lubrication very limited, nor helped her to loosen magically. Despite the poor preparation, I impaled her with one sharp stab, making her moan desperately, her pleasure easily overwhelming the hints of pain. </p><p>“Harder,” she moaned as I impaled her rapidly, so I grabbed her hair and pulled back roughly, adding another layer of pain, one that she appreciated greatly if her tightening was any indicator. I continued to drill her mercilessly while my other hand danced over her curves, mercilessly exploring her sensitive spots. </p><p>Her ass tightened under my treatment, doubling the already significant pleasure I was getting from our fun adventure. I didn’t say anything, just continued to enjoy her helpless tightness. Her back arching beautifully as I steadily pushed her toward another climax, struggling to stay on the bright side of the line that separated consciousness from fainting,</p><p>It wasn’t just the amazing tightness of her ass that was giving me pleasure —not that it was anything less than amazing. The true joy came from turning another strong and beautiful woman into a member of my growing harem. Without her strength and achievements, the pleasure I would have gotten from her total surrender would have been significantly less. </p><p>“Look at yourself,” I ordered as I conjured a mirror in front of her, forcing her to confront her own slutty face. </p><p>She caught the sight of her body. Her eyes widened in shock as her mind registered the intenseness of her arousal, clear as a day on her beautiful face. Still, despite the initial shock, she embraced it easily. She started pushing her ass back to match my pacing, her tits jiggling in an amazing manner whenever our bodies hit together. </p><p>As the hold of the pleasure got even stronger, her breathing started to get out of control. She was nearing another climax, but this time, I wasn’t too far away from an explosion as well. She was burning with a desire that was impossible to suppress. I considered suddenly pulling out to leave her on the edge, but I decided against it for two reasons. First, she had already gone through delicious torture locked in the cabinet while I was flirting with Delia. </p><p>Second, I was also about to explode. </p><p>“I’m going to fill you,” I whispered, which she replied with a delicious moan, not saying a word. Not that she needed any words at this point. Her desperate moans, combined with her body language, told her story much better than any word could convey. She closed her eyes as she focused on the sensation while I slammed with a renewed fervor. </p><p>Then, I exploded, flooding her bowels with my seed, which triggered a desperate moan in her as well. I unraveled the chains with a wave of my hands and dispelling the enchantments —the useless ones that I cast to trick her about the source of her suppression— and removed the restrictions from her stats. </p><p>Her phenomenal power returned completely, but that only helped her to stay conscious. She still collapsed against me, her body limp enough to force me to grab her waist to prevent her from collapsing. I chuckled even as I dragged her toward the nearest chair. </p><p>I sat down and pulled her to my lap, my shaft still in her ass, every throbbing making her moan softly. </p><p>I needed a toy to distract myself while I waited for her to recover. Luckily, I had a very convenient one. I grabbed her breasts and started kneading them gently while I waited for her to recover… </p><p>After all, we still have a lot of things to discuss… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>The spear she had passed to me was an interesting artifact, nothing more than a simple ruin at the first glance. Its wooden handle was broken halfway, turning the long weapon into something below two feet in length, the cracks of its head filled with rust even after all the dirt was cleaned carefully. The delicate decorations that were supposed to cover both the handle and head were ruined during the time it had spent underground, dust and dirt seeped deep into its texture so deep that it was impossible to clean it without ruining what was left of it. </p><p>Altogether, it was an easy tool to dismiss for anyone without magical sensitivity. </p><p>It wasn’t that the enchantments that were embedded on the nature of the spear were in any better condition than its outward appearance. The magical matrix that was supposed to be in one cohesive structure on the core to power its magical functions had fragmented into many smaller pieces, yet, it was as beautiful as a shattered diamond shining under the sunlight, creating rainbows. </p><p>The individual pieces of enchantments weren’t as fiddly as I first imagined. Oeyne could easily etch something more complicated, for example, but the sheer number of different parts and how they layered over each other was the real challenge. It was like a mathematical problem that only used first and second-order equations rather than more difficult equations, but with thousands of them at the same time. </p><p>And even from the aged fragments, I could see that the spear was created by multiple people, likely through a complicated ritual. Another interesting detail about its creation.  </p><p>Ultimately, as I examined it, likening it to a diamond made sense. Like a diamond, the function of the main enchantment was deceptively simple despite its impressive potential. I couldn’t exactly identify what it was supposed to store. I had my suspicions, of course, but nothing I could conclusively prove before working on it with Oeyne. </p><p>Their desire to use Oeyne to repair it became clear, however. Clearly, the enchantments were not added later to the spear, but forged into its core during the crafting process, a trick that Oeyne was famous for. Interestingly, its nature reminded me of the designs we had created for my weapons —but much more matured than our quick drafts— which were designed for durability and maximum capacity over simple surface enchantments. </p><p>“How is it?” Delia asked, pulling me out of my musings. Luckily, the personality I was selling to her was a genius yet socially inept expert, making my focused examination an acceptable part of my disguise. “Do you think you can repair it?” </p><p>“Oh, definitely, but it’ll take a lot of time,” I said even as I summoned a piece of paper. “The first problem is the alignment of the fragments…” I started, quickly bursting into a complicated babble of magical terms that I deliberately made even more impenetrable by referring to a bunch of complicated magical theories and other stuff. </p><p>“Wow, really,” she exclaimed, looking appropriately fascinated at my explanation, even as she slid closer, brushing her leg against mine. “You’re such a genius? Can you repair it singlehandedly?” she asked.</p><p>“P-probably,” I suddenly stammered evasively. “It’s a bit tricky to handle the more menial parts,” I clarified hurriedly. “I’m more involved in the magical aspects and the conceptual design. The actual forging is a more pedestrian part of it, not really my area of interest,” I quickly added. That babble was not pointless. I was essentially telling her that I was overly proud of my own work despite my limited forging skills, and I was feeling self-conscious about that part, using bluster to suppress that sense of inferiority. </p><p>Essentially, I was selling the idea that my pride was another great lever to be used to manipulate me against both the headmistress and Oeyne, along with my lust. </p><p>“You’re amazing,” Delia said passionately, losing no time before grabbing the exact point of weakness I had presented to her. “I don’t know how many experts we have talked about it, and you’re the only one that could understand its nature in such detail in such a short time,” she said, giving me a pointless compliment. Because I was absolutely sure that she lacked the capability to understand even a tenth of my explanation even if I hadn’t been trying to make it intentionally impenetrable. </p><p>“It’s my honor to serve the royal family,” I said, pushing my chest proudly. </p><p>“So, how much time do you need to finish repairing the spear.” </p><p>“A few days, a week at most,” I started, and her eyes shone with shocked excitement. She suppressed that quickly, but not quickly enough to avoid my notice. “That should be enough to finish the preliminary analysis phase, so that I could start designing the repair procedure. Optimistically, we should be able to start reforging the spear in less than a month.” </p><p>“A month,” she murmured, unable to hide the panic in her eyes. I was happy to take a note of it, because it meant that they actually needed the spear for something, and they needed that relatively urgently. </p><p>“Yes, a month, unless there’s something unexpected of course,” I added, with a matter-of-fact tone that was very natural. </p><p>“Isn’t there a way to quicken the process, maybe using the research we previously conducted on the spear,” she questioned. </p><p>This time, I didn’t need to fake the derisive snort I let out. “Yeah, I read those notes, they are not worthy to be used as kindling. I don’t know who was responsible for those, but I would be surprised if they can actually enchant something more complicated than a light crystal.” Not that I needed to work much to break their confidence to their own experts, after all, if they had any hope of actually repairing the spear with their own skill, they wouldn’t have bothered to arrange it with Oeyne in such a complicated manner. </p><p>“Is there really no way to make it shorter?” she murmured, her eyes widened in a way that enhanced her vulnerability, her lower lip trembling just the correct amount, creating a paradoxical combination of pitiful and sexy, enough to make a lesser man fall in love at that instant. </p><p>“Well, maybe…” I murmured, as I tried to decide the best way to leverage their need. </p><p>“Really?” she said enthusiastically as she grabbed my arm, pulling it enough to accidentally push it to her modest bosom. “As you said, you’re a true genius,” she said, essentially forcing myself to back my earlier statement to impress her. </p><p> “Yeah, but it’s tough to work, I need to cancel or delay a few more projects, not to mention I need to build a dedicated room to study it, which will be really expensive. Also, I need to keep the spear in my possession for the next weeks. Then, maybe I could do that.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, we can’t give the spear, not when there’s a war going on,” she quickly refuted, which was something I expected. “Who knows when a breach might occur.” </p><p>“You’re correct, but I need almost unlimited access to it to handle that any quicker,” I answered with a helpless expression, waiting for her to offer what I wanted in the first place. </p><p>“How about building the laboratory in our residence,” she offered, unaware that was what I wanted in the first place. </p><p>“That might work,” I murmured reluctantly. “But it’ll be really expensive if you want quick results, more than I could afford my own.” </p><p>“How much?” she asked hesitantly, smart enough not to sign to an open check. </p><p>“Well…” I murmured as I pulled another piece of paper and drafted a few quick plans, each with a list of materials underneath. “Essentially, we have multiple options, each with its own cost structure,” I said as I quickly explained to her, while her eyes widened as she processed the small fortune that was required for even the worst room I designed. </p><p>“Are you sure all of those is necessary,” she said. </p><p>“The most critical part of it is to isolate the resonance of the different fragments so that we can avoid a cascading overload…” I started, drowning any possible argument she could put in another pointlessly complicated theory debate. And, the best part, since she was faking her own capabilities in order to sell the idea that she was more capable than she seemed, she couldn’t just admit that she didn’t understand even a bit. </p><p>“I need to discuss that with the princess,” she murmured. “But is this the cheapest possible,” she said, pointing at the least complicated part of it. </p><p>“Well, not necessarily, but there are other drawbacks to building something cheaper, like the need to add too many wards, which would have the risk of interference with the protective wards,” I said, and seeing her panic, I quickly followed. “Nothing catastrophic, but it might slightly impair the detection capabilities,” I added. </p><p>Actually, the analysis phase before the repair wasn’t that long, nor it required a dedicated magical laboratory to successfully achieve. But since I wanted to have an excuse to visit the temporary royal quarters limitlessly, it was an excellent excuse.  </p><p>The type of laboratory they would ultimately choose didn’t matter to me even a bit. All I needed was an excuse to establish a set of independent wards in their quarters, which could be used in a variety of ways depending on what I discovered about the objective of the princess, from infiltration to sabotage — even assassination if necessary. </p><p>“I see,” Delia murmured as she examined the paper I had filled with the schematics. “It’s not something I can decide on my own, I need to talk with the princess,” she said as she stood up. </p><p>“Aren’t you going to wait Oeyne,” I said, deliberately adding a tone of distaste as I pronounced Oeyne’s name, like I resented the necessity of her help in the first place. The existence of such easy leverage put a huge smile on Delia’s lips. </p><p>“I appreciate the help. I’m sure the princess would appreciate your help as well. How about if you host a private lunch tomorrow in our quarter, after we finish moving in,” she added. </p><p>“It would be my pleasure,” I said as I smiled excessively, following her to the door.

    "content": "<p>For a while, silence ruled the living room. </p><p>Well, not exactly silence, as there was still the music playing on TV, though the sight of several poorly-dressed men and women rubbing against each other with hardly helped the awkwardness of sharing a blanket between three naked young people —well, two naked, and one half-naked considering Sarah still had her bra on, but that wasn’t exactly what I would call a big difference. </p><p>“Should we change the channel?” Carrie whispered. </p><p>Before I could even say anything, Sarah jumped in, clearly unhappy with losing the earlier game, and looking for a chance to make her payback. “Sure, go ahead and get the remote,” she said with a smirk as she tightened her grip around the blanket, pointing at the magical black rectangle several feet away from our current position. </p><p>For a moment, I thought Carrie would actually do that, but instead, she decided to counter Sarah. “How about the loser of the next game goes and gets the remote?” </p><p>“You’re on,” Sarah answered, enthusiastic enough to ignore the sexiness of sharing a blanket to win a meaningless game over her friend. </p><p>I loved it. </p><p>“What is the game you have in mind?” I asked. </p><p>“Simple, seven minutes of heaven,” Sarah said, while Carrie blushed. Blushed, but not scandalized and panicked as they shared a gaze.  </p><p>“Interesting idea, and not that I’m against it, but doesn’t seven minutes in heaven require us to go a closet, defeating the whole purpose.” </p><p>“That’s why we’re going to play a modified version of it. Carrie and I going to take turns sitting on your lap, one minute each, and the first one to chicken would go and get the remote,” Sarah explained. “Unless you don’t think you can handle it, of course,” she added provocatively, putting me in her target as well. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I was not one of those virgin boys who blushed at the slightest innuendo, and was more than happy to meet her challenge with a confident smirk. She looked less than enthusiastic about that, clearly expecting me too flustered for some weird reason.</p><p>Before she could change the terms, however, Carrie reacted. “I agree, but as the loser of the last game, you should go first,” Carrie said. </p><p>Sarah blushed a bit, not expecting to be put on the spot, but that didn’t prevent her from nodding after a delayed pause, her pride not allowing from retreating a game she had set up. “Okay, keep the time, one minute,” she said to Carrie, sliding closer toward me, carefully not to lose the blanket.  </p><p>“So, where should I keep my hands,” I asked as I felt Sarah’s leg pressing against mine, trying to gather her courage without making it obvious to Carrie. </p><p>“Outside,” Sarah answered immediately, already feeling overwhelmed with our legs touching from the side. </p><p>“Someone is feeling stressed,” Carrie said smugly, more than willing to latch on Sarah’s mistake. </p><p>“Not stressed,” Sarah answered, but only after a second’s delay. “I’m just thinking that as escalation. After every round, he’s allowed to put one hand under the blanket,” Sarah quickly improvised. </p><p>I was impressed with her improvisational ability. On the assumption that Carrie’s confidence wouldn’t have handled sitting on my lap, it was a good strategy. Too bad for her that Carrie had already done a lot more impressive stuff than perching on me naked. “It seems pretty clear,” I said with a smirk. “But you have to sit close enough that your back will press against my chest without leaning back too much.” </p><p>That earned a furious look from Sarah, which only made her even sexier —which was a challenge considering her state of dress. Still, she stayed silent as she climbed on my lap carefully, only to turn and send me a dirty look when my cock, fully erect, brushed against her ass. “Someone is enthusiastic,” she said bitingly, trying to shame me. She didn’t bother keeping the blanket up above the chest level, considering she was still wearing her bra. </p><p>“Honey, I have two sexy girls naked under the blanket with me, I would be reacting even if I was gay,” I said even as I put my hands on her shoulders and pulled her against my chest, which made sure the crown of my cock was pressing against the small of her back. </p><p>She turned to Carrie. “Start the clock,” she ordered. </p><p>Carrie did so with a huge smile, clearly enjoying Sarah’s discomfort, which was several times worse than the earlier strip tower game. It got even worse when I squeezed her tits without a warning. “Hey,” she said, sliding off my lap in shock. </p><p>“You said hands need to be outside the blanket, and they were outside,” I said shamelessly. </p><p>“You lost already,” Carrie said with a huge smile. “You</p><p>“No!” Sarah gasped, her eyes wide. “That doesn’t count. He cheated.” </p><p>“Hey, I followed all the rules,” I said before turning to Carrie. “Still, it’s a pity to stop five seconds after we started. How about you give her a condition to continue?” </p><p>Enthusiastic about her victory, Carrie didn’t seem to mind me cupping her friends’ breasts. She was lost in the excitement of ever-escalating challenges. </p><p>”Well, if she climbs on your lap again and you remove her bra, and for the rest of the game, she needs to sit the other way.” </p><p>“That’s too much,” Sarah said immediately. </p><p>“You lost, then,” Carrie said with a wide smile, pushing Sarah just like she had been being pushed earlier. </p><p>Sarah grumbled, her lips staying shut, but that didn’t prevent her from carefully climbing my lap the other way, her lack of panties making it a much more dangerous affair. She pulled the blanket over her torso, and I sneaked my hands under, unhooking her bra smooth before dragging it out slowly. She pressed her chest against mine, her nipples noticeably hard against my skin. </p><p>“Delicious,” I murmured even as I grabbed her waist over the blanket, pulling her forcibly closer, pushing her wetness against the base of my shaft. </p><p>Her eyes widened, but this time, the panic was a little part of her emotions, overwhelmed by growing desire. After all, despite all her bravado, she was no more experienced with the opposite sex than Carrie had been before we started our little private lessons. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her even more, but I had a feeling that I was already dancing Sarah’s limits of resistance, and pushing more would make her surrender. </p><p>“Time,” Carrie finally called, letting Sarah relax as she slid away, though her relaxation immediately turned into victory. </p><p>“Your turn,” Sarah said with a smirk, acting like she was already victorious. </p><p>Carrie just smiled confidently as she slid closer, careful to keep the blanket over her shoulders, but I felt a sense of alarm when she looked at me mischievously, like she had something against me as well. </p><p>I realized her plan too late when she climbed my lap, but pushed her ass far too much, swallowing me into her wetness. She gasped exaggeratedly, using that reaction to hide her moan as my shaft fully lodged into her pussy, her wetness after the extended foreplay phenomenally beautiful. </p><p>I had to bite my lips to prevent a moan of my own as her back rubbed against my chest. Luckily, Sarah was distracted by Carrie’s exaggerated reaction to actually look at my face. I stilled, using the opportunity to recover from her delicious surprise. However, I knew how to make her pay. I decided not to react in any way, not giving her any more excuses to cry or moan, forcing her to keep her reactions hidden.</p><p>From the way her hips were already rocking in enthusiasm, it didn’t seem like she had any chance to actually succeed on that. </p><p>Then, Sarah interjected, unaware of the real game. “It’s not fair, grab her body as well,” Sarah said suddenly, her tone scandalized, so much that she stopped caring about the blanket for a moment, and it started sliding down, giving me an unrestricted view of her tits for a fleeting second before she fixed it. “I’m not starting the timer before you put your hands on her body.” Despite the momentary flash, she was smug, like she had just got one over Carrie, unaware she had given her friend a lifeline instead. </p><p>Carrie didn’t waste a second before grabbing my wrist with one hand —the other firmly holding the blanket in place, afraid of revealing the true show— and put it directly on her breast, with only the blanket to insulate her from my touch. </p><p>Sarah looked at her, surprised at her daring, while I leaned in and whispered in a way Sarah wouldn’t hear. “So, that’s how you want to play,” I said even as I moved my fingers before squeezing her nipples hard —something she had enjoyed immensely during our earlier private encounters. </p><p>The moan she let out was spectacular, making Sarah look at her in shock as well, her earlier sense of victory abandoned for wonderment. At that point, she would have realized just how far things were devolving, if it wasn’t for the amazing spectacle Carrie was creating as I brought my other hand as well, caressing and squeezing her breaths aggressively. </p><p>Luckily, when her hips started to move in response, there was no way for me to hide the expression of enjoyment. After all, the illusion of having a busty beauty giving a naked lap dance should be enough to distract Sarah from the truth even when my face was contorted with pleasure. </p><p>Still, even with that, I doubted just how long Sarah’s suspicions delay, as Carrie was steadily losing any hint of control. Funnily enough, a moment later Sarah accidentally gave Carrie the opportunity to hide her expression. She jumped in when Carrie’s back separated from my back. “Aha, you also made the same mistake, now, reverse and start again. You need to last two minutes.” </p><p>“O-okay,” Carrie answered immediately as she pulled back, the relief on her face clear. With my aggressive play, she had realized teasing me wasn’t as easy as she thought, and she was clearly thinking of taking it easier. </p><p>I had no intention of letting her do that, of course. Not when she had taken the initiative to tease me. Just as she lowered herself, I grabbed her, large, luscious ass, even the thickness of the blanket unable to do anything to hide its marvelousness, sliding inside her again. </p><p>Carrie decided to handle that differently, showing that she could be quick-witted. She buried her face to the nook of my neck, hiding her face from Sarah as she bit her lips, focusing on keeping silent. Her ass, however, continued to move up and down, showing that she had no intention of taking my trick passively. </p><p>I was impressed. </p><p>Sarah watched the scene with glee at first, misunderstanding the reason for Carrie’s action. But even with the confusing presence of the almost softcore erotic scenes on TV and the satisfaction, she was getting from her illusion of success, a hint of doubt worming itself to her face. “It’s time,” she murmured when it was time to stop, unable to hide the tone of suspicion from her tone. </p><p>Carrie was too occupied with suppressing her own cries as she pulled herself up, missing Sarah’s expression in the process. </p><p>Meanwhile, Sarah climbed on my lap, once again facing toward me without any prompting from Carrie, looking at my face carefully. Then, she did something that surprised me, and wrapped her hand around my shaft, her eyes widening as she registered the wetness of my shaft. A wetness that evenly covered my girth, impossible to achieve just by giving a lap dance. </p><p>“Good detective work,” I whispered mockingly even as I waited for her to process the realization that one of her best friends was being fucked under the blanket. </p><p>All that remained was her reaction… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Observing the Councilwoman Fernhand as she watched the other nobles leave with an absolutely smug expression on her face, controlling everything, reminded me of the time I was just a young ambitious mercenary with no background, trying just to survive while those smug members of the dark families looked down on me despite their limited capabilities. </p><p>It took several years, but I had successfully taught them the cost of looking at me like that. </p><p>And while Fernhand wasn’t wearing that expression directly toward me, funnily enough, it made that even worse. After all, she was smug enough to treat not just me, but also everything I had accomplished as a Dark Lord as nothing more than a detail to her plans. </p><p>So, I decided to show her that discounting me from her plans was not the best idea. </p><p>I didn’t burst in immediately, of course. First, I had slowly unraveled the remaining protections of the room, which was surprisingly easy. Most of the wards were about protecting the documents and tracking the thieves, not protecting the occupants. Reasonable, considering it was in the middle of the palace. </p><p>Pity that it didn’t factor in an escaped prisoner Dark Lord with free access to the securest places in the Empire. Then, I didn’t bother changing my clothing before entering her office, using the main entrance. </p><p>She looked up at the unannounced visitor, her face scrunched with disgust as an uninvited servant burst into her room. To her credit, Fernhand was smart enough to realize no servant just burst in with such confidence, and reacted with outward calmness. “Can I help you?” she asked, managing to hide her shock even as she activated an alarm ward, calling for guards. </p><p>Too bad for her I had already disconnected it. </p><p>I didn’t bother speaking as I closed the door behind me before I sat the chair across her, crossed my legs, and leaned back, like I owned the place. She looked at me, maintaining a surface calm, but the more her guards didn’t appear, the more she was starting to get stressed. </p><p>Funnily enough, she didn’t seem to recognize me without my imposing armor set. We never had the pleasure of meeting, of course, but I would have expected them to circulate a drawing of me at least. Or maybe, she wasn’t able to connect the imposing figure wearing midnight black armor to one wearing servant clothes. </p><p>She said nothing, waiting for the guards to arrive. I said nothing, waiting for her to either recognize me, or to realize the guards wouldn’t be arriving. </p><p>She schooled her expression to an impassive wall, trying to act like she was calm, even as she sent a surface mental probe. I could have let it read a set of fake thoughts, or even tried to counter-attack through the connection, but instead, I just destroyed it, signaling that I was also experienced in mind magics, but without revealing my actual ability.</p><p>To her credit, she didn’t react other than giving a gentle nod, acknowledging my abilities and her own miscalculation, but otherwise stayed silent, testing my patience. After all, I was the one that burst into her room in the middle of the day, and the fact that I could wait for her to act meant that I was confident in my position. </p><p>That was enough to force her into a passive position. </p><p>It was almost at the two-minute mark that her eyes widened slightly as a hint of recognition wormed into her eyes. Still, considering the supposedly dead dark lord was sitting across her, limiting her reaction to that rather than shouting in panic was the proof of her ability to control her reactions. </p><p>So was her first statement. A less capable person would have asked how it was possible for me to be alive, or what I wanted to do with them after sneaking into their room. She gave a simple statement. “She’s even smarter than I had thought.” </p><p>“People can always surprise you,” I commented, fairly confident that she was talking about the Queen. “Especially if one relies on certain spies with more ambition than sense,” I said, acting arrogantly. After all, Dark Lords were known for their monologuing when they thought of themselves as superior. </p><p>And just like that, every single information she managed to get from Emma was in suspect, including anything she might have been revealed about my imprisonment —whether she actually revealed my identity or not. To make things even better, it wouldn’t matter even if she had validated them through reading her mind, because it wouldn’t remove the possibility of arranging things just for that eventuality. </p><p>She let out a desperate sigh as she spoke. “May I be privileged to learn how I can help such an esteemed guest, unless you’re planning to assassinate me.” </p><p>Not bad, I thought. Other than the slight exaggeration, she managed to convey her fake desperation perfectly, and mentioning assassination explicitly despite being fairly sure that wasn’t the aim —she wouldn’t have seen me at all on that condition— meant that it was the best way to initiate the discussion. Highlighting her weakness, and hoping for my arrogance to reveal more than necessary. </p><p>“Well, if you could kindly raise your hand and suppress your mana, I’ll give you a detailed explanation,” I said even as I grabbed the letter opener on her desk. She hesitated, which, admittedly was a smart thing to do. Letting a known Dark Lord draw blood was not the smartest thing to do.  </p><p>But it was easy to break her laziness. “Or we can go with the second option,” I said, which was enough for her to raise her hand. I had no intention of killing her, of course, and she clearly suspected that was the case. But suspecting and being sure was two different things, especially when </p><p>It was the cost of their arrogance, I realized. The same tactic was nearly useless against anyone in the dark lands, because their personal fighting capabilities would be enough to create a commotion. Fernhand, on the other hand, was clearly a specialized expert in terms of magic, just like Sapphire, dedicating the rest of their time to politics. </p><p>Considering their impressive rise despite their relatively modest beginnings —Sapphire was a simple concubine, and Fernhand was a minor noble— it was a good strategy. </p><p>Too bad it left them completely helpless against facing someone like me, who had been forced to become an expert in a dozen things just to survive. </p><p>It took Fernhand just five seconds under my sharp gaze to surrender and raise her hand. I used the letter opener to create a very small wound in her finger, and used that to cast a spell. A spell that took almost fifteen minutes to cast, owing to its complication, though more accurately, it was a curse. A curse of my own design, one that could be only unraveled by a number of people less than my fingers. </p><p>“Done,” I said with a smile as I let the complicated mana patterns sink into her skin, not bothering to explain anything. She hid her tenseness with a surprising composure, giving me more and more credit. She waited silently for me to explain the spell I had just cast. </p><p>“Just a simple spell to make sure you won’t be leaking secrets,” I said. “One touch of mana, and I won’t be worrying about future leaks, and before you start thinking about escaping far away, you should wait for my visit weekly, or a little time tracker I embedded in the spell will trigger,” I said. I didn’t go into details describing the spell effects, nor did I need to. Her imagination could handle that part better than anything else I could describe. After all, it was a spell that was cast by a dark lord with great difficulty. </p><p>Reputation was a surprisingly useful currency in such circumstances.</p><p>Of course, there were a few reasons for me to cast that spell on Fernhand while I hadn’t bothered to cast them on others. The Queen and the princess were simply too high ranked, and could easily hire people to remove it without suspicion, nor that it was necessary in the first place. For Emma, the knowledge of her disastrous mistake as she tried to balance her status between Fernhand and the Queen was enough to keep her contained. </p><p>It was the mistake most dark lords and aspiring dark lords made, applying more pressure than needed, preventing the development of any possible positive feelings. Even if I managed to control Aria with such a spell, for example, it would have been impossible for her to develop feelings toward me. </p><p>Fernhand was a different issue, of course. Not only she was smart, but also I lacked leverage. Even for the Queen, her need for my cooperation was much greater than my need for hers, giving me a lot of angles to play. For my dear councilwoman, the only thing I could do was to threaten her explicitly before I could get a better understanding of her. </p><p>“So, my dear, since that unpleasantness is behind us, let’s talk…” I started.</p><p>“Yes, let’s talk,” she said, once again calm. “How can I help my new lord, or should I just go and report to the Queen?” </p><p>I chuckled, once again impressed with her attitude, trying to question me in the form of a subtle question. “A quick learner, I’m impressed,” I said. I wasn’t stupid enough to take her display of loyalty at face value, of course, but that didn’t mean I could. “But you’re under a bit of misconception. Sapphire and I are … friends … at the moment. But there’s nothing preventing me from making new friends, unless you prefer listening to your dear Queen, of course. If that’s the case, I can arrange a meeting.” </p><p>It was a simple yet effective lie. My clear freedom in the palace grounds, combined with the news of my demise after a battle arranged by Sapphire created an erroneous picture that the battle was just for show, and I was a willing visitor at the palace. After all, the case of me being a prisoner yet escaping and having free access to the most secure place in the Empire of Light was too ridiculous to consider. </p><p>“I would prefer the first case, of course,” she said, not even waiting for a second. After all, she was smart enough to realize that between me and Sapphire, who needed her more. Sapphire just needed her to stop for her faction to lose effectiveness. I could use her help to do some interesting things instead… </p><p>Then, I was just trying to decide how to handle my new pawn, when she stood up and started unbuttoning her blouse, revealing a delicious alabaster skin underneath that contrasted with her black hair perfectly, showing great initiative. </p><p>Of course, she was clearly using her sexuality as a deliberate weapon to distract me, but that didn’t make it any less fun. On the contrary, it would be a nice change of pace after the playful seduction I was conducting —which, while fun, not exactly my preferred way of progress. </p><p>Maybe I would enjoy my new pawn even more than I expected. Now, all I needed to do was to decide the way to take her… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was planning to finish the dinner without making a major move, when I noticed Olivia’s excited gaze was sliding down to my hand, which was still around the thigh of the brunette girl from an Equites family —one I was yet to learn her name despite our closeness. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t the only one that noticed it. Marcus, the boy who had thought himself to be my competitor, noticed that detail due to extra attention he was paying on the hostess of the evening, preparing to lash out. </p><p>Olivia’s attraction gave me a rather indecent idea to prove myself to her. Or more accurately, it gave me an opportunity, because with all the training I was going through, I was feeling horny, and squeezing the tight body of a noble lady who was doing her best to rub her body against mine wasn’t exactly helping me to keep my calm. The only problem was the crowd of annoying males, who would no doubt try to push me away if I dared to make an open move. </p><p>Luckily, their fragile egos gave me the option I needed. “So, boys,” I said after finishing another story. “How about a drinking game, so that you can show me the famous strength of the Roman nobles,” I said, both my words and my tone filled with an exaggerated superiority. Just what I needed to trigger a bunch of hotheaded youths. </p><p>“You-” Marcus started angrily, only to be interrupted by Olivia. </p><p>“What an excellent idea,” she said. “Don’t you think so, Marcus?”</p><p>“I don’t think competing with a barbarian means anything,” Marcus answered tersely. </p><p>“Don’t worry boy, I can compete against all of you together, unless you’re scared of even that, of course,” I said with a hearty laugh. Making an enemy of so many little nobles might cut some of the probabilities, but it would also give me a reputation among the female part of the noble population. And rather than entertaining a bunch of noble teenagers with fragile egos, I would prefer sampling the flowers of upper society. </p><p>“Arrogant barbarian,” Marcus growled as he quickly filled his glass with wine and drained it up immediately. </p><p>I just smirked as I gestured to the noble girl I was currently caressing, and she filled my glass with a shocked yet aroused giggle. Just because she was trying to impress Olivia didn’t mean she was unaffected by my skilled touches. </p><p>Making a noble girl serve me wine worked perfectly to incense the other boys in the room, and they joined the game with great fervor, only to fall rather quickly as I used a simple spell to strengthen their alcohol, before they even realized just how far they had gone. </p><p>It barely took ten minutes. </p><p>“I can’t say I’m impressed,” I said even as I grabbed the ass of the noble girl that was serving me during the competition and pulled her on my lap, lodging my raging arousal between her asscheeks, showing my intention fully. “So, my noble ladies, is there any chance I could show you how my tribe rewards a victorious hero?” I said even as I slipped my hand under her skirt, brushing her wetness. </p><p>Not all noblewomen were interested in that. Some were clearly shocked by the initiative I was showing, while some were interested, they watched the situation with someone who was watching a forest fire —a spectacular view, but not to get closer.</p><p>There were two exceptions —well, three counting the enthusiastic social climber that was rubbing herself against my lap. Olivia, that delicious redhead who was currently hosting the party, and another blonde girl that was standing next to her all night. Adding to the sexy brunette on my lap, it represented a delicious spread. </p><p>And just when one of the others was about to interject, Olivia spoke with a sharp tone that belied no argument. “Sounds interesting, show me,” she said, unable to hide the shine of interest in her eyes. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said, not bothering to hide my mocking gaze even as I grabbed the dress of the brunette and ripped it off with a sharp pull, worthy of a barbarian. It earned a couple of shocked cries, and some of the women had already left the place, but with Olivia taking a step closer to get a better view, no one tried to stop me as I freed my shaft from my pants.</p><p>However, the shocked gasps they let out earlier were nothing as I suddenly pushed her off my lap to the floor, grabbed her head, and pulled her closer to me. Her eyes widened in shock, but her desire to struggle was abandoned quickly as Olivia gasped in appreciation, which contrasted greatly with the scandalized gasps the rest let out. </p><p>Clearly, in their mind, playing with a barbarian was one thing, and being treated as a slave was something much different. </p><p>The brunette opened her mouth obediently and I grabbed her head, skewering her with my length mercilessly. “So rough, so strong,” Olivia murmured in appreciation as she took a step closer despite her blonde friend’s attempts to grab her arm and keep her in place. “Make it a good show, Cera,” she then added, finally giving me the name of the sexy brunette I had I had been molesting for a while. </p><p>I kept one hand on Cera’s head while letting the other drop-down around her tits, mauling them hard enough to leave a soft pink mark. It wasn’t the best way to tease a girl under normal circumstances, but it fit my barbarian warrior persona perfectly. Though from the stuffed moans Cera was letting out, she didn’t seem like she was particularly minding. </p><p>“Why not come closer for a better view, mistress,” I said as I looked at Olivia, once again pronouncing the last word with a mocking edge. But my disrespect was clearly making Olivia feel even more aroused, her nipples visibly pushing against her silky dress. </p><p>Olivia just smiled confidently before shrugging the grasp of her blonde friend before she slowly walked closer, her breaths getting noticeably shallower despite her best efforts to keep it even to create an impassive demeanor. Her friend just followed her helplessly. Meanwhile, Cera’s lips were desperately wrapped around my shaft as used her mouth as a hole to relieve my barbarian desires. </p><p>I didn’t bother to suppress my moans and gasps, which only worked to enhance my domineering barbarian aura. Despite Cera’s obvious lack of skills —giving blowjobs were certainly something that was supposed to be below those nobles women— the hotness of her mouth was delicious. My iron grip around her head, determining the pace perfectly, only enhanced those sensations. </p><p>However, the fact that I could sense her arousal climbing up with a noticeable speed made it even better. Just a minute later, her tongue joined our little game as an active participant, moving around instinctively. I started fucking her throat even deeper, seeking true satisfaction… </p><p>Then, I noticed something even more interesting. Despite their initial reluctance, the outer edge of observers had walked closer, their legs rubbing against each other in a suspicious manner. Apparently, it wasn’t just Cera or Olivia who had fantasies about rough treatment from barbarian gladiators. </p><p>As a noble scion myself, I decided that it was my task to properly fulfill the wishes of those repressed noble ladies who had worked hard every day to consume the riches of the Republic! I let Cera pull out for a moment, and while she used that to catch her breath, I grabbed her waist and pulled her to my lap, and without a warning, skewered her with my girth. </p><p>The moan she let out as she swallowed my full length without prior preparation was simply spectacular. Luckily, she was wet enough after extended foreplay during the drinking game. Her tunnel trapped my girth, doing its best to extract its reward, while I grabbed her waist with both hands, and forced her to move at a spectacular speed. </p><p>Around, I could see that the women that surrounded me were already on the edge, so I cheated a bit by letting my aura slip out, adding another layer to my domineering presence. After that, I wasn’t surprised to see the surrounding crowd taking the seat at the nearest available surface, their hands immediately disappearing under their dress. </p><p>The effect on Olivia and her blonde friend was even more spectacular. They both watched the moving body of Cera. Olivia was already lost in anticipation, trembling excitedly. Her friend was slightly better, her eyes still carrying a dose of panic that struggled to survive under the rush of pleasure. </p><p>Still, her alertness wasn’t enough to prevent me from grabbing her arm and pulling her to the seat next to me, much to her panic, and much to Olivia’s perverted amusement. She tried to stand up, only to find out that my hold on her arm was not just a suggestion. “Olivia-” she tried to gasp, only to be silenced by my lips, aggressively stealing a kiss. </p><p>When I pulled back, she had a dazed expression on her face. Olivia just exploded in laughter. “Such an interesting way to lose your first kiss,” she commented even as she took a seat on the other side of her blonde friend, helping me to keep her in place. </p><p>A brunette social-climber that bitten more than she could chew, a surprisingly inexperienced blonde considering her social class, and a redhead who was still significantly overestimating her ability to control the situation, not to mention several other ladies of high status who was currently busy fingering themselves at the sight of me violating their equally-noble peers. </p><p>The house visit was shaping to be even more interesting than I had expected… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I opened the door, I was surprised to notice that there was only one visitor, a blonde girl whose body was hidden under a practical thick linen shirt and loose leather pants combo, like she was another craftsman. A figure I had seen from the distance as they were leaving the princess’ cart, though that time, she was wearing a fancy dress. </p><p>One of the handmaidens. </p><p>A moment of silence stretched as we both processed the unexpected scene. She was clearly expecting to meet with Oeyne, and I was expecting to find a bigger procession than just one of the handmaidens, carrying a wrapped bundle. “I’m here for a meeting,” she said, trying to look unperturbed. </p><p>“She’s out for an emergency, but she should be back in a few minutes,” I said even as I stepped to the side, allowing her to pass uninterrupted. “And I can help if it’s an emergency.” </p><p>“No, it can wait,” she said. She stepped inside, her eyes examining the room in a systematic manner, but she managed to hide that behind a casual glance. That glance alone was enough to tell me that I was dealing with another infiltration expert. Her choice of clothing, clearly prepared to impress Oeyne at first glance, showing they had done their homework.</p><p>Too bad for them that my presence was not something they could have prepared for, which meant that they were playing from a significantly disadvantageous position. Just by sending an agent with such extensive preparation, they had given me one critical piece of information. Whatever they want Oeyne repairing was not just an excuse for them to bring an army to the school, but something they genuinely wanted to achieve. </p><p>It was critical information for me to determine my next steps. </p><p>Well, considering they came with a small army, and my attention was split between two other critical projects, the game board was already weighing toward their side, so I was happy to get every scrap of advantage I could.</p><p>While she prioritized examining the room first, I decided on a temporary personality to pick up, so, when she turned to face me once more, she caught me looking at her ass, only to jump back to her face with a blush, giving the impression that I could be easily manipulated through seduction. </p><p>It was intentional. I wanted to enjoy passively as a sexy blonde tried to manipulate me through seduction. It would be a nice change of pace. </p><p>She proved that she was a professional when it came to the game when she looked deeply into my eyes even as her posture shifted. It wasn’t a major shift, but she leaned forward a bit more, her neck tilted vulnerably, one of her hands on her hips to accentuate the curves of her otherwise lithe body. With her blonde hair beautifully circling her innocent yet beautiful face, she was truly a perfect weapon. </p><p>“So, who exactly are you?” she said with a tingly tone even as she took a step forward, cutting the distance just a bit. </p><p>“I’m one of the special blacksmiths of the headmistress,” I said even as I puffed my chest pridefully, giving the impression that I was trying to impress her. “She had decided that a task assigned by the princess deserves the best attention.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” she said, failing to hide a calculative flash going through her expression, and a slight amount of panic. They clearly didn’t appreciate the headmistress knowing about the task, which was why I decided to steal another shy glance of her tits, selling the idea that I was easy to manipulate. </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>She might be good, but I was better, so it wasn’t entirely surprising when, after sending a thoughtful glance toward the door, she decided to stay inside. “Of course,” I said proudly, puffing my chest. “I’m the strongest mage when it comes to magical analysis and mana capacity.”</p><p>“How impressive,” she murmured, even as she relaxed even more. She wasn’t completely convinced yet, but my excessive mana capability and magical analysis not only served their needs perfectly —their own capabilities in the area were clearly a mess— but also reduced the chance of having other abilities to trick her. </p><p>Too bad for her that I was playing in a completely different class. </p><p>“Thanks,” I murmured even as I looked shyly. “And may I learn the name of such a beautiful lady?” </p><p>“It’s Delia,” she said, then continued without taking a break. “I have been fascinated by forging since I was a child. Would you mind showing me an example of your skills?” </p><p>“It would be my pleasure,” I said with an enthusiastic smile as I walked toward the other side of the forge, where Oeyne was still trapped in a cabinet, suffering under the tyrannical grasp of the buzzing spell. “Any preference?” </p><p>“Maybe a dagger,” she said. </p><p>“As you wish, milady,” I said even as I grabbed an ingot, a magically-treated steel block that represented a small fortune, showing that just how my poor decision-making had become as I was grasped by the desire to impress her. Then, I flared my mana, saturating the steel with my magic, the excess enough to blanket the room. </p><p>[-698 Mana]</p><p>Her eyes widened as the mana filled the room. The mana I had just burst out was enough to make someone a valuable mage, and I was clearly not near my limits. My hammer danced on the surface of the forge for the next few minutes, giving an impression that I was stretching both my mana manipulation and forging abilities to the limit. </p><p>Of course, it was impossible for her to know that my expression was less about the dagger I was forging, and more about the little game I was playing with Oeyne. </p><p>I had flipped open the cabinet door, and slipped my foot between Oeyne’s chained legs, drenching the top of my foot with her wetness as I caressed, turning her already difficult ordeal into the torture of pleasure. She groaned and moaned despite the gag, forcing me to establish a subtle silencing ward —which also confirmed that my current opponent might have some interesting subterfuge skills, but her magical abilities were clearly lacking. </p><p>Which meant the chances of her being the thief was very low. </p><p>With that, I split my attention between sending her lovesick glares and teasing Oeyne under the cabinet, sometimes directly through my foot, sometimes using a mage hand to caress her tits, turning her into a volcano ready to explode. </p><p>Five minutes later, I raised the dagger with a proud yet exhausted expression, having spent almost as much as mana I had spent in the beginning, giving her an idea about my mana capacity —a false one, of course.</p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>From her expression, carrying a subtle tone of smugness, I was sure that she was completely sold on my personality, just as I desired. “Such an impressive work,” she said as she walked to my side of the forge, forcing me to cast a quick spell to erase any possible smell. She grabbed the dagger —an elegant piece that would be perfect for a lady like her to carry— dragging her finger over its edge suggestively. “It will be a true masterpiece after it’s sharpened and polished,” she said. Her fascinated gaze dancing on the dagger was clearly begging me to offer to her —exaggerated to make sure I understood her intent. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” I said pridefully. “Just let me catch my breath for a moment, and your gift will be ready.” </p><p>“A gift, for me!” she said, her eyes far too wide to be a natural reaction as she put her hand on my forearm, squeezing my muscles. “You’re amazing!” </p><p>“It’s nothing much,” I said, shyly rubbing my head as I moved toward the large couch on the corner, far away from the forge. She walked along with me, keeping her hand around my arm, even after I had sat down. </p><p>“You must have a lot of stories about forging,” she suggested enthusiastically. </p><p>“Of course, like the time I was repairing a magical spear that was about to explode due to an unstable matrix…” I said before spinning a completely imaginary story that presented myself as an obsessive blacksmith whose attention split between his work and making sure he looked heroic, with a weak spot for beauties —though the last part was only implied to make it believable. </p><p>Thirty minutes, and two stories later, she was confident enough that she had deciphered my personality as an easy-to-manipulate blacksmith whose connection to the headmistress was through his production capabilities rather than any sensitive stuff. As a nice bonus, stretching my abilities in front of a diplomacy expert finally allowed me to completely mature my last remaining skill. </p><p>[+4 Speech]</p><p>“You’re so impressive,” she said as she continued to caress my arm, clearly not intending to do anything other than that. “Since you’re the magical expert, would you mind examining it first,” she said, before adding hurriedly. “Unless it would be a problem with Oeyne, of course. She’s the owner of the forge, after all.” </p><p>“Not at all,” I said quickly, too quickly even, showing that I didn’t appreciate Oeyne’s implied authority, giving the princess’ side an illusionary chance to play us against each other while we worked on their mysterious artifact. </p><p>“If you’re sure,” she said. “I wouldn’t want such a handsome man like you to get into trouble, after all,” she said, easily removing the sting of her earlier doubt. </p><p>With my control over my body, fake-blushing was a trivial achievement. She passed me the bundle, which had a broken spear, one that was clearly ancient. While she continued to caress my arm, I flared my mana, examining the structure of the spear. </p><p>However, before the spear, I used the flare of magic to disguise a small slip of mana, exploring her soul space to make sure her magical capabilities were indeed limited. My earlier assumptions turned out to be true. She completely lacked any kind of magical capability. Even her combat-related skills were extremely limited. Other than a dagger skill, her stats were split between observational skills and speech skills, creating a truly impressive mixture of diplomat and spy. If our stats were equal, she probably could run circles around my attempts to be clever. Overall, she was slightly below level twenty, making her a dangerous powerhouse in the general standards of the world, especially with her interesting focus. </p><p>Too bad for her that even my lowest stat doubled her highest stat, making her hopelessly outmatched. </p><p>With the shadow of being noticed resolved, I finally turned my attention to the broken remains of the rusty spear, curious about its value… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I pushed into Oeyne’s enthusiastic throat as she lay on her forge, wearing nothing but a sexy corset that was getting dirtier and dirtier with each passing moment, I couldn’t help but feel that despite all the bullshit I had gone through with the repeated battles and upcoming political crisis, it was worth it. </p><p>The way she clamped around my throat tightened as I pushed repeatedly was legendary, something that could never be achieved by the other girls due to the difference in their physical stats. Not even Aviada was enough to compete, at least, not yet. </p><p>Even as I was pushing into her delicious throat, however, I let my mana invade her soul space, examining her abilities. However, this time, I wasn’t trying to quantify or assess her abilities. I was trying to examine her power from a fresh perspective after my lengthy discussion with the headmistress. </p><p>Even knowing the artificial nature of the System, it was hard to find actual evidence through actual examination. Maybe my abilities weren’t truly developed yet —or maybe I shouldn’t be trying to multitask between pulling her hair and ravaging her throat while trying to do such a delicate experiment— but I failed to notice anything that would truly support the headmistress’ explanation. </p><p>It didn’t mean she was lying to me, of course, just as it didn’t mean she was being completely honest. In the end, it was a complicated issue, not something that could be validated immediately —and even validating meant very little unless I could start acquiring more details. So, I decided to turn my full attention back to Oeyne, who had been deliciously gasping as I invaded her throat repeatedly. </p><p>The way her arousal was increasing as I invaded her throat aggressively was a thing of beauty, her tendencies toward bondage showing itself. I decided to tease her a bit more, and grabbed a silver ingot, infusing it with my mana to soften before I started shaping it into a delicate state through my magic. I wasn’t using my fire mana, however, but earth mana, forcing the metal to reshape directly without softening. </p><p>A costly trick that exchanged an excess of mana and structural integrity for showmanship and speed, but I reinforced the metal with the second flood of my mana to reinforce the metal to make sure it wouldn’t just shatter with Oeyne’s strength. </p><p>[-691 Mana]</p><p>After all, it wouldn’t be proper bondage if she could just shatter her bonds with a pull. </p><p>Since her mouth was still blocked, she wasn’t able to comment on my tricky blacksmithing display, but I was familiar enough with her expression to realize she was impressed by my progress once again. After all, while she could easily do a similar trick with better quality, she was a focused blacksmith with years of experience, and I was a hobbyist at best. </p><p>Distracted by my display, she didn’t pay much attention to the trajectory of the floating handcuffs until they locked around her wrists, locking her arms behind her, rendering her helpless. She wasn’t unhappy about it, however, easily displayed by the way her moans gained another layer of enthusiasm, her arousal flaring. </p><p>I decided to make things even more entertaining. Another flare of mana —this time much smaller— later, a cube of ice was slowly floating down, but she had only noticed it when it touched her neck, gently gliding down to caress her naked shoulders. </p><p>She flinched in surprise at the first contact, but her eyes grew as she understood the source. Pity that she couldn’t comment on that as I slowly added a second one, this time dancing around her lips, the same lips that were tightly wrapped around my shaft to contain its girth. </p><p>“Is there something wrong,” I said even as I grabbed her hair and pulled it hard enough to be painful. “You seem a bit tense.” She couldn’t stammer an answer, but her moans were sufficiently revealing. She was on the edge of an explosion. </p><p>Pity I had no intention of actually stopping there, not when it was just a beginning. </p><p>I pulled out without a warning. She opened her mouth to question, only to cry in shock as I moved my hands under her shoulder and pulled her over the surface, until she was on her knees in front of me, her corset ruined completely in the process. And since it was ruined, it was no great waste when I ripped it off from her body. However, rather than ripping it off completely, I let the ruined scraps pool around her waist, the stained white of the corset contrasting beautifully with her skin. The shine of the silver handcuffs just added to the moment. </p><p>She definitely looked like a desperate damsel, fallen under the lacking mercy of a warlord. I wasted no time before slipping inside her mouth, while another two ice cubes joined the fray, circling around her breasts to enhance her pleasure even further. </p><p>As much as I enjoyed repeatedly sliding inside her mouth, her beautiful mouth wasn’t her only worthy quality, not when her caramel tits were waiting for my attention. I pulled out, only to bring my hands around her tits, pressing them against each other to create a delicious valley for myself before I launched a merciless assault. </p><p>“Fuck my tits,” she gasped even before her wheezing subsided, showing that the pain and restrictions that had been applied on her were only making her hornier. After spending her life in a forge, her definition of rough certainly differed compared to other people. </p><p>“Oh, who are you to give me orders?” I said mockingly even as I twisted her nipple painfully enough to hurt even her. I didn’t waste much time before freeing my foot from my shoe before using my soles to gently caress her thighs, contrasting with my otherwise rough treatment. </p><p>She definitely noticed when her foot started to climb toward her core while teasing her inner thigh. It didn’t take a genius to read my intention, but she only moaned in appreciation before leaning down and capturing the crown of my shaft, the base still sliding up and down between her beautiful tits. </p><p>Not that I would have really cared if she was not on board. At this point, it was too late for her to stop me or change the balance. Until we call an end to it, she was my toy -unless she could get out of her bindings. Her strength was not sufficient, not that it prevented her from stretching to test that occasionally. She even tried to use her mana to manipulate the handcuffs just like I had done earlier. She could have easily removed them if it wasn’t for my intervention. </p><p>Her crafting skills might be much stronger than mine, but the same didn’t apply to mana potency. She had to spend all of her mana in a burst just to have a chance of success, but that wouldn’t mean anything when I could always craft another handcuff right after. </p><p>It was that sense of dominance that was making her obedient enough to accept the relatively demeaning position of licking my cock while I teased her wetness with my foot. Triggering the submissiveness of such an imposing beauty was not a simple task. </p><p>She still tightened her legs in an attempt to slow down the inevitable move of my foot, but she was shaking under the strain of an overwhelming build-up, not to mention distracted by the teasing random travel of the ice cubes and occasional twisting of her nipples. It was like her own impressive strength was starting to betray her, refusing to put their power behind her move. </p><p>What she didn’t know was her impending orgasm wasn’t the only reason for her feebleness. Even as I continued to enjoy the merits of her caramel body, I didn’t stop exploring her soul space. She was an interesting specimen, strong yet almost entirely unaffected with my companion process. </p><p>Perfect for a little experimenting. My current trick was creating a magical cage around her strength stat, limiting the connection between her soul space and the stat. To my surprise, it was relatively easy to cut the connection between her stat, which had immediate adverse effects on her strength. </p><p>Pity that such a trick was practically useless in combat. If I could slip that much mana to someone’s soul space, directly killing them was the much easier option. Of course, that didn’t mean it was useless in other conditions. I could imagine it being used in many different ways. </p><p>Thanks to her enhanced weakness, Oeyne was helpless to resist my combined assault, and soon, she was trembling as the orgasm hit her, robbing even more of her strength. </p><p>“Please,” she gasped as she tried to stand upright, only to lean against her forge. She was being extremely affected by the aftermath of her orgasm —which was because I had significantly reduced her endurance as well, and used biomancy to increase her sensitiveness for good measure. As I continued to rub against her wetness, it was nothing less than delicious torture.  </p><p>“Yes, Oeyne,” I said, amused by the begging edge in her tone, which didn’t fit her usual characteristics even slightly. “How can I help you?” I added mockingly as my hand landed on her breast, squeezing absentmindedly like she was nothing more than my tone. My shaft started throbbing in protest as it was deprived of the delicious hug of her breasts, but I ignored that. A little denial was nothing much compared to the torture she was going through. </p><p>“Please-” she begged, trying to ask for a reprieve, but I didn’t let her finish her sentence, by twisting her nipple without a warning, sending fresh waves of pain into her body, which triggered another wave of pleasure. </p><p>“Please, what?” I said as my fingers sank into her firm tits, her flesh reacting beautifully. The rhythmic movement of my foot making things even worse. </p><p>I caught her eyes, her brown eyes filled with pleasure, showing that despite her begging, she was enjoying the show immensely. I was considering how to progress when I heard a knock on the door, realizing that I had been wasting too much time in the process. </p><p>“Is it the meeting time already,” I asked, only for her to nod sadly, no less enthusiastic about the need to stop? “Do you want me to handle the meeting completely, or do you want to be present?” </p><p>“Can you handle it alone?” she whispered, only to get punished with a slap to her tits. </p><p>“You shouldn’t doubt your own apprentice,” I said, which was a mocking reminder of how our relationship started, which long turned meaningless thanks to a combination of my strength and her submissive tendencies, even before I had earned a place in the inner circle of the headmistress. </p><p>“However, you should still listen to the meeting,” I said, and before she could even react, I grabbed another ingot of silver, this time using that to create chains for her feet, elegant yet strong, before showing her to a large cabinet under the forge. Then, I had put a complicated —yet useless— enchantment on the chains to hide the nature of my manipulations as I quickly blocked the connection between several of her stats to prevent her from using magic and her strength. </p><p>Her eyes widened in shock as she realized her helplessness was not just a ploy, but before she could even speak, a ball-gag appeared in her mouth, preventing her from speaking. Simultaneously, I pushed a magical dildo in her wetness, buzzing incessantly.  </p><p>“You should make sure to keep your voice down, we don’t want to alert the envoy of the princess,” I said before I pushed the lid close and walked to the door to meet with the princess’ envoy, leaving her in the darkness, constantly teased, yet being forced to keep her voice down. </p><p>And most importantly, weak for the first time… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [98/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [71/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the morning, I carefully extracted myself from Anna’s arms as I went to repeat my morning exercise routine, knowing that she was far too exhausted to wake up anytime soon, an assumption that turned out to be correct, as even after I finished my exercise and returned to the RV, she was still sleeping. </p><p>It was a beautiful, inspiring sight, her voluptuous body wrapped around the white sheets, the soft lights of the morning sun spilling over her to add an interesting depth, while the pink marks of our passionate embrace still marking her skin, focused especially around her breasts, owing to my fascination with those perfect globes. </p><p>The temptation was hard to resist, so I pulled my sketchbook and started to draft a colored sketch, trying to catch the inspiration brought by the amazing scene in front of me. </p><p>However, as my pen danced on the surface of the paper, the resulting picture didn’t just contain the beautiful innocence in front of my eyes, but also the spirit of mischievousness she had displayed when she dared to sneak behind the curtain when she thought that I was sleeping, fulfilling her needs, as well as the contrast she had shown with her usual shyness, hiding her true self like a blanket. </p><p>It was why painting was superior to photography and videos. It was not just limited to capture the moment, but allowed the painter to reflect everything he could observe about the truth of his target. </p><p>And, Anna had a very interesting truth, one that I just started exploring… My pencil continued to dance on the paper as I captured more and more, amused by the realization that the little girl I had picked up to get some extra income gave me the inspiration I was searching for during my month-long journey through the wilderness. Still, it was a pity that I couldn’t just put a canvas and create a proper painting of her. </p><p>Waking up to a full-sized canvas recording her naked figure after first time would be too disconcerting, and I didn’t trust myself to stop halfway when she started stirring when I was painting. Sketching was a less mentally involved activity. </p><p>When she finally started stirring, I moved to the shower, a perfect middle ground between staying next to her and leaving the RV, signaling my presence, yet not imposing my presence to her while she processed the last night’s adventure. </p><p>It turned out to be the case as I heard her moving around the RV. Though it would be a lie if I said I didn’t hope for a sudden visit to make the shower livelier. Unfortunately, under the bright lights of the morning, her shy personality was the victorious side. </p><p>I quickly finished my shower and left the bathroom with only a towel in mind, my muscles still glistening with a thin layer of moisture. While I didn’t want to push her to anything, that didn’t exclude giving her a proper show to damage any resistance she might build up in her mind due to her doubts. After all, the uncaring, disappearing men after a one-night stand was a common cliche. </p><p>“Good morning,” I said as I stepped out, only to find her wrapped tightly with the blanket, hiding her body from the view. </p><p>“G-good morning,” she stammered as her eyes stuck to my chest. Normally, I would account that to her fascination with my muscles —not undeserved if I may say so without sounding a bit narcissistic— but this time, it was clearly an excuse for me to avoid my gaze. Just as I suspected, her shyness was triggered perfectly after a night of debauchery, slamming against her mentality in repeated waves while she struggled to acknowledge what had happened. </p><p>Of course, it was trivial to take a step forward while letting my towel slide down, free her body from the sheet that was wrapped around with another tug, and have a joyful repeat of the last night’s activities, but doing so would strain her mind even more. </p><p>I didn’t want to overwhelm her in such a manner. “The shower is yours,” I said to her instead. “I’m going for a quick swim, feel free to join me if you want,” I offered, giving her an option that was just subtle enough to allow her to chase a repeat —as her swimsuit was deliciously ruined after the last accident, meaning if she came to the lake wearing that, there would be no question about the direction she wanted to follow. </p><p>Of course, just because I wanted to give her space didn’t mean that I would let her deal without any intervention. I leaned forward to steal a lingering kiss from her cheek, a simple move that nonetheless turned suggestive. An inevitable result after last night’s activities, not to mention our current mode of dress.</p><p>With that, I took my swimsuit and left the RV, leaving her alone and blushing. </p><p>The chilly waters of the lake turned out to be a relief, because as much as I didn’t want to admit, the gentle kiss that turned her into a blushing mess didn’t leave me completely unaffected either. After last night, my body was begging for a repeat, and turning back to the allure of her body wasn’t as simple as I would have thought. The chilly embrace was exactly what I needed to keep my mind straight and preventing myself from pressuring Anna. </p><p>“A good decision,” I murmured when I noticed Anna walking toward the lake, wearing her bulky bathrobe to utterly hide her swimsuit. She clearly needed some time to process what had happened earlier. </p><p>“How’s the water?” she asked in a steady tone that sounded suspiciously practiced as she stood at the shore, her arms tight around her bathrobe. </p><p>“A bit chilly, but exactly what I needed to make an explosive start for the rest of the day,” I said, suppressing my desire to make a teasing comment about the previous evening. I was afraid that she would take such words much more seriously than I uttered. </p><p>Her next words seemed to confirm my opinion. “D-do you mind turning your back for a moment while I get in the water?” she asked, stammering and whispering even with her mental preparation. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I turned my back, while simultaneously removing some fun ideas from the plan I had been making for the next few days, unless she decided to save herself for the nighttime. </p><p>“You can turn back now,” she said after a beautiful splash reached my ears. I did so, ready to tease her a bit about her shyness now that she was safely underwater, only for my mouth to fall open helplessly. “Is something matter?” she asked, a giggle escaping her mouth even as she blushed furiously. </p><p>I wanted to answer immediately, but I found that the words in my mind decided to take a surprise holiday. </p><p>The waters of the lake were surprisingly clear, which wouldn’t have been too much of a problem even with her ripped red one piece, if it wasn’t for one very important detail. The distorted view of her body didn’t carry even the slightest hint of red, or any other color than her own beautiful skin, not even the slightest hint. </p><p>She was skinny-dipping!</p><p>“I hope it’s not a problem, the red one is quite tight, and I don’t have any other swimsuit, ” she muttered —trying to sound confident and playful, but unable to overcome a shy undertone— as she started swimming deeper into the lake gently, her beautiful ass rising out of the water, giving me a beautiful glimpse. </p><p>At that moment, I was suddenly empathized by the sailors of the old stories, tempted by a glimpse of their own imagination, jumping into the water to chase a mirage, innocent and tempting at the same time. An explosive combination. If their imagination was half as good as what I was seeing in reality, their deadly attempts were understandable… Because before even making a conscious thought, I found myself chasing Anna, slowly yet steadily. </p><p>“M-Michael,” she stammered as she noticed me swimming toward her with a determined pace, her blush intensified even further. “Is there something matter?” </p><p>“I thought it was a good time to play water chase,” I said confidently, her question jerking me out of my daze. I still swam toward her, of course, but this time, it was much slower, like a shark cutting the path of its prey. “After all, you’re nice enough to bring such a beautiful bait?” </p><p>“Bait?” she uttered as she swam away, trying to sound playful but coming across as shy and panicked. “I didn’t bring anything with me, what are you talking about?” </p><p>“Exactly, you didn’t bring a thing… Not a single thing, not even a string…” I said even as I positioned myself perfectly to cut her path toward the nearest shore. “And it leaves just one thing I can get if I catch you,” I said, unable to hide the hunger in my tone. “Unless you can’t handle the game, of course?” I asked, still giving her an exit. </p><p>She stopped swimming and turned toward me, which gave me an interesting view of her beautiful breasts, though a bit distorted thanks to the soft waves caressing her skin. A beautiful expression of concentration appeared on her face, understanding what I was still leaving the choice to her. “I-” she uttered before she took a deep breath, which did amazing things to her bosom, straining my capability to keep myself back. Luckily, I was strong enough to resist the temptation until she opened her mouth suddenly. “Catch me if you can!” she shouted with a playful laugh as she turned back, swimming as quick as she could manage. </p><p>“As you wish, my naughty mermaid,” I said as I followed her… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Mark had to admit, seeing Laura in lingerie had awakened a fire that surprised him with its intensity, the kind he hadn’t felt for years. However, that didn’t mean he would just melt into a puddle, of course. So, after a moment of shock where he had been examining her body and murmuring in fascination, his instincts reasserted itself, and he started walking toward her, his steps enthusiastic and predatory despite his slowness. </p><p>Still, despite the fires of arousal burning freely, he had maintained enough presence of mind to continue observing her attitude as he walked closer, searching for any signs of retreat. As she stood in front of him, half-naked, she was a paradoxical mixture of confidence and fear, like a beautiful crystal work of art… Beautiful, but one rough mistake enough to shatter her completely… </p><p>And that fragility only made her more desirable… </p><p>He took another step forward, once again letting his eyes enjoy her surprisingly delicious body, stockings and garter belt framing her legs perfectly, her lacy black underwear thin enough to give a glimpse of the skin that lay behind. More importantly, he enjoyed the way she shivered as he examined her. Step by step, he got closer, watching as her excited trembling intensify. </p><p>Most importantly, however, he didn’t see any last-minute regret on her beautiful face… Which was all he needed to take the next step. She wanted him to teach her about the pleasures of the flesh. Well, he would teach her. </p><p>So, just when he was about to stand in front of her, he took another step, passing her, making her turn toward him with a shocked expression. He deliberately ignored her as he sat on the couch, patted the place next to him. “Let’s have a talk,” he said smoothly, proud of just how smooth and even he was able to keep his tone. </p><p>“O-okay,” she stammered cutely, caught flat-footed by the sudden change of pace, and prepared to sit next to him, only to let out a shocked cry when his arm wrapped around her waist at the last moment and pulled her on his lap. Her eyes widened in shock. “W-what are you doing?” she stammered. </p><p>He couldn’t help but smirk as her confidence and frustration melted into a fresh wave of panic. However, before he answered, he tightened his grip around her waist, making her let out another delicious gasp. “Why, helping you sit down before we have a little talk,” he said as he brought his face closer to her, their lips barely an inch apart. “Why, is there a problem with that?” </p><p> Laura swallowed, tempting him to leave a little bite on its expanse. “No,” she managed to gasp out. “No problem at all.” </p><p>“Excellent,” Mark whispered as he leaned forward to brush his lips against her, but pulled back before it became a proper kiss, leaving her panting in excitement, her heart beating like crazy. However, while he would have liked to say he had pulled back in favor of her, that would be a lie. Not when he felt like he was struck by lightning as his lips touched hers, his heartbeat fast enough to match hers. “I just have something to say before we start. Don’t forget that no matter what happens, you’re in control, and you can ask me to stop, delay, or slow down if you feel uncomfortable at any moment, without any concern. It’s all about you, understood?” </p><p>Laura just nodded obediently, her excitement after their almost-kiss preventing her from speaking. </p><p>“Excellent,” he whispered throatily. “Then, would you like to take the lead, or would you prefer me to take the lead?” he asked. </p><p>“You…” she managed to whisper. Mark was tempted to tease her about her sudden silence, but the temptation to tease her was nothing but a pale shadow compared to the desire burning in his heart to slowly unwrap her gift-wrapped body and enjoy her touch. </p><p>“As you wish, princess,” he whispered instead before leaning forward and capturing her lips in a searing kiss, finally allowing his body to do something he had been desiring since her coat had pooled around her body, triggering something in him. </p><p>It was not a soft, gentle kiss, despite his initial intention. It started that way, but soon, his body rebelled, disobediently intensifying the kiss, his tongue invading her mouth… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>With his legs under her body, his muscular arms around her body, and his tongue in her mouth, Laura was lost… It wasn’t her first kiss. Even though none of them ended well, she had dated before, and she had kissed other people. </p><p>Or at least, she had thought so, until the moment she had felt Mark’s lips over hers. </p><p>A fire rose from her heart and quickly covered the rest of her body while her skin trembled like she had been struck repeatedly by lightning. If that was what being kissed was supposed to feel like, she was free to admit it was her first proper kiss as well… </p><p>She tried to wrap her tongue around Mark’s aggressive assault, only for her success to turn like snowflakes trying to survive against a roaring inferno. She just accepted his invasion passively, happy to be annexed. </p><p>Her hands, however, were a different story. They were almost hungry as they grabbed the hem of his shirt, pulling it off him. He obeyed the desire of her hands, and pulled back from the kiss for a moment as she freed his torso from the mercy of the fabric, before returning to the kiss with a vengeance, cutting off her breath. </p><p>As she enjoyed the renewed assault, her hands started exploring his torso, tracing every single muscle, sculpted through endless hours spent in the gym, shaped to perfection. Even before that fateful discussion, she had spent one than one night in her bedroom, enjoying a certain buzzing instrument while imagining how it would feel to caress those abs. At no point, however, she had thought that it could be anything other than a passing fancy. After all, she was just a little nerd with past trauma numerous enough to build a respectable-sized hill. </p><p>But despite that, she was in his apartment, sitting on his lap, dressed in lingerie that made her even more exposed than being naked, caressing the same muscles she had imagined endless times. </p><p>When he had finally pulled back after a certain amount of time —the most precise she could describe, as the moment felt both too quick and endless— she let out a desperate moan and leaned forward to continue, only to feel his finger on her lips, preventing her from restarting the kiss. </p><p>“Did I do something wrong!” she asked panickedly as her eyes widened, her mind immediately going to the worst place. Maybe he was dissatisfied by her incompetence. Maybe she didn’t taste good enough. Maybe he had changed her mind… </p><p>“No need to panic, princess,” he whispered. His tone was calm on the surface, but under that surface, she could feel something else bubbling. Something dark… </p><p>Something exciting… </p><p>Paradoxically, it wasn’t the calmness that prevented her from spiraling in panic, but the stirrings of a dark undercurrent, telling her that he wasn’t as calm about the kiss they shared as he would like to pretend. Heat pooled between her legs even before he leaned forward, this time pressing his lips against her neck. </p><p>At first, she had thought that he was just slowing things down. Being kissed in the neck was nice, she thought as his lips slowly trailed down, but it was nothing compared to the passionate kiss they had shared earlier. Still, she just accepted that, because it gave her a chance to fulfill another desire. She used the angle to her benefit, and started kissing his chest muscles, enjoying the same defined lines her fingers had been dancing over earlier with her lips. </p><p>As time progressed, she had realized one important mistake. She had underestimated the impact of his lingering kisses as he moved up and down over her neck, occasionally moving as low as her collarbone, sometimes climbing hard enough to leave a lingering touch on the line of her chin. Every single kiss was soft, fleeting, but soon, she realized that their impact was gathering together, turning her body into a furnace. </p><p>And that was before he had made a discovery, revealing a sensitive spot she had been unaware of. She moaned desperately as the pleasure started to invade her body in a way she had never thought possible. His fingers, gently dancing along her spine, focusing more and more on the small of her back, didn’t help her any in containing that unfamiliar feeling. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she gasped in shock as her back arched as her understanding about her own body had transformed completely. She had never thought such a thick pleasure was possible, especially not when her most sensitive spots were still hidden behind her underwear, untouched… </p><p>Then, much to her surprise, the domination of pleasure continued to get thicker and thicker, invading her whole being. A sudden brightness filled her field of vision as fireworks went off her brain. She closed her eyes firmly, but that didn’t help to curtail the brightness. Her body stiffened and loosened at the same time, invaded by a pleasure she had never felt before. Endless cries echoed against her ear, and it took a while for her to realize she was responsible for those cries. </p><p>Mark decided to silence her with another searing kiss, not that she was unhappy about it. She kissed him like she was drunk, trying her best to adapt to his rhythm. Lost in pleasure, she barely paid attention when his arms tightened around her waist and he stood up. She continued kissing him, lost in his touch, the only reaction of her was to wrap her legs around his waist, allowing him to carry her even easier, to an unknown location… </p><p>When she felt the comfortable texture of expensive linens, however, the realization hit her strong enough to cut through her haze. Although, the fact that he had finally pulled back from the kiss had played a role in them, giving her a chance to realize things were about to take a step she couldn’t turn back from.</p><p>Her clarity of thoughts didn’t survive for long, not when she had looked down to see his head between her legs, using his teeth to drag down her panties with torturous slowness, teaching her a new meaning of being in heat. She just enjoyed the moment. Then, after he pulled off her panties completely, he stood up, holding her panties between his fingers. “Are you ready for the next step, princess?” he whispered, his hungry grin arousing her more than everything else they had done until that moment. </p><p>“Yes,” she simply whispered… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Leaving the bathroom while Aria and Sapphire continued to enjoy the soft caresses of the bubbly water was one of the most difficult things I had ever done. Pity that the things that Sapphire had revealed were too important to ignore. </p><p>After all, the whole reason for her to take my rule down was to handle the situation. Actually, not even handle it, but handle it without alerting her political rivals, which was a kick to my pride. I had always known that the only thing that allowed the dark lands to exist independently was the political will of the empire, but even I hadn’t realized that the power differentiator was that significant, and I prided myself on having a clearer view than the other idiots who had grown into the idea of an eternal fight of light and darkness. </p><p>I had been already seriously considering whether to take the mantle of the dark lord seriously, and the latest set of information I had received strengthened the negative side significantly.  </p><p>Before I could make a final decision, however, I needed more information. Sapphire’s explanation —as useful as it was— was ultimately a censored version she had told to Aria. Considering the lack of trust between them, I couldn’t have trusted Sapphire’s words even if her focus hadn’t completely been on serial orgasms she had been experiencing through a little assistance from my end. </p><p>And what better source to get information than Councilwoman Fernhand, the leader of the opposition. </p><p>Since it was early in the morning, I decided to disguise myself as something different than an elderly noble. After all, while they were famous for walking around without a care, they were also famous for sleeping in. If I walked around dressed as a noble that early, it would be remembered. </p><p>And during an infiltration mission, being remembered was the worst… </p><p>So, instead, I had picked a different direction, and disguised myself as a bearded servant, vaguely similar to multiple servants, enough to be mistaken from a distance. Thanks to a few bottles of cosmetics I had swiped from Aria’s stash, the disguise turned out to be even better than I expected. </p><p>Of course, I was daring enough to disguise myself as a servant, because I had a much better impression of the palace’s layout and working principles, and worst came to worst, Aria could back me up by claiming me as her servant. </p><p>At this point, I wasn’t even too afraid of Sapphire realizing what was going on. It would be inconvenient, but just inconvenient. At this point, if she was willing to whore herself to an unknown information dealer to get the item, she would be willing to make a deal with a previous dark lord. </p><p>It was a good experience to walk around the palace corridors without alerting someone. Of course, the palace had hundreds of checks to make sure every single servant was vetted, but none of those checks assumed that someone in the palace would bother to disguise as a servant, leaving the quarters of the Crown Princess. </p><p>So, this time, I was relaxed enough to enjoy the opulent yet tasteful decorations of the marble corridors. Avoiding possible checks of my identity was almost trivial as I arrived at Councilwoman Fernhand’s Office. </p><p>A casual assessment of the situation would imply that Fernhand would never keep anything important in the Palace, somewhere that was ultimately controlled by the Queen no matter how strong her faction was, but considering she was being such a threat to Sapphire, I decided to give her more credit. From the trick she had pulled with Emma, she was clearly the type of person that would have misinformation in her office, trying to mislead the Queen. </p><p>And while targeting already-manipulated information sounded like a bad idea, it actually had merit. After all, Fernhand would be trying to trick Sapphire, who already had a lot of information about her status. Fernhand had to keep most of the information accurate to slip the dangerous poisonous information. </p><p>I was more than happy to eat that small poisonous bite if it meant I could finally get the rest of the accurate firsthand information about the political struggle between them. </p><p>“Nice,” I murmured as I looked at Fernhand’s office from a distance even as I enjoyed the smell of freshly-mown grass and sweetness of the flowers. I wasn’t locked in my cell anymore, but still, I had little time to enjoy nature, even the meticulously cared kind.  </p><p>Funnily enough, Fernhand’s office —which was a standalone small building rather than a direct part of the palace— wasn’t too far away from the hedge maze I had first seen her while she was trying to trick Emma into a deadly trap, which gave me the perfect concealed spot to cast my shadow spells. </p><p>The light faction might be stronger than I had assumed, but that didn’t change my absolute superiority in terms of sneaky spells. The level of protection in Fernhand’s office just confirmed my assumptions. It was well defended, but with some subtle yet glaring flaws. An amateur might have assumed that they were left there by an accident, but I could recognize a master’s intentional touch easily. </p><p>And bypass their little trick just as easier, I thought with a smirk. The number of soldiers they could deploy or the number of heroes they could order around was meaningless when I was in the center of their power, slowly worming myself with their secrets. </p><p>Breaking through the wards without alerting anyone was a straightforward but time-consuming task, so I was glad for the existence of the plant maze, allowing me to stay unnoticed as I unraveled layer after layer of magical protection, creating access for myself. </p><p>Ultimately, I was able to crack the protections without triggering anyone, before triggering my shadow state and closed into the building. </p><p>Then, I met with a nice surprise. The office was not empty. A familiar brunette who I had first met when she talking with Emma was already in the office, reading a thick pile of documents. Her alabaster skin and her youthful appearance did nothing to reduce the sense of authority she had been radiating as she sat behind the desk and discussed a number of issues with two men on the other side of the desk. Her femme fatale aura slipping slowly, affecting the other two men </p><p>Though, admittedly, framing it as a discussion was not correct. Despite the high ranks of the other two men, the flow was more like Fernhand delivering orders between reading documents. They were framed as suggestions to make sure she didn't hurt the pride of the other two nobles, both ranking higher than her, but they were orders nonetheless.</p><p>I listened to their discussion carefully. The topic of discussion was not sensitive —if it had been, they wouldn’t be talking that in the palace— but still, listening gave me a better understanding of the most recent political status of the Empire. Then, they started talking about more interesting topics. </p><p>“Is there any development from our … friends from afar, about the battle for the throne?” asked one of the men. </p><p>“Not yet, it’s an ongoing struggle,” Fernhand answered sharply. </p><p>“What a waste, after all the money, those dark bastards can’t even take the throne,” said the other man, despite the warning glare sent by Fernhand, clearly unhappy about discussing such a dangerous topic in an unsafe location. Smart, pity that while her authority was high, it was not high enough to forcefully break the arrogance of her fellow conspirators. </p><p>“It’s an ongoing struggle,” Fernhand said, trying to dismiss the topic, but the second man didn’t seem to get the idea. </p><p>“We need to make sure our guy takes the seat. There’s a reason that bitch sent a team to kill the previous one. There must be something precious about the dark lands that made her move, otherwise, that whore wouldn’t have bothered.” </p><p>Interesting, I noted. Fernhand was clearly aware of my imprisonment after subverting Emma to her side —though I trusted Emma’s arrogance and her desire to be the best to keep my changed status of freedom hidden from them— but it seemed that her allies were not aware of it. And since Fernhand knew that I was being interrogated, she also knew that whatever the queen was searching, it couldn’t be attained through the new dark lord taking the throne. </p><p>Apparently, the opposition against Sapphire wasn’t as united as well. </p><p>“We have already spent a mountain of magical resources to give that idiotic necromancer an army of dead consisting of something other than mindless necromancers. What else does he need,” said the other one in annoyance as he stood up. “Maybe we should try seeking some alternative approaches.” </p><p>“And start from scratch,” countered the other man, angry as he looked at his opponent. “And whose family is going to be funding all the money required? You can barely afford to pay the taxes after your idiotic son destroyed yet another barony in his incompetence.” </p><p>“How dare-” the other one tried to exclaim, but before he could pick up speed, Fernhand cut in. “Gentlemen, we’re on the cusp of victory. It’s not time to squabble,” she said, and interestingly, even as she said so, I could feel a calm, almost impossible to detect mental probe entering the minds of her opponents, calming them slightly, proving that she was a true master of mind arts. Reading someone else’s memories was a difficult thing, but slightly adjusting their emotions could be achieved without too much of a risk. </p><p>Still, the ease she had attempted to do that, and the speed of her success suggested that it was a regular occurrence. No wonder those arrogant nobles were listening to her like obedient children, she had been emotionally conditioning them for a long time. </p><p>How interesting, I thought with a smirk. The legendary empire of light, split between two factions, one led by a sexy dancer who was an expert of the tantric magic, powering herself through their emotions, the other a dangerous mind expert slowly conditioning her followers like circus animals. </p><p>What an ignoble situation to such a glorious Empire, I thought mockingly. Maybe someone selfless and good should fix the issue. Someone pure and heroic…</p><p>Like me… </p><p>I smirked at the mocking thoughts, enjoying the irony of being the only one aware of the true nature of the political battle of the empire, even as I considered the next steps, whether to continue to observe her sneakily, or do something even more interesting… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I arrived at Oeyne’s room, I wasn’t surprised to find her wearing her most formal clothing, walking around her forge panickedly. I would be panicked too if I was a blacksmith in a politically divisive situation, and a royal person came to my visit with a regiment that could be rightfully classified as a small, yet very competent, army. </p><p>It made failure a distinctly more dangerous situation, especially for someone like Oeyne with an already shaky political position. She was already enemies with the guilds, and while the school was willing to retain her services despite that, Oeyne was smart enough to realize that even her services weren’t good enough to resist the combined pressure of the guilds, and a princess that conveniently brought along an army while the school was being sieged from multiple locations. </p><p>So, when she realized I had once again sneaked into her workshop without even bothering to knock, her first response wasn’t anger or annoyance, but pure relief. “Caesar,” she yelled as she dashed forward frantically. “I don’t know what to do, they are here with an army and if I can’t repair-” she started, only to be cut off by a kiss. </p><p>“Calm down,” I murmured, keeping the kiss short, yet heated enough to steal her breath and distract her from her growing panic. “Flailing will not help you dealing with a royal or whomever they assigned to handle the communication with you.” </p><p>“But whatever they are bringing is surely a difficult weapon to repair. What if I can’t do it, even with your help? I can barely able to get a basement to myself using all the favors and connections during my career as an adventurer. There’s no way they will weigh heavier than the order of a princess with her own army waiting at the back. They’ll kick me out, then the guilds will be free to take their revenge-” she said, spiraling in panic. I could have slapped her, which was a recommended response to hysteria, but why would I do that, when I could use that as an excuse to steal another kiss. </p><p>“There’s no point of discussing that before we even see the weapon they want us to repair,” I said even as I caressed her cheek gently. “And I’m sure, between two of us, there’s no weapon we can’t repair.” </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“You’re right,” Oeyne murmured as she snuggled against my chest, enjoying the safety of my arms, while I enjoyed the sight of my improving skill. It had been getting annoying that my skills hadn’t improved in the presence of the headmistress no matter how challenging the situation —though, after her explanation about the nature of the System, it turned out to be obvious that she was intentionally preventing the connection between the target and the System, probably a side-effect of her attempts to protect the Divine Sparks in her possession from being absorbed by the system. </p><p>However, that was a thought for another time. I focused on the sexy blacksmith in front of me, using me as a source of comfort. “We need to focus on what we can affect. Such as, how are you going to present yourself to them,” I said. </p><p>She pulled back with a frown and gestured her body. “What do you mean. I’m dressed in my best clothes, prepared the best refreshments I could afford, and cleaned my workshop to perfection, with my best works on display,” she said, pointing at a wall that was previously empty, but now holding a range of impressively delicate magical weapons. </p><p>“It’s your best, and that’s the problem,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, confused. “It’s going to be a royal visit, of course, I’m going to do my best.” </p><p>“Under more usual circumstances, that would have been true. You would only gain from displaying such an honest reaction. But things are different now. The crown princess already lost a lot of power, which meant that she would have no problem pushing your willingness to give to the limit, then more, uncaring of her own long-term reputation.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” Oeyne countered. “I have seen her retinue with my own eyes. Maybe her situation is much better than we expect, bringing such a large army with her.” </p><p>Oeyne’s deduction wasn’t bad, considering she was working from a faulty set of assumptions. She was a skilled adventurer, but she didn’t have my unique advantages and a ridiculous Perception stat to accurately assess the strength of her team. For Oeyne, it was just a large regiment of bodyguards, showing off her strength, not every single elite under her control. </p><p>“No, it’s literally everything she has left,” I said as I gave a general explanation of the status of her party without going too much into detail, careful to frame it as something I had learned from someone else. I liked Oeyne, but we weren’t at the point of sharing my secrets, yet. </p><p>“That changes things,” Oeyne murmured, her fear intensifying further. It was one thing to support a royal in a disadvantageous position, but it was completely different to support one that had lost any chance of making a comeback. “Should I reject her?” </p><p>“No,” I answered immediately. “She might have lost her power in terms of the wider empire, but that means very little considering the difficulties of different cities working together. For all intents of purposes, except the small area surrounding the Empire, we’re a loose connection of the city-states, and the princess has collected her power base here. As long as she can maintain a good relationship with the headmistress, she would be in a very important position in Silver Spires. You can’t anger her.” </p><p>“I don’t understand,” she murmured. “If she’s still important, I should still respect her, right.” </p><p>“In a way, but in a much lesser degree. We’re going to sell her the idea that you’re working closely with the headmistress’s agents, meaning she couldn’t just force you to work for her carelessly, or threaten you without risking the headmistress.” </p><p>“But I can’t lie about that!” she said angrily. </p><p>“Who said it would be a lie?” I countered, and upon her shocked state, I brought my magical pressure to the fore, much stronger than she had ever assumed I was capable. After our last meeting, I was free to flaunt my identity as an agent of the headmistress, and there was no point in wasting such an easy political asset. </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p> “You,” she gasped. </p><p>“Me,” I answered with a smug smile, enjoying her shock. “I’m an agent of the headmistress, one of the ones she keeps in the shadow,” I said before pausing. “Well, kept until the latest crisis forced me to take a more direct role, forcing me to reveal my identity,” I said, subtly lying about the extent of my tenure. After all, it wasn’t like she was going to have a discussion with the headmistress about the length of my service. </p><p>Also, it was far more believable than the truth, that I was working in the school for years, but gained phenomenal power during last month. </p><p>The last reveal likely would have been enough for Oeyne in her desperation even before our previous relationship. She just nodded with a growing smile, more than happy that her mysterious assistant came with such an important background. “What should we do?” she asked. </p><p>“There’s still sometime before the meeting, right?” I asked, and she nodded. “Good. First, let’s get you out of that dress and put in on something more functional,” I whispered even as I put my hand on her shoulder. </p><p>I was surprised when she pushed me away, but that surprise proved to be short-lived when, instead of taking a step back, she grabbed her shirt in a great hurry, aggressive enough to send more than one button flying. </p><p>The arousal quickly clouded her beautiful brown eyes as she took a step forward, her fancy corset struggling under the weight of her huge breasts. Apparently, saving her at the last minute, combined with the simultaneous reveal of magical and political power, triggered her arousal in a way I hadn’t seen on her before —at least, not without an extended foreplay session. </p><p>I was more than happy to let her take the lead as she ripped my shirt with even more aggression, destroying it so thoroughly that even with magic, repairing it would have been challenging. She threw it negligently as she smashed her lips against mine, her hands caressing my naked chest, tracing the contours of my muscles even as she pushed me toward her forge. </p><p>I let her do so. Fucking her in her forge, the center of her identity, was more appealing than another escapade in her bed. It felt symbolic. </p><p>She had proved that while her strength was her primary stat, her agility was nothing to dismiss when she somehow managed to slip out of all of her clothes excluding her corset, presenting her body in a very sexy yet accessible manner. </p><p>I was more than happy to follow her lead and kicked my pants and underwear, leaving myself naked. I didn’t bother to remove her corset, just squeezed her amazing breasts over it, the soft texture of her corset making it even more delicious as their amazing proportions filled my palms in excess.</p><p>A moan escaped her mouth, pushing through my lips’ ability to silence her, loud enough to fill the forge completely. I was glad to see that a few days without some close attention left her panting with desire. </p><p>Too much desire, even, I realized when I felt her biting my shoulder enthusiastically. Not enough to actually draw blood, just hurt, but considering my HP and constitution, even that was excessive. </p><p>“So, you want to play rough,” I whispered, which earned an enthusiastic moan. “As you wish, you dirty whore,” I whispered said as I grabbed her hair before pulling hard, enough to remind her that while she was strong, she was not my match when it came to physical domination. </p><p>“Take a deep breath,” I suggested in amusement even as I painfully pulled her hair, making her reveal her neck before I marked her with a bite mark, using a biomancy trick to make sure the hickey wouldn’t disappear easily through her natural regeneration. </p><p>Simultaneously, I pushed her until her chest was pressing against the table she used to do finishing work, covered with soot even after her attempts to clean it, immediately ruining her fancy corset. Paradoxically, its dirtiness made her even sexier. </p><p>I didn’t even bother asking her whether she was ready, as her wetness, thick enough to drip down her leg as she bent over gave me an answer much more accurately than her words. She moaned as I pulled her hair harder. I could have pushed inside her to enjoy that wetness, but I decided to take things slowly instead. </p><p>I walked to the other side of the table, aligning my shaft with her meaty lips. “Open wide,” I ordered, and she followed that easily, making it trivial for my girth to disappear into her mouth, forcing my presence into her throat. </p><p>She started gasping and gagging, but it only enhanced the enthusiasm shining in her eyes. I pushed my full presence into her throat repeated with no hint of mercy, knowing that she was more than tough enough to handle that. And she didn’t disappoint me by actually grabbing my hips to pull me even deeper into her throat… </p><p>There were certain perks of revealing the true extent of my power, it seemed, I thought even as I filled her throat with my seed, ready to do much more before the meeting with the princess’ envoys… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370 Mana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [98/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [71/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After the informative discussion with the headmistress, I was feeling overwhelmed. A system developed to counter the gods who had been locked out of the dimension for hundreds of years, The Eternals who had somehow lost control of the system they had developed, the possible source for my power as a goddess low-rank enough to easily dismissed by an angel who was clearly weaker than most gods, upcoming ritual to inject me with the light energy… </p><p>So, when, rather than doing the reasonable thing and visit Oeyne to strategize about the upcoming meeting with the crown princess before starting to work on her mysterious weapon, I started walking around aimlessly, I felt justified. I needed to calm down. </p><p>I sneaked out of the school once more, and started walking around the forests aimlessly, occasionally hunting the beasts too weak to detect the threat I had been posing to them. After talking about the source of the system and everyone’s power, I couldn’t help but examine the concept of level-up from a fresh perspective. </p><p>It was hard to imagine how the society would look without high-leveled individuals, restricted by the mortal limits of their deficiencies, limited. Likely not as limited as my own past status, of course, but still, extremely limited. Of course, while we haven’t discussed that explicitly, it was not hard to guess that uncontrolled monster hordes didn’t exist before the system —or more likely, after the gods’ supposed the last stand that broke the control of the system. </p><p>However, it would be a lie to say that I didn’t understand the motivation of the Eternals. After all, I had already lived through the torture of being an insignificant bug, living under the mercy of the people stronger than me. Living under the yoke of the gods with no chance to resist their power couldn’t have been any easier. </p><p>“It’s all so complicated,” I murmured as I pulled my hair hard in frustration. All I wanted was to live comfortably with my girls without being threatened by the presence of the mysterious organizations, undead hordes, and other mysterious creatures… Was that too much to ask?</p><p>Since I had been already out, I created another elemental, and quickly searched for the girls. Finding Aviada was the easiest, as she was close to the school, still patrolling with her team. I quickly moved through their patrol route to make sure there was no undead ambush or other dangerous events, before replicated the same thing for Titania and Marianne. </p><p>Their state was a bit different. They were defending against one of the fake monster hordes, easily cutting through the mass, the corpses around the town indicating that the current horde was far from the first one. Even when she was acting like she was tired, Titania was far too strong to even Luckily, they were following my suggestion —delivered through the headmistress— and avoided the temptation to loot the fake gems, preventing the potential disaster. Yes, defending against the weakened monster hordes was easy, but only when the walls were intact, and high-leveled defenders were healthy enough to contribute to defense. </p><p>The quick trip to the town Cornelia and Helga were garrisoning didn’t reveal anything different —except the number of monster corpses under the town border, indicating that their priority didn’t match the importance of Titania’s defensive location. </p><p>Not a surprising find after the attempt to capture Titania by the mysterious organization —The Eternals, if the headmistress had been truthful in her explanation— which was supporting the necromancer invasion. I wouldn’t be surprised if they made another attempt in a few days. </p><p>Or at least, I hoped that killing three members over level thirty would at least delay them would slow them a bit. To be fair, it was most likely the case. There was no reason for an organization that could treat such high-leveled characters as disposable cannon folder not to be already ruling the world. Even if that wasn’t their ambition, they wouldn’t have been bothering to ally with the necromancers to distract the headmistress, or bother working together with the other princes to weaken the Crown Princess. </p><p>Of course, there was a chance that I was misreading their level of strength, and they were actually treating people stronger than me as cannon fodder, and in that case, I was utterly and truly fucked. </p><p>Still, that was a thought for another day, I thought even as I returned to the school, just to see the royal procession passing through the gates. I stayed on the walls, watching them as the members of her party slowly stepped out of their carts. </p><p>Then, the bodyguards gathered around the fanciest carriage before the door opened, and a woman stepped out, one that shared almost exact body size with the thief —almost, because her puffy skirt and shirt were making it hard to make a conclusive decision from that distance. </p><p>“I might have just found my thief…” I started with excitement, only for another, almost identical, woman to step out. Their faces were somewhat different, so were their eye color and other identifying details, but their body size and type were almost the same. Even their hair color-matched, a shining blonde, with a smoothness that suggested several maids had been working on the style for hours. </p><p>“Okay, it might not be that easy to identify her,” I murmured to myself as a third one stepped out… Then a fourth… </p><p>Only them the princess stepped out, distinguishing herself with the crown on her head —which was radiating magic thick enough for me to detect from the walls— and her even fancier dress. However, other than that, her bodily sizes were almost similar to her handmaidens. Their hair was color-matched, though the style was wildly different, their hair wasn't too different in size, making any possible disguise even stronger. </p><p>Smart, I thought even as I watched five of them —four handmaidens plus the princess— walk toward the guest house, each of them walking with impressive grace. It was clear that not a single one of them was below level ten, but the thief I had watched was clearly over level twenty, and maybe even closing in level thirty, with a decent physical stat spread to support her power. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was hard to get a more accurate assessment of their strength just by watching from a distance. “Smart,” I said with a nod. With five of them almost identical, it would be almost impossible to identify the thief from the body type and presence even when one tracked her identity to the group. </p><p>Even better, they couldn’t just go and test the princess and her handmaidens easily, as without a doubt those five girls belonged to various noble families, which might take that as a political attack and retaliate. </p><p>It was genius whether it was the princess that arranged that, or it was a natural consequence of having handmaidens of similar builds to be used as decoys in case of assassination attempts. </p><p>Still, that answered one question. The princess was almost certainly aware of the movements of the thief —if she wasn’t the thief in the first place. However, that didn’t mean I could just pressure the princess to reveal the identity of the thief, because there was a likely chance that the thief wasn’t a part of her official retinue but someone from a different organization, assigned to defend the princess in exchange of accessing politically sensitive locations. </p><p>Such as, Silver Spires. </p><p>As the princess and the handmaidens disappeared into the guest residence —a large, bulky building with its own defensive wards, only given to politically important guests. However, its own independent warding system wasn’t the biggest defense the building had, as since a member of the royal family was occupying the building, for the duration of the visit, that building was effectively an embassy. The princess could simply execute any unexpected visitor, no question asked, which made the risk of getting caught pretty high. </p><p>I certainly didn’t want to infiltrate the building unless I was forced. It was different than trying to sneak around Silver Spires. Silver Spires’ high population, thanks to the mixture of a high number of servants, rotating students, and visitors from the distant kingdoms made walking around in disguise a low-risk affair. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same thing wasn’t applicable to the party of the princess, not when the number of the servants were a fraction of the number of the guards, and said guards were all extremely alert —which was understandable if even half of the information Oeyne had given me about their continuous defeats. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t afraid of death in case of capture. I trusted my abilities to perform a better escape than their little thief. Not only my agility could match hers, but also I had a range of magical abilities she could only imagine. Still, the news about an assassin —which they would naturally assume— walking around targeting the princess would make an already complicated situation even worse. </p><p>No, I needed an opportunity to delve into their secrets. </p><p>With that concluded —for better or worse— I turned my attention to the guards around the cargo carts, helping the servants to carry some of the heavier loads. I had to admit, they had an impressive number of guards, almost a hundred, and every single one of them was elites in soldier terms. Just like the handmaidens, even the lowest-leveled one was over level ten, though clearly on the lower end, as, unlike the girls, I could identify their levels easily. There were several guards that managed to hide their strength from me, however, making the situation slightly more challenging. And to make things even more impressive, every single one of them was carrying magical weapons along with their regular ones. </p><p>I would have been impressed with the number of the guards if I hadn’t noticed one important detail. The amount of cargo they brought along was extremely excessive for a trip, even a long-term one. Thanks to a combination of my crafting and my magical abilities, I could make a general appraisal of their cargo, and the content of the crates made it even more impressive.

    "title": "Fun with Nerdy Girls 13",
    "content": "<p>I didn’t bother hiding my erection as I sat down. After all, there was no way I wouldn’t get one as my two nerdy friends who had been exploring the limits of their sexiness sat across me, displaying their bodies the best way possible as we started to play. </p><p>There was no doubt about Carrie’s sexiness. Her dress, with the absence of her bra, was sexy enough before she started leaning forward to pull the blocks, pushing the buttons of her dress and enhancing the cleavage even further. And while Sarah lacked Carrie’s spectacular curves that forced the limits of reality, she did make sure to lean excessively whenever it was her turn, showing off her hips the best way possible. </p><p>Even better, their gaze clashed with a unique aura whenever their eyes met, part competitiveness, part incrimination, and part guilt. Their gaze told me that while they were aware of the ridiculousness of their competitiveness, that awareness had precious little impact on their competitiveness. </p><p>And I had no problems enjoying the fruits of their growing competitiveness, leaning forward to pull blocks with a growing sexiness, Carrie’s careful clumsiness contrasting greatly with Sarah’s smooth pulls. I was certain that Carrie would be the first one to fail, which posed an interesting problem for her considering she was wearing precious little, only a dress and panties, even a bra absent. As the tower started to get wobbly, I was putting mental bets on whether Carrie would be brave enough to actually remove her dress to display her beautiful mounds, or slide under the blanket to retreat from the game… </p><p>Then, the tower of blocks toppled just as Sarah pulled, surprising both me and Carrie. “Ops,” Sarah said with a flat tone and a smirk, signaling that her defeat might not be as accidental as I presumed. </p><p>“Unlucky. It’s time for the forfeit,” I said with a matching smile.</p><p>“Is there no mercy for the first time?” Sarah asked flirtatiously, but considering she had already grabbed the edges of her tops and started to pull with a slow, sensual manner, it wasn’t hard to guess that she wouldn’t welcome any actual attempts to give her a pass. </p><p>Meanwhile, Carrie’s expression transformed into a scandalized frown, realizing that Sarah had cheated in a way she hadn’t been expecting, intentionally losing. However, as much as it might be fun to tease Carrie about that, the sight of Sarah shedding her tight black top to reveal her lacy black bra underneath, nicely wrapping her breasts while still giving a hint of allure, deserved my complete attention. </p><p>Sarah met my gaze, Her confident smile trembled as a sliver of rationality reappeared in her eyes as if to remind her that she was pushing their friendly competition to a weird point, but ultimately, it failed to find traction in her mind. Despite the trembling of her fingers, she threw her top to the side before leaning down and grabbing the blocks. Thanks to the absence of her top, the resulting cleavage was much more appealing. “So, the next round?” she asked with a smirk. </p><p>“Sure,” I said, not bothering to hide my gaze dancing on her body despite Carrie’s obvious displeasure. From her expression, it was clear that she was measuring the relative benefits of accidentally losing to balance the books. I smirked, aware that her lack of a bra was holding her back from replicating Sarah’s trick. It was ironic that she was being held back from showing off due to her desire to show off in the first place. </p><p>This time, Sarah acted before Carrie could even make a decision, and just when she was pulling a block for the second time, she toppled down the wooden tower once more. “Again, how clumsy of me,” she murmured even as her smirk widened once more. </p><p>“Yes, you’re very clumsy tonight,” Carrie said with an obvious distaste as she watched Sarah stand up. “Such a whore,” she added, but this time, she tried to keep her whisper inaudible. Focused in her own amateurish —though very satisfying— attempt to deliver a short but sweet strip show, Sarah missed the last part. </p><p>I didn’t, but I didn’t intervene, just watching as Sarah pushed her shorts down as she swayed to the rhythm of the song that was playing on TV. She turned her back and leaned forward, accentuating her already perfect ass to another level of existence while she slowly shimmied her shorts, giving me a perfect view of her lacy panties, matching her bra perfectly. </p><p>“Let’s play,” she gloated as she threw her shorts to Carrie, who threw them at the other side of the room, unable to hide her anger. “Hey, I’m the one who’s losing. Why are you frustrated?” Sarah asked mockingly. </p><p>“Just play,” Carrie said as she started setting up the tower, her fingers trembling with anger. Unfortunately, just like many proverbs warned, anger was a dangerous emotion. Despite her intention to play carefully —due to her limited excess clothing— she managed to topple the tower in her second attempt. </p><p>“Pity,” Sarah murmured as she looked at Carrie, but her tone didn’t carry the slightest hint of mercy. “So, what are you going to do, sweetheart, hide under the blanket like a little girl, or get rid of that dress.” </p><p>I watched from the corner as they gazed at each other, one angry, the other smug, more than happy to enjoy the fruits of their rather pointless rivalry. “Neither,” Carrie answered. </p><p>“Why, are you chickening?” Sarah said, her smug tone stained with disregard. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” Carrie countered as she stood up, and her hands disappeared under her skirt, pushing her panties down. It wasn’t as slow and erotic as it could have been, but the sudden annoyance of Sarah more than compensated for the lack of fanfare. </p><p>Also, watching Carrie struggling to sit down without flashing everyone was delicious, especially when she pulled down her skirt to hide her ass, only to inadvertently turn her cleavage from teasing into downright erotic. </p><p>Sarah didn’t appreciate my lingering enjoyment. “The next turn,” she murmured, seeming ready to take down Carrie. Unfortunately, Carrie wasn’t the only one that had been suffering from the adverse effects of emotional instability, especially when Carrie suddenly decided to be aggressive in a different way, and just as Sarah pulled her block and prepared to place it on the top. </p><p>Carrie’s legs parted open, giving me a momentary glimpse of her beautiful core. It was a fleeting glance, certainly nowhere near enough the amazing show I had received in our private entertaining evenings, but Sarah didn’t know that. From her perspective, Carrie had just flashed me for the first time. Her mouth parted open as her fingers trembled, which ended up bringing down the tower. </p><p>“Pity. So, what are you going to do, sweetheart, hide under the blanket like a little girl, or get rid of that bra,” Carrie murmured in satisfaction, shamelessly ripping Sarah’s earlier words while Sarah looked at the toppled down the tower in shock, realizing the cost of her earlier arrogance. With her disposable clothing sacrificed to make a point, confident in her ability to play the game, Sarah found herself without a safety net. </p><p>I looked at Sarah along with Carrie, while she was looking everywhere but us, before burying her face into her hands. “I’m out,” she murmured. </p><p>“Under the blanket, then,” I said, pointing at the blanket which was resting on the most comfortable couch of the house. “And don’t forget to pass the piece you want after you decide which piece to sacrifice.” </p><p>Neither girl said anything for a while, one ashamed of losing after her arrogant words, the other absolutely satisfied with the sudden victory she had managed to pull. And, I had to admit, she deserved her smugness, winning in a game which her opponent arranged. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to tease Carrie, watching Sarah as she disappeared under the large blanket, shimmying uncomfortably as she undressed without the sense of victory she had been radiating earlier had the priority. Then, Sarah proved that Carrie wasn’t the only one that could surprise us when she threw her underwear out. </p><p>It was her panties. </p><p>“Daring,” I murmured as Sarah let the blanket fell, revealing her bra-clad chest. Carrie frowned, thinking that her perfect victory was marred through Sarah’s last-minute adjustment. </p><p>Luckily for her, I was fond of her, and more than willing to distract her. “Shall we play?” I said, not bothering to hide my playful smirk. After everything the girls had done, I couldn’t be bothered to hide my cheating, and toppled the tower at the first attempt. </p><p>“Damn, I have the worst of luck, getting undressed in front of two sexy girls, how could I handle that,” I said even as I grabbed the bottom of my shirt, and slowly slipped it up while dancing to the music. I wasn’t really a good dancer, but as my shirt slowly traveled upward, revealing my abs two by two, neither girl seemed to be particularly upset about my limited dancing ability. </p><p>I repeated the same trick the next round, this time getting rid of my shorts to reveal my boxers, which revealed my big pole. I was unashamed of my erection, as I doubted there was any straight hotblooded male that could avoid having an erection when facing a sexy buxom blonde without any underwear —and a loose dress to make that fact obvious— while a feisty brunette with no panties hiding under the blanket… </p><p>Not when a threesome was a distinct possibility, and the consolation prize was enjoying Carrie’s delicious tits around my cock once again. </p><p>“So, the last round,” I murmured as I set up the tower once more, sending a playful glare at Carrie, who was far too occupied by the pole in my boxers. “This one is for the victory.” </p><p>“L-let’s play,” Carrie said, her earlier confidence quick to melt at the sight of my erection. Sarah said nothing, but her gaze was no less affected, devouring the sight. I wasn’t surprised when Carrie toppled the tower in her fourth attempt, which earned a laugh from Sarah. </p><p>“Someone is going to join me under the blanket, it seems,” Sarah said. </p><p>“But the game is over,” Carrie said. </p><p>“You still lost,” Sarah gloated, with no intention of letting Carrie go after her own memorable defeat. “Come under the blanket, and lose that dress.” </p><p>Carrie looked indecisive until I sent her a playful wink, renewing her courage. Things had been clearly developing outside her initial idea for the evening, but Carrie was too lost in the sense of competition to limit that. </p><p>I wasn’t a moron, so I neglected to advise her about that. </p><p>Luckily, the blanket was large enough that Carrie could perch on the other side of the blanket, and still cover her body decently. Removing the dress took a bit more effort than Sarah’s easily slip, and gave us a couple of accidental glimpses of her skin, but ultimately, she sat on the other side of the couch, with only a blanket to hide her curvy body. </p><p>“So, Ms. Winner, would you mind passing back our clothes,” Sarah said. </p><p>“I do actually,” I said after throwing a glance at the TV, only to realize the music videos were finally having the change I had been hoping for. Instead of playful teenagers or aggressive guitarists, the screen was getting filled with half-naked ladies and gentlemen, rubbing against each other far too closely to classify it as dancing. </p><p>I slipped under the blanket, and a second later, threw my boxers on the other side of the room as well. “As a gentleman, I shouldn’t leave the ladies alone. It’s only fair, right?” I said with a charming smile. Girls were too overwhelmed with the fact that they were under the same blanket with a naked man to answer. </p><p>And just like that, three naked people under a blanket —almost naked in Sarah’s case, but definitely good enough— while softcore porn disguised as music video was playing on the screen… </p><p>A fun turn was ahead of us… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Hi, everyone. I have a little surprise for you all. I have just published a brand new story on Smashwords, a LitRPG system novel, this time on a superhero driven sci-fi/fantasy world. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1095584\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1095584</strong></a></p><p>The reason I'm publishing this book in Smashwords instead of Patreon is the possible content guidelines. Smashwords has looser guidelines for certain topics, allowing some of the themes I'm actively avoiding in my other stories to be handled more freely. </p><p>Some of you may have (justifiable) concerns that it might affect my other publishing state. Let me guarantee that, it'll not affect my Patreon schedule in any way, so no worries about that. Actually, assuming a reasonable sales number, it might push me closer to my dream of becoming a full-time writer. </p><p>So, fingers crossed.</p><p>And if you're curious about the general tone but don't want to pay immediately, you can read the first half for free, or wait for promotions. (I'll eventually reduce the price for the first book, when I have finally published a few more on series, of course. Unfortunately, that might take something between a few weeks and a few months, depending on my other commitments).</p><p><em>Also, just to give an idea about its length, it's approximately as long as 4-5 of my Patreon releases.</em></p><p>Feel free to message me about anything, be it negative or positive. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had assessed several possible options quickly before coming to a final decision. I needed to understand why the Queen was so determined to get the Eternal Core. An independent magic source, no matter how strong, shouldn’t be enough to trigger such actions. </p><p>Luckily, Sapphire was far too distracted thanks to the effects of the mana-infused water, her eyes firmly shut, allowing me to push my head out of water freely to whisper into Aria’s ear. “Ask her about why she’s so determined to acquire the Eternal Core.” </p><p>Aria trembled as I whispered, but as she was trying to deal with the after-effects of her most recent orgasm, I was sure that it was about the way my warm breath caressed her sensitive earlobe rather than understanding the significance of the question. Aria had much more immediate concerns to pay attention to than the strategic implications of the information battle between me and the Queen. </p><p>And even if she were able to gather enough focus, it was not a guarantee that she would care. After all, the earlier discussion in her bed indicated that she was on the way to changing factions. Still, I was happy for her not to realize the full implications, to delay any possible crisis of consciousness. </p><p>“I understand how to use my allure to get information from him, but why are we putting so much effort to get this artifact,” Aria murmured, failing to hide the erotic cadence in her tone as my fingers caressed her tits underwater, my head underwater once more just in case Sapphire decided to open her eyes to answer Aria. Still, that didn’t prevent me from assaulting Aria’s sensitive breasts the most erotic way I could manage, making her voice tremble. </p><p>Keeping my head underwater turned out to be unnecessary. “It’s a need-to-know secret,” Sapphire murmured, dismissing her question immediately to focus on her own pleasure, the movement of her shoulders especially suspicious. Pity Aria was between us, preventing me from peeking at her underwater easily. Still, that only made me go faster. </p><p>“Push her further, you’re the Crown Princess,” I advised Aria. “You need to know.” </p><p>“I-isn’t it better if I know as well?” Aria managed to stammer, her earlier confidence quick to melt at the first sign of disapproval. If it wasn’t for my encouraging caresses, teasing her sensitive breasts, while my shaft repeatedly invaded her insides, she could have never dared to challenge the Queen. I whispered a few clues to her. “Maybe I could get the information before Emma if I could somehow use that to my benefit.” </p><p>However, my tricks weren’t limited to forcing Aria to ask questions repeatedly. No, meanwhile, I was enhancing my control on the mana I had infused in the water earlier, using it as a tool to slowly add some waves to the water around Sapphire’s sensitive spots, particularly around her inner thighs and her breasts, but also focusing on several other sensitive spots I had discovered thanks to the adventures of the night before. Combined with the arousing effect of her own tantric spells, she was pushing quickly toward the climax. </p><p>Meaning, she was willing to take some ridiculous decisions to silence Aria, especially since there was no reason to suspect Aria’s shifting alliances, or the presence of another person hiding behind Aria’s voluptuous body. </p><p>“For the light, you’re stubborn today,” Sapphire murmured, her eyes still closed, biting her lips as she enjoyed the warmth of the water while her fingers moved, unaware of the subtle magical assistance I was providing to enhance her pleasure further. “It’s about the border skirmishes at the northern border,” Sapphire admitted. </p><p>That surprised me, because the northern border was the calmest border of the Empire. Not only was the monstrous humanoid tribes like goblins and orcs that the dark forces often used as cannon fodder absent, but it also lacked any kind of political entity like city-states that might push against the borders. Its icy shores prevented pirates and other kinds of sea-based pests to be a problem as well. </p><p>Of course, it was not a safe location. Since the harsh conditions didn’t allow farming or any other kind of mass food production, it was sparsely populated, providing an untouched breeding ground for monsters. Still, monsters, no matter their individual strength, were not a threat against the border forts. </p><p>Certainly not to a point of actually worrying the Queen. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one that was surprised. Aria might lack the force of personality required to be an active political player, but that didn’t mean she was stupid. “What skirmishes?” Aria asked. “I remember reading country reports, but they only mentioned a slight increase in monster activity, but even that was only impacting hunting parties slightly.” </p><p>“That’s the official reports,” Sapphire answered, the disdain in her tone indicating that the reports Aria mentioned weren’t worth the paper they were written. “We can’t tell the council that two of the border forts had stopped sending news after their request for reinforcement, not when some of the dukes following that abominable councilwoman. The closest dukedom is a direct supporter of her, and they would love to occupy those forts in the guise of assistance.” </p><p>“Why would they even bother?” Aria said. “Just a few border castles. I remember the reports, they actually cost money to maintain, more than a few hunting parties could offset the cost.” While she asked the question, I picked up the pace even further, sliding in her slippery tunnel repeatedly. </p><p>“Don’t worry about that part,” Sapphire cut in, while I barely held back a smile. The border might not be valuable as a habitation, but the relatively crowded monster population provided a really valuable hunting ground in terms of magical reagents and raw material for magical crafting. There was no way these forts were not making more than enough to cover the costs. </p><p>However, I was slowly developing a better understanding of Sapphire’s approach to management as well as the complications due to the strength of the council. Combining them, the most reasonable answer was that Sapphire was using the money from hunting as her own secret slush fund, both for her own unacceptable magical experiments and for bribes. </p><p>“Can’t we just send the royal guards to handle it?” Aria asked. “Or maybe we can go and handle it.” </p><p>“Not without the Eternal Core,” Sapphire cut in quickly. In this season, traveling to the northern borders would take weeks for a party, and maybe even months for a regiment of royal guards. There’s no way for a party to garrison multiple forts even if you could solve the problem, and I can’t afford to send away half of the royal army for an expedition that would take months. Not if I want to avoid a coup.” </p><p>“Things can’t be that bad-” Aria tried to cut in, shocked enough to momentarily ignore the effects of my fingers caressing her breasts underwater. “The council is just trying to-” she tried to continue. </p><p>“The council is trying to put your cousin to the throne because they don’t believe someone like me, a lowly concubine, shouldn’t be dirtying the throne with my lower-class body,” Sapphire cut in, cracking open her eyes, her annoyance enough to break through the pleasure that was covering her body. “Nor they think that you’re strong enough to take the reins, because of your feminine fragility. Instead, they want to put a seven-year-old on the throne while sidelining us. It’s their opportunity to take back the political power after the last civil war.” </p><p>Aria listened in shock, unable to process the rush of information. Admittedly, my continuing treatment wasn’t making it any easier for her to maintain her calm mind. While it was understandable that Sapphire was holding the cards close to her beautiful chest, as the next in line to the throne, Aria shouldn’t be that surprised by the political machinations of the entities. Clearly, the alliance of the dukes wasn’t the only one that doesn’t think Aria was fit to inherit the throne. </p><p>Rather than allowing her to recover, I tapped her shoulder, reminding her to ask the important question. “But how does it links to Eternal Core,” Aria asked, following the provided direction. </p><p>“Do you remember the stories about the Pathways?” Sapphire asked, while my eyes widened when I realized where that was going. </p><p>“Barely,” Aria said. “Weren’t they supposed to be one of the weapons of one of the old kingdoms or something?” she asked while I slipped my hand between her legs, spread open conveniently for my touch, and added a sensual touch to complement my repeated ramming. Her back arched as the enhanced pleasure hit her. Luckily for her, Sapphire was far too distracted by her own impending arousal to pay attention to Aria’s unusual attitude. </p><p>“Not weapons, but methods of transportation,” Sapphire mentioned. “It’s one of the secret strategic leverages of the Empire, to be only used in emergencies because of its incredibly high magical cost. However, once activated, it could instantly teleport a small group of people to another location with a stable Pathway exit.” </p><p>“And the Eternal Core provides enough power to make that a viable tool to transfer armies around easily,” Aria cut in. </p><p>“Exactly, so not only we can send reinforcements to the northern border without alerting our rivals, but also we can use them to strike unexpected locations if they decide to declare open rebellion,” Sapphire explained, her eyes once again closed as she started servicing her own body. “And most importantly, we can do that without touching the official magical reserves of the Empire, and catch the Council unawares.” </p><p>“So, that’s why we’re holding him hostage,” Aria murmured, unable to hide her aroused guilt from her tone as I continued to pump inside her while caressing every sensitive location of her body, pushing her toward another climax. </p><p>“No, silly girl,” Sapphire cut in. “That’s the whole reason I had launched that mission in the first place. Otherwise, do you really think I care who rules those horrible place called dark lands? Nothing really changed. Another Dark Lord will take his place in a few months at worst. We attacked, because we need that item to keep our throne. The sooner, the better. So, do whatever you need to do but make him reveal the location of the Eternal Core.” </p><p>Sapphire’s explanation had been filled with surprises. Even as the dark lord, I had always thought that Pathways were nothing but empty tales to give the ancient kingdoms an aura of mystery. And the fact that her political situation was fragile enough for her to launch a mission to capture me, just to get the location of the Eternal Core, was even more surprising. </p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but frown despite being on the edge of another climax to paint Aria’s insides once again. Sapphire was quick to dismiss two forts on the northern going dark, limiting her interest in how it would affect her own shaky condition. </p><p>However, I was more interested in the fact that at least two forts had gone dark while the reason staying a mystery. My instincts were telling me that there was something dangerous behind that…  </p><p>While I considered, the women I had been treating selflessly finally climaxed one after another, with a delicious intensity that triggered my own climax. Soon, I was covering Aria’s insides with a fresh coat of my seed, while enjoying the sight of the trembling climaxes of two sexy blondes. </p><p>Then, I prepared myself to leave. I had already pushed my luck sufficiently, and it was for the best if I could leave before Sapphire decided to open her eyes. All I needed was to decide what to do next for the rest of the day… </p>",

He sighed, welcoming the distraction from the document hell in front of him. It was a well-paying consulting job for a criminal case, but it wasn’t the payment that made him pick it up. No, he picked it up because the case was far too complicated for Thomas to handle alone, too complicated to trust an associate, and too lucrative to trust the other vultures in the firm. </p><p>Thomas belonged to his very sparse list of true friends, so Mark decided to help his friend, no matter how much his head hurt by reading endless pages of confessions and depositions. </p><p>He checked the identity of the visitor through the peephole —a habit he had generated after an unfortunate event when he was dealing with the mob cases— he was rather surprised to find Laura at the other side of the door. </p><p>It has been a week since his offer, since then Laura had been consciously avoided his presence even during the classes. He had to admit, despite his expectations, he was starting to miss her enthusiastic presence around, needling about studying harder. </p><p>“Good evening, and welcome to my humble abode, princess,” Mark said as he opened the door, allowing Laura to step inside, trying to reduce the panic dancing on the surface of her expression. Maybe he had pushed her too much, he realized, if she was feeling that conflicted about turning back his offer to teach her. </p><p>“Hi, Mark,” she murmured softly, in an uncharacteristic meekness, at least when they were together. He thought about the relative merits of pulling back the offer before she could reject it, but ultimately, he decided against it, because he didn’t want to baby her. She was strong enough to reject that by herself. </p><p>He decided to give her the next best thing. “Would you like a drink?” he offered, giving her both the space, and the liquid courage from alcohol if she preferred to do so. </p><p>“Just water, please,” Laura answered, but only after gazing toward his liquor cabinet longingly. She clearly understood the implications of asking for alcohol, but still decided against it, earning another point of admiration from him. </p><p>“Make yourself comfortable,” he recommended as he walked toward his kitchen, giving her the time she desperately needed to gather her wits. He grabbed a bottle of water and returned back to his living room, only to find Laura still standing up straight, cycling through a number of expressions, tightly grabbing her trenchcoat. </p><p>He was trying to find the best way to ask her to remove her coat and be comfortable without mentioning her stressed state, when her expression finally stopped on determination and her arms moved, removing her coat…</p><p>Mark heard a gasp, followed by a plastic bottle hitting on the floor. He was shocked by what she was wearing underneath her trenchcoat, and more importantly, what she wasn’t wearing. </p><p>“I’m…” Laura murmured before her voice faded. She took a deep breath before attempting to speak once more. “That’s my answer,” she said. </p><p>Mark would have liked to say that the thing he was most concerned about was the way her voice trembled and solidified, showing her determination, but that would be a lie when his eyes were locked on the way her chest moved as she took a deep breath, making her bosom heave. </p><p>A bosom that he could view perfectly, because, under her coat, she had forgotten to wear some critical pieces of clothing! A shirt, for example. Or a skirt. </p><p>Mark took a breath to excuse his silence even as he failed to resist the call to examine her body. He would have loved to say he was focusing on the way her fingers trembled as she removed her coat, showing her panic despite her attempts to hide that from her tone. </p><p>But no, he was much more focused on the ensemble that she was wearing. An ensemble that was black, lacy, and most importantly, thin… Too thin, even, failing to completely hide the pale skin underneath even under the dim lights of her living room. She was beautiful, he thought. Much more beautiful than he had ever thought. The biggest part of her clothing was her stocking, a deliciously chosen thigh-high that connected to her garter belt, enhancing her </p><p>As he looked at her almost naked body, he had realized his mistake. Her daily clothing preference —loose pants, boring cardigans, and cutesy blouses— had given him a childish impression about her, something that hadn’t changed even when she had made that outrageous request about teaching her about the pleasures of the flesh. At that point, it was easy to discount that as a childish reflex. </p><p>But now, looking at her body covered —barely, which made the impact several times stronger— in sexy lingerie, it was impossible to see her anything but a young woman, ready to take the step into the unknown. Mark knew that he needed to say something, but he found it rather difficult to pull his eyes from her delicious areolas, peeking through the edge of her bra, which was too small to properly cover her erotic pinkness. Her nipples, pushing against the fabric, hard with anticipation, made the act of pulling back even more difficult. </p><p> Ultimately, he succeeded, but not in the direction he wanted. He was supposed to be meeting with her beautiful blue eyes, not trailing down her surprisingly smooth stomach, imagining how her skin would feel under his touch, before arriving at her hips. Her black panties were no more substantial than her bra, hiding her core without hiding the fact that she was shaved clean. Her garter belt, once again black, but with touches of crimson, crowned the whole area perfectly, setting a burning flame in his heart. </p><p>He tried to take a deep breath, but that only intensified the fire… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>As she removed her coat, revealing the surprise underneath, her body felt like it was on fire. </p><p>It was a difficult thing to do, as a cynical part of her mind was expecting him to disappoint her, as everyone else in her life had done. Maybe he would laugh at her, a little girl trying to play the part of an adult woman, with the underwear she had purchased just for the evening. It was the whole reason she had put a huge dent in her savings to buy them, but she thought that was better than humiliating herself in her usual boring stuff. </p><p>However, spending the money didn’t mean that she felt like she deserved to wear them. She felt like a little girl, trying to fake being an adult woman, only to fail spectacularly. Her confidence was paper-thin, about to be raptured at the slightest negative reaction. </p><p>And when Mark maintained his silence after his initial shock and dropped the water bottle, her hands were twitching as she tried to ignore the desire to put her coat back on, apologize and dash away before changing her school. It didn’t help her confidence when his eyes started to trail her body down with torturous slowness, an emotion that she couldn’t recognize dancing in his eyes. </p><p>Still, looking at his eyes, she felt her heartbeat picking up speed, loud enough to deafen her. </p><p>She bit her lips, welcoming the sound of her own heartbeat. At least, it helped to quieten the cries of her insecurities that he would just laugh at her, saying that she was just a pathetic nerdy girl trying to reach a level of sexiness she could never deserve with her tiny pathetic body. The lower his eyes slid down, the stronger she felt. Her lips parted, about to apologize for her stupid idea…</p><p>But then, Mark’s eyes found hers, the expression she failed to decipher earlier still dancing in his eyes, only stronger. Then, he spoke. “Beautiful.” </p><p>Laura was helpless against the gasp that escaped her mouth even as a shiver suddenly covered her skin, simultaneously assaulting her body with a burning sensation. It wasn’t the first time she felt her face burning in front of someone else, but usually, it was about feeling ashamed. This time, the nature of the heat couldn’t have been any different. </p><p>She was not really experienced when it came to her own sexual nature. How could she, when her sexual experience was limited to awkward fumbling with a boy with a serious denial about his own sexual orientation, and a few hasty kisses stolen by an annoying hippy who was too fascinated by his own reflection? However, just one word from Mark was enough to awaken something different in her. </p><p>Mark, who was the first man who had really treated her by anything other than a silly teenager or an annoying geek. Mark, who was tall and muscular and handsome enough to actually work as a model if he so wished. Mark, who was rich and successful—or at least had been in terms of success until whatever happened to send him to Community college, though the state of his apartment suggested that the same thing didn’t affect his monetary status significantly, not that she really cared about the last part. </p><p>What she cared about was that knowing he could probably go to any bar he wanted, and leave the place with a woman much sexier and much more experienced than her own pathetic self —or more than one if he wished— but still, he still somehow looked at her with desire, reflecting a strength that she had never felt before. </p><p>Maybe she was wrong, she suddenly thought as she examined Mark’s expression, a sliver of confidence flaring into life. Maybe, she wasn’t as unattractive as her horrible past experiences had suggested…</p><p>Maybe, the night would go much better than she had expected… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I received a message from the university student affairs, telling me that I had to host yet another role-playing tabletop game for a group of students as punishment, the only thing that prevented me from preventing out loud was the fact that I was in the library, lost among a sea of students, and doing so would have seriously damaged my reputation. </p><p>And I had thought myself so clever that I had managed to convince my psychology professor that doing my thesis on the effects of role-playing games on resolving interpersonal conflicts. At that time, it seemed the perfect way to have a few nice games with a couple of new players rather than spending endless hours in the library. After all, it wasn’t my real college, but a community near my home I was attending during summer to get a few free credits that I could use as my electives to push for early graduation. The college was not only expensive, but an overachieving nerd like me surrounded by other nerds, was also boring. The sooner it ended, the better. </p><p>The problem: it worked too well. </p><p>I still remembered the shine her eyes had when she read the first draft, before essentially forcing me to transfer into her advanced class because she liked my drive. Which was weird since I wasn’t a psychology major but a prospective engineer instead. It was more work than I was ready to do for a summer elective in a community college —my own major was complicated enough— but considering how nice it would look on my CV to actually do something useful in a community college, not to mention the value of extra credit that would basically clear my whole elective schedule to guarantee early graduation, it was an offer impossible to turn down. </p><p>Then, a week after registration, she launched another surprise to me. Apparently, she managed to convince the school management to actually support our paper, with an actual budget I could spend on, some of it going to more books, actual props, and more dice than I could want, which was always. It was nice, until I learned that there was a twist. </p><p>Rather than playing the games with fantasy enthusiasts, I was actually going to use the game to resolve the conflicts of the students that had been having actual conflicts. The first week, I had to run a game between two theater students and two bullies who thought that breaking the set that they had spent a week building. </p><p>Running the game while they were making absolutely no effort had been difficult, though somehow, it was even more annoying that after two sessions, they somehow managed to become best friends, with their bullies rebuilding the stage on their own, and one of them actually joining the play in a small role. </p><p>Perfect news for the paper, not so good for my free time. Suddenly, my workload tripled, killing my free time completely as I dealt with more dysfunctional groups. The fact that I had to transcript every game —with some software assistance, thankfully— hadn’t made things any easier. </p><p>Since I was about to run the game just for the evening, I focused on my paper, trying to finish it before I could go to the room. From the experience, after the first game, I would be too annoyed to actually finish my work. </p><p>Hours later, I finished the paper and checked the time, only to realize I had only minutes to begin the game. I slammed my laptop shut and dashed toward the room, wanting to prepare the room for a new game. I barely twenty minutes until my prospective players arrived, which was barely enough to set up the room. </p><p>After setting up the lights —a dim environment worked best to calm people— and rearranging the rack of equipment that the players could use some tools to immerse themselves into their role. Then, I started waiting. </p><p>When the door opened, I was expecting yet another annoying jock, stretching his muscles to exert his domination. Thanks to my height and my running habit which gave me a decent body, I hadn’t really had to suffer bullying during high school despite actually setting a role-playing club and being an active member of the chess club, but that didn’t mean many of my friends hadn’t suffered the said fate. I was man enough to admit that it gave me a noticeable bias. </p><p>Then, my eyes widened as my first player. It turned out that I was half-right. It was really an athletic jock, but I was mistaken in terms of gender. Instead of another football player, I was going to host a redheaded gymnast. A redheaded, very sexy gymnast wearing just yoga pants and a sleeveless shirt that left her midriff open. </p><p>Moreover, I recognized her only because she had just won a local competition, which earned many big accolades from the management, with a dedicated event to celebrate her achievements. Her name was Eliza. </p><p>“Is this the conflict resolution event,” she asked with a calm, detached tone. </p><p>“Welcome,” I said, struggling to contain my reaction in two ways. The first was the effort not to allow my gaze below her neck, not wanting to give away my attraction, though with limited success. I was lucky that she was more occupied with the decorations rather than my expression, giving me the time to control my expression. </p><p>The second reaction I suppressed was a disappointed sigh. I had no idea who the rest of the players were going to be, but with such a spectacular example of sexiness in the game, I had no doubt that the rest of the players would flirt with her rather than playing the game. </p><p>It was going to be torture. </p><p>“Take a seat,” I said as I gestured to one of the four seats that were arranged around a half-circle table, with me sitting at the center, allowing me to observe all players together. “The rest of the players should be here in a few minutes, then I’ll explain the process.” </p><p>“Sure,” she said as she walked silently. “It’s a bit … different than I expected,” she murmured. </p><p>“You mean nerdier,” I said with a chuckle, amused by the way she flinched slightly at the confirmation. Nerd wasn’t the slur it was when we were in middle and high school, triggering endless bullying —thank gods that I was tall enough to avoid the physical side of it— it was still an insult, especially at the smaller towns, such as the one that my summer school was located. “Don’t worry about it, I wouldn’t have actually done research on the topic if I was ashamed of being a nerd.” </p><p>“Still, sorry,” she murmured, but her expression didn’t shift much. She was rather standoffish, which was technically good news for my game as at least it would dissuade the boys from hitting on her, as long as I didn’t get a persistent jock, or god forbid one of those so-called nice guys who thought a couple of hours of discussion without explicit insults as successful flirting. “What’s all those dice for?” she asked. </p><p>“They are here to add a sense of randomness to the game, which helps players to get a better handle of the risks,” I explained. “But if you don’t mind, I will delay the exact workings until the rest of the group arrives. It’ll keep you from getting bored from listening to them twice.” </p><p>“I see,” she answered, again coldly, but for some reason, there was a stillness in her tone. I wondered why, but before I could explore it, the door opened once more… </p><p>And another drop-dead gorgeous girl walked inside. I had to bite my lips as I tried to suppress my reaction, once again for more than one reason. The girl that just walked in was no less known than the superstar gymnast, but not with the same positive connotations. She was Tia Taylor, a sexy, lithe blonde with an impeccable taste in fashion, and the sole heiress to one of the biggest businesses of the town. </p><p>Part of my reaction was the same I had to Eliza, a struggle to hide my arousal and fear that her beauty alone would have been enough to destroy any hope of a sustainable game. And wearing stilettos and an elegant black dress that barely covered her ass, she was just perfect enough to enchant the rest of the game. </p><p>However, there was an additional layer to my frustration, because, across the school, Tia was known for her sharp demeanor and biting wit. And considering her family was the biggest donor for the community college, it wasn’t just the students afraid of her but also the professors. </p><p>“Hi-” I started, only to be silenced by a hand gesture as she walked toward us, her stilettos echoing on the floor. </p><p>“They are late,” she commented, and at that moment, it wasn’t hard to imagine her as the evil witch —a very sexy, very blonde evil witch— ordering her monster to execute the heroes. However, she looked at Eliza as she commented. </p><p>Eliza just nodded, her distant posture changed, tightening even more than I had thought that to be possible, suggesting that I wasn’t only going to be possible lovesick male players that were going to be problematic. Leading roleplaying games since my childhood allowed me to learn how to read people better, and I could see that whatever problem they had between them wasn’t just a simple row about a boy or equally casual. </p><p>I cursed myself for not checking the participant list before. At least, it would have been helping me prepare for the disaster mentally. </p><p>Tia perched on the chair at the other end of the half-circle, her eyes closed, her posture stiff. </p><p>Two minutes later, the door opened once more, and another unexpected figure entered. This time, I was pleasantly surprised that she was another female. I crossed my fingers. At this point, I was hoping that the fourth participant would be the same, at least removing the aspect of the playful flirting from the game. </p><p>However, the lack of alert didn’t mean that I wasn’t surprised. After the star female athlete and the ice queen, I had been expecting another sharp personality. I wouldn’t have been surprised by the captain of the football team, or one of the rich boys, for example. Or maybe another socialite. Instead, I got a petite brunette I barely recognized, with slouched shoulders, walking silently. </p><p>The other two turned to her, and she slouched even further as an attempt to make her smaller —which, admittedly, was very effective considering her short size. Without saying anything, she took the seat next to Tia, which was another surprise. With her casual loose clothes and her slouched stance, she definitely didn’t belong to the same group as the others, and her backpack, filled enough to explode, underlined that difference further. </p><p>I caught her gaze and smiled softly, recognizing a fellow nerd, but she just avoided my gaze. </p><p>I was considering the best way to initiate a dialog when the door burst open and my last player run in, and I gulped. It was yet another familiar figure, dressed in a very familiar outfit. Bianca Friar, the most famous cheerleader in the school —and probably the most famous person, period, thanks to a combination of her curvy body crowned by a lovely face and blonde hair, her excellent dancing that stretched her curvy body to the limits, and a cheerful personality that brightened any room that she walked in. </p><p>Well, any room but this, apparently, as the moment she walked in, the expression of the others tightened even further.  </p><p>“Sorry, I’m late. The practice run longer than expected. You must be Harvey,” Bianca said cheerfully, hitting me with a bright smile. However, since I was looking for that, I could catch an uncharacteristic tightness in her expression that marked her cheer as fake. </p><p>Admittedly, however, I was having trouble focusing on her expression, once again struggling to keep my gaze up, because she was still wearing her cheerleader outfit, which displayed her toned legs and her big tits perfectly.</p><p>However, I managed to notice an interesting detail despite the beautiful distraction she was providing. She had claimed that the practice ran late, but her outfit looked perfectly pressed, and while her blonde mane looked slightly wild, it did look more like something a hairdresser would do rather than the natural effect of jumping and dancing for two hours. </p><p>It was going to be a complicated game… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching a mythical —yet innocently sexy— angel blush as I flirted with her was a unique pleasure, especially considering the said angel was the legendary headmistress of Silver Spires. I would have loved to spend the next half an hour teasing her. </p><p>Pity that her expression soon recovered into a smooth calm, showing the benefits of her centuries of experience. </p><p>“About the alliance,” she spoke with an inflectionless voice, without the slightest stirring of emotion. However, that actually entertained me more, because that specific way of speaking was very familiar to me. Titania had been speaking like that before I had suppressed the emotional suppression from her ability. </p><p>The difference, it seemed, our resident angel could clearly use that as she wished rather than constantly staying under it. </p><p>“I can’t speak for the rest of my organization, but we’re not a close-knit group in the first place,” I explained. “As long as we continue to fight against the destruction of the society, we’re free to work with other groups,” I said, basically selling her the opportunity to eventually pulling the rest of my group into her alliance despite poaching one of their members. It was a tight rope to walk, but hopefully, she was desperate enough to grab the opportunity despite the slight inconsistencies in my story. </p><p>She said nothing for a while, lost in her thoughts, before she finally spoke. “I need to examine your power in detail,” she suddenly said as she raised her hand, not even asking for my permission as her mana invaded my body. </p><p>I could have fought back. While her mana was potent and her control was strong, I wasn’t exactly a weakling. But why would I, when I could use my focus to reinforce my fake soul space, including the dummy Companion Node that I created based on the mark my power had left on the girls? </p><p>I had put a Companion Node despite the risk of making her more suspicious, because I had no doubt that, eventually, she would either check Titania or start spying on the girls around me. Either way, she would discover the Companion Node, and through that, my involvement. With that, I would at least have an excuse. So, as her mana explored my fake soul space, I put my whole attention on maintaining the facade… While I considered the opportunity to push back and explore her soul space, but after sending a couple of mana strings, I failed to discover even the general location of her soul space, so I pulled back. </p><p>Then, she pulled her mana back without a warning!</p><p>I stiffened, fearing that she had discovered the fake, and decided to act. The last thing I expected was her to pull back with a disgusted expression before speaking. “You carry the mark of the Degenerate.” </p><p>I didn’t need to fake the expression of surprise on my face. When she pulled back like that, the last thing I had been expecting was an insult. “I’m carrying the mark of what, now?” I asked. </p><p>She explored my face for a moment, like trying to assess whether my expression was fake or real. “You don’t know the source of your extra power?” she asked. </p><p>“Hey, I think we have already mentioned the limited historical information my organization carries,” I said. Combining with her earlier explanations about the history of the world, it wasn’t hard to guess the Degenerate was a historical figure. “What exactly is this Degenerate, and how does it links to my abilities?” </p><p>“It’s about the rest of the explanation,” she said, her tone once again attaining her earlier calmness. “We were talking about how the Eternals was using the remains of the Divine Avatars as a weapon.” </p><p>“Yeah, and I’m assuming that’s significant,” I said. </p><p>“Very,” she said. “In their own domains, every god is essentially untouchable,” she murmured, though a twitch in her face as she said so made me suspicious about the accuracy of that particular detail. My instincts were telling me that she was hiding something about that, but it wasn’t time to push her about it, so I let her continue. “However, to affect the material world, every Divine being needed to use their own essence, their Spark, to create a body for themselves.” </p><p>“And therefore making them vulnerable,” I commented, and she nodded. </p><p>“Yes, and not only that, losing the avatar is no simple matter. Depending on the power they had invested in their avatar, the consequences of losing the avatar ranged from a slight inconvenience to injuries that would take centuries to heal,” she explained seriously. “And that’s assuming they could recover their essence.” </p><p>“And with the Eternals weaponizing that essence, I’m guessing that things had changed quite a bit…” </p><p>“Yes, it did,” she murmured, the slight trembling in her tone despite her best attempts making me doubt that whether she had just read that in a history book, or had a more direct knowledge… Maybe even living through it… “It wasn’t something Gods had expected to work so well, so the initial attempts to punish them was limited to sending a few lower-level battle gods and loyal demigods. No one expected them to actually succeed in using the Divine Spark in a few months, so the attempts to punish them only strengthened them.” </p><p>“Still, the gods seemed to have such a strong advantage, how did they lost, assuming they have lost of course,” I added, though considering their absence, their loss was a given. </p><p>“At that point, the Eternals counter-attacked,” she explained. “Many gods had their avatars across dimensions, especially the weaker gods trying to establish their power bases, not to mention hundreds of demigods and an untold number of Divine-touched serving as priests and servants for the gods. No one expected the Eternals to hunt them aggressively. Before the gods' counter-attack, many minor gods’ avatars had been slain and their divine essence pilfered, weakening them significantly.” </p><p>“How about the normal humans?” I asked. “I’m sure the gods and divine-touched were really strong, but I don’t want to believe that a group of high-leveled mage couldn’t actually counter at least some of it.” </p><p>“That’s the crux of the issue,” she sighed. “During the war, there was no system.” My eyes widened at her words. No matter what, it was hard to imagine a world without the system. Then, she said something even more interesting. “At least, during the first half of the war,” she added. </p><p>“Gods or the Eternals?” I asked. </p><p>“The Eternals, of course,” she said. “At first, the gods made their plans with the assumption that absorbing the Divine Spark of the gods was a difficult and time-consuming ritual, requiring impossible-to-replicate high-quality materials to initiate. It was too late when they had realized the Eternals had developed a special way of absorbing the Divine Spark from the slain Avatars, and that they were strengthening it as the war continued.” </p><p>“And that ultimately become the System?” I asked, frowning as I asked. The artificial nature of the System was surprising, but if that was true, it left the question of why the world wasn’t being ruled by the Eternals. I had examined the soul space of the assassins, and they certainly didn’t feel like created by someone with a good handle on their abilities. </p><p>“Not until the end of the war,” the headmistress said, her wings twitching. “There’s not much known about the actual war, only that at one point it was so heated that continents shattered and new mountains created while the old ones turned to dust. But I know that after the years of warfare, the gods were on the losing end.” </p><p>“Isn’t it weird,” I asked. “I can understand that the system is a game-changer, but I expected the gods to be stronger.” </p><p>“Certainly,” the headmistress said. “Unfortunately, after their counter-attack, the Eternals had gathered just enough to Divine Spark to activate the most decisive feature of the System, and the System started absorbing Divine Energy from the material plane. The established avatars were strong enough to resist the pull, but the effect was strong enough to prevent the other gods from descending into the material plane. Before the gods could realize that, many attempted avatar had been absorbed, their powers stolen.” </p><p>“However, it was only when the remaining gods and demigods had launched a desperate attack after discovering the to the headquarters of the Eternals, damaging the heart of the ritual that maintained the system.” </p><p>“And I’m guessing that it didn’t destroy them completely,” I commented. </p><p>“No, but it destroyed their ability to control the system. Instead, it started running chaotically, empowering both the animals and the people in a completely random manner, pushing the continent to chaos even worse than before. And since the absorption effect continued, no gods can come down to fix it. The only hope for the survival of the world that before it was too late, we need to discover the location of the system, and destroy it, once again allowing the gods to descend and fix the world.” </p><p>“Such a noble cause,” I said, doing my best to sound enthusiastic about the return of a bunch of uber-powerful beings with a nebulous range of personal attitudes, and probably a grudge after being kicked out of the material plane for hundreds of years. However, there was no benefit in saying that to an angel who clearly belonged to the team of one of those gods. Instead, I chose to distract her. “And who is this Degenerate you have mentioned, and how does it links to my own status.” </p><p>“She was one of the minor demonic goddesses,” she said with an obvious distaste, surprising me with the details. I wasn’t surprised to hear a possible divine link between my own unique System and a possible Divine entity. Nor I was entirely surprised by the nature of it being called demonic by an angel, as their fame for purity would no doubt classify the sexual nature of my powers as demonic even though it clearly helped both parties —at least in my case. </p><p>However, the fact that it was linked to a goddess instead of a god surprised me. </p><p>“And does she have anything to do with the war?” I asked, curious about her distaste. </p><p>“Not to my knowledge, no,” the headmistress said with a dismissive attitude. “She was cowardly enough to disappear before the war, one of the first Divine to do so, not that she would have been a big help even if she had been around,” she continued, though I was interested to note a hint of jealousy in her tone along with dismissal, both too sharp to be anything but personal. </p><p>How interesting, I thought. Apparently, the —possible— source of my powers had a history with my headmistress. What a small world… </p><p>“So, how about the power-up,” I asked her. “Are we still going to do that, because a war is coming, and I won’t say no to some extra power?” </p><p>“It’s not a free power gift,” the headmistress immediately countered. “I’m going to mark you as the one of the Divine-touched, one carrying the power of a proper goddess rather than a useless wallflower, and in return, you are going to become a hero that would fight against the darkness. It’s not a game.” </p><p>“Whatever you say, boss,” I said, not bothering to act too submissive. After all, she needed me more than I needed her, at least in her mind, which gave me an opportunity to show a touch of arrogance. “So, when are we going to do that?” </p><p>“Tomorrow, at the first light of dawn,” she said even as she magically opened her door. “Now, go, I need to prepare.” </p><p>I left the room, my mind already churning about the interesting history lesson I had just received… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The rest of the day passed after Nancy’s departure passed in an annoying blur, where I had spent hours and hours browsing the net and calling people, hoping to find a more sustainable income source. Unfortunately, it hadn’t gone as well as I might have hoped, so, when the night finally rolled, I decided to call it a day and go to the bed early. I had an early start tomorrow. </p><p>However, I didn’t wake up with the annoying yet necessary sound of my alarm, but with my phone ringing. A quick check of the screen revealed that it was Nancy that was calling me, and it was still barely five. “What!” I barked, not exactly trying to modulate my voice. Waking up at six for a favor was bad enough, and she was calling me even earlier. </p><p>“Sorry about calling, but I don’t know what to do,” Nancy gasped, the sheer panic in her tone enough to blunt my anger. Blunt, but not completely remove. </p><p>“Tell me,” I grunted as I tried to open my eyes. I hated to wake up earlier than necessary, but not all things were equal. A sexy redhead in distress was not the worst reason to wake up, though not the best either —that honor went to having a smiling beauty under my covers, slowly waking me up with her lips wrapped around my girth, moving back and forth to replace by grogginess with pleasure. </p><p>“My friends had changed their mind at the last minute, I need two new models.” </p><p>“And you think that five in the morning was the optimal time to find them.” </p><p>“They had sent a message when I was sleeping, I just saw it,” she said, panic threatening to overwhelm her. “I need someone else, please.”</p><p>For a moment, I considered teasing her, maybe even asking for a direct favor, but I was still too sleepy to push for it. “And how much you’re going to pay these new emergency models?” I asked. </p><p>Her sudden silence was telling. “A couple hundred?” she murmured. </p><p>“Each?” I asked, despite knowing that it wasn’t the case, and even if that had been, it was far from being enough.</p><p>“No, of course not,” she gasped. </p><p>“So, you’re saying that you’re looking for a full-day model for less than minimum wage,” I said as I buried my face to the pillow. “Have you already finished all the money you have earned from your own modeling?” </p><p>“Y-yeah,” she stammered. “Between the advance I paid for the books, design costs, and the money that it took to rent a booth, I spent it all. I even maxed my credit card.” </p><p>“Of course you did,” I murmured. No wonder Nicole was worried about her. I heard a gasp from her, which told me that she was on the edge of starting to cry. “Okay, against my better judgment, I’ll try to help. Grab the costumes and come down. I need to check their sizes to make sure I can find a proper model for them. </p><p>“I’ll be there in a minute,” she gasped, her earlier sadness immediately replaced by excitement. I jumped to my feet and started undressing, wanting to wear a fresh set of clothes. </p><p>I had just pulled fresh underwear on when she stepped in, only to gasp. “Sorry,” she said as she tried to leave. </p><p>“Come in, it’s not like anything you haven’t seen before,” I said even as I took a step toward the stairs, not bothering to pull a t-shirt on. If she was going to annoy me by making me wake up before dawn, I was going to tease her for it. </p><p>She murmured something suspiciously similar to an asshole, but that didn’t prevent her from gazing at my body hungrily. It had been a while since we had spent any time together, but the last time she had seen me on the act was much closer, enhancing her arousal considerably. </p><p>She got closer, and I grabbed the costumes she was carrying. One of them was a warrior outfit, designed for a reasonably curvy woman —but with a cleavage that would have been deadly for a real warrior— and the other reminded me of a thief with many pockets, and it was slightly more conservative. </p><p>“Hmm, tough one,” I murmured as I examined them. The warrior costume would fit on both Nicole and Penny, and as much as I wanted to invite the former —her captured princess costume was rather memorable— I doubted Nancy would be happy about that. And I didn’t want Nancy getting suspicious about the true identity of the model she had seen in the living room. Penny was a much more achievable target. “Is there any hair or skin color restriction for them?” I asked. </p><p>“They are both elves, so Caucasian is a must, but we have wigs for them, so hair color doesn’t matter,” she said. </p><p>“Hmm, I can find one for the warrior one,” I said. </p><p>“Is that the brunette slut-” she cut in, only to be silenced by a gesture. </p><p>“Hey, I’m the one that woke up at five as a favor. I’m more than happy to go to the bed if you’re determined to be a bitch about it,” I said, which was enough to earn a string of apologies. “And no, it’s not her,” I added. “However, the problem is the thief outfit. I don’t have anyone with that measurements I can call in such short notice.” </p><p>She looked dejected, trying to process that, when I interjected. “Why don’t you wear that yourself, it’s sufficiently close to your measurements. It would be a tight fit, but as long as you pop open a couple of buttons, it would fit nicely.” I could have tried to find someone else, but why would I, when I could make her wear the costume. It would be much more entertaining. </p><p>“I can’t, I need to be signing books,” she said. </p><p>“Your call,” I said with a shrug. “But I hope that your booth will the attractive enough with just one model, especially if she decides to leave early? Or with no model, if she decides not to join at all.” </p><p>“She won’t, would she?” Nancy asked in a panic. </p><p>“Honey, with the money you’re offering, it’s a miracle if she accepts in the first place. You’re not exactly in a place to expect perfect work ethics. No money, no time, and exhausting work.” </p><p>It took a while for her to make a decision, and I used that time to pull on a t-shirt and a comfortable pair of jeans. “Okay,” she murmured in defeat. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I walked toward my desk, picked my camera with one hand and my phone with the other. “Change into the costume to make sure it fits, while I make a call.” </p><p>A big frown covered her face, but that didn’t prevent her from picking the costume and walk toward the small dressing screen in my room. I could have forced her to dress in front of me, but at this point, she was looking for an excuse to lash out, to blame me for her failures, something I had no intention of giving to her. </p><p>It was much more amusing to tease her. </p><p>I called Penny, and she picked after three rings. “Is everything alright?” she asked panickedly, which was understandable considering she had been woken up with no warning. </p><p>“Nothing is wrong, sweetheart,” I answered lazily. “I just had a last-minute job for a photoshoot, it’s not a lot of money, but it’ll give you a decent amount of exposure and show your range better. The client insists on her own model, but you know how much I like you, so I wanted to check if you’re interested before I go with the client model,” I said. </p><p>“Of course I’m interested,” she answered, the hints of sleep disappearing completely from her tone. “How much time do I have, and where do I need to be? And, do I need to bring anything?” she asked rapidly, unable to hide her excitement. Apparently, the way our last photoshoot had ended didn’t bother her, which had rather interesting implications for today’s shoot. </p><p>Maybe, it wouldn’t be as boring as I feared.</p><p>“You don’t have to bring anything. Make sure to wear a summer dress and be ready to be picked up in half an hour. I’ll pick you up from your house,” I explained. </p><p>As I finished gathering my bag, Nancy finally stepped out of the screen, the thief costume wrapping her body nicely, giving a rugged yet erotic aura, though the latter part clearly accidental. After working in the fashion industry for a long time, I developed an accurate sense of measurement for women’s clothes. </p><p>Nancy’s thief costume was clearly designed for a thinner girl, to hang on loosely to create some kind of concealed danger, easy to slip into darkness or among the homeless. Unfortunately for her —and rather fortunately for me— Nancy was clearly more well-endowed in both in the hips and the bust, stretching the pants and forcing her to keep two buttons open on the top, turning what was supposed to be a serious costume into something fit into a late-night cheesy adventure movie, the kind that usually ended in a ridiculous excuse to remove the said costume to give some R-rated half-naked scenes. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said. “I’m sure your potential readers will love you.” </p><p>“No they won’t,” she gasped. “I’m going to be humiliated. No one would read my books, everyone will think that I’m a hack,” she gasped. “All my efforts will be ruined.” </p><p>I wanted to mock her for her panic, but the expression on her face was far too serious for me to mock. “Well, you don’t have to reveal that you’re the writer. We can say that the writer is absent, and give away pre-signed books.” </p><p>“Wouldn’t it be disrespectful,” she asked. </p><p>“A bit,” I admitted. “But it doesn’t have to be to your detriment. We can even sell that as a positive, playing the mystery angle, assuming you were smart enough to use a pen name.” </p><p>“Of course,” she answered. “There’s no sense ruining my name if the book isn’t received critically well.” </p><p>“Excellent, and you know that I can help you with your make-up enough to make you unrecognizable, especially with a wig. This character needs one as well, right?” I asked even as I walked closer. </p><p>“Yeah, the character is supposed to be blonde,” she explained while I walked closer toward her. </p><p>“Now, we just need to make sure the booth is going to attract enough visitors without a writer present,” I said even as I grabbed and flipped open two more buttons. </p><p>“That’s too much-” she started, only to cut it with a shocked gasp when my hand traveled to her back and unhooked her bra. Her hands jumped up, but I had significant expertise in quickly removing bras. Before her hands could reach, I had already pulled off her bra, the thin shirt clinging to her body much more beautifully. </p><p>“Better,” I said with a mocking grin as I examined her beautiful cleavage. “Now, we can be sure no male reader will be asking about the writer’s whereabouts.” She tried to say something, but I pressed my hand to her lips to cut her off. “Either that, or you’ll be wasting all the money you have spent arranging the booth and everything.” </p><p>Silence stretched for a minute, but even with that, I was not surprised by her eventual nod. She had sunk too much effort to ignore the chance for success. </p><p>Now, all I needed to do was deciding how best to leverage her desire for success… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite the inherent risks of the situation, I barely needed a second to come to a decision. “Ask her to stay and tell you what to do,” I sent a magical whisper to Aria, hoping that the Queen wasn’t paying attention to notice such a low-intensity magical spell. </p><p>It was a risky move. Things would get far too complicated if the Queen discovered that I was not in my cell like she had expected but hiding in the depths of the bath of the Crown Princess. </p><p>And the fact that I was currently in the midst of defiling the Crown Princess was not likely to make things any easier. Or at least, I assumed so. Maybe the fact that Aria had already achieved the task of seducing me —well, the reverse, actually, but that was a small, unimportant detail that I’m sure Sapphire wouldn’t care too much. </p><p>Right?</p><p>While I analyzed the risks of my impulsive decision, Aria followed my suggestion. “Could you stay and explain it better?” she asked, too overwhelmed by the situation to actually process the implications of her request. I knew she hadn’t understood the implications, because when Sapphire pulled off her nightie to reveal her deliciously voluptuous body —still carrying a couple fading hickeys from our adventures of the previous evening, missed by her healing spells, though with the steam blocking the view, the only reason I noticed was because I knew where to look. </p><p>“I can’t believe that I still need to explain that to you when you’re in your twenties,” Sapphire said dryly as she sank into the embrace of the warm water, closing her eyes to enjoy her soak. Which was convenient, as it allowed her to mistake Aria’s sudden gasp as I pushed deeper inside her with her reaction to the harshness of her statement. “I wouldn’t have bothered if things were getting direr by every passing day, risking to become a total disaster.” </p><p>Her last statement was curious, not the content itself —as I wasn’t stupid enough to miss that her search for the Eternal Core had a semi-urgent reason— but Aria’s reaction. She stiffened in a way that made me think that it was the first time she had been hearing about this so-called upcoming disaster. </p><p>Luckily, I was positioned perfectly to dissuade her from following up about that topic immediately. I wanted Sapphire to be relaxed a bit before asking the question. I pushed my hips forward, distracting Aria with a moan that she struggled to suppress, only to barely succeed. </p><p>It was a delicious feeling to slide inside Aria repeatedly while Sapphire leaned back to the other end of the bath, her beautiful breasts that easily rivaled Aria’s floating among the bubbles, enhancing the erotic potential of the moment several times. </p><p>It was a breathtaking moment even before Sapphire started explaining her tricks. “Let’s start educating you on the seduction. Hopefully, for once in your life, you can do something without being pointed at,” Sapphire said, which, admittedly, was undeservedly sharp. A day ago, their conflict would have just amused me, but now, a flare of annoyance appeared in my heart. </p><p>I have declared Aria as mine, who was she to insult her like that. Punishment was necessary. And the side-effects of the tantric spells she had tried to use against me gave me the perfect opportunity to exact some revenge. I started filling the bathwater with my mana slowly, allowing me to enhance the said side-effects. </p><p>Meanwhile, she started explaining her perspective on seduction. “The most important thing is your gaze,” Sapphire explained. “Every seduction starts and ends with the emotions reflected in your eyes. You need to reflect a mixture of innocence and availability, but never completely. Your target needs to think that he could get what you want, but only after a great effort.” </p><p>With that, Sapphire started to give a detailed breakdown of elementary seduction, her eyes still closed as she leaned against the bath, caring about the caresses of the warm water —even before my mana reached a density to properly affect her— more than whether Aria was fully getting what she had been explaining. Even when she was explaining that, she was distant, suggesting that their bond was even weaker than I had first assumed, which was critical information I used to adjust my further strategies, especially in the light of my growing relationship with Aria. </p><p>However, that was something to be considered later, because, at the moment, I was occupied by the increased tightness of Aria’s nether lips. She was clearly overwhelmed by the presence of the Queen in the bath, explaining to her how to seduce the dark lord —the same dark lord she was currently busy being impaled by— and reacting it by tightening further. </p><p>I reached to caress Aria’s beautiful blonde hair which framed the soft features of her face, currently contorted with pleasure. “Don’t worry, she’s plenty distracted,” I said as I gestured the Queen while I caressed along her spine, calming her while I impaled deeper repeatedly. As she moved, the water lapped over her nipples, begging for me to touch them. </p><p> I was never best rejecting the impulses unless there was a very strong reason against it. It was just the absurdity of the situation that the presence of the Queen that imprisoned me in her secret prison didn’t count as a strong reason. I caressed Aria’s breasts aggressively, and her back arched, a moan escaping her mouth. </p><p>I saw Sapphire stir and cut her explanation about the different types of kisses and sank back in the water, just in time to avoid being caught, leaving Aria to handle her shocked expression. “I know you always repressed yourself to a ridiculous degree, and the art of seduction is new for you, but at least try to control yourself and listen rather than imagining how it would feel to being kissed,” Sapphire said, with a detached uncaring manner that didn’t surprise me the slightest bit at this point. </p><p>She closed before poor Aria could even put together a response, and continued on explaining the best way to kiss. I didn’t miss the fact what she had been describing carried several interesting tricks from me. </p><p>It was nice to know that I had left an impression. </p><p>I once again pushed my head out of the water, this time using that opportunity to cover Aria’s neck with soft kisses, otherwise keeping silent, and she reacted by pushing her hips down, swallowing more of my shaft. It was obvious that what was transpiring was currently rewiring the way she had been looking at life. I could feel her expression change as she watched the Queen, her fear and respect slowly evaporating. </p><p>It was an understandable reaction. Their relationship was based on hierarchy and fear. Not that I disregarded fear and hierarchy, of course. As a dark lord, they were some of my favorite tools to rule the masses, but one should always be aware that they could be as dangerous to the wielder as they were to target. Fear, for example, works only when the target believes the power difference between the oppressor and the target was wide enough to be insurmountable. </p><p>For Sapphire, that sense of power came from her aura of infallibility. She always acted like she knew everything, using that to create an unsurmountable sense of authority. And now that Aria was watching Sapphire giving a long speech about seduction, unaware that they weren’t alone in the pool, her aura of infallibility shattered. </p><p>And my mischievous yet daring actions like continuing to fuck Aria and poking my head to kiss her neck were useful for more than just enhancing her pleasure. I was wordlessly showing her that Sapphire was not a real threat, but just a simple obstacle I could easily run circles around even when I was naked in the palace she owned, just a couple of feet away from her, sharing a bath… </p><p>It didn’t take long for Aria to unconsciously accept that message. Something started to stir inside her, something that she was yet to understand about her own mind and her own sexuality, maybe even her real position in life. </p><p>Aria managed to stay silent for a long time as the Queen’s explanations moved from kissing to best foreplays tactics, her eyes firmly shut. At this point, my mana in the water slowly reached the critical density, allowing me to tease Sapphire subtly using the leftovers of the tantric magic she tried to use on me, enhancing her arousal further. </p><p>It was very effective. </p><p>Her eyes shut even tighter as she continued explaining about foreplay, but her voice gained an ethereal quality as she started to detach completely from the situation and started focusing on the memories. The way she started shuffling in her place, shaking her amazing tits, was just another evidence of it. </p><p>Aria watched her with no small amount of shock, but that didn’t prevent her from picking up speed as I grabbed her tits aggressively, enjoying her body freely now that I would stay unnoticed. I still tried to keep the noise at a minimal level, but Sapphire was sufficiently gone to minimize the risk. </p><p>Almost at the same moment Sapphire ran her hand seductively along her thigh, her movements getting clearer as I used a subtle spell to dispel the bubbles on her side of the bath, giving me a clear view of her body. The sight of her fingers gently massaging her inner thigh as she mindlessly murmured the best foreplay tricks —while literally replaying one of the sessions I had delivered to perfection the previous evening— was amazing. </p><p>Aria twisted her neck to turn toward me, fluttering her eyelashes to look at me with her beautiful blue eyes, silently telling a story of desire and power, and she whispered. “Cum inside me,” she declared, making a monumental decision by not only rejecting the rule of the Queen, but also truly taking initiative in our relationship —twisted as it was. </p><p>Who was I to reject such a beautiful request? I exploded in her, filling her with my seed and my magic while she moaned freely —which I blocked through my magic, not wanting to alert Sapphire. Using a spell at that level was risky, but not as risky as Aria’s unbounded moans. As she rocked her hips, I felt my mana invading her body along with my seed, her healing magic working overdrive to contain my essence. </p><p>It was developing to be an amazing time for the first bath we shared. </p><p>All I needed to do was to decide on the next step… </p>",
